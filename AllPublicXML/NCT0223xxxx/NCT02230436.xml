  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the hypothesis that early removal of drain can reduce
      the incidence of intra-abdominal infection and pancreatic fistula after pancreatectomy
      compared with later removal of drain.

      This study is to analyze the association between the time of removal of drain after
      pancreatic resection and incidence of intra-abdominal complications, such as intra-abdominal
      infection and pancreatic leakage. We design a prospective randomized study. Patients with
      pancreatic and periampullar tumors who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) or distal
      pancreatectomy (DP) are recruited to the study if amylase value in drain(s) is less than 5000
      U/L on postoperative day (POD) 1. After obtaining informed consent, eligible patients are
      randomly allocated to early or late drain removal group on POD 3. In the group A, drain(s)
      are removed on POD 3, whereas in group B drain is removed on POD 4 or beyond. The primary
      outcomes are the incidence of intra-abdominal infection and pancreatic fistula; the secondary
      outcomes include intra-abdominal bleeding, delayed gastric emptying, pulmonary complications,
      and length of hospital stay.
