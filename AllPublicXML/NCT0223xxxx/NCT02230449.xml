  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to analyze the expression of genes and microRNAs potentially involved
      in oocyte competence in follicles of different sizes (&lt;17mm and ≥17mm) at the time of oocyte
      pick-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In ART, one of the major obstacles encountered in some patients is the wide variation in the
      follicular size at the oocyte pick-up day and consequently, the number of available mature
      oocytes and the number of competent embryos for implantation. The follicular size at the day
      of oocyte pick-up reflects the synchronicity of the individual follicular responsiveness to
      FSH.

      For successful preimplantation development of an embryo, the oocyte must contain all
      necessary maternal factors. Two of these factors are specific mRNA transcripts (GDF9, PTX3,
      HAS2, PTGS2, TNFAIP6) and microRNA (miR-224).

      For each Cumulus Oocyte Complex, the evaluation of embryo development and morphokinetics will
      be correlated with the expression and implantation data to identify a quantitative biomarker
      to predict the embryo with the highest chance of implantation in patients.

      Experimental Design:

        1. - Collection of Cumulus Oocyte Complex (COC) from patients

        2. - Separation of oocytes according to the size of the follicule they have been retrieved
           from (&lt;17mm; ≥17mm)

        3. - Isolation of mRNA from both groups of cumulus cells

        4. - Expression studies, qRT-PCR (GDF9, PTX3, HAS2, PTGS2, TNFAIP6)

        5. - Analysis of miR-224, a negative regulator of cumulus expansion via PTX3

        6. - Time-lapse culture &amp; evaluation of morphokinetics

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulus cell RNA expression correlation with blastocyst formation potential and quality</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>At the day of oocyte pick-up, cumulus cells will be collected from each cumulus oocyte complex. RNA extraction will be performed from those cumulus cells and expression levels of 5 genes and 1 miRNA will be measured (compared with that of a housekeeping gene). Oocytes of those samples will be injected and cultured with routine Assisted Reproduction Techniques. At the day 5 &amp; 6, after the oocyte pick-up procedure, each blastocyst formed will be noted and the quality of each blastocyst will be recorded. The blastocyst grading will be done according to Gardner's blastocyst morphological criteria (degree of expansion of the blastocoele cavity: 1 to 5, inner cell mass morphology: A to C, trophectoderm morphology: A to C).
The composite primary outcome measure will allow the correlation of the expression levels of 5 genes and 1 miRNA of each cumulus oocyte complex with the corresponding embryo morphology on day 5 (presence or absence of a blastocyst) and blastocyst quality.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Implantation of the embryo(s) transferred will be checked by ultrasound 6 weeks after the pick-up. Patients for whom the number of embryo(s) transferred match the number of sac will allow the correlation of the expression data with implantation.</description>
