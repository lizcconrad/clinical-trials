  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of GBR 900 in healthy volunteers. The purposes of this study are to
      look at safety, how well the study drug is tolerated, how much of the study drug gets into
      the blood stream, and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given to humans.
      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. Each participant
      will remain in the study for approximately 3.5 months. This study is for research purposes
      only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.

          3. Subjects who are otherwise healthy and free from clinically significant illness or
             disease as determined by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations, and
             other tests performed by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a history of neuropathy or otherwise present with risk factors for
             neurological toxicity like chronic alcoholism or clinically significant neurological
             (e.g. dementia, cognitive decline, seizure disorders) or psychiatric disorders.

          2. Subjects with a recent history of live vaccination within the past 3 month or presence
             of active infections within the previous month.

          3. Subjects with previous exposure to antibody therapies or administration of
             immunoglobulins (Ig) within 6 months of randomization.

          4. Subjects with a history of or presence of inflammatory disease or rheumatological
             diseases or joint diseases including OA or any undiagnosed pain in joints.

          5. Subjects with a current and/or recent history of arthralgia or a history of
             fibromyalgia, migraine, neuralgia, or systemic painful conditions, or medical or
             arthritic conditions or any undiagnosed pain or systemic inflammatory disorders.

          6. Any evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from the
             normal in history, physical or neurological determinations or investigations or has a
             clinical condition or receiving therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would make the subjects unsuitable for study.
