  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While significant advances in pain management have occurred in the last 20 years, the
      majority of patients with chronic pain (CP) are unable to access evidence-based treatment at
      either the primary or tertiary care level.

      Moreover, research has shown that unrelieved CP and the lack of available expertise
      contribute to emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions. At The Ottawa
      Hospital (TOH), close to 18,000 ED visits per year are related to CP (12.9%). Among high
      frequency visitors (HFV; &gt;= 8 visits per year), a small number of patients with CP use an
      inordinate amount of acute care resources. The investigators study will use a randomized
      controlled (RCT) design to conduct a pilot evaluation of the impact of a Complex
      Interdisciplinary Pain Assessment Program (CIPAP) linked with primary care physicians (PCP)
      compared to a treatment as usual (TAU) control arm.

      The investigators hypothesis is that implementing a CIPAP will increase health care value
      through improved patient outcomes and reduced costs in HFV with chronic pain (CP-HFV). The
      investigators believe that a CIPAP will provide CP-HFV patients long-term pain management
      solutions, ED visits for CP will be reduced, and hospital admissions for CP will be
      prevented. This pilot RCT study will inform a larger-scale RCT study to be conducted in the
      future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As this is a phase 2 trial, the sample size is primarily determined by logistical
      constraints; however, as this trial will yield valuable information about the preliminary
      impact of the program for planning a larger, more definitive trial in the future, we
      determined the maximum width of a two-sided 95% confidence interval around the differences
      between the arms at 12 months. For self-report measures, 18 patients per arm would yield a
      margin of error of 0.65 standard deviations (total width of confidence interval = 1.3 on the
      standard deviation unit scale), which is considered acceptable for the self-report measures.
      For number of visits over 3 months, we assumed a standard deviation of 3 (based on our
      preliminary data). Assuming approximate normality, our sample size of 18 patients per arm
      would yield a margin of error of 2 visits (total width of confidence interval = 4 visits)
      which is adequate to yield preliminary evidence of change. These are conservative estimates
      as our analyses will include repeated measures, and adjust for baseline measures of response
      in addition to other demographic and clinical covariates. To account for 20% attrition, we
      will plan to enrol 23 participants per arm (total number of participants =46).

It covers 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, or severe problems and participants use a tick box to select the statement that is most representative of their conditions. Participants are also asked to rate, using a visual analogue scale (0 to 100), their state of health.</description>
