      Background Da VinciÂ® Robotic Surgical System (DVRSS) has been widely applied to perform
      complex minimally invasive surgical procedures across different specialties. This study aimed
      to investigate the impact of DVRSS on surgical proficiencies among inexperience novice
      surgeons and compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery.

      Methods Twenty medical students (n=20) without surgical experience were enrolled. After a
      constructive training for basic surgical techniques, participants were randomly allocated
      into DVR or laparoscopy group. Participants were asked to close five cases (also named five
      tasks) of a 2cm long incision on pig stomach by using DVR or laparoscopy. Surgical time,
      successful closure rate and pneumatic bursting pressure of gastric incision withstanding were
      recorded. In addition, participant performance and workload were quantified by using
      performance score, scales of Global Rating Scale Assessment (GSA) and NASA-Task Load Index
      (NASATLI).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Task performance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The performance of participants for each task would be assessed by objective scoring scale basing on the task completion time, plus well-defined errors during suturing and tying knot.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of success in closure of gastrotomy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The success in closure of the standardized gastrotomy was defined as followings: (1) The gastrotomy must be closed with 20 minutes using a 10 cm-long suture with intracorporeal knots tying; (2) Sutures should not be broken during the experiment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pneumatic bursting pressure for gastric incision</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The efficiency of the two groups in using DVRSS and laparoscopic suturing for closure of gastrotomy was assessed by the maximal pneumatic bursting pressure that the suture line could withstand.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of participant workload</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participant workload was assessed by using National Aeronautics and Space Administration-task load index scale (NASATLX) after completion of each task. The scale focused on six domains, including mental, physical and temporal demand, as well as performance, effort and frustration.</description>
