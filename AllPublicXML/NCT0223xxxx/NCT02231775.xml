    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare receiving the combination of
      dabrafenib and trametinib before surgery to having surgery alone in patients with melanoma.
      The safety of the study drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Dabrafenib and trametinib are both FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of melanoma that is unable to be removed or has
      spread in patients with V600E/K mutations. The use of the drugs in this study is
      investigational.

      Up to 78 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive dabrafenib and
      trametinib for 8 weeks and then you will have surgery. You will not have surgery if the
      disease has grown or spread during the 8 weeks you have received the study drugs. After you
      have recovered from surgery and are eating and drinking normally, you will continue taking
      the study drugs for up to an additional 44 weeks.

      You will take capsules of dabrafenib twice a day and tablets of trametinib one time every
      day. The dabrafenib and trametinib should be taken at the same time in the morning, and the
      second dose of dabrafenib should be taken about 12 hours later. You should take the capsules
      and tablets with a cup (about 8 ounces) of water every time, either 1 hour before or 2 hours
      after eating a meal. You will stop taking the study drugs 1 day before surgery, and resume
      taking the study drugs within 1 week after surgery.

      Study Visits:

      Patients will have tissue collected during surgery for routine tests.

      Cycle 1 will be 8 weeks (before surgery) and Cycle 2 will be 44 weeks (after surgery). During
      Cycle 1, you will have study visits at Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8. During Cycle 2, you will have
      study visits once a month.

      At every visit, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and you will have
      a physical exam.

      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 for tests
      that measure whether a certain gene is expressed or not and to check your immune system
      function. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn before you have surgery and at Weeks 12,
      24, 36, and 48. If you are taken off the study early, you will have this blood drawn at that
      time as well.

      During Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will also be performed:

      If your doctor thinks it can be safely performed, at Week 3 after starting
      dabrafenib/trametinib, you will have a tumor biopsy to check how the study drugs are
      affecting your immune system cells and the way your genes are being expressed in response to
      the study drugs. If the location of the melanoma is not easily biopsied in the clinic, a
      doctor in interventional radiology may perform the biopsy outside the clinic at Week 3
      instead. The type of biopsy you have will depend on the location and size of the tumor.

      At Week 8 after starting dabrafenib/trametinib, you will have MRI and/or CT scans of your
      brain to check the status of the disease. You will also have CT scans of the chest, abdomen,
      and pelvis. If the scans show the disease has not spread or grown, you will be scheduled for
      surgery. You will continue taking the study drugs until the day of your surgery.

      During Cycle 2, the following tests and procedure will be performed in addition to the
      monthly blood draws and physical exams:

      At Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, you will have an EKG and an ECHO to check your heart function.

      At Weeks 20, 32, and 44, you will have MRI and/or CT scans of your brain, as well as CT scans
      of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the study drugs for up to 1 year. You will be taken off study if the disease
      gets worse, if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions. You will be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur.

      Your participation on the study will be over after your last study visit.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      If you stop taking the study drugs before you have completed the 52-week schedule, you have
      follow-up visits at least every 3 months after surgery for 1 year. The following tests and
      procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have CT scans and/or MRI to check the status of the disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          2. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage IIIB/C melanoma.
             The definition of resectability can be determined by the patient's surgical oncologist
             and verified via discussion at Multidisciplinary Tumor Conference attended by melanoma
             medical and surgical oncology staff. Resectable tumors are defined as having no
             significant vascular, neural or bony involvement. Only cases where a complete surgical
             resection with tumor-free margins can safely be achieved are defined as resectable.

             oncology team.

          4. BRAF mutation-positive melanoma (V600E or V600K) based on report from a Clinical
             Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory.

          5. Patients must have measurable disease, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

          6. Age &gt;/= 18 years.

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.

          8. Patients must have organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil

             prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) and partial thromboplastin
             time (PTT) &lt;/= 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN); Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 X ULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 X ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%); Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             &lt;/= 2.5 X ULN ^1; Albumin &gt;/= 2.5 g/dL; Creatinine &lt;/=1.5 X ULN 2 OR Calculated
             creatinine clearance &gt;/= 50 mL/min OR 24-hour urine creatinine clearance &gt;/= 50
             mL/min.

          9. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed below. This
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 4
             weeks after the last dose of study medication. However, it is advised that
             contraception be used for a total of 16 weeks following the last dose (based on the
             lifecycle of sperm). Methods: a) Abstinence, defined as sexual inactivity consistent
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception. b) Condom (during non-vaginal intercourse with
             any partner - male or female) OR c) Condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or
             cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) (during
             sexual intercourse with a female).

         10. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: a) Non-childbearing
             potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the contraception methods in Inclusion # 12 if they wish to
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of
             HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Continued in Inclusion #
             11.

         11. Continued from Inclusion # 10. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. b)
             Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in
             Inclusion # 12 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label
             or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 4 weeks
             after the last dose of study medication, and must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the start of dosing.

         12. Female Subjects Contraception Methods: a) Abstinence; b) Intrauterine device (IUD) or
             intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the &lt;1% failure rate as stated in the product
             label; c) Male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry into the
             study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject; d) Double barrier method:
             condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent
             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently receiving cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or
             biologic therapy) or investigational anti-cancer drug.
