  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot complications are a common and costly problem. Excessive plantar pressures due
      to foot deformities and/or limited ankle dorsiflexion, especially in the presence of
      peripheral neuropathy, can predispose subjects with diabetes for diabetic foot ulcers.
      Achilles tendon lengthening surgery has shown to delay or prevent recurrence of diabetic foot
      ulcers.

      Studies have shown that Shockwave Therapy (EPAT - Extracorporeal Pulse Activation Technology)
      was effective in treating subjects with chronic heel pain and Achilles tendonitis with no
      serious side effects. EPAT, therefore, may allow diabetic patients with ankle equinus to
      perform more effective stretching exercises and may prevent recurrence of diabetic foot
      ulcers.

      The purposed of this RCT is to compare effectiveness of manual manipulation with EPAT versus
      manual manipulation alone on ankle dorsiflexion and dynamic plantar pressure in at-risk
      subjects with a history of diabetic foot ulcer.
