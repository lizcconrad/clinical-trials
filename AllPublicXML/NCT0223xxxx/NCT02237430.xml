  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is the MynxGrip (test device) non-inferior to manuel compression (standard comparator) in the
      incidence of adverse access site related events in-hospital, at 30 days and at 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized (1:1), controlled, non-blinded, single center study in 2000 patients
      comparing the MynxGrip (test device) and manuel compression (standard comparator). Safety and
      efficacy endpoints will be reported for in-hospital, 30 days and 6 months.
