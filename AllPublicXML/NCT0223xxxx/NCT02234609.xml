  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) has become an accepted dental restoration treatment in
      many developing countries. Because, ART is intended to be operated in molars, and about 10%
      of all carious lesion by an age of 18 years appear in anterior teeth in Gambia, it was the
      aim of this study to clinically evaluate a modified ART restoration technique for anterior
      teeth as the traditional treatment approach did not show satisfying clinical results.

    <textblock>
      Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) has become an evidence-based treatment in class I
      caries cavities for countries with developing dental infrastructure. Though epidemiological
      data also demonstrate restorative treatment needs in anterior teeth in several African
      countries, scientific evidence for ART in this application appeared so far unrewarding.
      Consequently, many carious teeth remain untreated or are scheduled for extraction. In
      deciduous teeth, class III and IV ART presented 86% failures due to partial or complete loss
      already within the first year, and longitudinal data in the permanent dentition are rare.
      Survival rates of 71% after three years, and of 68% after six years in the same study cohort
      were reported from Brazil.

      Basically, ART appears to be an interesting treatment approach as it combines a manual cavity
      preparation technique with the use of a glass-ionomer cement as an adhesive and fluoride
      releasing restoration material. Biomechanical stress, however, is above-average in class IV
      restorations when intending to reconstruct the incisal edge with glass-ionomer cement
      resulting in reported high rates of restoration fractures or loss. It was therefore the aim
      to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a modified ART class IV restoration technique in a
      clinical study. These data are to be compared with an historical control (original ART class
      IV anatomical structure rebuilding restorations). Historical control data will be retrieved
      from &quot;Jordan RA, Gaengler P, Markovic L, Zimmer S: Performance of Atraumatic Restorative
      Tratment (ART) depending on operator-experience. J Public Health Dent 2010; 70: 176-80.&quot;

    <description>Carious tissue was removed with an excavator until a sound probing was obtained. Restorations were performed using a mechanically improved glass-ionomer cement for ART. The modified class IV ART restoration was inserted into the cavity using a spatula. By these restoration technique, the cavity was (i) sealed to stop further caries progression. The cavity was (ii) capped to protect the vital dentin-pulp-complex from external stimuli. The modified class IV ART was aimed at conserving the carious incisor for prospective functional use and for prolonging tooth preservation rather than at anatomical reconstruction of the tooth form for cosmetic reasons.</description>
