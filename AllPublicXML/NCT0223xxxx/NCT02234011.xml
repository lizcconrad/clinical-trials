  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn whether administration of intranasal (inhaled through the
      nose) ketamine reduces symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Ketamine has been
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an anesthetic agent (a medicine to
      reduce pain during surgery and other procedures) but ketamine has not been approved by the
      FDA as a treatment for OCD.

      The investigators believe that ketamine may be effective in reducing symptoms of OCD due to
      its ability to decrease the activity of a specific brain chemical called glutamate. Previous
      studies have shown that people with OCD can have abnormal levels of glutamate in their
      brains. This is the first time that intranasal ketamine is being studied in people with OCD.
      However, studies have been done in the past using intravenous (IV; through a needle into a
      vein in your arm) ketamine in people with OCD, and intranasal ketamine has been studied in
      people with other psychiatric conditions.

      This research study will compare ketamine to placebo. The placebo looks exactly like
      ketamine, but contains no ketamine. At some time during the study, the investigators will
      give you ketamine. At another time, the investigators will give you placebo. Placebos are
      used in research studies to see if the results are due to the study drug or due to other
      reasons.

    <description>Examining if ketamine is associated with a decrease in OCD symptoms as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at completion of one treatment when compared to placebo (saline solution).
The Y-BOCS measures OCD symptoms on a scale of 0-40, with higher numbers indicating greater severity of OCD symptoms. For this study, subjects had to have a Y-BOCS of greater than or equal to 18 in order to participate.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female age ≥ 18 and ≤ 55

          2. Meets DSM-IV50 criteria for OCD as the primary presenting diagnosis as determined by
             the investigator (participants with secondary comorbid dysthymia, major depression,
             anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and other obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders
             will still be eligible for enrollment).

          3. Score of ≥ 18 on the Y-BOCS at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwillingness or inability to provide written informed consent.

          2. Active suicidal ideation at screening

          3. Lifetime history of psychotic disorder or autism spectrum disorder

          4. DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence, with the exception of nicotine
             dependence, within three months prior to screening

             results as judged by the principal investigator.

             disorder, neurodegenerative diseases, transient ischemic attacks, neural vascular
             disease, stroke, cerebral aneurysms, and history of traumatic brain injury.
