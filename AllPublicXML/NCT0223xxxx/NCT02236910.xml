  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lu-DOTA-TATE (Lutetium-177 octreotate) is a radiopharmaceutical that has been reported as
      being effective in controlling symptoms and increase quality of life; induce stable disease
      and extend progression free survival; induce a (good) partial remission and induce a complete
      remission in patients with a somatostatin receptor positive tumour.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Lu-DOTA-TATE by measuring progression
      free survival and overall survival. This study will also asses the safety of Lu-DOTA-TATE,
      and the quality of life of the patients treated with Lu-DOTA-TATE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine (NET) tumours have secretory and metabolic pathways not typically found in
      other cancers that can be utilized for molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting. The most
      important is somatostatin. Somatostatin receptors are useful tools in the diagnosis and
      treatment of NET tumours because the somatostatin analogue octreotate can be radiolabeled
      with lutetium-177 for imaging and therapy.

      In selected populations of patients, radioisotope therapy in expert hands has been shown to
      be a safe and effective palliative therapy with stable disease, progression free survival
      benefit, symptom control and improvements in quality of life. Lutetium-177 (DOTA0, Tyr3)
      octreotate has been used in a significant number of clinical studies shown to be safe and
      effective as a therapeutic agent in patients with NET tumours. The investigators intend to
      further confirm these benefits with lutetium-177 octreotate, which could form the basis for a
      national registry study leading to registration of this therapeutic intervention.
