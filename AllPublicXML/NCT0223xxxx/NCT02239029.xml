  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although few studies have showed beneficial effect of platelet rich plasma (PRP) for
      osteoarthritis of knee (OA knee), only one study applied randomized, control method and none
      of them has the objective measurements such as balance test or muscle strength which were
      reported as decrease in patients with OA knees. We assess the analgesic effect and the extent
      of improved muscle strength and balance after PRP in patients with OA knee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with bilateral OA knee will be enrolled and randomized into intervention and control
      knee. One dose of PRP is applied in the intervention knee and normal saline in control side.
      Outcome measurements included visual analog scale (VAS)、Lequesne's severity index、Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)、balance test (Biodex) and
      isokinetic strengthening test at different follow-up frame (2nd week, 1st month, 3rd month
      and 6th month after treatment).
