      In this 3-treatment, 3-period, 6-sequence crossover study, each subject received all 3
      products in randomized order and used 1 product at a time for a duration of 5±1 days before
      switching to the next assigned product.

    <measure>Area for Each Region (Near and Intermediate) Under the Mean Defocus Curve (AUC) at High Luminance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, each product</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity was measured with contact lenses in place using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) high contrast logMAR chart under well-lit conditions. Lenses of different spherical powers (+2.00 diopter to -5.00 diopter) were placed in front of the eyes to produce varying levels of defocus, and logMAR acuity at each defocus value was recorded. The area under the defocus curve (AUC) was calculated via the trapezoidal rule for the entire study population by treatment using a 0.3 logMAR threshold for intermediate from -2.00 D (50cm) to -0.50 D (2m) and near from -4.00 D (25cm) to -2.00 D (50cm). A higher value indicates a bigger area of focus. This outcome measure was prespecified for monovision and DACP MF.</description>

        <title>Area for Each Region (Near and Intermediate) Under the Mean Defocus Curve (AUC) at High Luminance</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured with contact lenses in place using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) high contrast logMAR chart under well-lit conditions. Lenses of different spherical powers (+2.00 diopter to -5.00 diopter) were placed in front of the eyes to produce varying levels of defocus, and logMAR acuity at each defocus value was recorded. The area under the defocus curve (AUC) was calculated via the trapezoidal rule for the entire study population by treatment using a 0.3 logMAR threshold for intermediate from -2.00 D (50cm) to -0.50 D (2m) and near from -4.00 D (25cm) to -2.00 D (50cm). A higher value indicates a bigger area of focus. This outcome measure was prespecified for monovision and DACP MF.</description>
