    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common condition, affecting majority of the adults in the United States at
      some point in their lives. Fortunately, most resolve, even without treatment. However, some
      suffer from continued or recurrent pain.

      For those suffering from continued or recurrent low back pain, numerous treatment options
      exist. One such option is an epidural injection, particularly when other non-surgical
      treatment options have failed. An epidural injection is the placement of a needle into the
      space around the spinal cord with the aid of a live X-Ray machine, followed by an injection
      of various medications. Typically, the medication that is injected is a steroid, commonly
      with the combination of local anesthetic medication. Epidural steroid injections, with or
      without local anesthetic is part of the established standard of care in the United States for
      those with continued or recurrent low back pain. The steroid is believed to reduce
      inflammation and edema of the injured or irritated nerves. However, despite the routine use
      of epidural steroids, the steroid itself is not without risks or side effects. Though rare,
      the steroids have been associated with complications including osteoporosis, steroid induced
      myopathy, cataracts and many others. In order to minimize the side effects associated with
      epidural steroids, limiting the dose and frequency have been outlined.

      Clonidine is another medication, commonly used in numerous clinical settings. U. S. Food and
      Drug Administration approved the medication for epidural use for cancer pain but studies have
      shown effectiveness in non-cancer pain was well and is routinely used for various conditions.
      There is growing evidence on the use of epidural clonidine for treatment of pain, including
      low back pain.

      This research will study and compare the effectiveness, if any, of clonidine compared to
      steroid in an epidural injection for low back pain.
