  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of complementary therapies delivered
      via mobile technologies have a therapeutic effect on surgical patients' anxiety, pain, and
      self-efficacy in healing reports before, following, and at 10-day follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for same-day surgery (SDS) often experience state anxiety, which may
      result in increased perceptions of pain and lower self-efficacy in healing. Complementary
      therapies (CT), such as relaxation technique, massage, guided imagery, and acupuncture have
      been shown to benefit patients undergoing surgery. The aim of this study was to examine the
      effects of audio relaxation technique (ART), music intervention (MI), nature video
      application with music (NVAM), and nature video application without music (NVA) delivered via
      mobile technologies on patients' state anxiety, pain perception, and perceived self-efficacy
      in healing.

      Methods A randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 105 SDS patients, who were assigned to
      an ART (n = 25), MI (n = 25), NVAM (n = 15), NVA (n = 16), or a control group (n = 24) were
      assessed for state anxiety via the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), self-reported pain
      using the numeric rating scale (NRS), and self-efficacy with the general self-efficacy scale
      (GSE) four days prior to surgery, immediately prior and following the surgical intervention,
      and at day five post-operative.
