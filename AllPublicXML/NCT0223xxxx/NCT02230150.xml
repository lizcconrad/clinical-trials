      The purpose of this study is to verify the impact of the educational intervention in the
      adhesion to therapeutic strategies for patients with heart failure.

      1. Characterize the socio-demographic and clinical aspects of heart failure patients;

        2. Awareness before and after nursing consultation, in relation to diet for heart failure,
           liquid and weight, general heart failure information, medication, physical activity,
           measures to improve disease control, signs of decompensated heart failure;

        3. Adhesion of patients before and after nursing consultation, related to medication,
           liquid and weight, use of alcohol and importance of returning for consultation and
           exams.

        4. Evaluated the impact of educational intervention at the levels of NT-proBNP, urea,
           creatinine, sodium, potassium, before and after nursing consultation;

        5. The 6 minute walk test performance before and after nursing consultation;

        6. The distance covered and time of the 6 minute walk test, until fatigue in heart failure
           patients before and after nursing consultation;

    <description>The hypothesis that was investigated is whether the nursing consultation improves therapeutic strategies for membership, adherence to self-care, improved levels of NT-proBNP improves performance in 6-minute walk test, monitoring of biomarkers of laboratory tests (sodium , potassium, urea, creatinine and NT-proBNP) frequent occurrence of readmissions and mortality in patients with heart failure after 1 month.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  During the first phase of the study all the heart failure patients with ventricular
             ejection fraction of up to 49% shall be included (confirmed through ECOTT performed
             during the past year). All patients inserted had systolic heart failure and were
             scheduled and which agreed to take part of the research, signing a term of informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with cognitive deficit, first outpatient medical consultation, suffered
             AMI (acute myocardial infarction) within the last 3 months or a stroke, post-operative
             of cardiac surgery, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
             orthopedic problems, patients over the age of 80 and those that do not accept to
             participate of the research.
