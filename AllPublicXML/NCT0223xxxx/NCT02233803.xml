    <textblock>
      This Phase IV study is an a multi-centre, randomised open label, two way cross-over design to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NEUMOTEROL 400 in subjects with asthma.
      The study will be used to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Budesonide/Formoterol Fumarate
      combination (BFF) 400/12 micrograms (mcg) single capsule inhaler (NEUMOTEROL 400) compared
      with BFF 320/9 mcg SYMBICORT Forte TURBUHALER® inhaler.

      The population for this study will be adult subjects (&gt;=18 and &lt;=80 years) with a diagnosis
      of asthma who have a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40%
      to 85% of the predicted normal value, and are receiving a stable dose of inhaled
      corticosteroid inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with or without long-acting beta-adrenergic
      agonist (LABA) prior to screening.

      The study will consist of six phases: Prescreening, Screening/Run-in (4 weeks), Treatment
      Period 1 (4 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (4 weeks) and Follow-up (1
      week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 17 weeks. There will
      be up to 6 study visits and a follow-up telephone call.

      Pre-screening Visit will allow subjects who had recent asthma medication changes to be
      stabilized prior to Screening. During the run-in and wash-out periods, all the subjects will
      receive budesonide dry powder inhaler (DPI) 400 mcg twice daily (BID) (NEUMOTEX™ 400) and
      salbutamol 100mcg pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) on demand, as rescue medication.
      The dose of NEUMOTEROL 400 (400/12 mcg) and SYMBICORT Forte (320/9 mcg) will be one
      inhalation BID, and each treatment will be given to all subjects for 4 weeks (with a 4-week
      Washout Period between treatments).

      The study will include 300 subjects for screening so that at least 210 will be randomised and
      a minimum of 168 subjects complete the study/are evaluable. Half the subjects will be on
      Regimen A in Treatment Period 1and will then be crossed over to Regimen B in Treatment Period
      2, and vice versa. Regimen A: BFF (400/12 mcg) by single capsule inhaler. Regimen B: BFF
      (320/9 mcg) TURBUHALER inhaler. The treatment periods will be separated by a washout Period
      of 4 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day (D)29</measure>
    <time_frame>BL (D1) and D29 (each TP)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is maximal amount of air, forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose: 12 hours (h) after last evening dose D28 at end of each TP. Measured by spirometer in morning, before using bronchodilator and pre-dosing at wk1 D1 and wk4 D29 of each TP and test was performed within 30 minutes prior to dosing. Change from BL was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific (PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect. PS BL value is pre-dose assessment collected on D1 of each TP. SL BL is arithmetic mean of PS BL values of participant. If only one of PS BL value is missing for participant, SL BL took value of other BL. If both PS BL values were missing, SL BL was set to missing. Period level BL=PS BL - associated SL BL.</description>

    <measure>FEV1 Area Under the Curve (AUC) (0-10 h) at D1 of Each TP</measure>
    <time_frame>(0-10 h) at D1 (each TP)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 AUC (0 to 10h) was measured at beginning of each TP. AUC was derived using values observed at the following timepoints: 0 minute (pre-morning dosing), 5 minutes (m), 15m, 30m, 1, 2, 5, and 10h; post morning dosing FEV1 values on D1 of each TP. Pre-dose was taken as, 0h timepoint on the visit of interest, and all subsequent timepoints were calculated relative to that timepoint. FEV1 AUC was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific(PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From BL in Asthma Control Test (ACT) at 4 Wks for Each TP</measure>
    <time_frame>BL up to W4 (each TP)</time_frame>
    <description>ACT was basically a five item questionnaire, to measure participant's asthma control. It comprised of five possible answers to each question, associated with a score of 1 to 5 (1=poor control and 5=good control), wherein the scores from each question were summed to give an overall score (5=poor control and 25=complete control). ACT was recommended during each visit and was completed by the participant before any procedures were performed, avoiding any influence of the participants response. Change from BL was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific(PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect. PS BL value, is pre-dose assessment collected on D1 of each TP. SL BL, is arithmetic mean of PS BL values of participant. Participants with an ACT below 15 were excluded from the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &gt;=18 and &lt;=80 years of age with a diagnosis of asthma at the time of
             signing the informed consent

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-child bearing potential
             defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40 milli-international
             unit/milliliter (mIU/mL) and oestradiol &lt;40 picogram/millilitre (pg/mL) [&lt;147
             picomol/litre] is confirmatory) ; Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of
             the physician for the duration of the study from Screening to follow-up contact) if
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For most forms
             of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the
             blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After confirmation of
             their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
             of a contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use
             one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by
             the product label or investigator) before the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise
             the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
             until at least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment ; Abstinence from
             penile-vaginal intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the subject

          -  Severity of disease: A best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=40% to &lt;=85% of the predicted
             normal value at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). . Percent predicted will be
             calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative
             reference equations.

          -  Reversibility of disease: Demonstrated &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL reversibility of FEV1 within
             10 to 40 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or
             equivalent nebulised treatment with salbutamol solution) at Visit 1 (Screening and
             Run-in Visit)

          -  Current anti-asthma therapy: All subjects must be using an ICS with or without LABA
             for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening
             and Run-in Visit). Two populations are eligible for enrolment: Subjects maintained on
             ICS monotherapy (Budesonide 400 mcg to 800 mcg BID or equivalent) for at least 8 weeks
             and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) or
             Subjects maintained on an ICS/LABA combination product (e.g., NEUMOTEROL 200/6 BID or
             400/12 mcg BID or equivalent by other combination products or by separate inhalers)
             for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening
             and Run-in Visit). Subjects taking budesonide/formoterol as needed must switch to
             maintenance dosing (excluding the highest dose) with use of a SABA for symptom relief
             at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and
             Run-in Visit). NOTE: Subjects on low dose ICS monotherapy should only be enrolled, if,
             in the opinion of the investigator, after review of their medical history and clinical
             examination, they will be able to benefit from both an increase in ICS dose and the
             addition of LABA therapy arising from and ICS/LABA combination

          -  Ability to withhold LABA therapy : Other than what is provided during the study, LABA
             therapy is not permitted on the day of Visit 1(Screening and Run-in Visit) and
             throughout the entire study. The last dose of pre-study LABA and LABA/ICS combinations
             are to be taken on the day before Visit 1. According to investigators judgement,
             patients should be able to withhold LABA therapy during the run-in and wash-out
             period.

          -  SABA: All subjects must be able to replace their current SABA treatment with rescue
             salbutamol at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) for use as needed for the duration
             of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold salbutamol for at least 6 hours before
             each study visit

          -  Liver safety criteria: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2×the upper limit of normal
             (ULN), Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5×ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5×ULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) at Visit 1
             (Screening and Run-in Visit)

          -  Electrocardiography (ECG) safety criteria : The subject must have no ECG abnormalities
             that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety, or
             significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such, the
             investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and
             determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening and
             Run-in Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc)
             &lt;450 microseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for patients with bundle branch block. The
             QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula
             (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread.
             The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained
             over a brief recording period. Investigators will be responsible for ensuring
             appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs.

          -  The subject and/or the subject's legal guardian (if applicable) must be capable of
             giving informed consent/assent, which includes compliance with the study requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent/assent form

        <description>FEV1 is maximal amount of air, forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose: 12 hours (h) after last evening dose D28 at end of each TP. Measured by spirometer in morning, before using bronchodilator and pre-dosing at wk1 D1 and wk4 D29 of each TP and test was performed within 30 minutes prior to dosing. Change from BL was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific (PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect. PS BL value is pre-dose assessment collected on D1 of each TP. SL BL is arithmetic mean of PS BL values of participant. If only one of PS BL value is missing for participant, SL BL took value of other BL. If both PS BL values were missing, SL BL was set to missing. Period level BL=PS BL - associated SL BL.</description>

        <title>Change From BL in Asthma Control Test (ACT) at 4 Wks for Each TP</title>
        <description>ACT was basically a five item questionnaire, to measure participant’s asthma control. It comprised of five possible answers to each question, associated with a score of 1 to 5 (1=poor control and 5=good control), wherein the scores from each question were summed to give an overall score (5=poor control and 25=complete control). ACT was recommended during each visit and was completed by the participant before any procedures were performed, avoiding any influence of the participants response. Change from BL was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific(PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect. PS BL value, is pre-dose assessment collected on D1 of each TP. SL BL, is arithmetic mean of PS BL values of participant.
