  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      French guidelines currently recommend to initiate a 4-drug containing regimen associating
      isoniazid (INH or H), rifampicin (RIFor RMP or R), pyrazinamide (PZA or Z) and ethambutol
      (EMB or E) pending the results of drug susceptibility testing (DST). The rationale behind
      routine use of EMB is to prevent the emergence of resistance to rifampicin (RMP), in case of
      primary resistance to INH. Hence, early detection of resistance to INH and RIF using
      molecular testing in Mycobacterium tuberculosis could allow early adaptation of
      antituberculosis treatment: i) start with a 3-drug containing regimen (i.e. INH, RIF, and
      PZA); ii) early enforcement of treatment when resistance is suspected, pending in depth
      susceptibility testings.

      the duration of treatment is 6 months or 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of rapid detection of resistance with PCR has been poorly evaluated in low-endemic
      countries. In France, primary resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin were estimated at,
      respectively, 5.2%, and 1.2 %. Based on these estimates, French guidelines currently
      recommends to initiate a 4-drug containing regimen associating isoniazid (INH or H),
      rifampicin (RIFor RMP or R), pyrazinamide (PZA or Z) and ethambutol (EMB or E) pending the
      results of drug susceptibility testing (DST). The rationale behind routine use of EMB is to
      prevent the emergence of resistance to rifampicin (RMP), in case of primary resistance to
      INH. Hence, early detection of resistance to INH and RIF using molecular testing in
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis could allow early adaptation of antituberculosis treatment: i)
      start with a 3-drug containing regimen (i.e. INH, RIF, and PZA), in patients with fully
      susceptible isolates (currently 95% of cases); ii) early enforcement of treatment when
      resistance is suspected, pending in depth susceptibility testings. GenoType ®MTB DR plus
      sensitivity for RIF and INH resistance detection has been estimated at 100% and 83%,
      respectively.

cure certain: negative sputum cultures or negative sputum direct examination in a patient who has completed treatment and have never filled the definition of treatment failure.

completed treatment: patients who took more than 80% of prescribed treatment.

radiological improvement: between baseline and end of treatment
failure: if Positive sputum culture after 5 months of treatment, death during treatment whatever the cause, treatment interrupted for more than two months, decision of the clinician to change TB treatment because of the suspicion of failure after 5 months of TB treatment</description>
