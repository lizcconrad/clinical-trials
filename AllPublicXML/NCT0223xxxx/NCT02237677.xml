  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed translational study is to test a model, based upon basic
      science studies, exploring multisystem impairments in PTSD including endocannabinoid (eCB)
      and glucocorticoids in the modulation of fear memories by examining the cannabinoid type 1
      (CB1) receptor in a PTSD fear circuit as well as glucocorticoid function. The investigators
      propose that impaired eCB signaling in PTSD resulting in the maladaptive neurobehavioral
      response to the stressor is associated with an upregulation of the CB1 receptors and
      insufficient glucocorticoid signaling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eCB - anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) - and their attending cannabinoid (CB)
      receptors which are found in high densities in a fear circuitry involving the amygdala,
      hippocampus, the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex serve important functions in
      the regulation of stress-coping behaviors. Besides eCB regulation there is strong evidence
      from ongoing research of the investigators group and others suggesting an important role for
      glucocorticoid signaling as an endpoint of the biochemical sequelae initiated by stressful or
      aversive stimuli. One of the long-term research goals of our lab is to understand such
      functions and determine their relevance to the pathogenesis of PTSD and to provide a more
      integrative view on neurobiological mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of the
      neuroadaptive response to stress. The objective of the proposed translational study is to
      test a model, based upon basic science studies, exploring multisystem impairments in PTSD
      including eCB and glucocorticoids in the modulation of fear memories by examining the CB1
      receptor in a PTSD fear circuit as well as glucocorticoid function. The investigators propose
      that impaired eCB signaling in PTSD resulting in the maladaptive neurobehavioral response to
      the stressor is associated with an upregulation of the CB1 receptors and insufficient
      glucocorticoid signaling.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of distribution (VT) of cerebral CB1 receptor expression in PTSD and controls within a fear circuit of brain regions that regulate stress-related behaviors using the CB1 radioligand carbon - 11 (11C) [11C]OMAR and PET.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two months</time_frame>
    <description>To examine group differences in cerebral CB1 receptor expression in PTSD and controls within a fear circuit of cortical and subcortical brain regions that regulate stress-related behaviors using the CB1 radioligand [11C]OMAR and PET.
Hypothesis: PTSD patients will show greater [11C]OMAR VT (i.e. CB1 binding) values than both control groups, trauma-exposed and non-trauma exposed control subjects who will not be different.</description>
