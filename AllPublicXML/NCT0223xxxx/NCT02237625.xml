  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by defective bone
      and teeth mineralization caused by mutations of the ALPL gene, which encodes for the
      tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) isozyme, resulting in decreased serum and
      bone alkaline phosphatase levels. To date, over 250 different mutations in the gene encoding
      TNSALP have been associated with HPP. Clinically, the loss of TNSALP function results in
      progressive skeletal impact as well as progressive impact on all other major organ systems.
      It clinically manifests as rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia at all ages. The
      severe form of the disease has been estimated to have a prevalence of about 1 in every
      100,000 live births.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inheritance can be autosomal recessive or dominant, and penetrance is variable resulting in a
      wide range of clinical expressivity, with a spectrum ranging from stillbirth without
      mineralized bone to early loss of teeth without bone symptoms. Depending on the age at
      diagnosis six clinical forms are currently recognized: perinatal (lethal), perinatal benign,
      infantile, childhood, adult and odontohypophosphatasia. Severe forms of HPP (perinatal and
      infantile) are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and in milder forms (adult and
      odontohypophosphatasia) autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance coexist.

      Because of the rarity of HPP as well as the side spectrum of both clinical presentation and
      inheritance patterns of the HPP trait, a natural history study cataloging specific clinical
      data with HPP would prove invaluable for future research into this disease. Specifically, it
      is our goal to create a comprehensive multi-discipline modality for care for hypophosphatasia
      patients, researching clinical manifestations of the disease such as extent of bone disease,
      ophthalmologic manifestations, orthopedic issues, renal issues, musculoskeletal
      manifestations as well as other more anecdotal findings such as those seen with cochlear
      implant failures and/or early menopause.
