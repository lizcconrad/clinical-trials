  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to determine the mean change in HIV viral load from baseline to
      Week 4 compared with placebo after 4 weeks of treatment in highly experienced HIV-infected
      patients.

      Secondary objectives were to determine (1) the tolerability, hematologic and hepatic safety
      of different doses of alovudine and (2) the effect of baseline nucleoside genotypic
      susceptibility on virologic response after 4 weeks of alovudine administration
