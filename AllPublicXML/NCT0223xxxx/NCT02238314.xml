  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to evaluate the antiviral activity and safety of two regimens of
      tipranavir (500 mg BID or 1000 mg BID) plus ritonavir (100 mg BID) administered in
      combination with 1 new nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) + efavirenz in
      multiple protease-inhibitor-experienced HIV-1 positive patients.

             containing dual protease inhibitors

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the patient had adhered to PI-containing regimens

          -  Exposure of ≥ 3 months to the current PI therapy

          -  Exposure of ≥ 4 months to the prior PI therapy with single PI-containing regimens

          -  Stable PI-containing regimen for at least 2 months prior to study entry

          -  HIV-1-RNA ≥ 5,000 copies/mL

          -  Taking of any investigational medication with the exception of adefovir dipivoxil
             (Preveon™) and amprenavir (Agenerase™) within 30 days of study entry

          -  Pregnancy or lactation (serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin test had to have been
             negative within 14 days of study entry)

          -  Evidence of active substance abuse, which in the investigator's opinion, could affect
             compliance to the protocol

          -  In the investigator's judgment, inability to comply with the protocol requirements for
