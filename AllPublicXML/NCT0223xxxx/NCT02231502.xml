  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish to what extent innovations in food production
      techniques may facilitate retention of bioactive compounds in healthy individuals.

      The study has a single-blinded (outcome assessor), cross-over design; wherein, the plasma
      concentration and urinary excretion levels of a range of bioactive compounds will be assessed
      over a 24 hour period following intake of either a vegetable based convenience food, or a
      minimally processed meal containing the same vegetable materials.

      To do this, 20 healthy volunteers will attend two assessment days (and a follow-up assessment
      at +24hr) and will provide blood and urine samples, which will be collected at biologically
      relevant times over the 24 hour period. In this cross-over study, each meal will be eaten on
      separate days, with a wash-out period of at least 1 week between assessments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women

          -  â‰¥ 18 years old

          -  Successful biochemical, haematological and urinalysis assessment at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current smokers, or ex-smokers ceasing &lt; 3 months ago

          -  Pregnant women, or those currently breast feeding

          -  Subjects with existing or significant past medical history of medical conditions
             likely to affect the study measures i.e. diabetes, hepatic, renal, digestive or cancer
             (excluding Basal-cell carcinoma) - to be judged by the study clinical advisor.

          -  Those unprepared to adhere to dietary restrictions for 3d preceding and during each
             assessment day.

          -  Parallel participation in another research project involving dietary intervention
             and/or sampling of biological fluids/material.

          -  Those on therapeutic diets or having experienced substantial weight loss (to be judged
             by clinical advisor) within 3 month of screening

          -  Taking dietary supplements containing flavonoids, isothiocyanates or carotenes
             (including multivitamins) (and unwilling to cease intake during, and 1 month preceding
             the trial) or unwilling to maintain existing intake of other supplements.

          -  Prescribed medications likely to affect ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism,
             and excretion); medications to be assessed for suitability by the clinical advisor.

          -  Clinical advisor judged: abnormal biochemical, haematological or urinary results or
             measurements considered to be counter indicative for the study: including kidney and
             liver function, fasting glucose (especially if indicative of diabetes), lipid
             abnormalities, full blood count.
