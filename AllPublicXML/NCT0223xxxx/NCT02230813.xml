  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term cellulitis is a medical term describing a bacterial infection of the skin and
      tissues beneath the skin. Although it is usually easily treated with antibiotics given either
      orally or through a vein (intravenously), knowing which route of antibiotic treatment to
      prescribe to a person attending an Emergency Department with cellulitis is not clear.

      A Clinical Prediction rule (CPR) is a decision-making tool that comes from original research
      as opposed to the opinion of experts. We intend to create a preliminary CPR to decide which
      patients require oral and which patients require intravenous antibiotics for cellulitis from
      their first visit to an emergency department. The aim of this is to provide safer care by
      reducing the risk of a patient returning to the hospital with a worsening infection. It will
      also promote more cost-effective care by reducing hospital re-attendance rates and wasted
      antibiotics.

      Patients attending the department with cellulitis who are suitable for oral antibiotic
      treatment will be enrolled into this study. A separate doctor will re-examine at least 10% of
      study participants in order to reduce bias. A set of physical signs and symptoms will be
      recorded from each patient in order to determine which ones are associated with them
      &quot;failing&quot; prescribed oral treatment. A study investigator will then phone the patient after
      14 days to see whether they are better or whether they required intravenous antibiotics to
      get better.

    <description>The primary outcome is the proportion of patients initially commenced on oral antibiotics who subsequently require IV antibiotics to achieve treatment response. This will be assessed by means of telephone follow-up performed at 14 days post enrolment into the study. Treatment failure is defined as attendance at a treating Emergency Department for intravenous antibiotic therapy if already commenced on oral therapy.</description>

    <description>Consecutive adult patients attending the study Emergency Departments with cellulitis will be considered eligible for recruitment to the study. Only those patients deemed suitable for oral antibiotic therapy and planned for discharge will be recruited to the study. Oral antibiotic therapy prescribed will be dependent on local institutional prescribing guidelines. For the purposes of the sites enrolling participants, the antibiotic of choice is oral flucloxacillin 500 milligrams four times daily for seven days. We will be assessing the treatment failure rate for this cohort of patients; namely, the number of patients requiring the primary outcome (change from oral to intravenous antibiotic therapy). We will also assess this group of patient for the secondary outcomes listed above.</description>

        Adult patients aged &gt;16 years attending the ED with cellulitis as the primary diagnosis
        will be consecutively recruited. Only patients who are deemed suitable for an oral
        antibiotic will be enrolled. Patients who require IV therapy will not be enrolled.
        Cellulitis may arise de novo, or from a recognised cause such as a wound or ulcer. In order
        to generate an externally valid clinical prediction rule, we will include all patients
        attending the ED with cellulitis, including those who may have already been commenced on
        oral antibiotics (for example, by their general practitioner).
