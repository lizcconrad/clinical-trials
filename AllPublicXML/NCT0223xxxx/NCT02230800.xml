  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Side effects are common after treatment with radiotherapy for tumours in the pelvis and can
      affect the way the bowel and urinary system work as well as causing sexual difficulties, skin
      damage and bone problems. Problems in the bowel, bladder, sexual organs and skin mostly
      result from thickening of the tissues in response to radiotherapy, a process called
      &quot;fibrosis&quot;. Fibrosis often worsens over time.

      There has been progress in treating bowel symptoms which usually are the worst problem after
      radiotherapy. However, even after receiving the best possible treatments, while many patients
      are better, they are often not cured of all their difficult problems.

      For some years, it has been hypothesised that if fibrosis could be treated then symptoms
      would improve. Recent research in laboratory animals has suggested that an effective
      treatment for radiation-induced fibrosis is combination therapy with a drug called
      Pentoxifylline together with a nutritional supplement containing gamma-tocotrienol (Tocovid
      SupraBio), a substance derived from palm oil. Both of these agents are simple to take and
      side effects are rare.

      This study will recruit volunteers who continue to have difficult side effects after previous
      radiotherapy to the pelvis despite receiving the best treatments available from a unique
      clinic at The Royal Marsden which has pioneered treatment for bowel problems after
      radiotherapy. Two out of every three volunteers who take part, will be randomly assigned to
      treatment with Pentoxifylline and Tocovid SupraBio, while one out of three will receive dummy
      pills. Neither the patients nor the staff assessing them will know which treatment they have
      been given. Volunteers take the active treatments or dummy tablets for a year and will be
      assessed regularly while on treatment and for a year afterwards. This study will show whether
      active treatment is more effective than dummy pills in improving the symptoms caused by
      radiation-induced fibrosis.
