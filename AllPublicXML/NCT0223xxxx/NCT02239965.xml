  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monitoring the degree of neuromuscular blockade in general anaesthesia reduces complications
      and patient discomfort. However, monitoring is not applied consistently by Danish anaesthesia
      personnel. Surveys show that part of the explanation is that the anaesthetists often
      experience problems with the equipment used for monitoring, though the problems have not been
      described in detail.

      We hypothesise that the lack of consistent monitoring in general anaesthesia is caused by
      insecurity in the anaesthesia personnel's set-up and use of the equipment, as well as in
      interpreting the measurement results.
