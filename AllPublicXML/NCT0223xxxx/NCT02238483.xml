    <description>The EXACT for Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) scale is a derivative instrument comprising a subset of 11 of the EXACT items to evaluate the severity of respiratory symptoms of COPD.

    <description>The SGRQ-C is a modified version of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, which has been developed to measure the impact of respiratory disease on health status. The SGRQ-C includes 14 questions in 3 domains: symptoms; activity; and impacts. Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating benefit. Change in total score from pre study-treatment baseline to Week 12 end of treatment visit are reported.</description>

    <measure>Dyspnea (Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12 treatment discontinuation visit (in some patients this visit was delayed beyond the planned Day 84, up to maximum of 118 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Baseline/Transitional Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI) provides a multidimensional measure of dyspnea in relation to activities of daily living. The BDI provides a measure of dyspnoea at a single state, the baseline, and the TDI evaluates changes in dyspnoea from the baseline state. The instrument consists of three components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. For the BDI, each of these three components are rated in five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired), and are summed to form a baseline total score from 0 to 12. For the TDI, changes in dyspnea are rated for each component by seven grades from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and are added to form a total TDI score from -9 to +9. Positive scores indicate an improvement, and a change from the BDI or a difference between treatments of 1 point has been estimated to constitute the minimum clinically important difference.</description>

        <description>The Baseline/Transitional Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI) provides a multidimensional measure of dyspnea in relation to activities of daily living. The BDI provides a measure of dyspnoea at a single state, the baseline, and the TDI evaluates changes in dyspnoea from the baseline state. The instrument consists of three components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. For the BDI, each of these three components are rated in five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired), and are summed to form a baseline total score from 0 to 12. For the TDI, changes in dyspnea are rated for each component by seven grades from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and are added to form a total TDI score from -9 to +9. Positive scores indicate an improvement, and a change from the BDI or a difference between treatments of 1 point has been estimated to constitute the minimum clinically important difference.</description>
