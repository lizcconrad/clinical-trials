  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well FDG-PET/CT measures early response in patients with
      stage III-IV melanoma who are receiving chemotherapy. Positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) uses a metabolic imaging radiotracer, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG), which selectively accumulates in tumors. FDG-PET/CT of advanced melanoma before,
      during, and after treatment may improve methods for predicting which patients may benefit
      from therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate treatment-induced changes in FDG uptake with changes in tumor size and
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving therapy for advanced melanoma.

      II. To correlate treatment-induced changes in FDG uptake with changes in the activity and/or
      expression of available molecular biomarkers from patients receiving therapy for advanced
      melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT up to 2 weeks prior to first dose of therapy, after completion of
      the first treatment course (day 21), and after completion of the fourth treatment course (day
      84).

    <measure>Percent Change in the Sum of the Longest Dimension of Target Lesions, Defined by RECIST</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the completion of 6 courses of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary imaging metric is percent change in average FDG standardized uptake value (SUV) among the same target lesions between baseline and images acquired after completion of cycle 1. The relationship between tumor SUV change and size change will be assessed using standard linear regression.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Tumor [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Accumulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The association between the changes in tumor FDG accumulation with a panel of immunohistochemical biomarkers will be assessed with the Spearman correlation statistic. 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each variable. Paired changes in biomarker expression between biopsied (i.e., baseline) and biopsy samples will be compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. Change in binary expression will be compared using McNemar's test. The Wilcoxon rank sum test (or Kruskal Wallis test for more than 2 groups) will be used to compare continuous and ordinal variables.</description>

            <description>Patients undergo [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) up to 2 weeks prior to first dose of therapy, after completion of the first treatment course (day 21), and after completion of the fourth treatment course (day 84). Molecular assays on biopsied tissue obtained from a subset of patients will also undergo molecular assays, the results from which will be correlated with FDG-PET/CT data.
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose: FDG is administered intravenously approximately 60 minutes prior to the start of PET image acquisition.
Molecular assays on biopsied tissue: Correlative studies
positron emission tomography: Undergo FDG-PET/CT
computed tomography: CT that is part of FDG-PET/CT is a low-milliampere, low-resolution scan that is used for anatomic localization and attenuation correction for PET images.</description>

          <title>Percent Change in the Sum of the Longest Dimension of Target Lesions, Defined by RECIST</title>
          <description>The primary imaging metric is percent change in average FDG standardized uptake value (SUV) among the same target lesions between baseline and images acquired after completion of cycle 1. The relationship between tumor SUV change and size change will be assessed using standard linear regression.</description>

        <description>The association between the changes in tumor FDG accumulation with a panel of immunohistochemical biomarkers will be assessed with the Spearman correlation statistic. 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each variable. Paired changes in biomarker expression between biopsied (i.e., baseline) and biopsy samples will be compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. Change in binary expression will be compared using McNemar's test. The Wilcoxon rank sum test (or Kruskal Wallis test for more than 2 groups) will be used to compare continuous and ordinal variables.</description>
