  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we propose to employ a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      outpatient clinical trial to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a 160 mg and 40
      mg challenge of the mGlu2/3 agonist pomaglumetad methionil relative to placebo in modulating
      fear-potentiated startle response and behavior in adults with post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) (N=30). Each participant will receive a single dose of the study drug (40 mg vs 160 mg
      vs placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio).

    <description>To evaluate the effect of 160mg and 40mg challenge of the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist pomaglumetad methionil relative to placebo in mitigating fear-potentiated startle using the neutral-predictable-unpredictable fear-potentiated startle paradigm in adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The primary index of unpredictable fear will be the difference score between startle magnitude in safe and unpredictable conditions in the absence of the cue.</description>
