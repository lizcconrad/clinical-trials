    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that CPD parameters will provide improved prediction of sepsis
      compared to currently employed laboratory parameters. These studies hold the potential to
      shape practitioner guidelines and improve the timeliness and accuracy with which patients
      with sepsis are treated today.
