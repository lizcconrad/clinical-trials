  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral pulse oximetry allows continuous non-invasive measurement of arterial oxygen
      saturation, but the gold standard for arterial oxygen saturation is co-oximeter which
      requires an arterial blood sample. The purpose of this research study is to determine the
      accuracy of a pulse oximeter with a standard sensor (Masimo LNCS sensor) versus with the
      study sensors, namely Masimo blue sensor and Nellcor Max-I sensors and compared against
      co-oximetry. Currently available peripheral oximeters (standard) are inaccurate at low oxygen
      saturation noted in children with cyanotic heart disease. Hence therapeutic interventions
      (including surgery and cardiac catheterizations) based solely on peripheral oximetry can be
      delayed and or inadequate. By doing this study the investigators will be able to establish
      correct limits of peripheral pulse oximeter when using the standard and the study sensors.

      Peripheral pulse oximetry allows continuous non-invasive measurement of arterial oxygen
      saturation, but the gold standard for arterial oxygen saturation is co-oximeter which
      requires an arterial blood sample. The purpose of this research study is to determine the
      accuracy of a pulse oximeter with a standard sensor (Masimo LNCS sensor) versus with the
      study sensors, namely Masimo blue sensor and Nellcor Max-I sensors and compared against
      co-oximetry. Currently available peripheral oximeters (standard) are inaccurate at low oxygen
      saturation noted in children with cyanotic heart disease. Hence therapeutic interventions
      (including surgery and cardiac catheterizations) based solely on peripheral oximetry can be
      delayed and or inadequate. By doing this study we will be able to establish correct limits of
      peripheral pulse oximeter when using the standard and the study sensors.

      The investigator hopes to learn the limits of accuracy of currently available and used pulse
      oximeters. In children with cyanotic heart disease the &quot;blue sensor&quot; has been found in small
      studies to be more accurate compared to the &quot;standard&quot; pulse oximeter.

      This study is important as it will provide information as to which pulse oximeter should be
      routinely used in children with cyanotic heart disease and to assess which SPO2 even with
      blue sensor is borderline and therefore the physician will know to obtain arterial blood
      sample for co-oximeter prior to planning important procedures based on a saturation reading.

    <time_frame>2year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary measure was to describe the limits of the blue sensor and standard sensor accuracy as compared with the co-oximeter. If the test sensors consistently have a bias greater than 2 SD from the co-oximeter value at saturations lower than eg., 80 then the recommendation would be that the co-oximetry be used to measure patients saturatioin rather than relying on pulse oximtery alone for clinical decision making</description>
