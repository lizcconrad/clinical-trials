  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will investigate changes in hand function, active cervical
      range of motion and pinch grip force after the application of physical therapy in women with
      carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The purpose of this study is to compare changes in function,
      cervical range of motion and pinch grip force induced after the application of a physical
      therapy program including manual therapies targeted to those areas related to the median
      nerve or after endoscopic surgery in women with CTS at medium and long-term follow-up. The
      hypothesis is that manual therapy is more effective for increasing cervical range of motion
      and pinch grip force, but similarly effective for improving function, than surgical treatment
      in women with CTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence suggesting that CTS is associated with restricted cervical range of
      motion and deficits in pinch grip force. In fact, restricted cervical range of motion and
      deficits in pinch grip force seems to be independent of electro-diagnostic findings. These
      findings would be associated with the proposed &quot;double crush syndrome&quot; theory. However no
      longitudinal studies have been conducted. Further it has been demonstrated that hand function
      is associated to deficits in these outcomes. Since previous studies support the use of
      physical therapy and surgical interventions for the management of function in these patients,
      the aim of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to determine if changes in
      hand function are related to changes in active cervical range of motion and pinch grip force
      after the application of a physical therapy program including manual therapies targeted to
      those areas related to the median nerve or endoscopic surgery in women with CTS.

    <description>The Spanish version of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) will be used to assess function. This questionnaire evaluates 2 domains: 1) the functional status scale assesses ability to perform 8 common hand-related tasks; and, 2) the symptom severity scale includes 11 items assessing pain severity, numbness, and weakness at night and during the day. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (1: no complaint; 5: severe complaint), with higher scores indicating greater severity. In the current study the score of the functional status scale of this questionnaire will be used as the main outcome.</description>

    <description>A cervical range of motion (CROM) device will be used to assess cervical range of motion in a single direction: flexion, extension, lateral flexion toward or away from the side of the CTS, and rotation toward or away from the side of the CTS. For patients with unilateral symptoms, sides are classified as affected or unaffected whereas in those with bilateral symptoms, the most painful side will be considered as the affected side and the less painful side as the unaffected side.</description>
