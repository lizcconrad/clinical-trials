  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the
      efficacy of brief cognitive behavioral treatment for child sleep (CBTcs) to improve sleep in
      an important high-risk population, overweight/obese (OV/OB) youth with behavioral sleep
      disorders. OV/OB youth with behavioral sleep disorders and their parent(s) will be randomly
      assigned to 8 sessions of either CBTcs or an Educational Control (EC). CBTcs will address
      behavioral sleep issues in children; EC will address sleep and dietary education and general
      coping strategies. Child sleep (total wake time, total sleep time, bed/wake times), height,
      weight, physical activity, dietary intake, quality of life (QOL), fatigue, and daytime
      sleepiness will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. It is
      hypothesized the children in the CBTcs will experience greater improvement in sleep than
      children in the EC.

      Assessment Procedures: Subjects will participate in 8 treatment sessions and 3 full
      assessment meetings over the course of 7 months. All meetings will be held at the Magnolia
      Park Sleep Disorders Center. The following procedures will be performed:

      Stage 1 - Phone Screening, Stage 2 - Screening and Baseline Measures, Stage 3 - Overnight
      Sleep Monitoring, Stage 4 - Two weeks Wrist Actigraphy, Sleep Diaries, Dietary Recalls Stage
      5 - Intervention, Stage 6 - Post-Treatment Measures, Stage 7 - 3-Month Follow-Up
