  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure kappa opioid receptors
      (KOR) in the brains of individuals with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      The investigators propose to recruit 45 drug-na√Øve individuals, N=15 patients with PTSD, N=15
      trauma-exposed, but asymptomatic healthy control subjects (TC) and N=15 non-trauma exposed
      healthy control subjects (HC) to participate in one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and one
      PET study. The investigators will also carefully document trauma history, and collect
      behavioral and neuroendocrine measures to provide a more integrative view on the neurobiology
      of PTSD and its phenotype. The investigators predict PTSD will show greater carbon - 11
      (11C)[11C]LY2795050 volume of distribution (VT) (i.e. KOR binding) values than control
      populations in an a priori defined PTSD circuit.

        Subjects are between the age range of 18 to 55, are medically healthy and currently not
        taking any medications to treat any medical illness, have a history of post-traumatic
        stress disorder, or are a healthy control who has or has not been exposed to trauma.

        Inclusion criteria for patients with PTSD:

          1. age 18-55 years old

          2. currently diagnosed with PTSD and symptomatic with a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale
             (CAPS) score &gt; 50.

        Exclusion criteria for patients with PTSD:

          1. any primary Axis I disorder other than PTSD (e.g. psychosis)

          2. medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy, i.e.
             uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disorders

          3. a history of drug (including benzodiazepines (BZD)) dependence (Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) criteria) within 1 year of the study
