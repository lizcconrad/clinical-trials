  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a single site mechanistic study to investigate microRNAs (miRNAs)
      that are differentially expressed in the airway epithelium of patients with asthma at
      baseline and in response to allergen challenge. We hypothesize that allergen exposure
      enhances airway smooth muscle contractility and epithelial cell mRNA/miRNA production as a
      consequence of locally increased T-cell derived cytokine production. The study will involve
      three visits over the course of approximately 14 days. At Visit 1, participants will be
      characterized in detail with lung function testing, methacholine challenge testing, and
      allergen skin prick testing. At Visit 2, participants will undergo bronchoscopy with
      segmental allergen administration of either cat or dust mite standardized allergen extract.
      At Visit 3 (either 24 hours later or 7 days later), bronchoscopy will be performed to collect
      airway samples including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), epithelial brushings and endobronchial
      biopsies. Sample analysis will include measurement of miRNA and mRNA expression in epithelial
      brushings (RNAseq and qPCR); analysis of cell surface markers on BAL cells and blood cells;
      and collection of endobronchial biopsies for immunostaining of immune cells localization,
      immunoblotting of smooth cell protein phosphorylation, analysis of mucin content and smooth
      muscle cell subculture. A total of 38 subjects (26 asthmatics with stable or well-controlled
      asthma, 6 allergic non-asthmatics and 6 non-allergic non-asthmatics) will complete the study.

    <description>After processing of the sequencing data to read counts, the difference in read count in the allergen challenged as compared to the diluent challenged segment at the given follow-up time point will be calculated for each subject. The change in read count for each miRNA in the allergen samples will be compared to the change in read count in the diluent samples and statistical significance will be assessed using the Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate method (FDR) to account for multiple comparisons.</description>
