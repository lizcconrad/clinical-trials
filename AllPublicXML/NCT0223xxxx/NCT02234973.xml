  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Indigenous peoples experience higher prevalence rates of diabetes and worse health
      outcomes compared to the general population because of a wide array of factors: social
      determinants of health, lifestyle, genetic susceptibility, and historic-political and
      psycho-social factors. Barriers to care that are unique to First Nations communities
      exacerbate the problem with fragmented healthcare, poor chronic disease management,
      healthcare staff turnover, and limited, or non-existent, surveillance.

      Program: The TransFORmation of IndiGEnous PrimAry HEAlthcare Delivery (FORGE AHEAD) research
      program aims to develop and evaluate community-driven, culturally relevant, primary
      healthcare models that enhance chronic disease prevention and management in First Nations
      communities in Canada. Participants will consist of Indigenous community and clinic team
      members that will take part in multiple interrelated projects including community profiling,
      readiness consultations, diabetes registry and surveillance, and quality improvement
      workshops and action periods.

      Design: This mixed-method pre-post observational study will capture: 1) diabetes clinical
      process and outcomes measures, 2) details about community-driven innovations, and 3)
      knowledge about the experience and cost of attempting to improve primary delivery in
      individual Indigenous communities.

      Intervention/Instrument: Survey, literature review, 15 month intervention (readiness
      consultations, implementation and maintenance of a registry and surveillance system,
      community and clinic focused quality improvement workshops), interviews.

      Measures: Primary- mean A1C of patients with diabetes (A1C ≥ 8.0% at baseline);
      Secondary-clinical process and outcome measures, change in stage of readiness, description of
      participation and innovation facilitators and barriers.

      Policy Implications: The outcomes of this research program have the potential to
      significantly affect future policy decisions pertaining to chronic disease care in First
      Nations communities. Policy recommendations will be made to help support Indigenous
      communities in adopting successful innovations to help address issues related to diabetes and
      other chronic illnesses. The community-driven innovations developed in FORGE AHEAD and the
      subsequent policy decisions may enhance chronic disease prevention and management for
      Indigenous peoples across the country.
