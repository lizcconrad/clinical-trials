  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MET oncogene is known to sustain the Trousseau's syndrome in murine experimental models,
      featuring association of carcinogenesis with a blood procoagulant disorder. MET is frequently
      overexpressed in colorectal cancer, a tumor where venous thromboembolism (VTE) may occur in
      association with poor prognosis, but the biological and genetic factors that cause VTE are
      still obscure.

      The Investigators propose to study whether in patients harboring a surgically resectable
      colorectal cancer the MET oncogene is expressed and may be associated with a blood
      thrombophilic condition that favors the onset of VTE.

      These data would have two main implications: (i) for the first time, a direct genetic link
      between the MET oncogene and a procoagulant disorder would be demonstrated in humans; (ii)
      the procoagulant alterations would have diagnostic/prognostic significance for the
      identification of patients at risk for poor outcome, and implementation of appropriate
      therapeutic protocols.
