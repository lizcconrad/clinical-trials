  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study aims to monitor the vital sign changes in both mother and baby that
      occur during kangaroo care in preterm infants and to investigate any potential correlations
      between maternal measurement values and those of the infant. The purpose of this
      observational study is to look for a method to track the earliest responses that could,
      theoretically, be considered as 'social responses' in hopes of providing developmental
      interventions earlier to at-risk infants.

      The goal of this observational study is to identify any signs of early &quot;social response&quot; in
      order to be able to assist infants that lack this response with early neurobehavioral
      modifications.
