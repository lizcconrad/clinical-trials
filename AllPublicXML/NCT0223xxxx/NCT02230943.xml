      The RISE Registry is an enhanced version of the ACR's Rheumatology Clinical Registry (RCR)
      and allows for a simplified entry process, while establishing a best-in-class resource to
      manage your patient population and improve patient care.

      RISE provides participants with an infrastructure for robust quality improvement activities
      leading to improved patient outcomes, patient population management and quality reporting
      related to rheumatic diseases and drug safety. RISE gives physicians and researchers the
      information they need to optimize patient outcomes, meet reporting requirements, and make
      discoveries that advance rheumatology.

      RISE helps providers benchmark performances on key rheumatology clinical quality measures and
      align with best practice standards. The RISE benchmarking tool allows providers to view the
      details of their patient population against established rheumatology quality metrics. RISE
      allows access to aggregate data from other participating sites so providers can view their
      patient population in comparison to other RISE participants.

      RISE is integrated into an electronic health records (EHR) system, bringing a single point of
      entry into one solution for filing for quality-based incentive payments, avoiding penalties,
      complying with reporting requirements and tracking caseloads for quality monitoring and
      improvement initiatives. RISE collects the data needed to meet current federal reporting
      requirements.

      Participating in RISE helps push the field of rheumatology practice forward. RISE provides a
      source of information on patient outcomes and quality care for rheumatology leading to new
      discoveries, better understanding and a source of comparative effectiveness research.
