  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism of action of MSC relies on their ability to modulate pathogenic immune
      responses and provide neuroprotection through the release of anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and
      trophic factors as demonstrated by in-vitro and in-vivo preclinical studies.

      Patients will be randomized to receive immediate vs. delayed treatment with either a dose
      equal to 1-2 millions/kg of body weight of autologous MSC, or equivalent volume of suspension
      media at baseline. At week 24 treatments will be reversed.

      The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate:

        -  Treatment's safety within one year from MSC administration by measuring the number,
           time-frame and severity of adverse events and

        -  Treatment's activity in terms of reduction in total number of gadolinium-enhancing
           lesions (GEL) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

      Secondary outcomes are to gain preliminary information on the efficacy of the experimental
      treatment in terms of combined MRI activity and clinical efficacy (incidence of relapses and
      disability progression).
