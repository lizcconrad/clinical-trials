  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reduction of existing plaque and gum inflammation will be evaluated using two marketed
      mouth rinses along with tooth brushing after 21 days of use compared to a placebo mouth
      rinse.

      165 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this three week study. Volunteers who qualify to
      be in this study will have an equal chance of being assigned to one of the three treatment
      groups. Volunteers will have a total of three visits including 1) Screening/Baseline Day 1 2)
      Day 11 (after 10 days of use) and 3) Day 22 (after 21 days of use). Volunteers will maintain
      a diary at home to record each treatment use and will be asked to come to the clinic without
      brushing or use their product for at least 8 hours, but no more than 18 hours. Examinations
      for oral hard/soft tissue, gingivitis, bleeding and plaque assessments will be completed at
      Screening/Baseline and repeated at Clinic Visit 3, which is Day 22.

      A sufficient number of generally healthy subjects (approximately 165) that meet the required
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this 21 day, examiner-blind, single center,
      randomized, parallel-group controlled clinical trial to ensure that at least 150 subjects (50
      per treatment group) complete this study.

      At baseline, the prescreened subjects will present to the clinic site for baseline
      examinations (oral tissue assessment, gingivitis, bleeding and plaque assessments) having
      refrained from oral hygiene for at least 8 hours, but no more than 18 hours. After the
      baseline oral examinations, assessment of other inclusion/exclusion criteria qualifying
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Immediately following
      this randomization, subjects will begin use of their assigned test product following the
      label instructions. If randomized to the control group, subjects will brush twice daily in
      their usual manner with an ADA accepted fluoride toothpaste and a soft bristled toothbrush
      followed by rinsing twice daily with a 5% hydroalcohol control rinse (W002194-221P). If
      randomized to an active treatment group; subjects will brush twice daily in their usual
      manner, followed by rinsing twice daily with their assigned mouth rinse formulation
      (19292-116A or 11965-059). Subjects will be instructed to follow label instructions 20ml for
      30 seconds twice daily for mouth rinse product. The first product use will be conducted under
      the supervision of study personnel. All other brushing and rinsing will be unsupervised and
      the subjects will be required to maintain a diary card to document twice daily product use,
      brushing and rinsing times. Compliance will be evaluated by weighing residual volumes of
      returned mouth rinse and by reviewing the subject diary. Subjects will receive an ADA-
      accepted fluoride-containing dentifrice and a soft bristled toothbrush at their baseline
      visit.

      Subjects may continue to use floss to remove impacted food between the teeth if it is part of
      their usual oral care regimen during the course of the study; no other oral hygiene
      procedures will be permitted, including teeth cleaning, whitening or dental procedures except
      for an emergency treatment. The decision to withdraw a subject due to emergency dental
      treatment will occur at the discretion of the Investigator.

      At baseline and three weeks (Â±2 days) visits, subject will not have brushed or have used
      their product for at least 8 hours, but no more than 18 hours.

      Oral tissue safety, Modified Gingival Index (MGI), Bleeding Index (BI), and Plaque Index (PI)
      will be assessed.

             essential oil, cetylpyridinium chloride, or chlorhexidine containing mouth rinses
             within three weeks prior to baseline;

          5. Self-reported pregnancy or lactation (this criterion is due to oral tissue changes
             related to pregnancy and nursing which can affect interpretation of study results);

          6. Significant unstable or uncontrolled medical condition which may interfere with a
             subject's participation in the study, at the discretion of the Investigator;

          7. Participation in any other clinical study within 30 days of Visit 1;

          8. Subjects who are related to those persons involved directly or indirectly with the
             conduct of this study (i.e., principal investigator, sub-investigators, study
             coordinators, other site personnel, employees of Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiaries,
             contractors of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the families of each); and

          9. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation, substance
             or alcohol abuse or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into the
             study.

        <description>Gingivitis was assessed on the buccal and lingual marginal gingivae and interdental papillae of all scorable teeth according to the following scale: 0: Normal (absence of inflammation), 1: Mild inflammation (slight change in color, little change in texture) of any portion of the gingival unit, 2: Mild inflammation of the entire gingival unit, 3: Moderate inflammation (moderate glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy) of the gingival unit, and 4: Severe inflammation marked redness, edema and/ or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, spontaneous bleeding, congestion, or ulceration. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging their tooth site scores at Week 3.</description>

        <title>Whole Mouth Mean Gingival Bleeding Index (BI) at Week 3</title>
        <description>Bleeding was assessed using a periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip which was inserted into the gingival crevice, and swept from distal to mesial, around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degrees, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Each of 4 gingival areas (disto-buccal, midbuccal, mid-lingual, and mesio-lingual) around each tooth was assessed. After approximately 30 seconds, bleeding at each gingival unit was recorded according to the following scale: 0: Absence of bleeding after 30 seconds, 1: Bleeding after 30 seconds, and 2: Immediate bleeding. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging their tooth site scores at Week 3.</description>

        <description>Bleeding was assessed using a periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip which was inserted into the gingival crevice, and swept from distal to mesial, around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degrees, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Each of 4 gingival areas (disto-buccal, midbuccal, mid-lingual, and mesio-lingual) around each tooth was assessed. After approximately 30 seconds, bleeding at each gingival unit was recorded according to the following scale: 0: Absence of bleeding after 30 seconds, 1: Bleeding after 30 seconds, and 2: Immediate bleeding. The score for each participant was the change from baseline in the percentage of sites with a BI score of 0 at Week 3.</description>

        <description>Plaque area was measured based on the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index and was scored on six surfaces (distobuccal, midbuccal, mesiobuccal, distolingual, midlingual, and mesiolingual) of all scorable teeth, following disclosing, according to the following scale: 0: No plaque, 1: Separate flecks or discontinuous band of plaque at the gingival (cervical) margin, 2: Thin (up to 1 mm), continuous band of plaque at the gingival margin, 3: Band of plaque wider than 1 mm but less than 1/3 of surface, 4: Plaque covering 1/3 or more, but less than 2/3 of surface, 5: Plaque covering 2/3 or more of surface. The score for each participant was the change from baseline (i.e., Baseline Score minus Week 3 Score) in the percentage of sites with a PI score â¥2 at Week 3.</description>
