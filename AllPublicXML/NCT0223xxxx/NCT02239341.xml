  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for pregnant women deemed to be high-risk often involves
      recommending varying levels of activity-restriction, up to and including hospitalization.
      High levels of activity-restriction can lead to physical deconditioning of the mother, which
      can be difficult to recover from after birth. The proposed study will investigate whether a
      mild muscular conditioning program conducted in bed and given to hospitalized
      activity-restricted high-risk pregnant women will improve functional ability, cardiovascular
      deconditioning and overall quality of life in the postpartum period compared to a control
      group with no in hospital bed-rest exercise program. We hypothesize that women with a
      in-hospital muscle conditioning program will be better able to perform functional ability
      tasks and activities of daily living than a control group with no exercise program.

    <measure>Score on the Functional Mobility Assessment Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Mobility Assessment Tool was adapted from a senior fitness test, which uses 7 tests to assess muscular strength, aerobic endurance, flexibility and agility (Chair Stand Test, Arm Curl Test, 6-Minute Walk Test, 2-Minute Step Test, Chair Sit-And-Reach Test, Back Scratch Test, and 8-Foot-Up-And-Go Test).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (&gt; 28 weeks gestation); 2 weeks post delivery; 2, 6 and 12 months post delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome of the study is to examine quality of life in the postpartum period. Quality of life will be measured by completing four surveys the EQ-5D, and the Postpartum Psychological Profile Questionnaire which includes the Depression Scale (1 page), the State Anxiety Index (1 page) and the Postpartum Physical and Psychological Symptoms Report .</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The M intervention will be 30 minutes (same amount of time as E group), but the participants will simply be listening to the same music in bed with no exercise component. They will be wearing the heart rate monitor as in the E group. The M group will act as a control group for the E group.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Muscle Conditioning Intervention (E)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>E (exercise) is 30 minutes in length and will consist of 5 minutes of warm-up, 20 minutes of light strengthening exercises using a theraband, and 5 minutes of cool-down. All exercises will be completed in bed. Each participant will be listening to the same music (as the M group) during exercise. A heart rate monitor will be worn throughout each session. The first session for each participant will be used to complete baseline measurements and to assess initial muscle strength. Difficulty level will be adjusted by using different strength therabands.</description>
