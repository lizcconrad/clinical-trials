      Double Blinded Randomized Trial of eTNS as adjuvant treatment for Major Unipolar Depressive
      Disorder. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of eTNS (external
      trigeminal nerve stimulation) of the V1 branch of the trigeminal nerve as an adjunctive
      treatment for adult patients with the diagnosis of unipolar MDD (Major Depressive Disorder).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify a efficacy of eTNS of the V1 branch of the trigeminal nerve</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) 17 scores as the main outcome measure to assess the efficacy of sTNS of the V1 branch of the trigeminal nerve as adjunctive treatment for MDD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify the tolerability of eTNS stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability will be evaluated by the records of adverse effects observed during the randomized, open stimulation. We will apply the Ugvalg for Kliniske Undersgelser (UKU) scale at all visits for all patients and to compare scores between groups. Adverse events will be categorized using the MedDRA Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Complications reported by active and sham stimulation groups will be compared. The complication risk will be calculated based on the overall study duration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify the long-term recurrence rate of eTNS therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the recurrence rate of all participants at the end of the open label prospective follow-up. Recurrence is defined as return of HAM-17 scores equal to or superior to the original, after the patient has lodged during partial response (20% decrease of the initial score) or complete response (50% decrease of the initial score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify the duration of the placebo effect</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the duration of the placebo effect in participants randomized to sham stimulation during the initial 12 weeks of the trial. The mean, median and the standard deviation of the interval time to recurrence will be calculated on placebo stimulation.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomized to active vs. sham stimulation during a period of 24 weeks with a one-way cross over at 12 weeks.
After 12 weeks, the participants receiving active electrical stimulation will continue under active stimulation until completion of the study.
Participants randomized to sham stimulation will be shifted to active stimulation and will be followed-up until completion of the study.
The study will be unblinded after 6 months of randomized stimulation. The second part of the study will be an open label prospective trial for evaluate long-term follow-up. The duration of the open label trial will be more 24 weeks. the duration of the open label trial will be more 24 weeks.</description>
