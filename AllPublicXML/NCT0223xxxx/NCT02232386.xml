  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims at evaluating whether treatment with two different drugs, Ibrutinib
      and Rituximab is both efficient and safe for newly diagnosed patients with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that:

        -  Ibrutinib as single agent has been associated with a high response rate and PFS in
           previously treated patients, and in patients with poor prognosis clinical and biologic
           features.

        -  Ibrutinib as single agent has proven activity and is associated with a good safety
           profile in elderly patients with CLL.

        -  The Ibrutinib plus Rituximab combination has been associated with a high response rate
           and PFS in previously treated patients, and in patients with poor prognosis clinical and
           biologic features.

        -  The combined administration of Ibrutinib and Rituximab could be an effective and safe
           front-line treatment schedule for unfit patients with CLL.

        -  The current study is designed to evaluate whether first line treatment with Ibrutinib
           and Rituximab results in a significant improvement in PFS at 12 months as compared with
           chlorambucil plus rituximab in patients unfit for fludarabine- or bendamustine-based
           treatments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older.

          2. Diagnosis of CLL meeting IWCLL criteria.

          3. The diagnosis of CLL requires a history of lymphocytosis with a B-lymphocyte count
             ≥5,000/μL. Prolymphocytes may comprise no more than 55% of blood lymphocytes.

          4. Active disease meeting at least 1 of the following IWCLL 2008 criteria for requiring
             treatment:

               1. Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or
                  worsening of, anemia or thrombocytopenia.

               2. Massive (ie, at least 6 cm below the left costal margin), progressive, or
                  symptomatic splenomegaly.

               3. Massive nodes (ie, at least 10 cm in longest diameter), progressive, or
                  symptomatic lymphadenopathy.

               4. Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than 50% over a 2-month period
                  or a lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) of less than 6 months (which may be
                  extrapolated). Lymphocyte doubling time can be obtained by linear regression
                  extrapolation of ALCs obtained at intervals of 2 weeks over an observation period
                  of 2 to 3 months. For patients with initial blood lymphocyte counts of less than
                  30 x 109/L (30,000/μL), LDT should not be used as a single parameter to define
                  indication for treatment. In addition, factors contributing to lymphocytosis or
                  lymphadenopathy other than CLL (eg, infections) should be excluded.

               5. Constitutional symptoms, defined as 1 or more of the following disease-related
                  symptoms or signs:

                    -  Unintentional weight loss &gt;10% within the previous 6 months prior to
                       screening

                    -  Significant fatigue (inability to work or perform usual activities)

                    -  Fevers higher than 38.0°C for 2 or more weeks without evidence of infection;
                       or

                    -  Measurable nodal disease by computed tomography (CT). Measurable nodal
                       disease is defined as at least one lymph node &gt;1.5 cm in longest diameter in
                       a site that has not been previously irradiated. An irradiated lesion may be
                       assessed for measurable disease only if there has been documented
                       progression in that lesion since radiotherapy has ended.

          5. No prior treatment.

          6. Total CIRS &gt;6 and/or creatinine clearance &lt;70 ml/min [Cockcroft-Gault]).

          7. Hematology values within the following limits: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1 x
             109/L (ie, ≥1000/μL) independent of growth factor support. Platelets ≥50,000/mm3 if
             bone marrow involvement independent of transfusion support

          8. Biochemical values within the following limits:

               1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3 x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               2. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or
                  of non-hepatic origin

               3. Serum creatinine ≤2 x ULN or estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (Cockroft
                  Gault) ≥40 mL/min

          9. Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active must be practicing a
             highly effective method of birth control during and after the study consistent with
             local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for subjects
             participating in clinical trials. Men must agree not to donate sperm during and after
             the study. For females, these restrictions apply for 1 month after the last dose of
             study drug. For males, these restrictions apply for 3 months after the last dose of
             study drug.

         10. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin [β-hCG]) or urine pregnancy test at Screening. Women who are pregnant or
             breastfeeding are ineligible for this study.

         11. A signed (or signed by their legally-acceptable representatives) informed consent
             document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for
             the study, including biomarkers, and are willing to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition or organ system dysfunction
             and/or laboratory abnormality or psychiatric disease which, in the investigator's
             opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or
             metabolism of ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue risk or prevent
             the subject from signing the informed consent form.

          2. Pregnant or lactating females

          3. Known presence of alcohol and/or drug abuse.

          4. Any potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from
             participating in the study.

         10. Requires treatment with strong CYP3A inhibitors.

         11. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic
             arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of
             Screening, or any Class 3 (moderate) or Class 4 (severe) cardiac disease as defined by
             the New York Heart Association

         12. Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of randomization.

         13. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive serology for HIV; active
             Hepatitis B Virus infection or positive serology for Hepatitis B (HBV) defined as a
             positive test for HBsAg and HBV-DNA; active Hepatitis C or HCV-RNA positive; any
             uncontrolled active systemic infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics,
             antifungal, or antiviral treatment such as, but not limited to, chronic renal
             infection, chronic chest infection; history of tuberculosis within the last five years
             or recent exposure to tuberculosis equal to or less than 6 months.
