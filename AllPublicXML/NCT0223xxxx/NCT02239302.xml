  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructed defaecation syndrome is a common problem in which patients experience difficulty
      to evacuate stools and feel that the bowel is incompletely empty, which causes the need to
      put fingers in to the rectum or vaginal to empty the rectum. These symptoms have a
      significant effect on social, physical, emotional and sexual wellbeing all of which have
      impact on quality of life. These symptoms are caused by posterior compartment disorders such
      as the last part of the large bowel bulging into the vagina (rectocele), the small bowel
      pressing on the rectum (enterocele), a circumferential infolding of the rectal wall
      (intussusception) or paradoxical pelvic floor contraction during attempts to evacuate
      (anismus).

      Currently the evacuation proctogram is the gold standard for diagnosis of posterior
      compartment disorders. This technique, however, exposes the patient to ionising radiation,
      requires preparation of the small and large bowel with contrast and defaecation in a
      non-private setting, which most women find embarrassing and unpleasant. Over the years,
      research has focussed on identifying alternatives that are better tolerated to substitute
      evacuation proctography. Ultrasound is a widely available, non-expensive, non-invasive, fast
      and a well-tolerated method for the dynamic and static imaging of the pelvic floor without
      the use of ionising radiation. The level of agreement between transperineal ultrasound (TPUS)
      and proctography for varies widely. Endovaginal ultrasound (EVUS) not yet compared to
      proctography. The aim of this study is to assess the level of agreement between ultrasound
      (EVUS and TPUS) and evacuation proctography in the diagnosis of posterior compartment
      disorders.
