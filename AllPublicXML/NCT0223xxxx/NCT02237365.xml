  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculous meningitis is a severe brain infection which often causes disability and death
      even when treated with the best available treatment. Aspirin is a type of anti-inflammation
      drug which can reduce the inflammatory response in brains of patients with tuberculous
      meningitis, and therefore may decrease some of the most severe outcomes. This study compares
      the use of aspirin (at 2 different doses) versus placebo as an additional therapy to the
      standard treatment to see if aspirin is safe and helpful in reducing disability and death
      from tuberculous meningitis. Patients will be treated with aspirin or placebo for 60 days and
      followed up while on standard treatment for 8 months.

      The study is a parallel group, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial of 60 days
      treatment with placebo vs. 81mg daily dose vs. 1000mg daily dose aspirin for the treatment of
      HIV-uninfected adults with tuberculous meningitis.

      All patients will receive standard anti-tuberculous chemotherapy and adjunctive
      dexamethasone, according to Viet Nam National Tuberculosis Programme guidelines. Participants
      will be stratified by Medical Research Council UK disease severity grade, and randomized at
      enrollment to one of three study arms (1:1:1 ratio). Patients will be admitted to hospital
      for at least the first 14 days of study treatment enabling real-time active surveillance of
      any adverse events after which they will be discharged according to clinical care with
      continued monitoring.

      A schedule of clinical and laboratory monitoring including lumbar puncture, pharmacokinetic
      assessment of peripheral blood monocyte/macrophage antimicrobial activity, clinical
      assessments, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurological assessment will manage
      patient safety and capture study outcomes.
