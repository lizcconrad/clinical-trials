  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This drug-drug interaction study will assess the potential of CTX-4430 to induce CYP3A
      activity in healthy subjects.

      The study hypothesis is that midazolam (a sensitive, widely used CYP3A4 substrate) blood
      levels will not change after treatment with CTX-4430.
