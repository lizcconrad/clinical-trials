  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current definition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is based on the
      presence of persistent airflow obstruction assessed by spirometry. About half of the subjects
      with mild COPD (i.e. reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on forced vital
      capacity (FVC) ratio along with normal FEV1] are asymptomatic. Subjects with symptomatic mild
      COPD have reduced exercise tolerance and abnormal dynamic ventilatory mechanics compared to
      healthy subjects. The physiological and perceptual responses to exercise of subjects with
      asymptomatic mild COPD are currently unknown.

      The purpose of this study is to assess exercise tolerance, ventilatory constraints on tidal
      volume expansion and dyspnoea in asymptomatic mild COPD subjects undergoing incremental cycle
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to the limit of tolerance compared with symptomatic
      mild COPD and healthy controls.

      Subjects attend one single visit. If needed, COPD subjects are asked to stop any respiratory
      related medication such as short and long acting bronchodilators 72 hours prior to the visit.
      Subjects are asked to arrive early in the morning. After informed consent and appropriate
      screening of medical history, all subjects complete the mMRC scale. A complete medical
      history is collected. Subjects thereafter complete pulmonary function testing pre- and 30-min
      post-bronchodilator. Subjects are given a normal mixed meal and are asked not to drink
      alcohol or coffee.

      A symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise test is performed on the same day, at least 6
      hours after the bronchodilator test and at least 4 hours after the meal. After a steady-state
      resting period, a 3-min warm-up is conducted at about 20% of individually estimated maximal
      work load (Wmax), and the load is increased every minute in such a way that the test duration
      is &gt;8 and &lt;12 min. The following data are obtained breath by breath and expressed as 30-s
      averages: V'O2 and carbon dioxide production (V'CO2); minute ventilation (V'E); tidal volume
      (VT); respiratory rate; and ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide. Blood
      pressure is measured every minute by a sphygmomanometer. Blood samples are withdrawn from the
      arterialized earlobe at rest and at near-maximal exercise. Tests are terminated at the point
      of symptom limitation (peak exercise). Upon exercise cessation, subjects are asked to
      verbalize their main reason for stopping exercise (breathing discomfort, leg discomfort or
      both).

    <measure>Inspiratory capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory capacity as a function of work rate is studied as a continuous variable. In addition, a decrease in inspiratory capacity from rest of more than 150 mL at any time-point during exercise defines dynamic hyperinflation</description>

    <measure>Tidal volume as a function of minute ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>In the relationship between tidal volume (VT) and minute ventilation (V'E), there is an inflection point beyond which almost no further change in VT is possible despite a continued increase in V'E. This inflection in the VT response marks the point were dyspnoea sharply raises because of mechanical constraints on VT expansion. This inflection point is determined for each patient by analyzing individual Hey plot</description>
