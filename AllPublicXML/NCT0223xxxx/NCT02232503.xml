      The aim of the study is to find out prevalence and individual stages of Diabetic Retinopathy
      in patients with type 1 and type 2 DM verified based on complex ophthalmologic measurements
      in Slovak Republic. The outcome of the project will be epidemiology survey, prevalence of
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) in relation to type and duration
      of diabetes mellitus and risk factors. Project will also identify genetic factors linked with
      the diseases.

    <measure>Evaluate the impact of risk factors on the prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema</measure>
    <time_frame>participants screened each working day within 8 working hours during a 6 months period in selected diabetology centers according to protocol criteria</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis will be realized using multivariate logistics regression. The output of the analysis will be the impact statistical significance of the individual risk factors represented by odds ratio for each risk parameter accompanied with statistical significance and corresponding confidence interval. The risk factors will be at least: age, gender, ethnicity, DM duration since diagnosis, glycemic control and diabetes management based on the average HbA1c of all measurements in the last 12 months, presence of nephropathy, malignancies and BMI.
Age, DM duration since diagnosis, diabetes control based on the average HbA1c of all measurements in the last 12 months and BMI will be assessed as continuous covariates whereas gender, nationality, presence of nephropathy and malignancies will be considered as categorical variables.</description>

    <description>The impact of DR and DME on the quality of life in case of patients with DM will be realized using ANCOVA method where QoL will be evaluated as the continuous variable. The multivariate analysis will include all relevant patient characteristics including visual acuity, age and gender of the patient. These characteristics will serve as covariates to correct for the difference in characteristics of patient with/without DR.</description>

    <time_frame>DNA analysis during 7 months post study screening period</time_frame>
    <description>Genetic analysis is primarily exploratory in nature, does not test the hypothesis previously postulated and formal calculation of sample size can not be determined. In combination with accurately determined ocular and diabetic history is sample size above standard within typical publications of the topic.</description>

    <measure>The analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in pre-defined patient groups</measure>
    <time_frame>DNA analysis during 7 months post study screening period</time_frame>
    <description>Basic statistical analysis will include binary logistic regression (OR, 95% CI) and Fisher test. This method evaluates the statistical significance for the increase or decrease in the risk of DR for easy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), their combinations - DNA haplotypes, haplogroups and their clusters and thus identifies possible genetic factors involved in the study disease.</description>

      For the purpose of DNA isolation prior to genetic analysis two samples of peripheral blood
      will be taken. Tubes with sampled material will be stored under temperature of 2 - 8°C and in
      the least possible time delivered to the laboratory where DNA will be isolated. Of all the
      samples delivered to the laboratory, DNA will be extracted using the automated isolation
      method. From the second sample related to the genetic analysis also the plasma will be
      obtained and stored at -20°C. The DNA sample is then divided into two aliquot parts which
      will be stored separately for future analysis in order to decrease the risk of their
      impairment. DNA isolated from cells of biological material will be properly stored prior to
      further analysis. DNA will be archived by its freezing to -80°C, a temperature in which the
      characteristics are maintained for several decades.

        Total expected number of patients included in this survey is 5000. With the objective to
        guarantee non-biased patient selection sample, each screening day the pre-specified
        sequence of patients (5th, 10th, 15th...) will selected. If the pre-selected patient does
        not come for visit or does not fulfill the inclusion criteria or does not want to sign the
        informed consent the next patient is asked to participate in the research. We plan to
        enroll 4500 patients using this non-biased method.

        The weakness of the non-biased random selection is that the less frequent groups of
        patients will not have enough subjects for the proper statistical analysis. To correct for
        this effect pool of 500 patients is reserved for special subgroups. Pre-defined subgroups
        are:

          1. patients with DM duration more 20 years

          2. patients with DM duration less than 5 years already with DR in history All patients
             from these subgroups will be asked to participate in this project regardless of the
             pre-specified order.
