        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric
        criteria:

          -  Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an
             FEV1 &lt;=65% of predicted normal and FEV1 &lt;=70% of forced vital capacity (FVC).
             Predicted normal value will be calculated according to Morris

               -  Males: FEV1 = 0.093 (Height in inches)-0.032 (age)-1.343

               -  Females: FEV1 = 0.085 (Height. in inches)-0.025(age)-1.692

          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older

          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A pack-year is
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year

          -  Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and maintain records
             during the study period as required in the protocol

          -  Patients must be able to be trained in the proper use of an inhalation aerosol and the
             RESPIMAT™ device

          -  Patients must have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) with no clinical relevant
             arrhythmias or conduction system disease (e.g. right or left bundle branch block,
             second degree AV block or higher)

          -  Patients must have an oxygen saturation of &gt;=90% for &gt;=92% of the recording time on
             overnight oximetry

             (i.e., at least 24 hours (h) prior to the screening visit (Visit 1))

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically relevant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A
             clinically relevant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the
             investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study
             or a disease with may influence the results of the study or patient's ability to
             participate in the study

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e. one year or less) of myocardial infarction

          -  Patients who have a pacemaker

          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion the
             patient is excluded

          -  All patients with serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase / Aspartate aminotransferase
             (SGOT/AST) &gt;80 IU/L, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase / Alanine transaminase

             regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will be not be
             conducted in these subjects

          -  Patients who have a blood eosinophil count &gt;=600/mm3. A Repeat eosinophil count will
             be not be conducted in these patients

          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e. less than six
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to ant cholinergic drugs or any other components
             of the ATROVENT® RESPIMAT™ solution including bacteriostatic agent benzalkonium
             chlorid (BAC) and edetic acid (EDTA)

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within 1 month or 6 half-lives
