  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) appear almost exclusively in children and
      adolescents, representing 15 to 20% of posterior fossa tumours. Even if it is one of the most
      common malignant brain tumours, there are only 30 to 40 new cases per year in France. Their
      clinical presentation is stereotyped with a short clinical history and a unique MRI
      appearance that was usually considered as sufficient to establish the diagnosis. The
      prognosis of DIPG is always unfavourable; median overall survival is 9 to 10 months in
      general and most patients will die within two years after diagnosis (Kaplan 1996,Hargrave
      2006). Malignant gliomas infiltrating the brainstem represent the greatest challenge of
      paediatric oncology; despite numerous collaborative studies performed, patients' survival has
      not significantly increased in thirty years (Hargrave 2009). There is no validated prognostic
      factor. There is currently no validated treatment except radiotherapy.

      Several targeted agents have been tested in DIPG (Pollack 2007 Haas-Kogan 2008, Geoerger,
      2011), without knowing whether the target was present in the tumour. A critical review of the
      paradigms of these trials tells us that there are long term survivors in these studies that
      is to say patients who may have benefited from the tested therapy, but they are few. So far,
      the new therapies that have been tried were evaluated one after the other in search of a
      treatment that would be effective for all patients, measuring the treatment effect on median
      survival. They were all rejected as ineffective. However the investigators can challenge the
      endpoint to evaluate efficacy in these trials as the existence of long term survivors (&gt; 18
      months, for example) and their number should not been ignored, especially if targeted
      therapies are considered. The investigators propose a paradigm shift in the choice of
      treatment; the issue raised would be to give to each patient the treatment associated with
      the highest likelihood of efficacy based on the specific biological tumour profile.

      The development of targeted therapies for malignant gliomas infiltrating the brainstem has
      been hampered by the absence of biological data. It is therefore crucial to better understand
      the biology of these tumours. Despite the safety of the biopsy in brainstem tumours, most
      teams of paediatric neurosurgery limit the use of stereotactic biopsy only for clinically or
      radiologically unusual forms. Until recently, there has been no systematic genetic study at
      diagnosis to date and the few available data were confounded by the inclusion of autopsies or
      clinically and radiologically unusual cases (Louis, 1993; Gilbertson 2003; Okada, 2008;
      Zarghooni 2010; Broniscer, 2010; Wu, 2012 and Schwartzentruber, 2012).

      French teams gathered in the French Society of Paediatric Oncology and the European
      consortium &quot;Innovative Therapies in Children with Cancer (ITCC)&quot; decided a few years ago to
      perform biopsies of these tumours for diagnostic confirmation and to ensure the presence of
      certain therapeutic targets prior to a possible inclusion in a trial evaluating a targeted
      therapy (Geoerger, 2009; Geoerger, 2010). Part of this experiment was reported by the team of
      the Necker Hospital in Paris, confirming the low rate of complications of stereotactic biopsy
      procedure (Roujeau, 2007). The biopsy specimen analysis allowed practicing
      immunohistochemical, genomic (CGHarray), gene expression (transcriptome) and direct
      sequencing of candidate genes studies.

      In this study, the majority of patients will receive a treatment assumed to specifically
      target a biological abnormality identified on the biopsy. More importantly, patients will not
      receive a drug for which the identified target is absent.

      In this first step of the protocol, the patients will thus be allocated to one of the three
      treatment groups as follows:

        -  If the tumor overexpresses EGFR without PTEN loss of expression, patients may receive
           erlotinib or dasatinib allocated by randomization (R1 randomisation).

        -  If the tumor shows loss of PTEN expression without EGFR overexpression, patients may
           receive everolimus or dasatinib allocated by randomisation (R2 randomisation).

        -  If the tumor shows both EGFR overexpression and loss of PTEN expression, patients may
           receive erlotinib, everolimus or dasatinib by randomisation (R3 randomisation).

        -  If the tumor shows neither EGFR overexpression nor loss of PTEN expression (a very rare
           situation in our experience), patients will receive dasatinib (no randomisation).

        -  If the biopsy assessment is not contributive, the treatment will be allocated by
           randomisation between erlotinib, everolimus and dasatinib (R3 randomisation).
