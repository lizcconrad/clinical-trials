  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, single and multiple ascending dose study to assess
      the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of FP-025 in healthy subjects.

      Note: Dosing in the SAD phase was completed, and the planned MAD portion of the study was not
      conducted. Evaluation of FP-025 MAD is being conducted under a separate protocol (Study No.
      FP02C-17-001).

    <textblock>
      In the SAD part of the study the investigational drug will be administered once in a dose
      escalation manner starting from 200 mg in Cohort 1 to 2000 mg in Cohort 6. The study drug
      will be orally taken as capsules. In the MAD part of the study the investigational drug will
      be administrated twice daily for 5 days depending on the half-life of FP-025, as determined
      in the SAD part of the study. Study subjects will be randomized in a 1:3 ratio to either
      placebo or FP-025 in every cohort of the SAD and MAD part of the study.

      Note: Dosing in the SAD phase was completed, and the planned MAD portion of the study was not
      conducted. Evaluation of FP-025 MAD is being conducted under a separate protocol (Study No.
      FP02C-17-001).

          -  A history of psychiatric diseases, i.e depression and/or anxiety related illness.

          -  Serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             above the upper limit of normal (ULN) and deemed clinically significant by the
             investigator at screening and at the Safety Baseline Visit.

          -  Hemoglobin, white blood cells (WBC) or platelet count below the lower limit of normal
             (LLN) and deemed clinically significant by the investigator at screening and at the
             Safety Baseline Visit.

          -  Other laboratory results which are clinically significant abnormal at screening and at
             the Safety Baseline Visit.

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity at screening and at the Safety Baseline
             Visit.

          -  Employees of the investigator or study centre, as well as first grade family members
             of the employees or the investigator.
