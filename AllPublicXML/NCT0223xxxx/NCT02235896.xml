  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of our partnership with local African-American churches is to implement an
      effective, multi-component intervention to increase awareness of the critical importance of
      healthy lifestyle in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We will utilize the
      American Heart Association (AHA) prevention strategy, &amp;quot;Life's Simple 7&amp;quot; to address
      the major risk factors for CVD: diet, smoking, physical inactivity, hypertension, diabetes,
      cholesterol and obesity in order to improve overall cardiovascular health. Our main strategy
      consists of a community-based participatory research approach that involves focus groups to
      assess participant knowledge and beliefs about CVD risk factors prior to program initiation.
      We will also determine participant dietary and exercise practices, knowledge and perceptions
      related to healthy lifestyle and chronic diseases, demographic/health status information,
      health care utilization, biometrics (weight, blood pressure, blood tests for glucose and
      cholesterol, etc.) and attitudes about medical research at baseline, program completion and
      6-month follow-up.

      Church goers will undergo, baseline assessment of knowledge attitudes and behavior survey as
      it relates to CVD risk and anthropomorphic measurements. A 3 month experiential educational
      program will be provided at 2 locations. At 6 months after baseline a followup measure will
      be obtained
