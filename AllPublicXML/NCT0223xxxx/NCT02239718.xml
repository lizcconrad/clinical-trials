  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth replacement is a significant issue in the World and while dental implants and
      conventional bridges have been used to replace missing teeth, dental implants are too
      expensive for many and conventional dental bridges are destructive to supporting tooth
      tissue.

      Resin-bonded bridges (RBBs) are a conservative and cost effective replacement option that
      involves minimal tooth preparation, leaving the majority of the tooth intact. They are
      secured in place with an adhesive cement, which is bonded to the outer enamel layer. Clinical
      audit of these prostheses at the University of Hong Kong shows two-unit RBBs to have some of
      the highest success rates in the dental literature for the replacement of missing premolar
      and incisor teeth. However, for the replacement of molar teeth, two-unit RBBs are not
      performed, as established protocol and recognised texts contraindicate their use due to
      concerns with tipping or drifting of supporting teeth. Replacement of a single missing molar
      tooth can be with a three-unit, fixed-fixed (single-piece casting) or three-unit,
      fixed-movable (two-part casting). However, the fixed-fixed option has a higher debond failure
      rate than two-unit RBBs and therefore, at this centre, a modified, 3-unit fixed-movable
      design is used. This two-part casting allows for minor, independent movements of the
      supporting teeth and thereby aims to reduce stresses between them and, similarly, reduce
      de-bonding forces. This has the potential for greater longevity and easier long-term
      maintenance as if the major part of the bridge debonds it can be recemented.

      The aim of this unique study is to compare 2-unit and 3-unit RBBs for the replacement of
      single missing molar tooth in a randomized clinical trial. These two designs will be
      clinically evaluated at 6 months , 1 year, 2 years and 3 years to observe the outcome
      measures. The primary outcome will examine the success of the dental prostheses with respects
      to the need of any clinical intervention to repair or remediate the RBB or supporting tooth.
      Minor outcome measures will examine fatigue or damage to the prosthesis, changes in bone
      support, pulpal or periodontal health or tooth mobility. Patient satisfaction and quality of
      life evaluation of the dental prostheses will also be examined. Will 2-unit RBBs offer
      patients a simpler, cheaper, and successful option over current designs? This has not been
      previously reported.

    <description>Clinically whether the bridge is in subject's mouth. Any complication(s) and associated treatment(s) will be recorded. In case where there is absence of complication/treatment, this bridge is regarded as success.
If complication occur and/or treatment (apart from routine periodontal maintenance) is required but the original bridge is still in the mouth, this bridge is regarded as survival.
If lost of the original bridge/abutment tooth (teeth) or complication dedicates the remake of the bridge, the bridge is regarded as failed.
These will be presented in time to fail (survival) as well as time to complication/treatment (success) by Kaplan Meier curves.</description>

    <description>Models will be taken after insertion/cementation of bridge (RBB) (baseline model) and at review appointments (see Time Frame).
Vacuum suck down will be made on the baseline model and fitted in subject's mouth during review appointments to screen for any potential tooth movement.
In potential tooth movement case, models will be scanned and superimposed for analysis of tooth movement (direction and magnitude of movement)</description>

    <description>Complications related to the abutment teeth / prosthesis (RBB)
This is measured from review examinations as well as from patient history (any treatment of the RBB by the third parties other than the study centres)
Review examination will look for: debonding, fracture of framework, fracture of veneer material, caries occurring related to retainer on the abutments, extraction related to periodontal disease or root fracture resulting in loss of the entire reconstruction, abutment endodontic or apical radiolucency, probing depth greater than 5mm</description>
