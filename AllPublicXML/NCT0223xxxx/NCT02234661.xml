    <textblock>
      The CAP Family Advancement Study (CAP FAST) is a randomized control trial of CareerAdvance®,
      a dual-generation program providing education, career coaching, and soft-skills training for
      parents while their children attend CAP Tulsa's Head Start programs.

    <textblock>
      Randomization will take place with all applicants who have agreed to the study and are
      selected to participate in CareerAdvance®. Two-thirds of participants will be selected for
      the treatment group and will be able to enroll in CareerAdvance® immediately. The other
      one-third of the participants will be assigned to the control group and will not be able to
      enroll in CareerAdvance® for two years. Those who are selected for the control group will
      have access to CAP Tulsa's rich array of service outside of CareerAdvance®, including high
      quality early childhood education. The randomization process is introduced to parents during
      CareerAdvance® information sessions, and consent for the randomization process is required in
      order to apply to CareerAdvance®.
