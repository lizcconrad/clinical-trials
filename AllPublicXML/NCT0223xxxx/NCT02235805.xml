  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational epidemiologic studies have observed an inverse relationship between daily
      dietary magnesium intake and blood pressure (BP). Except for BP, magnesium may also
      beneficially affect other cardiovascular risk markers. Whether all these effects translate
      into improved vascular function is not known. Different vascular function markers at various
      stages on the pathway between diet and disease exist. One of these markers, vascular
      stiffness, is closely related to the process of atherosclerosis, an independent
      cardiovascular risk factor, and predictive of future cardiovascular events and mortality. To
      examine the integrated effects of interventions on cardiovascular risk, vascular stiffness
      may therefore serve as a marker at the later stage of cardiovascular disease development.

      Therefore, it is imperative to examine in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, two-way parallel-group human intervention study, the effect of magnesium
      on vascular stiffness. Focus will be on carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), the gold
      standard for the evaluation of vascular elasticity, to quantify vascular stiffness. Urinary
      excretion of magnesium will be used to assess dietary magnesium uptake. Furthermore, time
      courses of an increased magnesium intake on changes in BP, other markers reflecting vascular
      function, and plasma biomarkers related to low-grade inflammation and vascular activity will
      be measured to unravel possible cause-effect relationships.
