  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial in two zones of Bangladesh (north and south). Treatment is
      assigned at the village level where treatments are: cash transfers (north and south); cash
      transfers + nutrition behavior communication change (north only); food transfers (north and
      south); food transfers + nutrition behavior communication change (south only); food-cash
      split (north and south); and controls (north and south). Within treatment localities, women
      living in very poor households are targeted to receive benefits for two years.
