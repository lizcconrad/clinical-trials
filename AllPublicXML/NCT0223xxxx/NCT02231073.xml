  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is emerging research detailing the relationship between balance/gait/falls and
      cognition. Imaging studies also suggest a link between structural and functional changes in
      the frontal lobe (a region commonly associated with cognitive function) and mobility. People
      with Parkinson's disease have important changes in cognitive function that may impact
      rehabilitation efficacy. Our underlying hypothesis is that cognitive function and frontal
      lobe connections with the basal ganglia and brainstem posture/locomotor centers are
      responsible for postural deficits in people with Parkinson's disease and play a role in
      rehabilitation efficacy. The purpose of this study is to 1) determine if people with
      Parkinson's disease can improve mobility and/or cognition after partaking in a cognitively
      challenging mobility exercise program and 2) determine if cognition and brain circuitry
      deficits predict responsiveness to exercise rehabilitation.

      Design: This study is a randomized cross-over controlled intervention to take place at a
      University Balance Disorders Laboratory. The study participants will be people with
      Parkinson's disease who meet inclusion criteria for the study. The intervention will be 6
      weeks of group exercise (case) and 6 weeks of group education (control). The exercise is a
      cognitively challenging program based on the Agility Boot Camp for people with PD. The
      education program is a 6-week program to teach people how to better live with a chronic
      disease. The primary outcome measure is the MiniBESTest and the secondary outcomes are
      measures of mobility, cognition and neural imaging.

      Discussion: The results from this study will further our understanding of the relationship
      between cognition and mobility with a focus on brain circuitry as it relates to
      rehabilitation potential.

    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Subscale III is a 10-minute assessment of motor signs related to severity of PD. If the investigators have trouble recruiting subjects of similar severity in the 2 groups, they will use the Postural Instability and Gait Disability(PIGD) Subscore (Items 27-30) as a covariate in data analysis.</description>

    <description>The New FoG of Gait Questionnaire will be used to identify 'freezers' (score &gt;3). NFOGQ is a self-report measure that begins with the presentation of a short (30-s) video to illustrate FoG during walking turning and starting gait and then follows with questions related to frequency and duration of each type of FoG episode.</description>

    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire with 39 questions reflecting 8 domains of quality of life (Mobility, ADL's, Emotional well-being, Stigma, Social support, Cognition, Communication, and Bodily discomfort). Each item scores from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Subscale scores and a summary index representing the global health-related quality of life will be calculated, with higher scores representing worse quality of life. Convergent validity is very good and discriminative validity for PD severity levels has been established. The PDQ will reflect limitations to participation in community mobility.</description>

    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Activities of Balance Confidence (ABC) questionnaire consists of 16 questions about how balance confidence limits participating in the community such as riding an escalator, walking in a parking lot and replacing a light. Subjects indicate their confidence from 0% to 100% they have in their balance when they imagine doing these tasks. A score of 80% indicates an average level of physical functioning for older adults.</description>

    <description>Subjects will participate in an 80-minute, group (6 per group) exercise session led by a certified exercise trainer knowledgeable in the Agility Boot Camp-Cognitive (ABC-C) program for 3x/week for 6 weeks. The exercise protocol is an adaptation of our Agility Boot Camp (ABC) exercise program for PD. The exercises are designed as a circuit to challenge movement-skills known to be impaired in PD. Stations will include: Gait training, PWR Moves Â©, Agility course, Lunges, Boxing and Tai Chi. Each activity was chosen for its inherent focus on multi-directional movements, dynamic postural transitions, axial mobility, big movements and whole body motor sequencing. Each station (10-20 minutes) has 3 possible progression levels, based on: (1) divided attention with secondary cognitive tasks, (2) response inhibition, (3) limiting external sensory cues, and (4) increasing speed and resistance.</description>

    <description>The Education arm is a chronic disease education program to teach patients how to live better with their chronic condition. It was developed by our research team to be specific for people with Parkinson's disease. It will include content and discussion of topics such as sleep, nutrition, and medication management. Classes will consist of a group of subjects (up to 6) meeting with the trainer for 90-minute session, once a week for six weeks. In order to match dose of the education intervention with the exercise intervention, participants will be provided relaxation tapes to be used at home 5 times per week for 30 minutes for an overall education dose of 240 minutes; similar to the exercise dose.</description>
