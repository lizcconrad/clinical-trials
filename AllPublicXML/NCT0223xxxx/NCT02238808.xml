  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some breast cancers have estrogen receptors (ER+). The investigators know that some ER+
      tumours can be cured by hormone therapy alone while other ER+ breast cancers cannot.
      Currently, there is no perfect way to tell these groups apart nor do the investigators know
      why some respond when others do not.

      Research findings suggest that the two types of ER+ breast cancers differ in their response
      to estrogen with estrogen being toxic to one type and not the other. For those tumours that
      find estrogen toxic, this may explain why tumours only start to grow when estrogen levels
      decrease after menopause.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether a two-week treatment of estrogen equal to
      pre-menopausal estrogen levels will decrease the rate at which patients' ER+ tumours grow.
      This will be done by comparing the growth rate in the tissue removed during standard of care
      surgery after patients have been treated with 7-14 days of estrogen prior to that surgery.

      Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that includes two ER+ genetic subtypes (luminal A
      and luminal B) that differ in their response to treatment.

      Results from the Women's Health Initiative Trial showed that estrogen treated hysterectomized
      women with no prior history of breast cancer had a significant and persistent decrease in
      breast cancer incidence when compared to placebo treated participants. This implies that some
      ER+ breast cancers are in fact growth inhibited by estrogens and are not growth promoted.

      The hypothesis of this study is that some ER+ breast cancers (luminal A) are actually
      sensitive (growth inhibited) by estrogen.

      Objectives:

        1. To assess changes in breast cancer proliferation after a 7-14 day trial of estradiol in
           newly diagnosed estrogen receptor positive post-menopausal breast cancer patients prior
           to surgery.

        2. Exploratory analysis of biologic correlates with comparison to available genotyping
           tests.

      This is an open-label single group assignment pilot study for safety/efficacy and exploratory
      biologic correlates
