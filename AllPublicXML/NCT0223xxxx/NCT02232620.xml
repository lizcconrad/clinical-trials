  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase II study of BBI503 administered to adult patients
      with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor who have exhausted all currently approved
      standard anti-cancer treatment options. BBI503 will be administered orally, daily, in
      continuous 28-day cycles at a dose of 300 mg once daily. Cycles will be repeated until
      patients are no longer clinically benefiting from therapy due to disease progression, adverse
      events, or another discontinuation criterion.

      Safety, tolerability and efficacy of BBI503 will be assessed for the duration of study
      treatment.
