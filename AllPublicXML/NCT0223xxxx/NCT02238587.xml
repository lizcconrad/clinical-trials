  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effect of Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules on the life quality and immunity
      status of the patients with head-and-neck cancer after complete treatment (including surgery
      and / or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ganoderma is known to modulate immunity and improve health. However, the mechanism is not
      clear. We hypothesize that patients who have completed standard treatment with/without
      radiotherapy might require biological modifier such as Ganoderma to improve life quality and
      immunity status.

      A total of 100 patients are randomized to study and control groups. In study group, Ganoderma
      Spores Powder Capsules are given to the patients for 6 weeks, In control group, only placebos
      are given during the same period. Then the patients in study and control groups are switched,
      Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules and placebos are given for 6 weeks. The data pertaining to
      their Life quality are collected using Quality of Life Questionnaire after the first 6 weeks
      and the second 6 weeks. The immunity status is also studied at the same time.
