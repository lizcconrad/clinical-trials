          -  Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age of either sex or any race;

          -  Be planning to undergo unilateral cataract extraction via phacoemulsification and
             posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantation in the study eye;

          -  Have a pin-hole visual acuity (VA) &lt; 1.0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution
             (logMAR) in the operative eye and fellow eye as measured using an Early Treatment for
             Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart at Visit 1;

          -  (For females of childbearing potential) agree to have urine pregnancy testing
             performed at Visit 1 (must be negative) and at exit visit; must not be lactating; and
             must agree to use a medically acceptable form of birth control1 throughout the study
             duration. Women of childbearing potential include all females who have experienced
             menarche and have not experienced menopause (as defined by amenorrhea for greater than
             12 consecutive months) or have not undergone successful surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a known sensitivity or allergy to the class of medication of the active
             ingredient in the study medication or any of the study medication's components;

          -  Have any intraocular inflammation (e.g., white blood cells or flare) present in the
             study eye at the Visit 1slit lamp examination;

          -  Have a score greater than &quot;0&quot; on the Ocular Pain Assessment at Visit 1 or 2 in the
             study eye;

          -  Have an immunosuppressive or an autoimmune disease that in the opinion of the
             Investigator could affect intraocular inflammation or the normal healing process of
             the eye;

          -  Have active or chronic/recurrent ocular or systemic disease that is uncontrolled and
             will likely affect wound healing;

          -  Currently have suspected or known malignancy or be currently receiving antineoplastic
             therapy;

          -  Be a female who is currently pregnant, planning a pregnancy, lactating, not using a
             medically acceptable form of birth control throughout the study duration, or have a
             positive urine pregnancy test at Visit 1;

          -  Use anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics/pain relievers (including opioids, narcotics
             and other pain medications) or immunomodulating agents, systemically, or in either
             eye, and/or use medications for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), from the washout
             period through the duration of the study
