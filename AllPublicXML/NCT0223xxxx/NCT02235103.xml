  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has revealed that subtle abnormalities can be found in sperm samples that
      seem to be normal with conventional analysis techniques. The DNA in the sperm heads is
      sometimes fragmented and this may be the reason why couples with a diagnosis of unexplained
      infertility do not achieve pregnancy.

      We are planning a study to examine the incidence of DNA fragmentation in the sperm of couples
      with previously unexplained infertility. In a first treatment cycle with intra-uterine
      insemination the percentage of DNA fragmentation in sperm will be measured. Afterwards the
      results of the patients who are pregnant will be compared with those of the not pregnant
      ones. We expect to find differences between both groups.

      100 patients will be included in the study.
