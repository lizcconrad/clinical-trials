    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe and effective the combination of the study
      drugs romidepsin and lenalidomide is for treating patients with peripheral t-cell lymphoma
      (PTCL) who have not been previously treated for this cancer. Currently, there is no standard
      treatment for patients with PTCL; the most common treatment used is a combination of drugs
      called CHOP, but this can be a difficult treatment to tolerate because of side effects, and
      is not particularly effective for most patients with PTCL. Romidepsin (Istodax®) is a type of
      drug called an HDAC inhibitor. It interacts with DNA (genetic material in cells) in ways that
      can stop tumors from growing. It is given as an infusion through the veins. Lenalidomide
      (Revlimid®) is a type of drug known as an immunomodulatory drug, or IMID for short. This drug
      affects how tumor cells grow and survive, including affecting blood vessel growth in tumors.
      It is given as an oral tablet (by mouth).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of romidepsin plus lenalidomide in patients
      with previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of the combination of romidepsin and lenalidomide. II. Further
      evaluate efficacy of the combination of romidepsin and lenalidomide.

      III. Evaluate the delay to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the use of Northwestern Medicine (NM) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) vs CT imaging in PTCL.

      II. Validate a new prognostic model for newly diagnosed PTCL. III. Investigate the tumor
      immunohistochemical profile to identify potential biomarkers associated with prognosis and
      treatment response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 1 year in the absence of disease progression, inter-current illness that prevents further
      administration of treatment, unacceptable toxicity, patient decides to withdraw from study
      treatment (or study as a whole), or general or specific changes in the patient's condition
      render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of PTCL (using the most recent edition of the World
             Health Organization [WHO] Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid
             Tissues as guidance) including:

               -  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell kinase (ALK)-negative

               -  Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma

               -  Enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma

               -  Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type

               -  Hepatosplenic gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma

               -  Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified (not otherwise specified [NOS])

               -  Transformed mycosis fungoides

               -  Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.

               -  NOTE: A copy of the pathology report is sufficient to register the patient to the
                  trial; diagnosis of PTCL should have been based on identification in biopsy
                  specimens of a peripheral T-cell lymphoma disorder characterized by positivity in
                  the malignant cell population of at least 3 of the following T-cell markers:
                  betaF1, cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, and negativity
                  of at least 2 of the following B-cell markers CD19, CD20, CD79alpha and paired
                  box 5 (Pax-5); further, CD56 should be used for the diagnosis of the nasal type,
                  while CD30, ALK-1 and Pax-5 (that should be negative) are required for the
                  anaplastic type; CD10, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), programmed
                  cell death (PD)-1 and CD21 are warranted for the diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic
                  T-cell lymphoma along with Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small ribonucleic acid
                  (RNA) (EBER) in situ hybridization; determination of mindbomb E3 ubiquitin
                  protein ligase 1(Mib-1)/marker of proliferation Ki-67 (Ki-67) to be performed;
                  finally, additional markers useful within the context of anaplastic large cell
                  lymphoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell
                  lymphoma are TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA-1),
                  granzyme B and perforin; it is acknowledged that no marker has absolute lineage
                  specificity, and that immunophenotypic studies should be performed with panels of
                  monoclonal antibodies; final diagnoses containing caveats such as &quot;suspicious of&quot;
                  or &quot;presumably&quot; are considered inadequate for a patient to be enrolled in the
                  trial

               -  NOTE: Patients with adequate archived (well-preserved, formalin-fixed) biopsy
                  tissue remaining will be required to submit a portion for exploratory studies;
                  this is not optional if tissue is available; however, lack of adequate tissue for
                  exploratory studies will not preclude patients from participating

          -  Patients must have bi-dimensionally measurable disease (&gt;= 1 cm) by CT imaging

               -  NOTE: Patients with marrow-only disease are eligible; response for these patients
                  will be assessed by repeat bone marrow biopsy

          -  Patients must fit into one of the following categories:

               -  Age &gt;= 18 years to &lt; 60 years with a cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) score

               -  &gt;= 60 years

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function (documented within 14 days prior

               -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must either commit to continued
                  abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth
                  control: one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE
                  SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide, during lenalidomide
                  therapy, during dose interruptions, and for at least 28 days following
                  discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy

               -  Males receiving lenalidomide must agree to use a latex condom during any sexual
                  contact with FCBPs even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy

               -  NOTE: A FCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a
                  tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following
                  criteria:

                    -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months
