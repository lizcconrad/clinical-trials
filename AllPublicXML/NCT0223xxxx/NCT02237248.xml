    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the changes in function and performance biomechanics
      in patients undergoing spinal fusion corrective surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
      (AIS).

      Methods will consist of movement studies, questionnaires, and chart review. The recruited
      subjects will be followed at the usual clinical schedule of pre-op, 6-week, 3 -, 6- and
      12-month post-operative follow-up visits. After signing informed consent, age at time of
      surgery, height, weight, body composition, leg length will be recorded to be used during data
      processing. Chart review will further yield data on Cobb angle, Lenke Scoliosis
      classification, instrumentation used during surgery, and level of spinal fusion. All subjects
      will be asked to complete assessments of activity level (Marx Score, Tegner Activity Score),
      general health (EQ-5D), and a validated scoliosis survey (Scoliosis Research Study
      questionnaire SRS-22). Movement studies will consist of the Lower Quarter Y Balance Test
      (YBT-LQ), and Functional Movement Screen (FMS), and measures of forward flexion, right and
      left lateral bending, and right and left trunk rotation. These measures will be assessed
      preoperatively and at postoperative follow-up visits.

    <measure>Change in Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test (YBT-LQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively; 6wks, 3mos, 6mos, and 12mos Postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The YBT-LQ is a test of dynamic balance in unilateral stance that has been deemed to be reliable and valid. The YBT-LQ consists of each patient standing on one leg and reaching as far as they can with their non-stance leg in the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral direction while standing on the other foot on a centralized stance platform.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Movement Screen (FMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively; 6wks, 3mos, 6mos, and 12mos Postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The FMS is a screening tool used to identify limitations or asymmetries in movement patterns by executing seven motions. Activities include a deep squat, lunges, hurdle steps, a push-up, straight-leg raises, shoulder mobility assessments, and rotary stability assessments.</description>
