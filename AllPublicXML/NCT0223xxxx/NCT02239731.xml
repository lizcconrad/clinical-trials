      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of FDX104
      Antibiotic Foam in the prevention of EGFRI skin toxicity in cancer patients receiving
      Cetuximab or Panitumumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter, randomized, double blind, vehicle controlled clinical study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Doxycycline Foam 4% for the prevention
      of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition Skin Toxicity, to Subjects with Cancer
      Receiving Cetuximab or Panitumumab on a weekly or every 2 weeks basis.

      The study consists of a screening visit, a treatment period where patients will be treated
      topically on the face twice daily for 5 weeks. A post-treatment follow up visit (4 weeks
      after end of treatment), will be performed only for subjects who have experienced unresolved
      possibly-related or related adverse events at the end of the treatment. Seven days after
      randomization and study drug initiation, subjects will start their EGFRI treatment.

         10. Any clinically significant finding on the physical examination that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk if the subject were to
             participate in the study

         11. Systemic lupus erythematosus

         12. Undergoing any current biological treatment for cancer other than the prescribed EGFRI
