  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see whether wearing a weighted vest during a period
      of active weight loss can decrease the loss of muscle and bone that occurs during weight
      loss. We will also determine if study participants who wear the weighted vest will have
      greater improvements in physical function and self-reported disability, pain, stiffness,
      fatigue and quality of life. This knowledge could impact weight loss programs designed for
      older adults.

      Hypothesis: Participants randomized to VEST will experience similar weight loss, but less
      loss of lean mass and bone density, than participants randomized to Control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The loss of muscle mass and bone density during weight loss is partially attributed to the
      decrease in mechanical stress on these tissues as weight is reduced. As a result, performing
      exercises that enhance muscle and gravitational loading during the period of caloric
      restriction usually diminishes the relative amount of muscle and bone loss for a given weight
      loss, but these interventions do not fully prevent all muscle and bone loss.In addition,
      conventional exercise training interventions often require expensive equipment, on-site
      participation, and, ideally for older, obese adults, safety supervision by trained exercise
      leaders. Moreover, the exercises performed may not fully translate into improvement in daily
      tasks due to training specificity, and are not always tolerated or sustained, especially in
      obese persons with OA. On the other hand, it is conceivable that treating the decrease in
      mechanical load from weight loss by externally replacing lost weight via use of a weighted
      vest may also be effective for reducing muscle and bone loss during caloric restriction. In
      animal models, mechanisms regulating skeletal tissue structure and function respond in a
      similar fashion to increases in actual or externally-added body mass. Also, research shows
      that exercising while wearing weighted vests can improve bone density, muscle mass, and lower
      extremity strength in older adults. However, no prior studies have examined the effects of
      weighted vest use on muscle mass and bone density during a period of intentional weight loss.

      The main objective of this pilot study is to assess feasibility (accrual, retention,
      compliance) of daily use of a weighted vest during a diet intervention, to estimate the
      variability of outcome measures, and to obtain preliminary estimates of treatment efficacy. A
      controlled, randomized design will be used so we can obtain a realistic estimate of accrual
      and an unbiased estimate of treatment efficacy.

      A total of 36 older (age=65-79 yrs), obese (BMI=30-40 kg/m2), sedentary men and women with
      x-ray evidence of knee OA will undergo a 22 week weight loss intervention (targeting 10%
      weight loss) with randomization to one of two groups (n=18/grp): 1) No vest use (Control); or
      2) Progressive weighted vest use during normal daily activities (VEST).

    <description>Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS) is a self-administered 10 item assessment. It asks participants to rate the level of physical and mental fatigue they experience or imagine after completing a set of hypothetical activities related to daily life at a fixed intensity and duration. The participant provides a score from 0-5 where &quot;0' equals no fatigue at all, and &quot;5&quot; equals extreme fatigue.</description>

    <description>SPPB is a measure of lower-extremity function consisting of walking speed, balance, and repeated chair stands. These 3 performance measures are scored from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest level of performance and 0 the inability to complete the task, with a summary score of 0-12.The SPPB has been shown to have predictive validity showing a gradient of risk for mortality, nursing home admission, and disability.</description>

        <title>Changes in Self-report on Fatigue Using Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS)</title>
        <description>Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS) is a self-administered 10 item assessment. It asks participants to rate the level of physical and mental fatigue they experience or imagine after completing a set of hypothetical activities related to daily life at a fixed intensity and duration. The participant provides a score from 0-5 where &quot;0' equals no fatigue at all, and &quot;5&quot; equals extreme fatigue.</description>

        <title>Changes in Lower Extremity Physical Function</title>
        <description>SPPB is a measure of lower-extremity function consisting of walking speed, balance, and repeated chair stands. These 3 performance measures are scored from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest level of performance and 0 the inability to complete the task, with a summary score of 0-12.The SPPB has been shown to have predictive validity showing a gradient of risk for mortality, nursing home admission, and disability.</description>

            <description>All participants will undergo a 22 week dietary weight loss. In addition, participants will be asked to wear a weighted vest for &gt;10 hours a day. Weight in the vest is adjusted to match weight lost during the intervention.
Vest: light weight, adjustable, vest to be worn underneath clothes that weight can be added to
Diet: Participants will undergo a 22 week dietary weight loss intervention which will incorporate dietary practices for achieving weight loss while minimizing muscle and bone loss. Participants will be instructed by the Registered Dietitian to follow a low calorie diet. Individual calorie goals will be adjusted during the study if necessary to achieve a targeted weight loss goal of at least 8%, but no more than 12%, within the intervention time frame.</description>
