      Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a rare primary immunodeficiency dieases (PID), is
      poorly characterized in mainland China. We meant to explore the patients with SCID refered to
      our hospital and summarize their clinical manifestations and genetic features.

      Diagnostic criteria were based on recommendations by the Pan-American Group for
      Immunodeficiency and the European Society for Immunodeficiencies, which included failure to
      thrive, persistent diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, and oral candidiasis, or Pneumocystis
      pneumonia, severe bacterial infections, and disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)
      infection during the first 2 to 7 months of life. In addition, patients included in the study
      were &lt;2 years of age, with either transplacentally acquired maternal T cells or &lt;20 % CD3+ T
      cells, the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt;3000/mm3. Exclusion criteria include HIV
      infection, congenital rubella, DiGeorge syndrome, Zap70 deficiency, Cartilage hair
      hypoplasia, PNP deficiency and MHC class II deficiency.
