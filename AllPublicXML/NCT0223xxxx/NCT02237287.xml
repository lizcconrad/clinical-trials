      Background: The wound healing promoting effect of negative wound pressure therapies (NWPT)
      takes place at the wound foam interface. Implementation of bioactive substances at this site
      represents a major research area for the development of future NWPT devices.

      Methods: Wound healing kinetics of pressure ulcers treated by vacuum assisted closure devices
      with or without the implementation of a thin interface of poly-N-acetyl glucosamine
      nanofibers (sNAG) was studied in a prospective randomized clinical trial.

  <why_stopped>
    Open label study part reduced from n=10 to n=6 because of insufficient number of patients under
    antiaggregation.
