  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to assess the value of an emergency department-based intervention
      to reduce hazardous alcohol use among older adults. We hypothesize that the intervention will
      result in a 25% reduction in the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use while the control group
      will only have a 5% reduction.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to perform a pilot, randomized, controlled trial of a brief
      intervention and referral for treatment among older adults in the emergency department (ED)
      with alcohol misuse. The pilot data would then be used to design a larger study. The
      intervention for this trial will consist of a Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) with a
      stratified referral for further treatment, compared with usual care. The BNI is a
      standardized, well-described intervention that has been implemented in a broad range of
      clinical settings but has not been specifically tested in older adults in the ED. Following
      the BNI, we will provide a referral for further care for the patient that is stratified by
      severity of alcohol misuse. Patients with hazardous or harmful alcohol use will follow-up
      with a primary care physician; patients with alcohol abuse or dependence will follow-up with
      an outpatient alcohol and substance abuse program; those at risk for complicated withdrawal
      will be recommended for inpatient treatment. In all cases we will contact the referral
      physician to help transition the patient's care, and ensure the patient receives a consistent
      message regarding their alcohol use across the different care settings.

    <description>This group will not receive a brief intervention in the ED. They will receive a pamphlet with general health information for older adults, as well as contact information for an outpatient alcohol treatment center where they have the option to follow-up for alcohol treatment at their discretion. The patient's readiness to change their alcohol habits will be measured using a 1-10 scale with a visual cue.</description>

    <description>The BNI will follow standard steps (7, 63): 1. The research assistant (RA) will ask permission to discuss the patient's alcohol use with them. 2. They will provide feedback regarding the patient's alcohol use, and will review guidelines drinking in older adults. Where relevant, the RA will discuss how the patient's current visit may relate to their alcohol use. 3. The RA will assess the patient's readiness to change using a 1-10 scale, and will enhance motivation. 4. The RA will negotiate a goal for the patient's drinking and give advice. The patient will be asked to sign a drinking agreement.</description>
