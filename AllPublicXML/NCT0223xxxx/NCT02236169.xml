        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric
        criteria:

          -  Patients must have a stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an Forced
             Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) &lt;=65% of predicted normal and FEV1 &lt;=70% of
             Forced vital capacity (FVC)

               -  Males: Predicted Normal FEV1 = 0.093 (height in inches)-0.032 (age)-1.343

               -  Females: Predicted Normal FEV1 = 0.085 (height in inches)-0.025(age)-1.692

          -  Male or female age 40 years or older

          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A pack-year is
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes (20 cigarettes) per day
             for a year

          -  Patients must be able to satisfactorily administer the medication, perform pulmonary
             function tests (PFTs) and maintain records during the study period as required in the
             protocol

          -  All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial
             (i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications and prior to
             fasting for laboratory tests)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease with may
             influence the results of the study or patients ability to participate in the study

          -  Patients with clinically relevant baseline hematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis.
             If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion the patient is
             excluded

          -  All patients with serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt;80 IU/L, serum
             glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &gt;80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dl, or creatinine
             &gt;2.0 mg/dl will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory
             evaluation will be not be conducted in these patients

          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a blood
             eosinophil count above 600/mm3. A repeat eosinophil count will be not be conducted in
             these patients

          -  Patients with a recent (i.e., one year or less) history of myocardial infarction

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of cardiac failure,
             patients with cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy, patients receiving any systemic
             beta-blockers and patients on chronic daytime oxygen therapy

          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis

          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last 5 years. Patients with treated basal
             cell carcinoma are allowed

          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis

          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history of thoracotomy for other reason should be evaluated per exclusion criterion
             No.1

          -  Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks
             prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs

          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction

          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma

          -  Patients who are on cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium

          -  Patients who are on antihistamines

          -  Pregnant or nursing women and women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception (e.g., oral contraceptive, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm or Norplant®)

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within 1 month or 6 half-lives
             (whichever is longer) of the drug prior to the screening visit or patients currently
             enrolled in another research study

          -  Patients with a history of and/or active alcohol or drug abuse
