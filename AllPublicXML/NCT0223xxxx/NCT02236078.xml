    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) must be treated with second-line drugs (SLD) that
      are less effective, more toxic, and more expensive. Treatment requires at least 20 months
      with 4 or more effective drugs based on timely drug susceptibility test (DST) results.
      However, there are many examples of closely related drugs with differing antimicrobial
      activities.

      Labs have found differences in DST results among the rifamycins, rifampin (RMP) and rifabutin
      (RBT); the fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and moxifloxacin; and the second-line injectable
      agents, kanamycin, amikacin, and capreomycin. In a related finding, isolates resistant to 0.2
      mcg/ml INH may be susceptible to higher concentrations. In the Preserving Effective
      Tuberculosis Treatment Study (PETTS), 32% of RMP-resistant isolates were susceptible to RBT,
      41% of kanamycin-resistant isolates were susceptible to capreomycin, and 45% of isolates
      resistant to 0.2 mcg/ml INH were susceptible to 1.0 or 5.0 mcg/ml (1). Other studies have
      demonstrated differences in DST results between moxifloxacin and ofloxacin. Whether these in
      vitro results translate into clinical efficacy is completely unknown. Given the severely
      limited treatment options in MDR TB, it would be exceedingly useful to know whether these in
      vitro results translate into evidence for clinically meaningful treatment decisions.

      The investigators will determine the clinical bactericidal activity of certain antibiotics
      against M. tb that appear to be effective in vitro even though closely related drugs from the
      same class are ineffective in vitro. Further, the investigators propose to determine the
      molecular genetic determinants of these differences.

      Specifically, we plan to determine:

        1. The bactericidal activity of RBT in patients whose baseline DST results demonstrate
           susceptibility to RBT and resistance to RMP.

        2. The bactericidal activity of high-dose INH in patients whose baseline DST results
           demonstrate susceptibility to high concentrations of INH and resistance to low
           concentrations of INH.

        3. The bactericidal activity of RMP when an approved molecular assay demonstrates genetic
           mutations associated with RMP resistance, but the phenotypic testing demonstrates
           susceptibility to RMP.

        4. The bactericidal activity of moxifloxacin in patients whose baseline DST results
           demonstrate susceptibility to moxifloxacin and resistance to ofloxacin.

        5. The bactericidal activity of amikacin and capreomycin in patients whose baseline DST
           results demonstrate susceptibility to either of these two drugs and resistance to
           kanamycin.

        6. The genetic mutations associated with both in vivo and in vitro drug resistance and
           bactericidal activity.

      To achieve these objectives the investigators propose an innovative variation on early
      bactericidal activity (EBA) study methodology. Patients at risk for MDR TB will be screened
      for RMP resistance and INH resistance using molecular assays. In those with RMP-resistant or
      INH-resistant TB, the investigators will quickly perform phenotypic DSTs using the direct
      method in the Bactec Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system, so results will
      be available within 14-21 days. If the DST results show, for example, RMP resistance but
      susceptibility to RBT, consenting patients will be treated with RBT by itself for 10 days.
      The investigators will assess its effect with serial quantitative sputum cultures. If the
      concentration of viable bacteria decreases significantly, the investigators will interpret
      this to mean the drug is having an effect. If not, the drug is ineffective. After 10 days,
      the patients will resume individualized multidrug treatment based on the full set of DST
      results.

      In case the investigators identify drugs that are effective under these conditions, the
      investigators will sequence known and putative genes associated with the action of these
      drugs for the mycobacterial isolates from these patients.

      The results would have immediate implications for treatment of MDR TB and for diagnostic
      mycobacteriology.
