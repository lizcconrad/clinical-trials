  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable variation in the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
      across Europe. The likelihood of attempted resuscitation also varies. To better understand
      the factors that contribute to variation, more data on incidence, management and outcomes
      from OHCA is required. A European, multi-centre study provides the opportunity to uncover
      differences throughout Europe and may help find explanations for these differences. Results
      may also have potential to support the development of quality benchmarking between European
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS).

      This prospective European study will involve 27 different countries. It provides a common
      Utstein-based dataset, data collection methodology and a common data collection period for
      all participants, thereby potentially increasing comparability.

      Study research questions will address the following: OHCA incidence in different European
      regions; incidence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempted; initial presenting
      rhythm in patients where bystanders or EMS starts CPR or any other resuscitation
      intervention; rate of any return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); patient status at
      handover to a hospital i.e. ROSC, ongoing CPR, dead; incidence of patients still alive 30
      days after OHCA; incidence of patients discharged alive from hospital.

      The participating registries will transfer unprocessed anonymised data. Transmission of
      aggregated data should be avoided whenever possible; only in case of limitations due to
      national laws or ethical requirements should a participating registry transmit aggregated
      data. Every single case requires a data sheet (DS). Data will be collected within the
      national, regional or local participating registries (either as a computer-based export from
      the national, regional or local registry or as a paper-based DS. After validation and
      anonymisation of data by participating registries the data will then be transferred only via
      the national coordinator (computer-based) to the study centre. National coordinators are
      responsible for quality control i.e. the completeness reliability and accuracy of the of
      data, including timely submission of data to the study management group. Every DS will be
      identified by a unique number, including the country and region of origin. Registries that
      cannot transfer unprocessed original data due to the reasons mentioned above will collect
      data themselves. These registries will then send aggregated data to the study centre.
      Participating registries must collect basic EMS data on the region and population served.
      This registry-specific information must only be transmitted once during the study period.
      Data (computer and paper-based) will be handled according to national laws concerning data
      security; the national coordinator is responsible for maintaining the necessary standards.
      Access to the data will be protected by username and password.
