      To assess if oral nizatidine or lisinopril alone and in combination will increase heme
      oxygenase 1 (HO-1) protein concentration and activity compared to placebo in healthy
      subjects.

    <textblock>
      Current therapeutic options for gastroparesis are limited to dietary modifications and
      pharmacological (i.e., prokinetic and symptomatic) agents. Exciting and novel preliminary
      data from our programs demonstrate that (i) reduced expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is
      responsible for loss of interstitial cells of Cajal and delayed gastric emptying in non-obese
      diabetic (NOD) mice, (ii) upregulation of (HO-1) reverses delayed gastric emptying in this
      model, perhaps by generating carbon monoxide (CO), which has anti-apoptotic and
      cytoprotective actions, and may relax smooth muscle, and (iii) hemin upregulates HO-1 in
      humans. However, hemin is exorbitant and can only be administered intravenously. A large
      throughput screening assay uncovered that the histamine H2 receptor antagonist nizatidine and
      the ACE inhibitor lisinopril upregulate HO-1 in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells. Hence,
      this double-blind placebo-controlled study will randomly assign 24 healthy subjects to one of
      4 arms, and HO-1 protein activity and concentration will be assessed.

    <description>Heme oxygenase (HO-1) degrades heme and protects against oxidative stress. When HO-1 is induced, more heme is removed, and end products of heme metabolism (i.e., carbon monoxide, iron, and bilirubin) are generated. HO-1 activity was measured by a blood test, the units are pmol bilirubin/mg/h.</description>
