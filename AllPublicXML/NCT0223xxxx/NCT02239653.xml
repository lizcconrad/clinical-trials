      Objective: to test the hypothesis that an intervention comprised of targeted physician and
      print messages can influence parents to reduce the amount of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB)
      and fruit juice they give to their children 1 - 12 years of age.

      The study will be conducted through a practice-based research network of community pediatric
      practices. Participating sites will be randomized to the intervention or control condition
      (usual care) using a pre-specified randomization scheme derived using computer generated
      random numbers. The intervention sites will participate in a 30-minute training for using the
      &quot;Milk. Water. Period&quot; intervention (brochures, posters, key talking points and phone
      messages) in their office. The goal is for them to discuss beverage consumption and encourage
      &quot;Milk. Water. Period&quot; for all children 12 months to 12 years old (not yet reached their 13th
      birthday) at their checkup visit. The primary care provider (PCP) will use the talking points
      to facilitate the discussion about drink milk and water only and will give a brochure to each
      family. Assessments will be by telephone interview of the parent 2 to 4 weeks after a
      check-up visit for the index child.
