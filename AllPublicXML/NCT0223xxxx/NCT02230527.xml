      This is a single center, prospective, randomized, unblinded, open-label, active controlled
      pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor plus aspirin versus clopidogrel
      plus aspirin in patients with Rutherford Stage IV to VI PAD that have undergone a
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the lower extremities in the past 2 weeks.

      Enrollment into the study will require severe symptomatic CLI without wounds (Rutherford
      Stage IV) or CLI with concomitant vascular insufficiency wounds (Rutherford Stage V-VI PAD).

      Potential participants will be identified and screened prior to discharge or at the time of
      the first out-patient visit (within 2 weeks after discharge) after a percutaneous lower
      extremity arterial angiography with arterial intervention (stent or balloon angioplasty) for
      the presence of lower extremity vascular insufficiency. Participants will be classified as
      Rutherford Class IV - VI (with or without ulcerations). A total of 60 patients will be
      randomized into 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (ticagrelor to clopidogrel). Patients are
      placed on clopidogrel after their arterial intervention per standard of care. They will
      remain on clopidogrel up to the time that randomization occurs. For patients that are
      randomized to ticagrelor, the clopidogrel will be stopped.

      Patients will be randomized to either ticagrelor 90mg by mouth twice daily or clopidogrel
      75mg by mouth daily.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults age 18-100 years with Rutherford Classification Stage IV through VI PAD with a
             recent percutaneous lower extremity arterial angiography with arterial intervention in
             the past 2 weeks

          2. Willingness to sign informed consent

          3. Ability to return for follow up visits

          4. A female patient of childbearing potential who is sexually active must agree to use
             adequate contraception from screening until 30 days after receiving the last dose of
             study drug. Women not of childbearing potential are defined as those who have
             surgically sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or who
             are post menopausal (defined as at least 2 years since last regular menses). The
             female patient should not be lactating and must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be ineligible for this study if they meet any one of the following criteria:

          1. Intolerance to thienopyridines

          2. Hypersensitivity to ticagrelor or any component of the product.

          3. Concomitant use of oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonist, factor Xa
             inhibitor, or direct thrombin inhibitor

          4. History of intracranial hemorrhage

          5. History of severe hepatic impairment defined by baseline transaminase greater than or
             equal to 3x ULN or any elevation in bilirubin

          6. Active bleeding

          7. Allergy to aspirin

          8. Baseline TcPO2 &lt; 10 mmHg post angiography

          9. Resting, pre- procedure heart rate &lt;50 beats-per-minute without a permanent pacemaker
             and not on an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent

         10. Severe COPD on home oxygen therapy -
