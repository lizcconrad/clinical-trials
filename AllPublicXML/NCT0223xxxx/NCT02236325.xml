    <textblock>
      A significant percentage of individuals who die by suicide do not seek mental health services
      in the time preceding their death. This population is underserved and it is unclear what
      barriers keep them from seeking treatment. In order to begin a line of research aimed at
      addressing this high-risk population, this proposal rests on the hypothesis that suicidal
      individuals who do not seek treatment prior to attempting suicide experience the same
      psychopathological difficulties as suicidal individuals who do seek treatment - namely,
      severe emotion dysregulation. However, these non-treatment-seeker s will likely require more
      creative recruitment strategies and briefer interventions than treatment-seeking individuals.
      As such, this application proposes to use wide-reaching recruitment efforts throughout the
      community to locate and enroll individuals who are suicidal but not seeking treatment.
      Further, there is a paucity of empirical support for interventions targeting suicidal
      individuals. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is one of the few treatments that have been
      demonstrated to be effective with a suicidal population and is the only treatment whose
      effectiveness has been replicated. Previous research has suggested that an abbreviated
      version of the skills that are taught in DBT skills training have effectively reduced emotion
      dysregulation (i.e., depression and anxiety) in problem drinkers and the format of the
      proposed intervention is derived from this evidence-based emotion dysregulation intervention.
      As such, the proposed research is a randomized, controlled pilot trial of a very brief,
      one-time, skills-based intervention targeting difficulties in emotion regulation and distress
      tolerance.

      This research aims to evaluate the safety of the intervention, the feasibility of the
      research methods (including the appropriateness of the relaxation training control
      condition), and to preliminarily estimate the immediate (one week) and long-term (one and
      three month) changes resulting from the DBT Brief Skills Intervention (DBT-BSI) relative to a
      relaxation training control on the primary outcomes of suicide ideation and emotion
      dysregulation as well as a number of secondary outcomes. These results will inform the design
      of a subsequent full-scale randomized controlled trial of the DBT-BSI.
