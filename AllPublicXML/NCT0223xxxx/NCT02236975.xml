  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized 1:1, single blind trial using BuMA Supreme versus
      Resolute Integrity conducted in approximately 14 interventional cardiology centers in The
      Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Portugal.

      Clinical follow-up will occur at 1, 9 and 12 months post-stent implantation. All patients
      will undergo repeat angiography at 9 months follow-up. QCA assessment will be performed at
      baseline (pre- and post-procedure) and at 9 months follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is at least 18 years of age.

          2. Clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive territorial functional
             study.

          3. Documented stable angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
             Classification 1, 2, 3 or 4) or unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia
             (Braunwald Class IB-C, IIB-C, or IIIB-C), or documented silent ischemia

          4. The patient has a planned intervention of a single de-novo lesion in one or two

          6. The visually estimated target lesion must be able to be covered by a single BuMA
             Supreme stent or a single Resolute Integrity stent (for available sizes refer to
             tables 1 and 2, page 20 and 21).

          7. The target lesion reference diameter must be visually estimated to be ≥2.5 mm and ≤4.5
             mm in diameter.

          8. Written informed consent.

          9. The patient agrees to the follow-up visits including a 9 month angiographic follow-up.

         10. Patient must have completed the follow-up phase of any previous study.

             12 months). Subjects with age &lt;50 who underwent tubal ligation, ovariectomy or
             hysterectomy can be included.

          2. Evidence of ongoing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in ECG and/or elevated cardiac
             biomarkers (according to local standard hospital practice) have not returned within
             normal limits at the time of procedure

          3. Patient suffered from stroke/TIA during the last 6 months.

          4. LVEF &lt;30%

          5. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;400,000 cells/mm3, a WBC of &lt;3,000 cells/mm3, or
             documented or suspected liver disease (including laboratory evidence of hepatitis)

          6. Known renal insufficiency (e.g. serum creatinine &gt;2.5mg/dL, or creatinine clearance
             ≤30 mL/min), or subject on dialysis, or acute kidney failure (as per physician
             judgment).

          7. Patient undergoing planned surgery within 6 months with the necessity to stop DAPT.

          8. Patient requiring oral anticoagulation (Coumadin, Novel Oral Anticoagulant (NOAC))

          9. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

         10. The patient is a recipient of a heart transplant

         11. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, antiplatelet
             medication specified for use in the study, sirolimus, zotarolimus, or cobalt-chromium.

         12. Other medical illness (e.g. cancer, stroke with neurological deficiency) or known
             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) as per physician judgment
             that may cause non-compliance with the protocol or confound the data interpretation or
             is associated with a limited life expectancy

         13. The patient is simultaneously participating in another investigational device or drug
             study
