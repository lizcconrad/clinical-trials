  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) is produced only in small ovarian follicles with quite stable
      levels during the cycle. There is not yet sufficient data to inform couples undergoing IVF
      about the effect of ovarian stimulation on the levels of AMH due to the increasing size of
      follicles and chances of success of the method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing IVF will be included in the study. All patients will be counseled
      regarding their prognosis. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) will be measured prior to the
      initiation of IVF and during ovarian stimulation. Patients will be stimulated with a short
      GnRH-antagonist protocol. All women will have measurements of serum FSH and estradiol (E2)
      and a pelvic sonogram on the second day of their cycle. Ovarian stimulation will be initiated
      with of gonadotropins either in the form of a combination of highly purified urinary FSH and
      LH or with a combination of Rec FSH and Rec LH. The dose of gonadotropins will depend on the
      levels of estradiol and FSH prior stimulation. All patients will be re-evaluated on day 3 and
      5 of the stimulation (measurment of AMH, E2 and pelvic sonogram), and dosage adjustments will
      be made and the antagonists (Cetrorelix or ganirelix 0.25 mg/day) will be initiated on day 5.
      Measurment of AMH, E2 and pelvic sonogram to conferm the size of follicles will be continue
      every second day untill the oocyte retrieval. When at least 2 follicles reach an average
      diameter of 17 mm, final oocyte maturation will be triggered with 10,000IU of hCG ( Pregnyl,
      Organon, Greece Inc.). Oocyte retrieval will be performed 34 to 36 hours later. Patients with
      successful fertilization will have embryo transfer under sonographic guidance on day 3 after
      retrieval.
