  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of Electrical Impedance
      Tomography (EIT) as a bedside diagnostic tool for lung pathologies in patients who are
      mechanically ventilated. In electrical impedance tomography low amplitude, low frequency
      current is applied on electrodes, and the resulting voltage is measured and used to computed
      the electrical properties of the interior of the chest as they change in time. The computed
      properties are used to form an image, which can then be used for monitoring and diagnosis.

      The goal of this study is to characterize the ability of the electrical impedance tomography
      system (hardware and software) to distinguish between lung pathologies by assessing the
      sensitivity and specificity as well as the overall agreement with the CT scan in terms of
      spatial resolution. The study will test, as well as refine, the mathematical algorithms
      needed to create meaningful outputs on adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation and
      who also have received or will be receiving a CT scan as part of their standard of care.
