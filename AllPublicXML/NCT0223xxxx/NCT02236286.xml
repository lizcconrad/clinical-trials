  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will relate our new quantification of Freezing of Gait (FoG) in Parkinson's
      disease, using body worn inertial sensors (Aim I), with abnormalities in state-of-the-art,
      resting state, functional brain connectivity (Aim II), and determine the number of subjects
      needed for a future, randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of our novel, Agility
      Boot Camp (ABC) rehabilitation intervention for FoG (Aim III). The technological approaches
      to these aims are cutting edge and will allow us to develop sensitive behavioral and brain
      biomarkers for gait disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) for use in future clinical trials.

    <measure>Change in Freezing of Gait Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Quantify amount of freezing in the legs ('trembling of knees'), defined as the square of the total power in the 3-8 Hz band, divided by the square of the total power in the 0.5-3 Hz band.</description>

    <measure>Change in the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOGQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The NFOGQ will be used to identify 'freezers' (score &gt; 3). It is a self-report measure that begins with the presentation of a short video to illustrate FoG during walking, turning and starting gait and then follows with questions related to frequency and duration of each type of FoG episode.</description>

    <measure>Change in PDQ-39 score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) has 39 questions reflecting eight domains of quality of life (Mobility, Activities of Daily Living, Emotional well-being, Stigma, Social Support, Cognition, Communication, and Bodily Discomfort). Each item scores from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Subscale scores and a summary index representing the global health-related quality of life will be calculated, with higher scores representing worse quality of life. Convergent validity is very good and discriminative validity for PD severity levels have been established. The PDQ-39 will reflect limitations to participation in community mobility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activities of Balance Confidence (ABC) Questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>ABC questionnaire consists of 16 questions about how balance confidence limits participating in the community such as riding an escalator or walking in a crowded area, Subjects indicate their confidence from 0 - 100% in being able to complete each of the tasks. A score of 80% indicates an average level of physical functioning for older adults.</description>

    <measure>Change in instrumented gait and balance measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Gait: Walking metrics will be collected during short (7 meter, 180Â° turn, 7 meter) and long (2 minutes) walks.
Instrumented Brief BESTest - another variation of the BESTest (Balance Evaluation - Systems Test) that will be administered with inertial sensors to quantify the important metrics of the test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mini-BESTest score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The mini-BESTest assesses dynamic balance via a 14-item test that measure multiple domains of balance including anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, and dynamic gait.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in UPDRS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Motor Subscale is a 10-minute assessment of motor signs related to severity of PD. If the investigators have trouble recruiting subjects of similar severity in the 2 groups (PD Freezers and Non-Freezers, then they will use the Postural Instability and Gait Disability (PIGD) Subscore as a covariate in data analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change in locomotor neural network functional connectivity strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in resting state blood oxygen level dependent neural signal synchronization between Supplementary Motor Area and Mesencephalic locomotor region across 3 time points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SCOPA-COG score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three timepoints; baseline, 6 weeks (after Arm 1), 12 weeks (after Arm 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-cognition (SCOPA-COG) is an instrument that was designed to assess the specific 'frontal-subcortical' cognitive deficits found in Parkinson's disease. The scale, consisting of 10 items, covers the following domains: memory and recall (verbal recall, digit span backward, and indicate cubes), attention (counting backward, months backward), executive function (fist-edge-palm, semantic fluency, and dice), visual-spatial functions (assembly pattern), and memory (delayed recall). The score ranges from 0-43 points with higher scores reflecting better performance.</description>

    <description>Subjects will participate in a 90-minute, group (6 per group) exercise session 3 days per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions). The theoretical basis for our novel Agility Boot Camp (ABC) exercise program is based on research that identified the primary neurophysiological and cognitive constraints that limits balance and mobility in PD. The exercises are designed as a circuit with several types of movement-skills specifically focused on improving different postural domains with cognitive challenges such as memorized sequences and dual tasking.</description>

    <description>Subjects will also receive (cross-over) six weeks of educational classes. The Education program will teach subjects, chronic disease self-management - how to live better with their parkinsonism. Classes will consist of 6 subjects per group meeting for 90 minute sessions, once a week for six weeks. Subject will do an additional 120 minutes of relaxation at home/week.</description>
