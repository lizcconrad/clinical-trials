  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) robustly predicts anger and aggression, and U.S.
      Iraq/Afghanistan-era combat Veterans report that treatment for anger and aggression is among
      their top priorities. PTSD-related anger and aggression are associated with profound
      functional impairments, yet to date there are no empirically-supported treatments for
      Veterans with PTSD and aggression. Effective group treatment programs could improve
      functioning and facilitate community reintegration for these Veterans. Given that anger
      impedes progress in treatment of PTSD symptoms, group anger treatment could also improve
      Veterans' capacity to benefit from individually-administered empirically-supported therapy
      for PTSD such as prolonged exposure or cognitive processing therapy.

      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) robustly predicts anger and aggression (Olatunji,
      Ciesielski, &amp; Tolin, 2010), and U.S. Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans report that controlling
      anger and aggressive urges are primary readjustment concerns (Sayer et al, 2010).
      Trauma-related anger and aggression are associated with functional impairments that
      significantly limit community reintegration (Rodriguez, Holowka, &amp; Marx, 2012) and that may
      persist for decades (Koenen et al, 2003). As more troops return from multiple deployments to
      Iraq and Afghanistan, there is an urgent and growing need for the development and testing of
      psychosocial treatment for anger and aggression in combat Veterans with PTSD. VA clinicians
      are doing their best to be responsive to Veteran's needs by offering anger management
      treatment to Veterans: A survey of clinical practices within the VA found that 35-65% of VA
      PTSD specialists report providing anger management to their patients (Rosen et al., 2004).
      Yet to date only one randomized clinical trial (RCT), published in 1997, has investigated the
      efficacy of treatment of anger and aggression in Veterans with PTSD (Chemtob et al., 1997).

      A recent review noted that most researchers who have examined the effects of anger management
      interventions have not done so as part of a systematic program of research (DiGiuseppe and
      Tafrate, 2003). The proposed CDA-2 application outlines Training and Mentoring Plans that
      will provide the applicant with the foundation to establish a career systematically
      developing, testing, and refining treatments for PTSD-related anger and aggression in
      Veterans. The following specific Training Goals have been formulated: 1) To acquire the
      advanced skills in the development and evaluation of clinical interventions necessary to
      begin an independent research career within the VA; 2) To develop greater expertise in
      delivery of behavioral interventions to improve functional outcomes and community
      reintegration in Veterans with PTSD, anger problems, and aggression; 3) To acquire expertise
      in the development and evaluation of treatment innovations to help Veterans generalize
      treatment gains beyond the therapy setting; 4) To increase understanding of rehabilitation
      theory and methods in treatment practices and research; and 5) To achieve critical
      professional development milestones, including submission of a Merit Review proposal based on
      the pilot data generated from the CDA-2 project.

      The Research Plan proposes a pilot feasibility trial for an RCT of Cognitive-Behavioral
      Therapy for Anger and Aggression in Combat Veterans with PTSD (CBT-A). CBT-A is a 12-week
      manualized group treatment protocol that has been designed to address the specific needs of
      combat Veterans whose PTSD-related anger and aggression interfere with effective community
      reintegration. The group was implemented with 4 male Vietnam Veterans with severe
      combat-related PTSD who were referred for anger management treatment, and preliminary data
      were promising. The active comparison treatment for the pilot RCT will be group
      Present-Centered Therapy (PCT), a manualized treatment for PTSD that controls for treatment
      time, social support, and instillation of hope. The proposed research project will address
      the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Characterize the differential effects of group CBT-A and
      group PCT on anger, aggression, and anger/aggression-related limitations to psychosocial
      functioning and community reintegration in combat Veterans with PTSD; and Aim 2: Evaluate
      study feasibility and treatment delivery procedures of an RCT comparing CBT-A to a PCT
      comparison condition. The results generated will guide the design of a full RCT to be funded
      by the end of the CDA-2 funding period. The research, training, and mentoring plans outlined
      here will provide the foundation for the PI's independent research career developing a
      systematic program of research in the treatment of anger and aggression among combat Veterans
      with PTSD. The availability of empirically-supported anger treatment would benefit the many
      Veterans with PTSD who return from combat reporting problems with anger and aggression.

    <measure>Slope of the change in scores on the Community Reintegration of Service Members Computer Adaptive Test (CRIS-CAT) over 4 time points</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment (12 weeks), 3 months post-treatment (48 weeks), and 6 months post-treatment (84 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CRIS-CAT is a computer-administered interview based on item response theory that was developed specifically to assess the ICF domain of Participation in Veterans. CRIS-CAT questions target areas of functioning particularly salient for Veterans with PTSD. The CRIS-CAT has three sub-scales, each measuring a different dimension of participation. The Perceived Limitations to Participation subscale assesses Veterans' perceived limitations in participation, and includes items such as &quot;I felt that I easily lost control of my feelings&quot;. The Extent of Participation subscale assesses how often Veterans experience a challenge in participation, and includes items such as &quot;How often did you get together with friends?&quot; The Satisfaction with Participation subscale assesses Veterans' level of satisfaction with participation, and includes items such as &quot;How satisfied were you with your daily accomplishments?&quot;</description>

    <measure>The McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 months post-treatment, 6-months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The FAD is a 60-item scale that consists of statements about families to which respondents indicated agreement or disagreement on a 4-point scale. It yields a General Functioning (GF) score, as well as indices of 6 areas of family activity: problem solving; communication; roles; affective responses; affective involvement; and behavioral control. Both the veteran and a family member will be asked to complete this measure.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Adaptability Scale of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Adaptability Scale is an 8-item subscale of the CD-RISC that measures adaptability in the face of challenges (e.g., &quot;I am able to adapt when changes occur&quot;). Cronbach's alpha for the 8-item Adaptability scale was found to be .91 in a sample of 1981Veterans (Green et al, under review). One of the primary goals of the CBT-A intervention is to increase Veterans' behavioral repertoire and range of Activities by targeting maladaptive Thought Functions and Emotion Functions. The Adaptability scale of the CD-RISC will be included among the outcome measures as it may assess improvements in Thought Functions and Emotion Functions that underlie limitations to Activities and Participation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist (PCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>On the PCL participants first report an autobiographical narrative of a trauma, and subsequently rate symptom frequency (0 [not at all] - 4 [everyday]) and severity (0 [not at all distressing] - 4 [extremely distressing]) for all DSM-V PTSD symptoms within the past week. Psychometric testing is currently underway on the newest version of the PCL; previous versions have been found to have high reliability and validity across trauma populations. The PCL will be included among the outcome measures to evaluate whether improvements in self-control of anger and aggressive behavior will affect PTSD symptoms, either directly or through an interaction with changes to Participation (as measured by CRIS-CAT) and psychosocial functioning (as measured by IPF). In addition to the outcome time frame listed above, the PCL will be administered weekly to evaluate the association of PTSD symptoms with anger cognitions (as measured by the DAR) over the course of the group.</description>

    <description>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anger and Aggression in Combat Veterans with PTSD (CBT-A) is a 12-week manualized group treatment protocol that is grounded in up-to-date research, and that specifically addresses the Energy and Drive Functions, Attention Functions, Emotion Functions, and Thought Functions that are hypothesized to underlie the limitations to Activities and Participation associated with PTSD-related anger and aggression. Each session lasts 90 minutes. The first session orients participants to the structure and philosophy of the program, provides a historical overview of PTSD, and introduces the concept of the &quot;survival mode&quot; of functioning (Chemtob et al., 1997). The remaining 11 sessions follow a standard format: 1) practice relaxation training (15-20 minutes); 2) review homework, introduce new material, and engage in group activities focused on implementing new skills and behaviors (70-80 minutes); and 3) review problems or concerns of group members.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Present Centered Therapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Present Centered Therapy (PCT) is an active, manualized treatment comparison condition for psychotherapy trials. PCT is designed to control for nonspecific factors of therapy such as contact with a trained therapist, rationale for treatment, and instillation of expectancy for therapeutic gains. The therapeutic approach was drawn from Yalom's group therapy model, which utilizes interpersonal process, supportive techniques, identification of response options, encouragement of adaptive reactions, and focus on the &quot;here-and-now&quot;. Previous large-scale randomized clinical trials of Veterans with PTSD have found reduced PTSD symptoms in the PCT comparison condition (Schnurr et al., 2003), and a survey of practice patterns within the VA suggests that similar present-focused approaches are routinely employed by VA mental health providers (Rosen et al., 2004). Consistent with recommendations in the PCT manual, training will emphasize the approach rather than specific interventions.</description>
