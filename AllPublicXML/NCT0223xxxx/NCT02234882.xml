          1. Signed Informed Consent Form

               -  Signed written informed consent must be obtained from the subjects in accordance
                  with requirements of the study center's IRB or IEC before the initiation of any

          2. Target Population

               -  Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant deviation from normal
                  in medical history, physical examination findings, vital sign measurements,
                  12-lead ECG measurements, and clinical laboratory test results.
