  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It is most often detected by an abnormal
      digital rectal exam or an elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen -determine by a blood test. When
      it is suspected that someone may have prostate cancer, a biopsy is ordered. This biopsy is
      performed by the Radiologist with ultrasound guidance through the rectum. In some patients, a
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate may be ordered to further evaluate the
      prostate. In some situations, the MRI and Ultrasound images will be fused (digitally merged)
      together during the ultrasound procedure to help localize the questionable lesions. Recent
      research has used an additional component known as a contrast agent - an intravenously
      injected inert substance - which is identifiable by ultrasound. This inert substance is more
      obvious in areas of increased blood flow, which is a common finding in cancerous lesions. In
      this research project, we would like to determine whether the use of contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound is beneficial in improving accuracy of the biopsies taken and the relative
      correlation to the MRI/ Ultrasound-fused images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is the hypothesis that cancerous lesions in the prostate will have an increased amount of
      blood flow, and that the lesions identified under ultrasound with the benefits of
      contrast-enhanced imaging can be correlated to the MRI Findings in real-time. A study of 50
      patients who would be undergoing MRI/Ultrasound fusion would be selected to have contrast
      added to their procedure. The lesions identified on MRI would then be evaluated with
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound. The findings from the contrast study could then be correlated
      with the MRI findings. The rest of the prostate gland would also be assessed using the
      contrast agent for lesions not identified on the MRI imaging study. The pathology results
      could be correlated with both the contrast study and the MRI study both independently, and in
      conjunction with the two imaging modalities. If a correlation between highly suspicious
      lesions on the MRI and significant flow patterns under contrast can be established, then the
      sensitivity and specificity of contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be increased.

      While MRI / Ultrasound Fusion is being shown to increase prostate cancer identification and
      targeting for biopsy, it is a very limited modality due to the costs associated. Many sites
      will also not have access to an MRI unit, and the fusion system is prohibitively expensive,
      and requires specialized training to configure the system and modulate the images in
      real-time. However, ultrasound is an in expensive modality that is readily available. If the
      materials and methods in the utilization of contrast-enhanced ultrasounds can be correlated
      to MRI / Ultrasound fusion, better protocols can be developed for contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound. This more cost-effective method of identifying and targeting prostate cancer
      could then be exported to smaller communities who would otherwise still be carrying out the
      sextant biopsy model.

    <description>It is hypothesized that the introduction of the Definity contrast agent during the ultrasound biopsy will increase the accuracy of the targeting biopsy sample, as well as reduce the number of targeted biopsies of non-cancerous lesions.

    <description>Ultrasound Contrast enhancement has a time component, and the measuring of the contrast uptake as a function of time will be measured to generate a Time Intensity Curve (TIC). The time to the contrast enhancement peak (TTP), intensity change from the baseline to peak (ΔI) and ΔI/TTP of the tumour and the the TIC will be correlated to the lesion's MRI Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) value.</description>

    <description>Injection of Definity Perflutren Injectable Suspension- which travels in the bloodstream throughout the body. These microbubbles are identifiable on ultrasound imaging, and studies of the liver and kidney have identified it as a useful adjunct to identifying vascular lesions. Areas of regular blood flow will not have as large a concentration of the microbubble agent as will areas that have increased blood flow and neovascularisation. It has been well documented that cancerous solid lesions undergo neovascularisation and have increased blood flow to the area.</description>
