  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the pathological complete response (pCR) to
      chemotherapy given before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) could be predicted by the
      evaluation of the RNA (ribonucleic acids) disruption pattern (RNA Disruption Assay or RDA
      score) obtained from a biopsy of the tumor 7 - 14 days after the first, second and third
      cycles of chemotherapy treatment. If we can determine the optimal time during neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy to measure the RDA score for the prediction of pCR, we can optimize breast
      cancer management.

    <textblock>
      When administering neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the current practice of monitoring response to
      treatment is by measuring the size of the breast tumor after each cycle of chemotherapy. The
      drawback to this method is, it will take several weeks before we can actually measure a
      significant change in size; and the initial response to chemotherapy is often evident as a
      softening of the tumor without an apparent decrease of the tumor size. Finding a reliable way
      to identify early response to chemotherapy would be helpful to enable matching of
      chemotherapy to an individual's need.

      In a previous trial of breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, researchers have
      identified that the pCR to a full treatment of chemotherapy could be predicted by the change
      in RNA pattern obtained from a biopsy of the tumor half way through the chemotherapy course.
      [Parissenti et al. 2010] The purpose of this study is to determine if we can predict the pCR
      to neoadjuvant chemotherapy by examining the pattern of RNA disruption (RNA Disruption Assay
      or RDA score) from breast biopsy tissue obtained 7 to 14 days after the first, second and
      third cycle of chemotherapy. If we can determine the optimal time during neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy to measure the RDA score for the prediction of pCR, we can optimize breast
      cancer management. For example, if RDA score can identify non-responders earlier, we can
      switch to other chemotherapy agents and reduce the exposure to the unnecessary side-effects
      of ineffective treatment.

    <description>The association between tumor RDA score measured 7-14 days after the first, second and third cycles of chemotherapy and the pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be evaluated. pCR is defined as no evidence of invasive carcinoma in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0/N0itc) on histology at the time of surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy).</description>

    <time_frame>An expected average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The capacity of RDA score to predict pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be assessed by exploring for a cut point on the RDA score to differentiate subjects with a high likelihood of achieving pCR versus those who are less likely to achieve pCR.</description>

    <time_frame>An expected average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cost-effectiveness of using RDA score to guide neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be evaluated by measuring the cost-effectiveness of monitoring pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy through the RDA score and in modifying the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for non-pCR patients accordingly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>An expected average of 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The association between tumor RDA score measured 7-14 days after the first, second and third cycles of chemotherapy and DFS will be evaluated. DFS will be measured as the time from patient's enrollment to the event of cancer metastasis or recurrence, or death, whatever comes first.</description>
