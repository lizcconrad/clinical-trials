        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male volunteers aged 19 to 50

          2. Participant who has a body weight that is &gt;=55kg(male) and body mass index (BMI) level
             that is 18~30

          3. Provision of signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of clinically significant disease

          2. History of clinically significant hypersensitivity or hypersensitivity reactions to
             drugs and other medications (aspirin, antibiotics, etc.), including components such as
             Telmisartan, Rosuvastatin and Amlodipine

          3. A history of drug abuse or the presence of positive reactions to drugs that have abuse
             potential in urine screenings for drugs

          4. Administration of other investigational products within 2 months prior to the first
             dosing.

          5. Administration of herbal medicine within 2 weeks or administration of ethical drugs
             within 2 weeks or administration of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs within 1 week prior
             to the first dosing of the investigational product (if the investigator (study doctor)
             determines that the person meets other criteria appropriately, the relevant person may
             participate in the study)

          6. Volunteers considered not eligible for the clinical trial by the investigator (study
             doctor) due to the reasons including laboratory test results, ECGs, or vital signs.
