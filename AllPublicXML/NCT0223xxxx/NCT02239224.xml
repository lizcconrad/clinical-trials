    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability profile of ATYR1940 in the
      treatment of adult patients with molecularly defined genetic muscular dystrophies

    <textblock>
      Study ATYR1940-C-002 is a multi-national, multi-center, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, ascending dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK,
      immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamic effects of ATYR1940 in patients with FSHD. Up to 44
      patients are planned to be enrolled at multiple study centers in the U.S. and Europe; the
      actual number of patients enrolled will depend on the number of cohorts initiated.

      Patients will be screened for study eligibility during the Screening period within 3 weeks
      before Baseline (i.e., Day 1, the first day of Study Drug administration). Eligible patients,
      based on Screening assessments, will be randomly assigned to treatment with ATYR1940 or
      placebo. Patients who are randomized are considered to be enrolled in the study.

      After enrollment, patients will enter the 1-week single-blind placebo period during which all
      patients will receive a single 30-minute IV infusion of placebo. Thereafter, patients will
      enter the double-blind treatment period and will receive 30-minute IV infusions of Study Drug
      (ATYR1940 or placebo) according to their random treatment assignment.
