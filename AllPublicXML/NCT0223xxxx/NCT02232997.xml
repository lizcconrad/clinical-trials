      No well-defined protocols exist to guide fluid administration for prevention of contrast
      induced nephropathy in high risk patients. The investigators will compare long term hydration
      at routine speed(12h before and after procedure at 1ml/kg/h) with short term hydration at
      high speed(1h before and 4h after procedure at 3ml/kg/h) to verify our hypothesis that the
      short term hydration may not be inferior to the long one.

      No well-defined protocols exist to guide fluid administration for prevention of contrast
      induced nephropathy in high risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Long term
      hydration at routine speed(12h before and after procedure at 1ml/kg/h), as the most
      recommended adequate hydration, has been carried out to prevent contrast induced nephropathy
      in lots of clinical trials. Base on the data in the POSEIDON randomised controlled trial with
      haemodynamic-guided fluid administration, short term hydration at high speed(1h before and 4h
      after procedure at 3ml/kg/h) may not be inferior to the classic long term hydration, the
      speed should be reduced half of the intended speed in all the patients. We hypothesized short
      term hydration may not be inferior to the long one to reduced significantly the hospital stay
      and healthy cost.
