  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials organization in several neuromuscular disorders (NMD) has some specific
      issues. Nonambulant status and difficulties with transportation are among them. Moreover a
      lot of patients with NMD have so poor condition that even short transportation is able to
      worse it. Such situation forces researchers to limit a region of recruitment for clinical
      trials and to exclude from trials more severe subgroup of patients, which cause additional
      issues especially for rare diseases.

      The purpose of this study is to prove hypothesis about possibility to reliably monitor
      patient condition remotely, without trial site visiting. Visit-free study design is
      potentially able to widen eligible patient population and to decrease patient dropout rate as
      well as burden of numerous assessments. Meanwhile assessment frequency could be increased
      enabling monitoring of short fluctuations in patients' condition.

      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neuromuscular condition to which all mentioned above
      issues are completely applicable. Direct current stimulation (DCS) of neural structures is
      well studied and safe intervention, however, its effects on SMA patients' strength and
      durability has not been reported for today. The investigators suppose that investigation of
      DCS action in SMA patient population is an adequate model for visit-free design feasibility,
      reliability and sensitivity evaluation.
