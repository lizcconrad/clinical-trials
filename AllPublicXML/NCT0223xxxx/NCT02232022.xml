      The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
      (AF) in ischemic stroke patients who have a presumed known stroke etiology other than atrial
      fibrillation.

    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that their is a relatively high incidence of silent paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (PAF) in cryptogenic ischemic stroke patients. Detection of silent PAF in this
      population, however, requires prolonged cardiac monitoring. On the other hand, there is no
      understanding of the frequency of silent PAF in patients with a &quot;known&quot; or presumed etiology
      for their ischemic stroke other than AF. If this incidence is also found to be significant, a
      dramatic change in stroke evaluation and management would likely occur. This study intends to
      find the incidence of PAF in a population of recent (within 7 days) ischemic stroke patients
      (or MRI positive &quot;transient ischemic attack (TIA)&quot; patients) who have presumed etiology for
      their stroke other than atrial fibrillation or other high risk cardiac lesion. Stroke
      etiology will be determined through a standard post-stroke evaluation that includes:

        -  Brain MRI

        -  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for AF detection

        -  24-h ECG monitoring for AF detection (eg, Holter monitor or cardiac telemetry)

        -  Transthoracic and/or Transesophageal echocardiogram

        -  CT or MR angiography of the head and neck

        -  Hypercoagulable blood panel for patients less than 55 years-old. Preliminary
           hypercoagulable work-up within 7 days will include the antiphospholipid antibody
           syndrome results, which will be needed to determine stroke management. All other
           results, which could take longer to return, including genetic tests of
           hypercoagulability, rarely change stroke management.

      To find occult PAF in this population, participants will have an insertable cardiac monitor
      (Reveal LINQ ICM) implanted within 7 days of the incident stroke and will be monitored for at
      least 1 year.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with brain
             infarction on brain imaging.

          -  No history of atrial fibrillation or finding of atrial fibrillation on standard
             inpatient monitoring (electrocardiogram, telemetry, 24-hour Holter monitor)

          -  Have a presumed stroke etiology: Lacunar or small vessel thrombosis, extra-cranial or
             intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis or dissection, arteriopathy or vasculitis,
             hypercoagulable state, aortic arch plaque with or without mobile elements, or evidence
             of a low-risk cardiac source (e.g., patent foramen ovale with or without atrial septal
             aneurysm and with or without evidence of venous thromboembolic source).

          -  Have virtual CHADS2 score ≥3 or

          -  Have 2 or more of the following co-morbidities: obstructive sleep apnea, coronary
             artery disease, (Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD), hyperthyroidism, Body
             Mass Index&gt; 30, prior myocardial infarction, prolonged PR interval (&gt;175 ms) or renal

          -  Patient is ≥40 years old (patients younger than 40 years old have a very low
             likelihood of having atrial fibrillation and are therefore excluded from the study).

          -  Patient is not fit, or is unable or unwilling to follow the required procedures of the
             Clinical Investigation Plan.

          -  Cryptogenic Stroke: A stroke/TIA will be considered cryptogenic if no cause is
