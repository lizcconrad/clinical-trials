    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of a human
      monoclonal antibody (BTT1023) which targets the vascular adhesion protein (VAP-1) and its use
      in the treatment of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive immune mediated biliary disease characterised
      by bile duct inflammation and fibrosis, and accompanying hepatic fibrosis. For patients with
      elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in particular, progressive disease is predicted, that
      currently results in a need for liver transplantation in the majority. No current medical
      therapy has as yet been shown to be effective in altering the natural history of disease. For
      this reason patients with PSC with elevated ALP values will be recruited to this study, to
      evaluate the impact of Vap-1 blockade by BTT1023, in an early phase study focused on
      biochemical efficacy and safety.

      This is an early phase study of BTT1023 in immune mediated liver disease, with the rationale
      to identify biochemical efficacy of effect (reduction in ALP) and safety, in an orphan
      disease indication for PSC that presently lacks any other medical therapy. The study design
      therefore focuses on identifying early biochemical efficacy signals to justify larger scale,
      randomised controlled studies over longer duration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females 18 - 75 years of age who are willing and able to provide informed,
             written consent and comply with all study requirements.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of PSC as evident by chronic cholestasis of more than six months
             duration with either a consistent MRI showing sclerosing cholangitis or a liver biopsy
             consistent with PSC in the absence of a documented alternative aetiology for
             sclerosing cholangitis.

          -  In those on treatment with UDCA, therapy must be stable for at least 8 weeks, and at a
             dose not greater than 20mg/kg/day.

          -  Serum ALP greater than 1.5xULN.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to starting study treatment. For the purposes of this study, a female subject of

             highly effective method of contraception from the Screening Visit throughout the study
             period and for 99 days following the last dose of study drug. If using hormonal agents
             the same method must have been used for at least 1 month before study dosing and
             subjects must use a barrier method as the other form of contraception. Lactating women

             primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients with possible overlap syndrome with autoimmune

          -  Participation in an investigational trial of a drug or device either within 60 days of
             screening or 5 half-lifes of the last dose of investigational drug, where the study
