  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, impairing, childhood onset
      neuropsychiatric disorder with executive dysfunctions. The ADHD symptoms and executive
      deficits may last to adulthood. Our previous studies, like western results, have shown that
      children with ADHD have disrupted microstructural integrity of frontostriatal fiber pathways
      and impaired brain activity in frontoparietal network. However, there is lack of data with
      regards to whether adults with ADHD also demonstrate structural and functional
      disconnectivity of frontostriatal and frontoparietal networks as compared to healthy controls
      without ADHD in Asian population and no study has been done to correlate a wide range of
      executive functions with the connectivity of these two networks.

      Specific Aims:

        1. to compare the executive functions, and structural and functional connectivity in
           frontostriatal and frontoparietal circuitries between adults with ADHD and healthy
           controls without ADHD;

        2. to correlate the data from structural and functional connectivity, executive functions,
           and ADHD core symptoms stratifying by the ADHD and controls; and

        3. to explore other circuitries that may involve in ADHD by using whole brain tractography
           analyses.
