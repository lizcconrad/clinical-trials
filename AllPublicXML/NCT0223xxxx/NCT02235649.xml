  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced social and community functioning is a predominant and enduring feature in people
      experiencing severe mental illness such as psychosis. The large majority of interventions
      (mostly pharmacological) target the so called positive symptoms (e.g. hallucinations and
      delusions) but poorly address functional and social consequences of the illness.

      This study attempts to fill this gap by assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a
      psychological intervention targeting social cognition deficit in people with psychosis. The
      intervention is a group psychological treatment facilitated by a clinical psychologist
      targeting competencies such as emotion recognition, social situation appraisal and guessing
      people's intentions and mental states. The group therapy takes advantage of audiovisual
      material to illustrate strategies and thinking styles that may help participants to overcome
      difficulties in social settings.

      A second objective of this study is to test a new method to measure social cognition. Recent
      research showed that interview and performance based tests are poorly associated with every
      day activity of people with schizophrenia. This study is planning to evaluate the feasibility
      of new assessment methods for social cognition in everyday life using portable electronic
      devices (Experience Sampling Method and an activity watch). These devices will be carried by
      participants in their everyday life and will ask about feelings and levels of social
      activities at random times and record basic physiological and activity levels.
