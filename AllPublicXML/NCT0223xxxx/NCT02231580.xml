    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Position-index as Determined by Choreomotography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day-1) to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Choreatic (involuntary) movements were assessed using Choreomotography by calculating a position-index and orientation-index. Patients were asked to grasp and lift a device equipped with an electromagnetic sensor, and were asked to hold the device as stable as possible. Three dimensional (3D) changes in position (x, y and z) and orientation (roll, pitch and yaw) were recorded and used to calculate a position-index and an orientation-index. This method provided an objective measure of the involuntary movements. 5 trials of 20 seconds duration were performed with each hand, and the start and end of each trial was signalled by a cueing tone. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the position-index of the right and left hands are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present geometric least squares (GLS) mean ratios in the original units.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The coordination of isometric grip forces in the precision grip between the thumb and index finger were assessed by Manumotography. Grip forces were assessed during grip initiation, object transport and in a static holding phase. Subjects were instructed to grasp and lift a device equipped with a force transducer and 3D position sensor in the precision grip between thumb and index finger and hold it stable adjacent to a marker 10 centimetres high. Grip forces and 3D position and orientation of the object were recorded. Mean isometric grip forces and grip force variability in the static phase (expressed as coefficient of variation = standard deviation/mean x 100 [GFV-C]) were calculated during a 15 second period. 5 trials of 20 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the grip force variability of each hand are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Position-index as Determined by Choreomotography</title>
        <description>Choreatic (involuntary) movements were assessed using Choreomotography by calculating a position-index and orientation-index. Patients were asked to grasp and lift a device equipped with an electromagnetic sensor, and were asked to hold the device as stable as possible.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Grip Force Variability as Determined by Manumotography</title>
        <description>The coordination of isometric grip forces in the precision grip between the thumb and index finger were assessed by Manumotography. Grip forces were assessed during grip initiation, object transport and in a static holding phase. Subjects were instructed to grasp and lift a device equipped with a force transducer and 3D position sensor in the precision grip between thumb and index finger and hold it stable adjacent to a marker 10 centimetres high. Grip forces and 3D position and orientation of the object were recorded. Mean isometric grip forces and grip force variability in the static phase (expressed as coefficient of variation = standard deviation/mean x 100 [GFV-C]) were calculated during a 15 second period. 5 trials of 20 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the grip force variability of each hand are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Isometric Grip Forces as Determined by Manumotography</title>
        <description>The coordination of isometric grip forces in the precision grip between the thumb and index finger were assessed by Manumotography. Grip forces were assessed during grip initiation, object transport and in a static holding phase. Subjects were instructed to grasp and lift a device equipped with a force transducer and 3D position sensor in the precision grip between thumb and index finger and hold it stable adjacent to a marker 10 centimetres high. Grip forces and 3D position and orientation of the object were recorded. Mean isometric grip forces and grip force variability in the static phase (expressed as coefficient of variation = standard deviation/mean x 100 [GFV-C]) were calculated during a 15 second period. 5 trials of 20 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the mean isometric grip forces of each hand are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Duration and Variability of Inter Onset Intervals (IOI) as Assessed by Digitomotography</title>
        <description>Digitomotography was used to assess the duration and the variability of tap IOI in an index finger speeded tapping task. The patient placed their hand on a hand rest with their index finger positioned on a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to finger tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the duration and variability of IOI for the left and right hands are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Duration and Variability of Tap Durations (TD) as Assessed by Digitomotography</title>
        <description>Digitomotography was used to assess the duration and the variability of TD in an index finger speeded tapping task. The patient placed their hand on a hand rest with their index finger positioned on a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to finger tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the duration and variability of TD for the left and right hands are presented a raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Duration and Variability of Inter Tap Intervals (ITI) as Assessed by Digitomotography</title>
        <description>Digitomotography was used to assess the duration and the variability of ITI in an index finger speeded tapping task. The patient placed their hand on a hand rest with their index finger positioned on a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to finger tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the duration and variability of ITI for the left and right hands are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

            <description>Patients were randomised to receive oral study medication, BN82451B, b.i.d. from Day 1 to Day 27, under double-blinded conditions. On Day 28 only one morning dose of BN82451B was administered. It was planned for patients to be assigned to 3 cohorts to receive 3 dose levels ranging between 40 and 80 milligrams (mg) b.i.d.
For cohort 1, 40 mg BN82451B b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If this dose was well tolerated then it was increased to 60 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 60 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 2, 60 mg BN82451B b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If 60 mg b.i.d was well tolerated then it was increased to 80 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 3 it was planned to administer 80 mg BN82451B b.i.d for 27 days with one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28. The study was terminated early before completion of cohort 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Variability of Peak Tapping Forces (TF) as Assessed by Digitomotography</title>
        <description>Digitomotography was used to assess the duration and the variability of TD in an index finger speeded tapping task. The patient placed their hand on a hand rest with their index finger positioned on a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to finger tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the variability of TF for the left and right hands are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Duration and Variability of TD as Assessed by Dysdiadochomotography</title>
        <description>Dysdiadochomotography was used to assess the regularity of hand taps performed when alternating between the palm and dorsal surface of the hand performing a repetitive pronation/supination movement. The force and duration of the hand taps were recorded, with their hand positioned on a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to hand tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the duration and variability of TD for the left and right hands are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

            <description>Patients were randomised to receive oral study medication, BN82451B, b.i.d. from Day 1 to Day 27, under double-blinded conditions. On Day 28 only one morning dose of BN82451B was administered. It was planned for patients to be assigned to 3 cohorts to receive 3 dose levels ranging between 40 and 80 milligrams (mg) b.i.d.
For cohort 1, 40 mg BN82451B b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If this dose was well tolerated then it was increased to 60 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 60 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 2, 60 mg BN82451B b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If 60 mg b.i.d was well tolerated then it was increased to 80 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 3 it was planned to administer 80 mg BN82451B b.i.d for 27 days with one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28. The study was terminated early before completion of cohort 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Duration and Variability of IPI as Assessed by Dysdiadochomotography</title>
        <description>Dysdiadochomotography was used to assess the regularity of hand taps performed when alternating between the palm and dorsal surface of the hand performing a repetitive pronation/supination movement. The force and duration of the hand taps were recorded, with their hand positioned on a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to hand tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the duration and variability of IPI for the left and right hands are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

            <description>Patients were randomised to receive oral study medication, BN82451B, b.i.d. from Day 1 to Day 27, under double-blinded conditions. On Day 28 only one morning dose of BN82451B was administered. It was planned for patients to be assigned to 3 cohorts to receive 3 dose levels ranging between 40 and 80 milligrams (mg) b.i.d.
For cohort 1, 40 mg BN82451B b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If this dose was well tolerated then it was increased to 60 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 60 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 2, 60 mg BN82451B b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If 60 mg b.i.d was well tolerated then it was increased to 80 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 3 it was planned to administer 80 mg BN82451B b.i.d for 27 days with one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28. The study was terminated early before completion of cohort 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Variability of Peak TF as Assessed by Dysdiadochomotography</title>
        <description>Dysdiadochomotography was used to assess the regularity of hand taps performed when alternating between the palm and dorsal surface of the hand performing a repetitive pronation/supination movement. The force and duration of the hand taps were recorded, with their hand positioned on a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to hand tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each hand. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the variability of TF for the left and right hands are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Duration and Variability of IOI as Assessed by Pedomotography</title>
        <description>Pedomotography was used to assess the tap duration and variability in a foot speeded tapping task. The patient placed their foot on the foot device such that the ball of the foot was positioned above a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to foot tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each foot. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the duration and variability of IOI for the left and right feet are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Duration and Variability of IPI as Assessed by Pedomotography</title>
        <description>Pedomotography was used to assess the tap duration and variability in a foot speeded tapping task. The patient placed their foot on the foot device such that the ball of the foot was positioned above a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to foot tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each foot. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the duration and variability of IPI for the left and right feet are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

        <population>The PD population consisted of all subjects from the safety population who have not reported major protocol violations impacting Q-motor evaluation and who have a Q-motor evaluation assessed both at Baseline (Day -1) and at one post baseline visit.</population>

            <description>Patients were randomised to receive oral study medication, BN82451B, b.i.d. from Day 1 to Day 27, under double-blinded conditions. On Day 28 only one morning dose of BN82451B was administered. It was planned for patients to be assigned to 3 cohorts to receive 3 dose levels ranging between 40 and 80 milligrams (mg) b.i.d.
For cohort 1, 40 mg BN82451B b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If this dose was well tolerated then it was increased to 60 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 60 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 2, 60 mg BN82451B b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If 60 mg b.i.d was well tolerated then it was increased to 80 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 3 it was planned to administer 80 mg BN82451B b.i.d for 27 days with one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28. The study was terminated early before completion of cohort 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Duration and Variability of ITI as Assessed by Pedomotography</title>
        <description>Pedomotography was used to assess the tap duration and variability in a foot speeded tapping task. The patient placed their foot on the foot device such that the ball of the foot was positioned above a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to foot tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each foot. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the duration and variability of ITI for the left and right feet are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>

For cohort 1, 40 mg placebo b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If this dose was well tolerated then it was increased to 60 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 60 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 2, 60 mg placebo b.i.d. was administered during the first 14 days. If 60 mg b.i.d was well tolerated then it was increased to 80 mg b.i.d. for 13 days and one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28.
For cohort 3 it was planned to administer 80 mg placebo b.i.d for 27 days with one morning dose of 80 mg on Day 28. The study was terminated early before completion of cohort 2.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Mean Variability of Peak TF as Assessed by Pedomotography</title>
          <description>Pedomotography was used to assess the tap duration and variability in a foot speeded tapping task. The patient placed their foot on the foot device such that the ball of the foot was positioned above a force transducer, and recordings were started after practice runs. The patient was then instructed to foot tap as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap was defined as a rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ended when it dropped to 0.05 N before the maximal baseline level was reached again. 5 trials of 10 seconds duration were performed with each foot. The mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in the variability of TF for the left and right feet are presented as raw data. The statistical analyses present GLS mean ratios in the original units.</description>
          <population>The PD population consisted of all subjects from the safety population who have not reported major protocol violations impacting Q-motor evaluation and who have a Q-motor evaluation assessed both at Baseline (Day -1) and at one post baseline visit.</population>
