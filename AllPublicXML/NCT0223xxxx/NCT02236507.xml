  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorectal 3D high resolution manometry (3D HRM) is the most advanced version of manometry
      equipment and has been recently introduced into clinical practice. It is the most precise
      method to assess the anal sphincter pressure function and may be crucial for planning and
      controlling surgical procedures of the anorectal area. Normal values in pediatric population
      have not been established.

      The aim of this study is complex evaluation of anorectal function in children without
      symptoms from lower GI tract and establishment of normal values.
