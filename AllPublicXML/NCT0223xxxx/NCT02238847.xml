    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of Fully Covered biliary SEMS to
      Uncovered biliary SEMS in biliary drainage for the pre-operative management of biliary
      obstructive symptoms caused by pancreatic cancer in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy.
