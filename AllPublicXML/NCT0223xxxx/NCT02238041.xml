      The primary purpose of this Study is evaluation of the safety and accuracy of the GlucoClear
      CGM System.

      Design: Non-randomized, non-treatment, prospective, open label Study.

      The GlucoClear System will not display real-time glucose values, glucose trend graphs, or
      glucose alarms to either the Study subjects or the Study site clinical personnel. There will
      be no treatment of any subject based on the output of the System.

      After providing written informed consent, subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will
      be monitored by the System for a maximum of 72 hours.

      Up to 51 1 mL blood samples will be drawn from each subject for comparative glucose
      measurements on blood glucose analyzers over the 72 hour period.

      After the GlucoClear Sensor removal, subjects will be contacted for a follow-up assessment 14
      days later, and any subsequent adverse events will be documented.
