      The response of Continuous Erythropoietic Receptor Activator (CERA) with different dose
      interval and the survey for influence factors:

      We aim to evaluate a better clinical response which can be achieved by different dosing
      interval of a fixed dose of CERA. We expect this study can determine the dosing schedule with
      better clinical response to CERA and identify the associated factors predicting the
      cost-effectiveness of CERA in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients in Taiwan.

      We included HD patients with stable hematocrit (between 30~36%) under intravenous
      administration of CERA 100 μg once monthly for two months. Then they were shifted to receive
      CERA 50μg twice monthly for anther two months and finally they were shifted back to receive
      CERA 100 μg once monthly again for additional two months. Then we measured and compared the
      erythropoietic response (hematocrit, hemoglobin), profiles of iron status as well as
      nutritional status and inflammatory markers among the study subjects every two months for a
      total of 6 months. Those who had bleeding or received surgery or blood transfusion were
      excluded.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HD patients with stable hematocrit (between 30~36%) under intravenous administration
             of CERA 100 μg once monthly for two months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HD patients were excluded due to active bleeding (major trauma, gastric ulcer
             bleeding, or surgery), blood transfusion or administration of additional
             erythropoietic stimulating agent (ESA) other than CERA within the follow-up period
             during the study perod of 6 months. People who discontinued CERA as their ESA were
             also excluded.
