  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics study aims to evaluate the safety of Z7200 (budesonide/formoterol) in
      comparison with Symbicort Turbohaler (budesonide/formoterol), assessing the bioequivalence of
      the two products. Namely the study will compare the total systemic bioavailability (as an
      indicator of safety), and it will compare the pulmonary bioavailability (as a possible
      surrogate indicator of efficacy). This study will be performed in healthy subjects.
