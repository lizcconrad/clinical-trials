    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether intensive case management interventions by a
      diabetes team, led by an endocrinologist and certified diabetes educator, can prevent &lt;31 day
      readmission in previously identified high risk patients with diabetes.The procedures of the
      study will focus on managing the patient's diabetes and diabetes education while in the
      hospital, decreasing the patient's risk for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the hospital,
      and assist in the patient's diabetes management plan for a safe discharge.

    <description>Primary outcome measure is to assess whether an intensive case management intervention by a diabetes team, led by an endocrinologist and a certified diabetes educator (CDE) , can prevent a &lt;31 day readmission in previously identified high risk patients with diabetes compared to standard/usual care.</description>

    <time_frame>Upon the participant's consent (within 24 hours of hospital admission) to hospital discharge- the average length of stay is five days</time_frame>
    <description>To examine whether intensive case management intervention per endocrinologist and CDE during hospital stay prevents hypoglycemia &lt;70mg/dl, severe hypoglycemia &lt;40mg/dl, and improves overall glycemic management (100-180 mg/dl) compared to standard/usual care.</description>

    <description>to assess whether intensive case management intervention by a diabetes team , led by an endocrinologists and a CDE, can improve patient's overall satisfaction.
The research participant will be given a brief satisfaction questionaire at the time of discharge.</description>
