  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome is a major endocrinological disorder affecting 5-8% of reproductive
      aged women. Anovulation is a major feature of the syndrome, managed primarily by clomiphene
      citrate. Failure to respond to clomiphene citrate is termed clomiphene resistance and second
      line treatment is either laparoscopic ovarian drilling or gonadotrophin ovulation induction.
      Although laparoscopic drilling is effective in restoring ovulation and achieving pregnancy,
      some women still remain anovulatory and infertile after the procedure. N-acetyl cysteine has
      emerged as a novel therapeutic adjuvant to laparoscopic drilling to improve ovulation and
      pregnancy rate.

      Resistance to ovulation induction therapy with clomiphene citrate (CC) is a significant
      problem affecting as many as 25% of patients. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is an accepted
      second line treatment option, achieving ovulation in 75-90% and pregnancy in 50-69% of the CC
      resistant patients.

      Adjuvants to laparoscopic drilling have been explored by researchers some studies have shown
      evidence of improved outcome with the use of N-Acetyl cystiene (NAC), a long used mucolytic
      drug which has been used for various other indications including detoxification and cancer
      chemoprotection. Several studies have addressed the possibility of using NAC as adjuvant
      therapy to Clomiphene citrate for induction of ovulation in resistant patients with some
      showing encouraging results. The use of NAC as adjuvant to laparoscopic ovarian drilling was
      addressed in a single pilot study showing good results with improved ovulation and pregnancy
      rates compared to the non users.
