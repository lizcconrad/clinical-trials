  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to half of military veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) also suffer from
      co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Both are linked to higher risk of chronic
      pain, one of the most common health complaints among U.S. veterans who served in Operation
      Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq), and Operation New Dawn
      (OEF/OIF/OND). However, pain medications elevate risk of opioid abuse, and studies indicate
      that veterans perceive barriers to traditional mental health treatments. Little research
      exists regarding non-pharmacological, technology-based interventions designed to reduce pain
      in veterans with PTSD and TBI. Mobile technology used to implement neurofeedback (EEG
      biofeedback) shows promise in providing a portable, low-cost intervention for reducing pain
      in veterans with co-occurring disorders. We aim to test the feasibility and effectiveness of
      using mobile neurofeedback devices for reducing pain symptoms in veterans with PTSD and TBI.
      Veterans with PTSD, TBI, and chronic pain will receive a NeuroSky headset (which reads EEG
      brain waves) and an iPod Touch with an app called Mobile Neurofeedback (which provides
      neurofeedback to induce relaxation). Veterans are taught how to use these together to do
      neurofeedback themselves at home for 12 weeks. Guided by existing research and preliminary
      data, we hypothesize that participants will show high levels of adherence to the NeuroSky +
      Mobile Neurofeedback intervention for the 3-month study duration and that participants will
      show statistically significant reduction in pain symptoms at 3 months compared to baseline.
      Given links between pain and other outcomes in veterans, we will also explore effects on drug
      abuse, violence, and suicidality. When the research is complete, the field will be changed
      because we will know whether new technology reading EEG brainwaves can be used to treat
      symptoms among individuals suffering from chronic pain. We will also know whether
      neurofeedback shows promise as an effective intervention for veterans with PTSD and TBI to
      reduce pain and related outcomes. If this program of research is successful, its impact will
      be to shift approaches to managing pain in clinical practice, for both veterans and civilians

    <description>Per protocol, participants are enrolled if they have chronic pain defined as self-reporting on the numeric rating scale a score of 4 or above lasting three months or more. The study will therefore ask participants to self report their level of pain (from 0-10, 0 least amount of pain, 10 being the most) following the three months of the neurofeedback sessions.</description>
