  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, randomized, open-label, parallel group study designed to assess the
      clinical and biological effects of 12 months of treatment with long acting intramuscular (IM)
      aripiprazole (Abilify®) as measured by clinical and behavioral measures, and changes on
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in subjects with schizophrenia compared with SOC oral
      antipsychotic medications and compared with a healthy control group.

      It is hypothesized that improved treatment compliance will lead to fewer white matter changes
      in the brain. Fewer white matter changes will be demonstrated via neuroimaging as increased
      FA and BPF values in the prefrontal region, and an increase in metabolites in a voxel
      centered on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as seen with MRS. Therefore, the aim of this
      study is to examine the structural and metabolic effects of aripiprazole (Abilify®) once
      monthly in patients with schizophrenia using MRI techniques and to examine these effects in
      association with cognitive and clinical measures.
