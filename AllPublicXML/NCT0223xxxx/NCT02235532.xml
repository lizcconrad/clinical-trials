    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess the effects of Aloe Vera toothpaste on dental plaque and
      gingivitis.

      The single-blind cross-over clinical trial was conducted on 20 dental students (10 males and
      10 females with a mean age of 24.5±4 yrs.) with gingivitis. Students were randomly divided
      into 2 groups. The first group used Aloe Vera toothpaste for 30 days. A 2-week wash-out
      period was allowed and then subjects used fluoride toothpaste for the next 30 days . This
      order was reversed in group 2.

      Toothpastes are used with tooth brushing to better control microbial plaque. Herbal
      toothpastes have recently gained attention. This study aimed to assess the effects of Aloe
      Vera toothpaste on dental plaque and gingivitis.

      This single-blind cross-over clinical trial was conducted on 20 dental students (10 males and
      10 females with a mean age of 24.5±4 yrs.) with gingivitis. Students were randomly divided
      into 2 groups. The first group used Aloe Vera toothpaste for 30 days and then their plaque
      index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were recorded. A 2-week wash-out period was allowed and
      then subjects used fluoride toothpaste for the next 30 days and underwent PI and GI
      assessment again. This order was reversed in group 2. Wilcoxon-Sign Rank and two way Repeated
      Measure ANOVA tests were applied for statistical analysis.
