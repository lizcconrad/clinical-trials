    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether abatacept, a drug approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration to treat rheumatoid arthritis, may help blood pressure medications to work
      better. This will be studied in people with high blood pressure that is not well controlled
      on three or more blood pressure medications, the condition also known as resistant
      hypertension. We expect to show that adding abatacept therapy to standardized treatment of
      resistant hypertension will result in a greater decrease in blood pressure at 24 weeks
      compared to treatment with placebo and conventional blood pressure treatment.
