  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous animal studies done by Dr. Brent Cameron in 2013 at the Univ. of Toledo have shown
      that glucose present in the fluid in the front of the eye, called the aqueous humor,
      correlates well with blood glucose. As blood glucose changes, the optical properties of the
      aqueous humor change, causing a change in the appearance of the iris of the eye.. The data
      collected in this study will be shared with IRISense to assist in validating the algorithm
      being used to develop the database needed. The data collected so far is in a narrow band of
      the normal glycemic range (healthy volunteers). We will collect standard digital photographic
      images of the eyes of subjects with diabetes along with corresponding blood glucose
      concentrations using the finger stick glucose monitoring method. In order to do this we will
      use standard digital photography techniques that is embedded in our benchtop prototype device

    <description>The subject will be scheduled for 3 visits. Scheduling for testing will be performed by the principal investigator. Each subject will be required to take part in three individual or group testing sessions of 45-90 minutes over a 60 day period.
Eight digital photographic image of the subject's iris will be obtained at various times during each visit under standard illumination using the developed instrumentation. A point-of-care fingerstick blood glucose reading will be taken with an FDA approved blood glucose measurement device (i.e., Contour, Bayer Healthcare, LLC) as close to simultaneously as possible with the photograph.</description>
