  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether providing ventilation during delayed
      umbilical cord clamping provides greater placental transfusion and improved hemodynamic
      transition at birth.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive 1 minute of delayed cord clamping in both arms. One arm will receive
      routine care, warm dry and stimulate during the 1 minutes transfusion. The second arm will
      receive routine care PLUS administration of CPAP and if need positive pressure ventilation.
      The outcome is to determine whether the addition of ventilation provides a larger placental
      transfusion and a smoother transition at birth.
