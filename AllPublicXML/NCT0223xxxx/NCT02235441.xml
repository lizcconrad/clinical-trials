  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence of the integral role of exercise following cancer treatment.
      Randomized trials show that exercise improves post treatment symptoms and quality of life in
      breast and prostate cancer patients.Regular exercise reduces cancer specific and all cause
      mortality for patients with breast, prostate, brain or colorectal cancer. Nearly a 40-50%
      relative risk reduction in cancer specific death and 20-50% relative risk reduction in all
      cause mortality have been reported with exercise. At present it is unknown if preclinical
      pleiotropic effects on tumors through aerobic exercise are clinically relevant. Before
      launching into further studies of exercise training on changes in tumor hypoxia and response
      to CRT in rectal cancer patients, it is first important to understand: 1. Whether measures of
      exercise exposure (i.e., exercise capacity and self-reported exercise behavior) are
      associated with markers of tumor hypoxia at diagnosis (prior to initiation of CRT) and 2.
      Whether changes in measures of exercise exposure over the course of CRT are related to
      changes in tumor hypoxia and response to CRT.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of assessing cardiopulmonary fitness pre and post chemoradiation therapy. This feasibility assessment will be reported as a composite of the following variables: (a) the study can accrue 25 patients in no more than 3 years, (b) at least 18 of these 25 patients adhere to the cardiopulmonary testing pre and post CRT; do not drop out early, and do not have an exercise-related adverse event (i.e., cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction), and (c) no more than 1 patient has an exercise-related adverse event.</description>

    <description>All subjects will undergo a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test and resting metabolic rate study. Prior to the exercise treadmill test, each subject will have a resting ECG and blood pressure to determine whether there are any abnormalities that would contraindicate exercise testing.This exercise test involves exercising on a treadmill to maximal exertion, during which the subject's breathing and oxygen consumption are measured. The subject will wear nose clips to prevent exhaling air through their nose and a mouth piece that will allow all exhaled air to be analyzed through the metabolic cart. The subject's electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure, and perceived exertion are monitored throughout the test by trained personnel.</description>
