Dosage for adult subjects (16 years aged and over): 4 mg Dosage for pediatric subjects (3 months to &lt; 16 years): 0.05 mg/kg (but not exceeding 4 mg) Frequency: Intravenous administration of lorazepam. Subjects whose seizure does not stop or recurs within 10 minutes after the initial dose may receive the same amount of lorazepam injection no earlier than 10 minutes following the initial dose.
