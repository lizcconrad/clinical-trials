  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposed pilot study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a
      Depression Decision Aid (DDA) protocol integrated into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and
      used by nurses with depressed ambulatory care patients. The Depression Decision Aid protocol
      is a streamlined adaptation of an in-person Shared Decision-Making (SDM) intervention, and
      its goal is to increase patient involvement in clinically appropriate treatment
      decision-making as a way of strengthening treatment engagement and outcomes. The protocol
      guides ambulatory care nurses in helping depressed patients (Patient Health Questionnaire-9
      [PHQ-9] &gt;10) develop informed treatment preferences through a process of education and values
      clarification. We will target patients in the general medical clinic, whether currently
      receiving depression treatment or not, because depression is highly prevalent but often
      poorly managed in this population.

      The aims of this project are to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of an electronic
      Depression Decision Aid protocol with nurses and patients using questionnaire and
      administrative data.

      One to two nurses will deliver the Decision Aid protocol to 40 low-income patients (aged 21
      and over) scoring &gt;10 via routine PHQ-9 screening. Consenting nurses will be assessed
      regarding their satisfaction with the protocol following its use with each patient subject.
      Nurse fidelity to the protocol will be evaluated via their documentation of protocol use in
      the EHR. Consenting patient subjects will be assessed at baseline; week 1 to determine their
      decision about depression treatment, satisfaction with the decision-making process; and week
      12 to determine treatment initiation or change, treatment adherence, and depressive status.
      Medical records will also be examined for documentation of medication prescription and other
      depression treatments.

      The study will test the following hypothesis concerning the Depression Decision Aid protocol:

      1. Feasibility and Acceptability: a) At least 85% of each nurse's intervention sessions will
      meet fidelity standards via Electronic Health Record (EHR) data; b) Nurses will report high
      levels of satisfaction with the Decision Aid; c) Patients will report high levels of
      satisfaction with the decision-making process;

    <description>The Depression Decision Aid protocol, integrated into the Electronic Health Record (EHR), is a streamlined adaptation of an in-person Shared Decision-Making intervention. Shared decision-making, in contrast to traditional medical decision-making, involves a collaborative process where patients discuss personal values and preferences and clinicians provide information to arrive at an agreed upon treatment decision. The focus of the intervention is to empower the elderly depressed primary care patients and help them efficiently arrive at a treatment decision that can be successfully implemented.</description>
