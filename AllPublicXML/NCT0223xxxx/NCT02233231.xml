    <textblock>
      This is a study describing changes in inflammation of the airways in asthmatics before and
      after smoking cessation and steroid treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      84 smoking asthmatics will be included. 50% will be treated with varenicline and 50% with
      placebo tablets for 12 weeks. All will be treated with inhaled steroid for 12 weeks.

      Study period: About 26 weeks including asthma screening. 4 visits will be performed.
      Inflammation will be described through sputum induction, and several other pulmonary medical
      tests will be performed, including NO, methacholine, spirometry, CO, blood samples, skin
      prick test and asthma questionaires.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Asthmatic symptoms during the last year and at least one criterion of the below:

          1. current FEV1-increase of minimum 12% after b2-agonist,

          2. positiv Methacholintest,

          3. Day-to-day FEV1-variation of at least 20% during a two-week period.

          4. Positive mannitol test.

        Furthermore, all of the below inclusion criteria:

          -  At least 10 packyears

          -  At least 10 cigarettes per day within the last year

          -  Age 18-40 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Asthmatics who have been treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), systemic
             corticosteroids, leukotrien-antagonists (LTA), long-lasting b2-agonists,
             anticholinergic medicine or varenicline within the last 3 months

          2. Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, within the last 6 weeks.

          3. Patients suffering from other chronic respiratory disease than asthma, such as
             sarcoidosis and COPD will also be excluded.

          4. Pregnant and nursing women will be excluded as well as women planning pregnancy during
             the study period.

          5. A history of allergy towards study drugs will lead to exclusion.

        Patients who during the study period develop lower respiratory infections or due to severe
        uncontrolled asthma receive treatment with any of the above listed types of medicine will
        be excluded. Patients who are diagnosed with other chronic respiratory disease than asthma
        during the study period will also be excluded, as well as patients who during the study
        period require more asthma medicine than the planned study medication.

        Any participant who wishes to leave the study, for any reason, including unacceptable
        side-effects, during the study period will be excluded, as well as anyone who wants to
        withdraw their recorded data from the project after the study period has ended.

        In case of unacceptable side-effects to varenicline resulting in immediate cessation of
        treatment with this drug, the participant will continue visits unchanged, but he/she will
        be excluded from the calculations of tobacco cessation succes-rate. However, varenicline
        cessation up to 4 weeks after treatment start with varenicline will result in exclusion and
        replacement of the participant.

        Cessation of treatment with budesonide will result in exclusion from the rest the study.
        The person will not be replaced. The data recorded from the participant until the last
        visit before cessation will be used.

        Allergic reactions towards study drugs will result in immediate cessation of the drug, and
        possible exclusion, as described in the above.
