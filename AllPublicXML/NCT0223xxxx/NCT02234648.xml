  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the global health issues associated with poor cardiovascular function, interventions
      that help reduce the severity, with emphasis on prevention would not only have economic
      implications, but would also improve health, wellbeing and quality of life. Research provides
      evidence that consumption of a diet high in plant foods and rich is polyphenols is associated
      with a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (Hung et al 2004). Tart
      Montmorency cherries have been shown to be high in numerous phytochemicals (Wang et al 1999;
      Seeram et al 2001). Several of these compounds, are known to be vasoactive and improve blood
      vessel function by increasing bioavailability of vasodilators (Mudnic et al 2012), reducing
      vasoconstrictors (Broncel et al 2010), decreasing platelet aggregation (Hubbart et al 2006)
      and increasing blood vessel dilation (Schroeter et al 2006). Impaired function of the lining
      of blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction) has been linked to increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease. However, the bioavailability of all the compounds in Tart Montmorency
      Cherry Juice and their efficacy with respect to vascular function has not been fully
      determined. This study will examine the influence of tart Montmorency cherry juice on
      cardiovascular function, specifically arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity and blood
      flow in the microcirculation by laser Doppler imaging. This study will also examine digital
      volume pulse and pulse wave analysis. These data will provide information on the ability of
      TMCJ to affect blood flow and vascular function.

      Participants provided blood samples immediately before supplementation and sequentially 8h
      post ingestion. Additionally, vascular measurements including laser Doppler imaging (LDI),
      pulse wave analysis (PWA), pulse wave velocity (PWV), digital volume pulse (DVP) and blood
      pressure (BP) were performed with the participant in a supine position. LDI, PWV, PWA, and
      DVP were measured at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8h intervals. BP was performed at hourly intervals. All
      vascular measurements took place on the non - cannulated arm. No additional food or fluid was
      provided during the study period except for low-nitrate mineral water. Following a minimum of
      two weeks washout, the participants were required to return to the laboratory to repeat the
      procedure with the other intervention drink.
