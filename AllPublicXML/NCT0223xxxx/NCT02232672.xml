      Prostate cancer is currently the leading newly diagnosed cancer in the industrialized world.
      Treatment of prostate cancer is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. Current methods
      for staging of bone metastases are known to be inaccurate. Staging of lymph nodes requires
      surgery associated with risk of bleeding etc. Prior studies from our department suggest that
      PET/CT is useful in staging of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. The aim of
      this study is to compare the usefulness of MeAIB PET/CT with current methods for the staging
      of bone and lymph node metastases in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.

      Better initial staging will result in better treatment of the individual patient. If we are
      able to develop a more accurate and non-invasive method of staging patients with undetected
      metastases on current staging will be spared of the side-effects associated with current
      treatment and staging- impotence, incontinence, radiation damage, bleeding, infection etc.

      1. Introduction. Cancer of the prostate (PCa) is currently the leading newly diagnosed
           cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men in the industrialized
           world . In Denmark alone more than 4000 men are yearly diagnosed with PCa . As PCa
           primarily affects elderly patients, one can assume that PCa will become one of the most
           important medical issues in the developed world due to the already high incidence
           combined with a growing population of elderly men.

           The aetiology of the disease is not well understood. In its most common form PCa evolves
           from the glandular tissue of the prostate. Metastatic spread will most commonly happen
           as lymphogenous spread to the regional lymph nodes or as haematogenous spread to the red
           bone marrow .

           Intended curative treatment of PCa is associated with considerable side effects, in
           particular incontinence, impotence and radiation damage to the surrounding tissues.
           Furthermore, over 30% of patients with organ-confined disease, which was treated with
           radical prostatectomy, will have biochemical relapse within 10 years . Relapse may be
           due to local recurrent disease suggesting poor surgical quality or poor initial staging
           with undetected metastases at the time of treatment.

           At diagnosis patients are stratified as having low, intermediary or high risk of
           dissieminatio according to D'Amico . Patients with intermediate or high risk of
           dissemination will be examined further with whole-body bone scintigraphy (WBS) and
           pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).

        2. Background.

           2.1. Current staging and limitations. WBS has been the examination of choice for
           evaluation of potential dissemination to bone. WBS utilizes 99mTc-labeled methylene
           diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) that binds to the bone matrix formed by the osteoblasts. Gamma
           cameras detect the γ-radiation emitted by the decaying tracer thereby creating a
           2-dimentional image depicting local osteoblast activity .

           Several limitations apply to the use of WBS in staging of patients with PCa. Sensitivity
           has reported as low as 39% in lesion-based analysis in patients with a low number of
           lesions . This combines with a low sensitivity due to many equivocal lesions caused by
           other bone pathology than metastasis.

           Sensitivity and specificity is improved by the use of single-photon emission computed
           tomography (SPECT), where the same tracer as with WBS is used to generate a
           three-dimensional image using a rotating gamma camera. This method also gives better
           anatomical information on the exact position of a potential metastasis.

           The examination of choice for the evaluation of potential metastases to lymph nodes is
           extended PLND . This procedure is done either prior to radiotherapy or during
           prostatectomy in patients with intermediate or high risk of dissemination. The optimal
           extent of the dissection is debated. The extended PLND performed at our institution
           includes the nodes in the obturator fossa, the nodes over the external iliac artery and
           vein, the nodes around the internal iliac artery and the nodes along the common iliac
           artery up to the crossing of the ureter. This dissection is assumed to include
           approximately 75% of lymph nodes known to harbor primary prostatic lymph node metastases
           . Extended PLND is surgically demanding with risk of lymphocele formation, infectious
           complications and severe bleeding due the lymph nodes' close proximity to the large
           vessels in the pelvis. All in all extended PLND is perhaps the best option for lymph
           node staging of PCa but it cannot be considered as optimal due to the above-mentioned
           issues.

           2.2 Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Positron Emission Tomography combined with
           Computerized Tomography (PET/CT) is a well-established tool in diagnosing and staging of
           several types of cancer . PET is an imaging technique where pairs of gamma rays emitted
           by positron-emitting radionuclide tracer are detected, producing a three-dimensional
           image of tracer concentration based on the amount of gamma rays emitted. The radioactive
           tracer is coupled to a biologically active molecule depending on the organ or metabolic
           process of interest . These images can then be fused with CT to create a combined
           functional and high-resolution anatomical image. Several tracers have been developed for
           use in cancer diagnostics and staging. As of now, PET/CT has no generally accepted role
           in the diagnosing or staging of PCa neither in Europe nor in the US .

           2.2.1 Choline. Choline is a precursor for phosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid that is
           integrated in the cell membrane making it a marker for cell membrane turnover and
           metabolism . 11C-Choline was first used as a PET tracer in 1997 . Since then many
           studies have been performed with 11C-Choline and later 18F-Choline (FCH) having
           approximately the same properties as 11C-Choline, but with a longer half-life (110 min
           vs. 20 min) making it more versatile in every-day use. A recent study from our
           department tested the use of FCH-PET/CT in detecting lymph node metastasis in 210
           patients with PCa . The study concluded that FCH-PET/CT was not ideally suited for lymph
           node staging but could give additional information about bone metastasis. Several other
           investigators have also implied this , . A likely reason for the better detection of
           metastasis to the bone is that bone metastasis in an early stage is actually bone-marrow
           metastases rather than bone matrix metastasis and that it most likely that bone-marrow
           metastases proceed to bone matrix metastases. These will not be detectable by WBS (and
           probably not by CT and MRI either). Larger prospective series on the use of FCH-PET/CT
           for imaging of bone metastasis in PCa-patients have not yet been produced.

           2.2.2 MeAIB. α-(N-methyl-11C)-methylaminobutyric acid (MeAIB) is an amino acid analog
           that concentrates into cells only via the System A amino acid transport system, which
           has been shown to be highly upregulated in malignant cells making it a potential target
           for oncological imaging . The tracer has been developed by our local chief radiochemist
           and studies on biodistribution and dosimetry conclude that MeAIB is a tracer usable in
           humans with radiation doses lower than other used PET-tracers , . Clinical studies on
           the use of MeAIB-PET/CT in oncology are sparse , . The use of MeAIB-PET/CT in PCa has
           not been investigated. Unpublished data suggests that MeAIB could prove useful in
           diagnosing PCa because of a high uptake in prostatic tumors . Due to the short half-life
           of 11C (20 min.) an onsite cyclotron is required for performing the study, and thus this
           is possible in Odense.

        3. Trial objective. To evaluate the diagnostic value of MeAIB-PET/CT in detecting bone and
           lymph node metastases in 30 patients with newly diagnosed PCa

        4. Method. Patients included will have a choline-PET/CT perfomed as part of another
           project. In addition a MeAIB-PET/CT will be performed. The MeAIB PET/CT is performed
           with a single acquisition 1 hour after injection of tracer. All scans are performed in
           random order within three weeks and the images interpreted by a specialist in nuclear
           medicine and a specialist in radiology. Images are interpreted based on visual
           evaluation with supplementary measurements of SUV. Activity in lymph nodes will be
           recorded according to their location - external iliac vein, obturator fossa and internal
           iliac artery and vein.
