  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot clinical study is to perform a randomized placebo-controlled study to
      assess the beneficial effect of a 3 month-treatment with Bazedoxifene/Conjugated Estrogens
      (BZA/CE) vs. placebo on glucose homeostasis and body composition in 20 post-menopausal women.
      The recruitment will be performed at Tulane Health Sciences Center.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at 3 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be assessed through change in body mass index (BMI), waist to hip circumference (WHR), and body composition DEXA scans conducted at baseline and at 3 months post-treatment. The change in 3 months will show if BZA/CE has any effect on decreasing abdominal fat.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Glucose Homeostasis</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at 3 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed through a 2-hour IV Glucose Tolerance Tests conducted at baseline and 3 months. The changes in glucose and insulin levels throughout the test will determine if the body is able to process glucose normally.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systematic Inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at 3 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Systematic inflammation will be measured through serum cytokines (Leptin, insulin, adiponectin, RBP4, LCN2, TNFa, IL6, PAI01, FGF21) taken at baseline and 3 months. The changes in these levels will provide information if BZA/CE can improve systematic inflammation.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to BZA/CE will receive a daily tablet containing conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg and bazedoxifene 20 mg. BZA/CE (bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens) tablets, 0.45 mg/20 mg are oval, biconvex, pink tablets, branded with &quot;0.45/20&quot; in black ink on one side. The recommended and only FDA approved dosage is one BZA/CE tablet daily, taken without regard to meals. Tablets should be swallowed whole. If a dose of BZA/CE is missed, participants will be instructed to take it as soon as remembered unless it is almost time for the next scheduled dose. They should not take two doses at the same time. The dose is one tablet per day independent of weight and fat mass. Participants will be provided with information about BZA/CE and its potential side effects and contraindications.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to placebo will receive a daily tablet that matches the BZA/CE to maintain the blind. Placebo tablets, 0.45 mg/20 mg are oval, biconvex, pink tablets, branded with &quot;0.45/20&quot; in black ink on one side. Also to assure the blind is maintain, participants in the placebo group will be given the same instructions for taking the study medication.Tablets should be swallowed whole. If a dose, participants will be instructed to take it as soon as remembered unless it is almost time for the next scheduled dose. They should not take two doses at the same time. The dose is one tablet per day independent of weight and fat mass. Participants will be provided with information about BZA/CE and its potential side effects and contraindications, again to maintain the blind.</description>
