        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male subjects, 18-55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the

             screening;

          -  Medically healthy subjects with clinically insignificant screening and check-in
             results (medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram [ECG], physical examination, and
             laboratory tests); and

          -  Subjects who are able to understand and are willing and able to give their signed
             informed consent before any trial-related procedures are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently diagnosed or a history of asthma, urticarial, angioedema, anaphylaxis,
             atopic dermatitis, clinically significant abnormality of skin of the abdomen, cancer,

          -  Presence or history of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             condition (including surgery) known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of medicines;

          -  Systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure
             outside the range of 40 to 90 mmHg, and/or pulse rate outside the range of 40 to 100
             beats per minute after one repeat at screening or check-in;

          -  Abnormal ECG at screening as judged by the Investigator;

             Investigator;

          -  Allergy to sesame, sesame oil, or a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic
             reaction to compounds related to the study drug

          -  Subjects undergoing current treatment with other androgens (i.e.
             dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]), anabolic steroids, other sex hormones, or drugs that
             interfere with the metabolism of testosterone (i.e. opioids, anastrozole, clomiphene,
             dutasteride, finasteride, flutamide, ketoconazole, spironolactone, and testolactone);

          -  Subjects treated within the past 12 months with estrogens, gonadotropin releasing
             hormone (GnRH) agonists, or growth hormone;

          -  Prescription, over the counter medications, vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements
             taken within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the dose of study
             medication and duration of the study;

          -  Positive screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis
             C at screening;

          -  Positive urine screen for drugs of abuse (amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
             cocaine, marijuana, methadone, methamphetamines, oxycodone, and opiates) or positive
             breath alcohol test at screening and check-in
