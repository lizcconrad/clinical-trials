  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is the ExoSeal VSD non-inferior to Angio-Seal vascular closure device (VSD) in the incidence
      of adverse access site related events at 30 days.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized (1:1) controlled, single blind, single center study in 2000
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients comparing the ExoSeal VCD (test device) to
      the AngioSeal VCD (standard comparator). In-hospital and 30 days safety and efficacy
      endpoints and 6 months safety endpoints will be reported.

    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Insignificant bleeding seen on the bandage or small continuous oozing is considered haemostasis. Continuous oozing will be counted as a Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 1 bleeding event</description>

    <measure>Pain and discomfort related to the closure procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Closure procedure and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed on a numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 (no pain or discomfort) to 10 (worst possible pain or discomfort) Scripted language will be used when discussing pain scores with the patient. Pain and discomfort score will be assessed just before and immediately after the closure procedure and reported. The delta-value will be reported and compared. The patient will be given predefined standardized instructions on how to rate and that only pain and discomfort related to the closure procedure should be assessed</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to mobilization</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>From start of closure procedure to patient is mobilized. Patients treated for ST-elevation myocardial infarction are assessed separately</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 days</time_frame>
