      LAARGE aims to show the care reality of patients whose left atrial appendage (LAA) is closed
      by an implantable medical device. In particular the following questions should be answered:

        -  Indication: For which reasons is the indication for implantation of LAA-Occluder put for
           patients with atrial fibrillation?

        -  Safety: How save is the implantation of LAA-Occluders (procedural, in hospital and in
           the long term course)? How frequent are bleeding complications and what is the relation
           of observed and expected bleeding complications (according HAS-BLED score)?

        -  Effectiveness: How effective is implantation of LAA-Occluders in daily clinical practice
           (in hospital and in the long term course)? How frequent are strokes and what is the
           relation of observed and expected strokes (according CHADS-VASC score)?

        -  Concomitant treatment: Which concomitant treatment is prescribed for patients with
           LAA-Occluder?
