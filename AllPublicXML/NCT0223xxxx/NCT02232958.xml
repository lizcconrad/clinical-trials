  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to extend our previous work, in which we demonstrated an
      increase in the internal and cross network connectivity of resting state neural networks in
      patients with cerebral small vessel disease by treatment with hyperbaric oxygen, to at least
      20 more individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients without contraindications to Hyperbaric Oxygen treatment or magnetic resonance
      imaging who exhibit white matter hyper-intensities on MRI will be recruited to have a
      functional MRI followed by10 hyperbaric oxygen treatments at 2 ATA for one hour. These
      treatments will be done once daily, from Monday through Friday, on 2 consecutive weeks. 4-6
      weeks later, they have a repeat fMRI. These fMRI's will be analyzed regarding any changes in
      the resting state connectivity of various circuits.

    <description>Patients are placed in a special chamber in which the pressure is gradually increased up to the desired pressure with 100% Oxygen and the patient is kept at that pressure for one hour. Then the Oxygen flow is slowly reduced until the patient has been returned to one atmosphere of pressure.</description>
