  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether adding everolimus to hormone treatment before
      breast surgery will increase the chances of shrinking the breast cancer in those patients
      with hormone-responsive breast cancer and a lower Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score ( 25 or
      less), compared to prior experience with hormone therapy alone. Everolimus is a drug
      currently approved for use by the United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic kidney or breast cancer. Everolimus is
      considered investigational for non-metastatic breast cancer patients.

      This is a single arm open-labeled neoadjuvant phase II clinical trial evaluating everolimus
      in combination with an aromatase inhibitor in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor
      positive/HER2 negative breast cancers with low and intermediate risk (&lt; 25) Recurrence Scores
      by Oncotype Dx.

    <description>(PEPI) preoperative endocrine prognostic index. The total PEPI score assigned to each patient is the sum of the risk points derived from the pT stage, pN stage, Ki67 level, and estrogen receptor status of the surgical specimen. An HR in the range of 1-2 receives one risk point; a HR in the 2-2.5 range, two risk points; a HR greater than 2.5, three risk points. The total risk point score for each patient is the sum of all the risk points accumulated from the four factors in the model.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of hormone receptor positive,
             HER2 negative invasive breast carcinoma.

          -  Tumors must be estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive according to ASCO/CAP
             2010 guidelines as either ER or PR ≥ 1% positive nuclear staining by

             will not be accepted.

          -  Tumors must be HER2 negative as defined according to ASCO/CAP 2013, as HER2 0 - 1+ by
             IHC or non-amplified FISH or CISH. If HER2 IHC is 2+, FISH/CISH must be performed and
             must not be positive (must be a ratio of &lt; 2), but otherwise FISH/CISH is not required
             if IHC is 0 or 1+ by institutional standards.

                  &gt; 1 cm must have an Oncotype Dx and the score must be &lt; 25. Lesions less than 1
                  cm in size are not required to have an Oncotype Dx. One lesion (typically the
                  largest) should be designated as the target lesion for which clinical and
                  radiographic response to the neoadjuvant therapy will be judged.

               -  Patients with a hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative invasive cancer that
                  meets study criteria may have ductal carcinoma in situ in another quadrant of the
                  same breast or in the contralateral breast even if the DCIS is hormone
