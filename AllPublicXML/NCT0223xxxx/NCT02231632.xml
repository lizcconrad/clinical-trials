  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Live attenuated Poliomyelitis vaccine (human diploid cell) is used for poliovirus prevention
      in children above 2 years old , Which was developed by Institute of Medical Biology , Chinese
      Academy of Medical Sciences , based on the other two products : Poliomyelitis Vaccine in
      Dragee Candy (Monkey Kidney Cell), Live ; and Poliomyelitis（Live）Vaccine (Monkey Kidney
      Cell),Oral . After its safety been proved in phase 1 clinical trail evaluation , the phase
      2/3 trail was started in Guangxi Province, China during 2011-2012. The purpose of this trial
      is to assess the safety and immunogenicity in healthy children of 2,3 and 4 months old .

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of virogene VP1 genovariation between vaccinal I-III Sabin strains and poliovirus separated from faeces of study objects after vaccinated</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>20 children aged 4 years old and 20 infants aged 2 months were vaccinated with 3 dose of Live attenuated Poliomyelitis vaccine (human diploid cell). Their faeces on day 0,7,30,60 and 90 were collected and incubated in L20B and RD cells for 2 generations, in order to separate and amplify poliovirus I-III Sabin strains in faeces of study objects . Extract total viral RNA from the culture supernatants and detect virogene VP1 through RT-PCR and sequencing ,in order to test the genovariation of vaccinal I-III Sabin strains in faeces after vaccinated .</description>

    <measure>The frequency of all the adverse events in vaccine group and placebo group</measure>

    <description>compare frequency of all the solicited events, unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events between vaccine groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of seroconversion from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Randomly chose 600 infants respectively from two study arms, get 2.5ml of the blood on the first day and 3 months during vaccination .Reciprocal antibody titers of at least 1:8, the lowest detectable titer, is considered to indicate seropositivity with regards to the presence of poliovirus neutralizing antibodies. Seroconversion is defined as either seronegative participants (&lt;1:8 titers) who become seropositive (≥1:8) or participants who demonstrate a 4-fold change in titers between two specimens, e.g. a change from 1:8 to 1:32. Chi-square tests will be used to test the statistical significance among seroconversion rates across study arms.</description>
