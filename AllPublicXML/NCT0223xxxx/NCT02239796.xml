  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of undertaking a phase III trial of
      transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve electrical stimulation (TPTNS) to alleviate
      stroke-related urinary incontinence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke-related urinary incontinence (UI) persists in more than one third of stroke survivors.
      It is associated with significant burden including reduced quality of life, increased
      morbidity and disability. Urgency UI, together with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms
      (frequency, urgency, nocturia), is most commonly experienced. Current continence care is
      limited to lifestyle advice and behavioural interventions such as voiding programmes. There
      is a reliance on containment approaches and a lack of available options for active treatment.
      Intermittent electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve (TPTNS) is effective for
      treating non-stroke neurogenic UI and OAB, but has not been tested in the stroke population.
      This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the potential effectiveness of
      TPTNS for stroke-related bladder dysfunction. Adults with stroke-related UI will be
      randomised to TPTNS or sham. They and/or their carer will be taught to self-deliver a
      programme of TPTNS over a six week period. Bladder function, associated healthcare costs and
      quality of life outcomes will be measured at 6, 12 and 26 weeks. A nested process evaluation
      will be conducted. Pilot RCT and process evaluation results will inform the design of a phase
      III RCT of TPTNS to treat urinary incontinence in the stroke population.

    <description>12 stimulation sessions of 30 minutes duration, delivered twice weekly over a 6 week period using a NeuroTrac continence stimulator.
Two surface electrodes are applied to the non-hemiparetic ankle, where appropriate, or the right ankle where no hemiparesis exists. The electrical stimulator is pre-programmed to safely deliver 30 minutes of continuous stimulation with a pulse frequency of 10 hertz and pulse width 200µs22. The intensity of the current will depend on the stroke survivor's perception threshold and individual comfort and is self-adjusted at each session, but will normally range between 15 and 40 milliamps.</description>

    <description>The sham stimulation group will self- or carer-deliver a similar programme of twelve, 30 minute sessions twice weekly for 6 weeks NeuroTrac continence stimulator.
The surface electrodes will be positioned on the lateral malleolar area of the ankle, not the medial aspect, to avoid the posterior tibial nerve.
The stimulation intensity will be increased until sensation is reported, then turned down to 4mA for the 30 minute session, ensuring that despite avoiding the posterior tibial nerve, there is no therapeutic stimulation provided.</description>

    <description>Electrically stimulating the sacral nerve plexus modulates the L4-S3 nerve roots that control bladder function and urethral sphincter activity to eliminate inappropriate detrusor contractions while leaving the micturition reflex intact.
Transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (TPTNS) is a technique of non-invasive retrograde electrical stimulation of the sacral plexus via the sciatic nerve. The posterior tibial nerve, a tributary of the sciatic nerve, is accessed using surface electrodes applied to the medial malleolar area. We are using NeuroTrac continence stimulators.</description>
