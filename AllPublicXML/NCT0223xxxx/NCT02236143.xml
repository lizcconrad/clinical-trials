  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to develop new ways to acquire MRI data and/or new
      ways to analyze the acquired data.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acquired data will be used to investigate the structure and function of the body. In
      addition the developmental aspect of this study, certain information may be used to obtain
      normal values for healthy adult structural and functional information. This information would
      be valuable if and when the developed methods are incorporated into future clinical studies
      involving patient populations which would be recruited under separate protocols. Our
      hypotheses is that imaging and spectroscopy methods can be developed to a level where the
      increased sensitivity and resolution of 7 Tesla (7T) MRI will improve the non-invasive
      studies of the human body.

        Healthy male or females over the age of 18, recruiting by invitation only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female volunteer over the age of 18

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include those associated with the use of MR as the imaging
             modality. The specific set of exclusion criteria for a given study will depend on the
             specific study to be performed which will be made clear on initial contact and during
             consent. In addition, other medical conditions deemed by the PI or associates to make
             the patient ineligible for protocol procedures may also arise.

          -  Exclusion criteria will be assessed during a safety screening interview and during
             final consent. A questionnaire will be provided regarding general health and
             exclusion/inclusion criteria. The investigator doing the interview will determine if
             any of the exclusion criteria apply. Subjects will be asked:

               1. To describe any previous surgeries to help subjects and study staff open a
                  dialogue as to any possible contraindications listed in the yes/no section below.

               2. If they are claustrophobic and to rate the severity.

               3. If they wear hearing aids and if they can be removed for the scan.

               4. If they have a transdermal delivery system, and if yes where is it located and if
                  it can be removed for the study.

               5. If they wear colored contact lenses and, if yes, can they be removed for the
                  study.

               6. To provide a list of medications, dosages and time of last dose for medicines
                  taken regularly.

               7. To identify if they have any pre-existing medical conditions including
                  Hypertension, Hypotension, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease and Fever.

               8. To identify if they ever had an operation.

               9. To indicate if they have ever been injured by a metallic foreign body which was
                  never removed.

              10. If they wear braces and/or if they have removable bridgework, false teeth or a
                  permanent retainer.

              11. If they have any tattoos, non-removable body piercings or hair extensions.

              12. If they are currently using/wearing an IUD or diaphragm.

              13. If they have any reason to believe they are pregnant. (If the subjects are unsure
                  about their pregnancy status, test kits will be available to subjects).

          -  In addition, a set of yes/no questions will be asked in the screening form for the
             patient to confirm or deny the presence of items that may be hazardous to their safety
             and/or some interfere with the MRI examination, including:

        No Cardiac pacemaker

        No Implanted cardiac defibrillator

        No Carotid artery vascular clamp

        No Intravascular stents, filters, or coils

        No Aortic clip

        No Internal pacing wires

        No Vascular access port and/or catheter

        No Swan-Ganz catheter

        No Shunt (spinal or intraventricular)

        No Aneurysm clip(s)

        No Neurostimulator

        No Electrodes (on body, head, or brain)

        No Heart valve prosthesis

        No Any type of prosthesis (eye, penile, etc.)

        No Artificial limb or joint replacement

        No Bone growth/fusion stimulator

        No Bone/joint pin, screw, nail, wire, plate

        No Metal rods in bones

        No Harrington rods (spine)

        No Metal or wire mesh implants

        No Wire sutures or surgical staples

        No Insulin pump or infusion device

        No Any metal fragments (i.e. metal shop)

        No Any implant held in place by a magnet

        No Cochlear, otologic, or ear implant
