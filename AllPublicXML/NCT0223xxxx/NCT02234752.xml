      Aim: To examine the efficacy of the combination of galantamine and memantine for the
      treatment of cognitive deficits in outpatients with schizophrenia.

      Hypothesis: A combination of galantamine and memantine will improve cognitive impairments in
      patients with schizophrenia.

      This is an open-label study to evaluate whether a six week course of galantamine ER and
      memantine XR is effective in improving the cognitive performance of patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The primary outcome measure will be the change in
      level of cognition as measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The results
      of the MATRICS collaborative project recommended the need for standardized cognitive tests
      that better distinguish the different facets of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. The
      MCCB will assess the following seven domains: attention/vigilance, reasoning and problem
      solving, processing speed, social cognition, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and
      memory, and working memory. The MCCB will be administered at baseline and at the end of the
      study. We will report total score and each domain score in the MCCB at baseline and six
      weeks.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the change in level of cognition as measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). In schizophrenia, usual composite scores are 20-39. In healthy controls, usual composite scores are normalized to 40-60. Higher values of composite scores mean better cognition. Test scores are normalized to healthy controls, therefore no min-max range is available. Final scores calculated by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery software. Exact minimum/maximum are not known to provider. Overall composite scores are reported.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome measure will be the change in level of cognition as measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). In schizophrenia, usual composite scores are 20-39. In healthy controls, usual composite scores are normalized to 40-60. Higher values of composite scores mean better cognition. Test scores are normalized to healthy controls, therefore no min-max range is available. Final scores calculated by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery software. Exact minimum/maximum are not known to provider. Overall composite scores are reported.</description>
