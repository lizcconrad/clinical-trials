    <textblock>
      This trials of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) in Tanzania is part of the larger
      Identification and Intervention for Dementia in Elderly Africans (IDEA) study.

      The overall aim of the IDEA study is to set up and evaluate sustainable programmes to
      facilitate diagnosis of, and therapy for, people with dementia led by local communities in
      sub-Saharan Africa. The investigators seek to improve quality of life for people with
      dementia and their caregivers.

      Within this trial of CST, the investigators hypothesise that CST can significantly improve
      the quality of people with dementia and their carers living in Africa

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project will address three specific challenges: 1) Integrate screening and core packages
      of services into routine primary health care. 2) Provide effective and affordable
      community-based care and rehabilitation. 3) Develop effective treatment for use by
      non-specialists, including lay healthcare workers with minimal training.

      Dementia is under-diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and treatment is rarely accessed or
      available. The burden of dementia on caregivers is high, with loss of income, and
      psychosocial stress common. However, large scale screening for dementia in such a setting is
      neither affordable nor sustainable. The purpose of this 3 year project is to provide a
      sustainable mechanism for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for people with dementia.
      The investigators will use 2 complimentary, rural study sites, 1 in Nigeria, West Africa and
      2 in Tanzania, East Africa. As a consequence our results should be generalizable to all SSA.
      Our approach is inexpensive and will have applicability to other low- and middle-income
      countries.

      During Phase I the investigators will validate a screening tool, previously developed by
      members of our study team from data collected in Tanzania, and carry out a pilot study of the
      benefits of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) when used in SSA for those already identified
      with dementia. During both of these activities the investigators will initiate training of
      local healthcare workers in diagnosis and management of people with dementia. In Phase II the
      investigators will engage with local communities to raise awareness of dementia. Building on
      previous work at both study sites, the investigators will initiate poster, newspaper and
      radio advertising and use mobile phone text messaging services (for relevant healthcare
      personnel) to increase awareness of the need to diagnose and intervene at an early stage. The
      investigators will empower local private pharmacies to help identify people with dementia, a
      relationship which will ultimately be mutually beneficial through the supply of medicines to
      treat risk factors for dementia, such as hypertension. The investigators will engage with
      local community leaders and government officials to assist us in this awareness raising, an
      approach that has proven successful in previous studies by our team in SSA. One of our study
      team (Dr Mushi (DM)) is a social scientist based in Tanzania and during Phase II the
      investigators will conduct qualitative research into attitudes and beliefs surrounding
      dementia and identify any barriers to diagnosis in both sites. The results of this research
      will be fed back to inform other phases of the study. Finally, in phase III the investigators
      will initiate a program of community based CST led by local occupational therapists (OTs) and
      nurse specialists. OTs and nurses will train caregivers in CST techniques and the
      investigators hope that the training will ultimately be led by caregivers allowing such
      therapy to become sustainable within communities in the longer term. The investigators will
      evaluate changes in cognition in people with dementia, and quality of life (QOL) in both
      people with dementia and their caregivers, post-intervention. The investigators will carry
      out a full economic evaluation of the effect of our program, to be led by a heath economist
      based at Newcastle University, United Kingdom.

      This protocol cover the CST trial (Phase III of the study) in Nigeria

    <description>Outcomes at baseline will be compared with those immediately post intervention and at four weeks post-intervention.
In accordance with the CST manual protocol, patients will be allocated to groups to ensure a spread of abilities and ensure inclusivity. No group contains only one individual of a particular religion or gender, such that they may feel left out. The investigators will allocate patients to groups to avoid excessive travel to the group meeting place, participants may be allocated to a group based on their geographical location. Individuals will be allocated to groups based on religion, gender and geographical location.</description>

    <description>The CST intervention comprises 14 sessions lasting 1-2 hours across 7 weeks. The CST manual has been adapted for use in this setting by members of our study team. Each session has a theme. Activities include tasks aimed at engaging participants in cognitive and physical tasks designed to improve quality of life. Sessions will be led and facilitated by a study nurse or occupational therapist. The sessions will be held at a local health centre of village hall.</description>
