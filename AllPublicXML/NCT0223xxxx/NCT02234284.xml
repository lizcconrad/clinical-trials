  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study will examine whether health coaches can improve the management of COPD in
      a population of vulnerable patients cared for in 'safety-net' clinics. The study is designed
      as a randomized controlled trial for patients with moderate to severe COPD. Patients will be
      randomized into a health coaching group and a usual care group. Those in the health coaching
      group will receive 9 months of active health coaching. Outcome variables will be measured at
      baseline and after 9 months
