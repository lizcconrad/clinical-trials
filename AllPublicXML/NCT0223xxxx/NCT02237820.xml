  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study assessing the impact of dexamethasone (a glucocorticosteroid with
      negligible mineralocorticoid activity) as compared to prednisone on short-term outcomes of HF
      patients hospitalized with exacerbation of COPD. The study may provide important data
      regarding a simple but potentially robust intervention among large patient population with
      high rates of hospital admissions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An Open-label randomized prospective study of HF patients (NYHA grade II-VI), hospitalized
      with COPD exacerbation. Eighty patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to conventional
      and intervention testament groups. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients prior
      to study enrolment.

      The conventional therapy group will receive 40mg of oral prednisone daily, while the
      intervention group will be treated with oral dexamethasone in an equivalent anti-inflammatory
      dose of 6 mg/day. Glucocorticosteroids will be administered throughout hospitalization and
      will be continued for 7 days after randomization. Dose changes through this period, as well
      as subsequent tapering will be on the discretion of the treating physician. All patients will
      also be treated with short-acting bronchodilators, antibiotics, oxygen, positive pressure
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation and VTE prophylaxis - based on the GOLD 2013 guidelines
      and clinical judgment of the attending physicians. An order for low sodium diet will be
      written. Discharge decisions will be based on the GOLD 2013 discharge criteria list8.
      Patients will be discharge without steroid tapering regimen unless indicated by clinical
      judgment. Tapering regimens will include reduction of steroid dose by 5mg every 5 days and by
      1mg every 7 days for prednisone and dexamethasone respectively.

      Patient's demographic data will be documented at baseline (age, sex, GOLD severity stage,
      data on hospitalizations in the past year, patients' chronic drug therapy).

      On admission and at 14 day follow-up point, patients' weight, height and oxygen saturation
      will be measured and blood will be drawn for evaluation of complete blood count, chemistry,
      NT proBNP levels, troponin, C-reactive protein and venous blood gas. The patients will be
      asked to complete COPD assessment tool (CAT) questionnaire in order to quantify their health
      status. In addition, patients will undergo a chest X-ray, ECG, spirometry and two-dimensional
      echo-Doppler examination.

      A follow-up visit will be performed 14Â±2 days after enrollment. The following measures will
      be obtained: weight, laboratory blood tests (please refer to admission blood tests), CAT
      questionnaire score and documentation of current diuretic dose. In addition, two-dimensional
      echo-doppler examination and spirometry will be performed.

      After study completion, each patient will be followed for 30 more days post discharge in
      order to document further hospitalizations.
