  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will use the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) to generate allergic
      rhinitis symptoms in participants under controlled conditions, to collect well-characterized
      biological samples (urine and blood) before and after they develop these symptoms. The EEU
      provides the ability to control the timing, duration and levels of allergen exposure, and
      also other outside environmental factors, yielding ideal biologic samples for analysis with
      novel, cutting-edge molecular techniques. Results from the analysis of these unique allergic
      rhinitis samples should help determine if the technique of urine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
      analysis could be a useful diagnostic tool in allergic rhinitis. IgE testing will be done on
      blood samples and compared to spin prick testing and symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

      Urine samples will be retained for analysis via nuclear magnetic resonance. Blood samples
      will be retained after separating the mononuclear layer. These samples will be tested for
      epigenetic changes. Blood samples will also be retained for IgE testing.
