  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ROCSS is a randomised controlled trial of the placement of a biological mesh at the site of
      stoma closure. Our hypothesis is that reinforcing the stoma closure site with a collagen mesh
      (Strattice®) is superior to the standard technique in preventing herniation at 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Closure of complex and contaminated abdominal wounds is challenging and carries risks,
      including wound dehiscence and incisional hernias. Use of biological meshes in these
      situations may provide a safe method of reducing these complications, especially long-term
      incisional hernias. ROCSS will use stoma site closure as a model for biological mesh
      placement during any difficult contaminated abdominal wall closures.

      Hernia at the site of stoma closure occurs in up to 30% of patients and is associated with
      adverse effects on quality of life. In up to 10% of cases, patients are submitted to complex
      re-operation which carries significant morbidity. Not all patients will report symptoms or
      undergo repair, as they do not wish to have a further major operation. Incisional hernias at
      the site of stomas closure form an important and well defined subgroup. If there is a
      measurable benefit from mesh insertion, elective use of a collagen mesh would warrant
      consideration in the closure of other difficult, contaminated abdominal wounds. This study
      will also provide useful information on the value of using a CT scan as an early diagnostic
      tool of herniation, which could then be used in future abdominal wall studies as a surrogate
      endpoint for clinical hernia.

      ROCSS aims to assess whether a biological mesh (collagen tissue matrix) reduces the incidence
      of clinically detectable stoma closure site hernias at two years compared to standard closure
      techniques. The primary outcome is Occurrence of clinically detectable hernias at two years
      post randomisation. Other outcomes include surgical re-intervention rate, surgical
      complications at 30 days post-operation and 1 year post-randomisation, quality of life and
      post-operative pain, cost-benefit analysis and radiological hernia rate at one year
      post-randomisation (an exploratory analysis will compare radiological hernia rate at 1 year
      with clinical hernia rate at 2 years to assess the value of using a CT scan as an early
      diagnostic tool of incisional hernias).

      Randomisation is 1:1 between Strattice® mesh vs. standard closure. The sample size for the
      trial is 560 (80% power, 10% dropout/crossover, 40% proportional reduction - 25% to 15%) and
      recruitment will be over 2 years from at least 30 centres. ROCSS will be a double blind
      (observer blind) randomised controlled trial with a CT scan at one year and clinical follow
      up at 2 years. Cost benefit analysis and quality of life analysis will be performed at 2
      years. The sample size will be reviewed prior to reaching target and may be increased 790
      (90% power, 20% dropout/crossover, 40% proportional reduction - 25% to 15%).

    <description>Fascial closure will be the preferred technique of the surgeon without mesh reinforcement. The technique recommended is the fascia should be closed with Prolene, PDS or nylon sutures; Vicryl should not be used for the fascia. This technique can include either interrupted or continuous sutures.
Closure of the muscle, soft tissues and skin is up to the discretion of the operating surgeon.</description>

    <description>The protocol preference is for the mesh to be placed intra-peritoneally fashion (i.e. below the peritoneum). Anchoring bites will be taken in four to six sites of peritoneum (e.g. using 2-0 PDS) and the mesh will be 'parachuted' into place. Once correctly placed, the fascia above will be closed using Prolene, PDS or Nylon (surgeon preference, but excluding Vicryl). Infiltration of up to 40ml 0.25% Marcaine for infiltration into the fascial layer is recommended. The remainder of the closure will be at the surgeon's discretion.</description>
