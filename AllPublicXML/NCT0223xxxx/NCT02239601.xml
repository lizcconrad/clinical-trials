  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) is still unknown. A theory is
      that the microtubule-stabilizing agents that prevent division of cells also affect healthy
      peripheral nerves. Symptoms of CIPN are in the hands/feet and include: pain, numbness, and
      loss of function. An estimated 55-60% of patients will experience lasting symptoms affecting
      function for years post-treatment. Research on nerve disorders identifies that a nerve
      already entrapped/damaged at one site may be at greater risk when combined with chemotherapy
      (double crush syndrome). Physical therapy is an established, effective treatment for
      entrapped nerves and neuropathic pain. This study seeks to identify additional risk factors
      and provide evidence for the role of physical therapy in the treatment of CIPN.

      Hypotheses

        1. Physical therapy will assist in managing symptoms (sensory, pain, edema) compared to the
           control group during chemotherapy.

        2. Positive tests for mechanical entrapment prior to chemotherapy will result in more
           severe symptoms of CIPN.

        3. The treatment group will have greater resolution of CIPN symptoms compared to control at
           the six month follow-up.
