  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait and balance disorders are important public health problem necessitating studies to try
      to prevent falls. Many studies have dealt with spatiotemporal gait parameters or balance
      during quiet standing (posturography). Nevertheless, falls occurred predominantly during
      gait, and rarely during quiet standing. We have developed a tool to measure balance during
      gait : the braking of the center of mass (CM), a biomechanical parameter obtained from the
      vertical velocity of the CM recorded with a force plate.

      In previous studies, we have shown that the braking of the CM was a physiological and a
      active mechanism, reflecting balance during gait. Unfortunately, the braking of the CM
      measured on a force plate provide an important intra-individual variability.

      The 3D optoelectronic gait analysis system (VICON) also provide an estimation of the CM. The
      primary goal of this study is to compare intra-individual variability of the braking of the
      CM determined by a force plate or the 3D optoelectronic gait analysis system (VICON) in
      healthy subjects.

    <description>Subjects, barefoot and standing upright and motionless on a force plate, were instructed to walk for 10 m following a beep delivered by the experimenter. Two experimental conditions were tested: (i) the 'natural' gait condition where subjects walked normally and (ii) the 'fast' gait condition where subjects walked as fast as they could, taking large steps. Each subject performed 10 trials in each condition.</description>
