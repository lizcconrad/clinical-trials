  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first randomized, open-label, national, multicenter, phase II study
      assessing the efficacy and safety of OCLU in subjects with pretreated progressive pancreatic,
      inoperable, somatostatin receptor positive, well differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine
      tumors (WDpNET). Subjects must have experienced documented progression of disease within 1
      year prior to the start of the study. The control group of patients receiving Sutent will be
      used as internal control to assess the hypothesis of 12 months PFS equal to 35% in patients
      receiving Sutent.
