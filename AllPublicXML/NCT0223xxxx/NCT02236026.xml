             time during the 6 months prior to Screening;

          -  Is currently using, or has used within 6 months prior to Screening, hormonal
             contraception or progestin intrauterine device.

          -  Has known or suspected carcinoma of the breast;

          -  Has benign or malignant liver tumors or acute liver disease;

          -  Has current or past thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders or a family history
             of thromboembolic disorders;

          -  Has a personal history of myocardial disease, Long QT Syndrome or a personal or family
             history of Long QT Syndrome (e.g., Anderson-Tawil Syndrome [micrognathia, low set
             ears, clinodactyly]; Timothy's Syndrome [syndactyly and autism spectrum disorder];:
             Jervell/Lange-Nielsen Syndrome [bilateral hearing loss]; Romano-Ward Syndrome
             [fainting, seizures]), unexplained syncope or presyncope, or current or recurrent
             hypokalemia.

          -  Has a family history in genetically related grandparents, parents, uncles/aunts,
             cousins, or children of Long QT Syndrome, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, or unexplained
             sudden death before 50 years of age.

          -  Has an abnormal 12-lead ECG, with clinically significant abnormalities of rate,
             rhythm, or conduction including: HR &lt; 45 or &gt; 90 beats per minute (bpm), after a 5
             minute supine rest; PR interval &gt; 220 ms; QRS interval &gt; 120 ms; QTcF or corrected QT
             interval using Bazett's formula (to be determined by Investigator) &gt; 450 ms; QTcF &lt;
             300 ms; Any degree of clinically significant fascicular block, bundle branch block, or
             intraventricular conduction delay; QRS and/or T wave that the Investigator judges to
             be unfavorable for consistently accurate QT measurements (e.g., indistinct QRS onset,
             low amplitude T wave, inverted or terminally inverted T wave, merged T/U waves,
             indistinct T wave offset, or prominent U wave that affects QT measurement);
             Neuromuscular artifact that cannot be readily eliminated;

          -  Has, on ECG, premature atrial or ventricular beats or other findings that in the
             Investigator's opinion represent clinically significant excessive HR variation;

          -  Has any clinically significant deviation from normal in any of the screening tests or
             initial exams that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might present a safety risk
             for participation or would confound analysis or interpretation of the study results;

          -  Has participated in a clinical study or used any investigational drug within the 60
             days prior to Screening;

          -  Requires the use of medication, including over-the-counter products, or nutritional
             supplements, with the exception of aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. Medications
             are not exclusionary if they are discontinued as described below; however, under no
             circumstance should medication be discontinued if doing so would place a subject at
             risk; Medications (including nutritional supplements) known to be moderate or potent
             inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, or to prolong the QT/QTc interval, must be
             discontinued at least 21 days prior to study entry (Day -1 of Treatment Period 1); All
             other prescription medications must be discontinued at least 14 days prior to study
             entry (Day -1 of Treatment Period 1), unless in the opinion of the Investigator the
             concomitant use of such medication does not place the subject at risk and will not
             confound the collection, analysis, or interpretation of study data; Over-the-counter
             medications (including nutritional supplements) must be discontinued at least 7 days
             prior to study entry (Day -1 of Treatment Period 1);

          -  Foods or beverages containing alcohol, caffeine, xanthine, or grapefruit are not
             allowed within 48 hours of Day -1 of each treatment period.

          -  Has a positive hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screen;

          -  Has a positive test for alcohol or drugs of abuse, or a history of known or suspected
             alcohol or drug abuse;

          -  Has used tobacco products within 6 months prior to Screening, or has a positive urine
             test for tobacco use;

          -  Has donated more than 400 mL of blood/plasma in the 60 days prior to Day -1 of
             Treatment Period 1;

          -  Is unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent or comply with the
             activities or instructions of the study;

          -  Is judged by the Investigator to be unsuitable for any reason.
