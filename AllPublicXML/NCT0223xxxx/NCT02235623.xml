    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial designed to evaluate testicular outcomes after a single stage
      versus a two-stage surgical procedure to fix an undescended, one-sided testicle located in
      the abdomen. Also to determine and compare the costs, surgical complications and the health
      related quality of life for the two procedures. Testicular outcomes will be measured using a
      scrotal ultrasound 6-12 months after the procedure (after the second stage procedure for
      those randomized to a 2 stage surgery).

    <description>To evaluate the volume of the operated testis at 6-12 months after single-stage Fowler-Stephens orchidopexy (FSO) (6-12 months after two- stage FSO), as determined by ultrasound measurements. This will be compared to the intra-operative testicular measurements done during the laparoscopy.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Boys age 4 months to 36 months

          -  Undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy for unilateral non-palpable testis, who are found at
             laparoscopy to have an abdominal undescended testis, in whom a Fowler-Stephens
             Orchiopexy would be appropriate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 36 months

          -  Age &lt; 4 months

          -  Bilateral cryptorchidism

          -  Solitary testis

          -  Findings at laparoscopy for which Fowler-Stephens Orchiopexy would not be indicated

          -  Intra-operative mobility of the intra-abdominal testis such that, with no (or minimal)
             mobilization, the testis is able to reach the contralateral internal ring, without
             dividing the spermatic vessels.

          -  Assessment of whether a single stage primary orchidopexy will be performed, is
             entirely at the discretion of the attending surgeon.
