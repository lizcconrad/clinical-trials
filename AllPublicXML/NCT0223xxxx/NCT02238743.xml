  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the Project ADOPT- Ventral Hernia case-series is to collect clinical outcome
      data following the completion of a hands-on proctorship training model in laparoscopic
      ventral hernia repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ADOPT- Ventral Hernia project is designed as a prospective, single arm, case series. The
      proctor will select a limited number of licensed surgeon trainees (up to 5) as agreed upon by
      Covidien and the proctor. The proctor will then train through clinical immersions, hands on
      proctorship and video training for proper technique on minimally invasive surgical (MIS)
      repair of ventral hernia. After the training, the data will be collected on the trainee's
      next 10 MIS ventral hernia repair cases, pending subject consent to collect data. Procedural
      and Post-Operative details will be captured for each of these subjects who have undergone the
      laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.
