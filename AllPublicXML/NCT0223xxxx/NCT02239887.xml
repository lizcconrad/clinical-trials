      Purpose To establish the safety and efficacy of the Coherex WaveCrest Left Atrial Appendage
      Occlusion System for left atrial appendage (LAA) closure during treatment of non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation in patients who are at increased risk for embolic stroke and have an
      ongoing indication for oral anticoagulation.

      Primary Safety Endpoint The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of major adverse events
      up to 45 days post-procedure. Major adverse events are defined as life-threatening incidents
      as determined by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) and include events such as device
      embolization; cardiac injury, re-intervention, and/or device-related surgery; bleeding events
      such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding due to any source,
      gastrointestinal bleeding; or any other event related to the device or the procedure, which
      requires treatment.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of LAA occlusion at
      45 and/or 180 days (+ten days) post-procedure. LAA occlusion will be assessed by
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) color flow Doppler and will be defined as absence of
      flow in the LAA or color flow Doppler jets less than 3mm.

        The target population for this study is the subset of patients who have non-valvular
        paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial fibrillation; LAA anatomy amenable to treatment
        by percutaneous techniques; and an anticoagulation indication for potential thrombus
        formation in the left atrium. Patients with an absolute or relative contraindication to
        anticoagulants will also be included.

        Inclusion Criteria:Candidates for this study must meet ALL of the following criteria

          1. At least 18 years of age.

          2. Diagnosis of paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

          3. Indicated for long-term anticoagulation therapy including patients on anticoagulants
             and patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation. The first 30 patients must
             have a contraindication to anticoagulation.

          4. Eligible for cessation of anticoagulation therapy if the LAA is sealed (i.e., the
             patient has no other condition requiring anticoagulation therapy).

          5. Calculated CHADS score ≥ 1.

          6. Willingness to participate in the required follow-up visits and tests.

          7. Willingness of patient or legal representative to provide written informed consent.

         14. Resting heart rate &gt; 110 beats per minute (bpm).

         15. A single episode of transient atrial fibrillation.

         16. Thrombocytopenia (&lt;50,000 platelets/mm3), thrombocythemia (&gt;700,000 platelets/mm³),

             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials.)
