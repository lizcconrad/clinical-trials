  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liposorber® LA-15 System is a blood purification therapy that selectively removes malignant
      lipoproteins including low density lipoprotein from circulating blood flow and rapidly
      reduces the plasma cholesterol level. The system was originally developed for the treatment
      of patients with serious dyslipidemia such as familial hypercholesterolemia and then applied
      to improve the dyslipidemia, a common complication of nephrotic syndrome and found to bring
      about improvement not only with the dyslipidemic condition but the nephrotic condition (e.g,
      proteinuria and hypoproteinemia).

      Although the definitive mechanism by which the system may relieve nephrotic syndrome is
      unknown, it has been recognized as one of alternative therapies for refractory nephrotic
      syndrome including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in Japan and referred in the
      Guidelines for the Treatment of Nephrotic Syndrome endorsed by The Japanese Society of
      Nephrology.

      This study is conducted as a post approval study imposed by Humanitarian Device Exemption
      (HDE) order to confirm the safety and efficacy of the Liposorber® LA-15 System in the
      treatment of drug-resistant pediatric primary FSGS.

    <description>Liposorber® LA-15 System is an extracorporeal blood purification system. Approximately 3 to 4 L of plasma is treated in a single treatment session and it takes 2 to 3 hours. Recommended frequency of the treatment is twice weekly for 3 weeks followed by once weekly for 6 weeks, thus it takes 9 weeks for a total of 12 treatment sessions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A pediatric patient is deemed suitable for inclusion in the study if the patient has
             FSGS with a GFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and any of the following:

               -  Refractory nephrotic syndrome in which standard treatment options are
