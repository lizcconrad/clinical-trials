    <textblock>
      The objectives of the Phase I study are to evaluate the safety and tolerance of increasing
      single oral doses of oxfendazole in healthy volunteers.The secondary objectives assess the
      pharmacokinetic profile of oxfendazole and assess the metabolism of oxfendazole. The
      description of agent used is single oral dose of an aqueous suspension of oxfendazole, a
      benzimidazole carbamate antiparasitic drug. Each new cohort will be dosed only after the two
      week safety data for the preceding group have been reviewed. If a clinically significant AE
      is observed, and if this event is drug-related the safety monitoring committee will be
      convened to determine whether the study should continue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the safety
      and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral doses of oxfendazole (0.5 to 60 mg/kg) in
      healthy volunteers. Up to 70 healthy males and females (non-chldbearing potential), ages
      18-45 volunteers recruited from one site will participate in this study. The study duration
      is approximately 18 months with subject participation of 2 weeks. The primary objective
      assess the safety and tolerability of oxfendazole in healthy adults. The secondary objectives
      assess the pharmacokinetic profile of oxfendazole and assess the metabolism of oxfendazole.
      Two sentinel subjects will receive the study product (1 drug/1 placebo) in each group and be
      monitored 48 hours for adverse events prior to completing enrollment of the remaining 8
      subjects in the group.

        study. 11. A history of alcohol consumption* or any illicit drug use†, or history of
        substance abuse#. Individuals must agree to abstain from drug or alcohol use for 48 hours

        average) is acceptable. Individuals will be counseled to abstain from use of tobacco and
        marijuana from screening through day 15.
