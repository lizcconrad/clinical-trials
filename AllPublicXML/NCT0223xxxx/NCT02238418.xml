  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is not seen anymore only as a phosphocalcic and bone hormone, but also as having an
      effect on global health (anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour roles and
      cardiovascular protection).

      Until recently, vitamin D repletion was defined as the minimal concentration that enables the
      prevention of rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, i.e, approximately 8 ng/mL (20
      nmol/L). However, most of the international experts agree to set minimal threshold of 25 OH
      vitamin D serum concentration, higher than the one previously admitted, with a limit of 20
      ng/mL (50 nmol/L) to define a vitamin D deficiency and a limit of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) to
      define vitamin D insufficiency.

      Recommendations for Vit D supplementation in healthy children were updated in France in 2012.
      The invariable supplementation of infants and toddlers is efficient since deficiency-related
      rickets have almost disappeared; however there is very few information in ill children
      populations.

      Vit D supplementation tolerance is usually considered as good and over-dosage risks are low,
      however these studies were conducted more than 30 years ago, and as far as we know, there is
      no study about calcium urinary excretion kinetics after intake of a 100 000 IU vial of
      cholecalciferol (Uvedose®). When 25 OH vitamin D serum concentrations exceeds 200 ng/mL,
      which is very rare in daily practice, toxic effects of Vit D may theoretically be observed,
      particularly hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.

      Vitamin D deficit is very common in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a 50 to
      92% prevalence depending on the studies; it it is a risk factor for secondary
      hyperparathyroidism.

      Although international guidelines regarding the care of CKD children recommend 25 OH vitamin
      D serum concentrations over 75 nmol/L, there are no practical recommendations in terms of
      dose and frequency of native Vit D treatment.

      Therefore, the objectives of the present study has are the following:

        -  to validate prospectively the efficacy of our service usual care for Vit D
           supplementation of children and adolescents seen in the paediatric nephrology
           department.

        -  and to study the effect of Vit D supplementation (100 000 IU vial of cholecalciferol) on
           calciuria in these patients.

    <description>The 25 OH vitamin D serum concentration will be measured at inclusion (before treatment intake) and 2 months after supplementation. No extra blood intake is programmed since this parameter is always measured in this population. The main evaluation criterion is defined as a 25 OH vitamin D serum concentration over 75 nmol/l at month 2. This defines the success of supplementation. The failure is defined as a 25 OH vitamin D serum concentration under 75 nmol/l at month 2.</description>

    <description>Calciuria (absolute and normalized with the calculation of the ratio urinary calcium/creatinine) will be measured on the first morning urine at those time points after each vial intake. Measurements will be made in the unique local laboratory chosen by each patient. Thus the lab will be different between patients but must remain the same for each patient.</description>

A local lab will performed urinary dosage of calciuria and creatininuria:
at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 after the first intake of a 25OHD vial
at days 0, 2 and 4 after other intakes (when applicable)
