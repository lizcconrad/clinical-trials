  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the treatment patterns in participants with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, participant's demographic and
      clinical characteristics, skeletal-related events, criteria used to define CRPC, prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) levels and pain related to disease and overall survival will be
      observed.

      This is an observational (study in which participants identified as belonging to study groups
      are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes), longitudinal (correlational research study
      that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of time) and
      retrospective (study looking back over past experience) study to describe the treatment
      patterns in mCRPC. Treatment patterns will be assessed by collecting medical charts from
      participants diagnosed with mCRPC in or prior 2009. Primarily, percentage of participants who
      received therapy as first line treatment will be assessed. All adverse events associated with
      the use of Sponsor drugs will be reported.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Gleason score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Gleason scoring is used to grade tumors. A primary grade is assigned to the most common tumor pattern (how the cancer cells look under a microscope), and a second grade to the next most common pattern. The two grades are added together to get a GS. Gleason grade range= 1-5; 5=worst prognosis. GS range=2-10; 10=worst prognosis. Improvement is defined as a decrease in GS from a Baseline score of 6 (GS&lt;=6; includes no cancer); worsening is defined as an increase in GS from a baseline score of 6 (GS &gt;6).</description>
