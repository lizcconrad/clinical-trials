  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this research study to determine if taking vancomycin in addition to a
      broad-spectrum antibiotic will decrease the chance of developing recurrent Clostridium
      difficile infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether prophylactic use of oral vancomycin reduces the incidence of recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI) in hospitalized patients admitted from their home or
      another health care facility (HCF) who are exposed to concurrent broad spectrum antibiotics.

      This is a randomized research study, which means that the treatment you get will be chosen by
      chance, like flipping a coin. You will have a 50/50 chance of receiving one of the following:

        1. Group 1 (Treatment Group): single daily dose of vancomycin in liquid form (study
           medication).

        2. Group 2 (Placebo Group): single daily dose of placebo (a placebo will look just like the
           study medication, but contains no medication, only a substance like sterile water).

      Depending on the group you are placed in (which is chosen by a computer), you will receive
      either a daily dose of the study medication or a daily dose of the placebo for a total of ten
      days. If you are discharged from the hospital prior to ten days, you will be given the study
      medication to complete outside of the hospital with written instructions.

      A member of the Research staff will monitor you daily during the 10 days of treatment for any
      adverse reactions or any signs and symptoms of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. If
      you are discharged prior to ten days, the monitoring will take place via telephone call daily
      until completion of the ten day treatment.

      You will be contacted again by telephone at 1, 3, and 6 months after completion of the study
      medication to inquire about your general health and any changes in health status.

      Other medical information from your records and charts may also be collected by us for
      purposes of review for this study.

    <description>Vancomycin Group: Study participants started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic will be initiated on Vancomycin 125 mg PO QD within 48 hrs of the 1st dose of primary broad-spectrum antibiotic and continued to complete a 10 day course regardless of the duration of primary antibiotic. Dose of oral Vancomycin is 125 mg PO QD. Vancomycin liquid will be dissolved in fruit juice which is standard practice at Spectrum Health Hospitals. Both groups will continue in the study even if their broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is curtailed prior to 10 days.</description>
