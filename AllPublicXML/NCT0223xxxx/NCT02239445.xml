  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that intranasal dexmedetomidine
      is as effective as second dose of oral chloral hydrate for rescue sedation in infant age
      between 1 and 6 months who were not adequately sedated following initial dose of chloral
      hydrate.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>successful rescue sedation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hours after MRI scaning</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation status was evaluated by a attending anesthesiologists every 5-10 min with a 6-point sedation scale, which was modified from the Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAA/S; Table 1).
successful sedation was defined as an MOAA/S of between 0 and 3</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>sedation induction time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 min after rescue drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Successful sedation was defined as an MOAA/S of between 0 and 2, and sedation induction time was defined as the time from rescue drug administration to the onset of satisfactory sedation
0 Does not respond to a noxious stimulus
Does not respond to mild prodding or shaking
Responds only after mild prodding or shaking
Responds only after name is called loudly orrepeatedly
Lethargic response to name spoken in normal tone
Appears asleep, but responds readily to namespoken in normal tone
Appears alert and awake, responds readily to namespoken in normal tone</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wake -up time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 hours after rescue drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Children were classified as awake if the MOAA/S was between 4 and 6. Wake -up time was defined as the time from successful sedation until the time that the child awoke</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>non-invasive systolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, before and 15 , 30, 60, 75, 90 min after rescue drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>changes in the non-invasive systolic blood pressure at the baseline, before and 15 , 30, 60, 75, 90 min after rescue drug administration</description>
