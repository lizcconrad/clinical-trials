  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the immediate efficacy of Counterforce brace versus
      kinesiotaping on patients with lateral epicondylosis/tennis elbow with respect to a
      repetitive physical task. The investigators hypothesized that there would be difference in
      the outcomes with respect to interventions and activity. Patient came for one hour long
      Single occasion testing session and were not followed up after the testing was complete.

    <textblock>
      This was a cross over randomized control trial. Thirty patients with clinical diagnosis of
      lateral epicondylosis/tennis elbow were recruited from a local community and were tested on
      single occasion (one time testing session) before and after a five minute upper extremity
      repetitive task first with control and then brace and kinesiotape assigned in cross-over
      design. The testing session was one hour long and there was no follow up of patients
      following the testing. The patients were recruited between Jan-June 2013.

    <description>Kinesiotape was used only on the affected side as per the manufacturer instructions. With the elbow extended, wrist fully flexed and fingers pointed down 24, KT was applied with slight stretch (10-15%) and paper off tension to the lateral arm beginning just above the bony portion of lateral epicondyle. Once the top strand was anchored, KT was applied along the side of elbow such that hole in the tape was over lateral epicondyle of the elbow. Two strands of tape followed the lateral forearm and ended at around beginning of the distal one third of forearm. Once the support was applied, KT was gently rubbed to activate the glue.</description>

    <description>The counterforce brace was approximately 5cm wide with velcro attachment for adjustable girth. It had gel pack for extra support on extensor muscle mass. With the elbow extended, brace was applied 2.5cms below the lateral epicondyle. A feeling of comfortable compression, as reported by the patients was used to adjust the brace.</description>
