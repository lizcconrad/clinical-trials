  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the high-frequency range deep brain oscillations (HFO) as
      pathologic markers in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for epilepsy or Parkinson
      disease. Newly developed technology allows for the chronic recording of these brain signals
      at the same time as clinical stimulation is occuring. We will learn both whether these HFO
      correlate with disease activity and whether the HFO change in response to ongoing stimulation
      (potentially giving insight into the underlying mechanism of action of DBS).

    <measure>Degree of correlation of recorded neural signatures with disease severity as determined by regression analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks post deep brain stimulator implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Regression analysis will be performed using the measures of clinical disease severity as the independent variables and the various HFO measurement conditions/parameters as dependent variables.
HFO parameters to be analyzed will include: 1) total power within each recorded band and 2) frequency distribution as defined by the ratio of power within the higher HFO frequency band versus the lower HFO frequency band.
Clinical disease severity will be determined by: 1) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III) score in each of the various conditions for Parkinson Disease (PD) subjects, 2) motor diaries linked with each visit for PD subjects, and 3) seizure counts from the 4 weeks of seizure diary preceding each visit for epilepsy subjects.
(Note: UPDRS is a rating scale used to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. Part III is a clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation.)</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Medically-refractory neurologic disease amenable to therapy with deep brain
             stimulation including:

               1. Idiopathic Parkinson disease with motor fluctuation, dyskinesia, and/or medically
                  refractory tremor despite optimal medical management by a movement disorders
                  neurologist.

                  OR

               2. Unilateral or bilateral mesial temporal lobe (hippocampal) epilepsy with complex
                  partial, and/or secondarily generalized seizures, that is:

                    -  confirmed through a combination of interictal scalp EEG, ictal scalp EEG
                       under video monitoring, ictal SPECT scanning, and/or invasive EEG monitoring

                    -  disabling seizure counts &gt;2 per month documented over a 3 month period

                    -  refractory to at least three antiepileptic drugs given at clinically
                       appropriate maintenance doses resulting in therapeutic plasma levels (in
                       cases where such levels have been established for that particular drug. Drug
                       failures because of side- effects will not be counted toward this total.

                    -  determined to have mesial temporal lobe epilepsy that is not amenable to
                       resective surgery according to consensus opinion among epileptologists on

          2. Mayo Clinic Deep Brain Stimulation Committee approval for bilateral deep brain

             protocol.

          3. Age 18 to 75.

          2. Comorbid nonepileptic behavioral events or psychogenic movement disorder.

          4. Psychiatric comorbidities not under stable medical therapy.

          6. Implanted electronically active medical device with the potential to interfere with
             intracranial recordings (ex. pacemaker, automatic implantable cardioverter
             defibrillator (AICD), active vagal nerve stimulator).

          7. Pregnancy; women of child-bearing potential will be required to commit to using an
             effective method of contraception during the entire duration of the trial. If a

             that to our center within two weeks at which point explantation of the experimental
             device would be an option.
