    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary safety of administration of aldoxorubicin in combination with ifosfamide in subjects with metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiograms (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans, electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and weight.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the activity of aldoxorubicin in combination with ifosfamide/mesna in this population, assessed by overall response rate and progression-free survival (PFS).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 15-80 years, male or female.

          2. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (including doxorubicin) allowed if no tumor
             recurrence for at least 12 months since the last measurement, beginning or end of last
             chemotherapy.

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced, unresectable, and/or
             metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (including rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and mixed
             mesodermal sarcoma), chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma of intermediate or high grade and
             gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) (only in subjects that have progressed after
             receiving treatment with imatinib and sunitinib).

          4. Capable of providing informed consent and complying with trial procedures.

          5. ECOG performance status 0-2.

          6. Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks.

          7. Measurable tumor lesions according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          8. Women must not be able to become pregnant (eg post-menopausal for at least 1 year,
             surgically sterile, or practicing adequate birth control methods) for the duration of

             contraception, intrauterine device implanted for at least 3 months, or barrier method
             in conjunction with spermicide.)

          9. Males and their female partner(s) of child-bearing potential must use 2 forms of
             effective contraception (see Inclusion 8 plus condom or vasectomy for males) from the
             last menstrual period of the female partner during the study treatment and for 6
             months after the final dose of study treatment.

         10. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at
             the Screening Visit and be non-lactating.

         11. Geographic accessibility to the site that ensures the subject will be able to keep all
             study-related appointments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy unless for adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy with no tumor recurrence
