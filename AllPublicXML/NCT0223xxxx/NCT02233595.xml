      The investigators will be using the combination of FDG-PET and multiparametric MRI in pre-
      and post-adjuvant chemoradiation therapy in order to attempt to predict pathologic response
      on surgical resection.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of histopathologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma.

          -  Locally advanced disease as determined by ERUS or pelvic MRI. Endoscopy reports should
             clearly state both the T and N stage.

          -  Patients with cT2N1-3M0 or cT2-4NxM0 will be considered eligible for participation.

          -  Age â‰¥18.

          -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document and the willingness to sign
             it.

          -  Tumor must be determined to be surgically resectable. Surgical resection is planned to
             take place at UCSF.

          -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiation prior to resection is planned..

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ERUS tumor state of T1.

          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease

          -  Weight in excess of limitations of the scanner or girth that prohibits entry into the
             bore of the PET/CT scanner due to size.

          -  Any medical condition which impairs the ability to lie flat and without movement for
             15 minutes (e.g. cough, severe arthritis, etc.)

          -  Prior receipt of any therapy, including local excision, radiation or chemotherapy, for
             the diagnosed rectal adenocarcinoma.

          -  Prior history of pelvic radiation.

          -  Uncontrolled hyperglycemia (defined as inability to achieve a glucose of &lt;250 mg/dL at
             time of FDG injection).

          -  Impaired renal function (CKD 4 or 5: eGFR &lt; 30 mLs/min), which is a contraindication
             to gadolinium containing contrast.

          -  Known allergy to gadolinium containing contrast agents.

          -  Contraindication to use of fluoropyrimidines as a radiosensitizing agent.

          -  Pregnancy or nursing. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within
             72 hours prior to randomization. This is because of the potential teratogenic effects
             of the involved imaging modalities, radiation, and chemotherapy.
