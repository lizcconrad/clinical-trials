    <textblock>
      Comparative analysis of the efficacy of intranasal MP29-02 (a novel formulation of azelastine
      and FP) has already been conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe seasonal AR. The
      combination formulation appeared to be superior in these patients with better symptomatic
      relief. However, objective analysis of the effect of this treatment on nasal mediators and/or
      nasal hyperreactivity has not yet been performed and would help in understanding the
      additional benefit of the combination treatment over monotherapy with nasal corticosteroids.

    <measure>change in PNIF values upon CDA exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal hyperreactivity (NHR) can be assessed with peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) measurement before and after cold dry air (CDA) provocation.
Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) Peak nasal inspiratory flow evaluation is a physiologic measure of air flow through both nasal cavities during forced inspiration. The PNIF can be measured using a portable nasal inspiratory ﬂow meter and is expressed in liters per minute.
Cold dry air (CDA) provocation CDA nasal provocation can be performed by delivering compressed dry air through a mask placed over nose and mouth of the patient, while breathing only through the nose. Patients will be exposed during 15 minutes. NHR is defined as a drop in PNIF larger than 20 % from baseline upon CDA challenge.
The efficacy of MP29-02 treatment will be evaluated by measuring the change in PNIF values upon CDA exposure in both treatment arms.
Unit of measurement of PNIF: L/min</description>

    <measure>change in assessment of visual analogue scale (VAS) for total nasal symptom (TNS) and individual nasal symptoms, reflective total of 5 symptom scores (rT5SS) and Allergic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement of patient's subjective evaluation of symptom severity. Patients will score the severity of their total nasal symptoms (TNS) on a scale, as well as each individual nasal symptom (rhinorrhea, pruritis, sneezing, nasal obstruction), with 0 meaning no symptoms and 10 meaning the worst symptoms. The cut off value of 5/10 is to distinguish between controlled and uncontrolled AR.
Patients will score their reflective nasal and ocular symptoms on a 4-point scale from absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2) to severe (3)). Minimum score: 0/15 as having no trouble with any of the symptoms; and maximum score: 15/15 as having maximum trouble with all the symptoms
The Allergic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT): Patients score the five questions from 1 (always troublesome) to 5 (never troublesome). Minimum score: 5/25 ; maximum score: 25/25. A score from 5/25 to 20/25 is assumed not controlled AR; a score higher then 20/25 is assumed controlled.</description>
