    <textblock>
      The potential synergistic effect of administering 2 dengue vaccine candidates that were
      previously shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans will be evaluated in this study. A
      prime-boost study of tetravalent dengue virus purified inactivated vaccine (TDENV-PIV) with
      alum and tetravalent dengue live attenuated virus (TDENV-LAV) vaccine Formulation 17 (F17)
      will gather data to help better understand the human immune response to dengue vaccination
      and infection.

               1. &gt; 110% upper limit of normal (ULN) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, serum urea nitrogen
                  (SUN) and bilirubin (total and direct)

               2. &lt; 100% lower limit of normal (LLN) or &gt; 120% ULN for hemoglobin, hematocrit and
                  platelet count

               3. &lt; 75% LLN or &gt;110% ULN for total white blood cell count (WBC)
