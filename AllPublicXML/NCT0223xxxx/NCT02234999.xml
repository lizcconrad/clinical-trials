    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label study to evaluate the metabolism and excretion of
      [14C]-CC-122 following a single oral dose of [14C]-CC-122 in healthy male subjects. It is
      planned for 6 subjects to be enrolled; each subject will participate in a screening phase, a
      baseline phase, a treatment phase, and a follow up phone call. Blood, urine and fecal samples
      will be collected for analyses.

        blood donation center.

        13. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and
