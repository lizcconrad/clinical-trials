  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug called temsirolimus in
      combination with a drug called perifosine in treating brain tumors that have continued to
      grow after previous treatment. Temsirolimus is an intravenous drug approved by the FDA for
      treatment of other cancers (kidney cancer, certain types of lymphoma) but not for brain
      tumors. Perifosine is a pill that has not been approved by the FDA which blocks a messenger
      that tells cancer cells to grow. Research suggests that combined treatment with both drugs is
      better than either alone, and that it is reasonably safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and glioblastoma (GBM) is the
      most common subtype in adults, representing more than 50% of gliomas. Standard initial
      treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection followed by
      radiotherapy to the tumor bed and chemotherapy with an oral DNA alkylator, temozolomide.
      However, recurrence is nearly universal despite standard therapy. There is no standard
      treatment at recurrence. Median survival is about 15 months from diagnosis and 6 months from
      recurrence. Once patients develop tumor progression, conventional chemotherapy is generally
      ineffective.

    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks, starting at 8 weeks after Day 1 of treatment, and up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor measurements will be calculated and compared to baseline measurements to determine if the regimen induces radiographic response (tumor shrinkage or stabilization) and/or delay in disease progression. These statuses will be categorized as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Minor Response (MR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD), and Unknown (UNK).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in tumor size specifically at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months from drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' disease status will be evaluated for progression at 6 months: 6 months from first day of study drug administration (Arm A) and 6 months from first day of study drug administration following surgery (Arm B). This will be accomplished via radiographic measurement comparisons between follow-up on-study scans, compared to the baseline scan tumor measurements.</description>

    <measure>Median Overall Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of first study drug administration until expiration, (approximately 48 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be calculated by using the interval between the date in which the first study drug administration took place (Arm A), and first day of study drug administration following surgery (Arm B), until the date of subject expiration.</description>

    <description>Cytoreductive surgery planned (surgical cohort). After post-operative standard evaluations, patients will resume therapy. After anti-emetic prophylaxis, patients will receive the first divided dose of the perifosine loading dose after recovery from surgery. Patients will be observed for at least 30 minutes to ensure there has been adequate anti-emetic prophylaxis, and then patients will receive temsirolimus administered over 30-60 minutes IV. The remaining divided doses of the perifosine loading dose will then be administered. Patients will then return weekly for infusion of temsirolimus over 30-60 minutes IV. Dosing will be continuous although for the purposes of evaluation, a cycle will be defined as 4 weeks (28 days).</description>
