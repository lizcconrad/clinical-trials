  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS) is prevalent among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.
      Recently, its prevalence is rising. There are several different clinical presentations of
      this syndrome. It has a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

      The purpose of this study is to find the connection between the heart pathology and its
      effect on ESRD patients. This will aid in choosing the appropriate medical therapy for these
      patients, and hopefully, aid in increasing their quality of life, and decrease their
      morbidity and mortality.
