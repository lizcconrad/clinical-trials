  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare nurse-led care coordination for persons receiving
      cancer chemotherapy treatment incorporating mobile health technology to nurse-led care
      coordination without any mobile health enhancements.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will randomize sixty (60) participants receiving cancer chemotherapy treatment to
      receive nurse-led care coordination using a HIPAA-compliant mobile health platform compared
      to no technology-enhanced care coordination.

      All participants receive nurse-led care coordination throughout chemotherapy treatment.

      RESEARCH AIMS:

        -  Demonstration of a HIPAA-compliant social networking platform;

        -  Facilitate communication and collaboration among patients with cancer and their care
           team;

        -  Assess patient health outcomes (chemotherapy-related physical and psychological side
           effects; pain, quality of life and patient satisfaction)

        -  Assessment of healthcare utilization including emergency department visits, unplanned
           clinic visits and hospitalization;

        -  For patients assigned to the mobile health care coordination, understanding their
           experience of use of the technology
