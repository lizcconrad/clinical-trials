  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary focus of this intervention trial is to understand the effect of quitting smoking
      on TB treatment outcomes. The investigators will compare a cessation strategy based on
      guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union
      against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUTLD). This is currently not utilized in TB directly
      observed therapy (DOT) clinics in Pakistan. The investigators study will provide
      comprehensive data towards understanding the effectiveness of these strategies for TB
      patients who smoke in Pakistan, and most importantly, on the effect of quitting smoking on TB
      treatment outcomes. These findings will guide development of effective smoking cessation
      strategies in a region with high prevalence of TB and increasing tobacco use.

    <description>To assess differences in TB treatment outcomes between smokers and quitters, all patients enrolled in the intervention trial will be included in analyses of a composite negative outcome variable, defined as a composite endpoint of poor clinical response to TB treatment including death, treatment failure, relapse, and/or requirement for prolongation of TB therapy. Risk of a negative treatment outcome will be compared between the following 3 groups: 1) TB patients who were current smokers and quit smoking for 6 months of follow-up; 2) TB patients who were recent smokers and stayed quit for 6 months of follow-up; and, 3) TB patients who are never smokers.</description>

    <description>Study participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive intensive cessation support outside of the TB clinic setting, from a health worker trained in cessation counseling, during the course of their TB treatment. Behavioral elements will consist of follow up using unscheduled drop in or phone sessions, motivational interviewing, and counseling tailored to the needs and circumstances of the patient. Patients who are current smokers and are ready to commit to quit smoking will be supported to stop completely. Recent smokers will supported for having quit, and the counselor will discuss coping strategies to maintain abstinence.</description>
