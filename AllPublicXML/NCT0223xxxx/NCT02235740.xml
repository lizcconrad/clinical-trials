  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, 2-part Phase I/ randomized Phase II multi-center study is conducted to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and clinical activity of
      afuresertib in combination with carfilzomib versus carfilzomib alone, in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory MM. Part 1 will evaluate 2 dose levels (125 milligrams [mg] and 150 mg of
      afuresertib) in 16 subjects (approximately 8 in each parallel arm) to determine an optimal
      dose of afuresertib for administration in combination with carfilzomib in Part 2. If neither
      of these dose levels are tolerated, an additional dose level of 100mg of afursertib in
      combination with carfilzomib may be explored in approximately 8 additional subjects. Part 2
      was to investigate the safety, and clinical activity of the combination of afuresertib with
      carfilzomib (determined in Part 1) compared to carfilzomib alone, in approximately 100
      subjects (50 in each parallel arm), however the study was terminated after the
      discontinuation of the single subject following the transition of the afuresertib development
      program from GSK to Novartis. The reason for the study termination is that the protocol
      defined study treatment was no longer aligned with the evolving standard of care.

             eligibility criteria. In situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted
             range, the investigator may opt to retest the subject and the subsequent within range

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of Non-childbearing potential.
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt

             Investigator/designee, if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise,
             they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to
             study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Child-bearing potential,
             has a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to start of study drugs,

             vasectomy or agree to use one of the contraception explained by the
             Investigator/designee. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose
             of study drugs until 10 days after the last dose of afuresertib or carfilzomib

             any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not
             medically relevant. Other clinically significant ECG abnormalities including second
             degree (Type II) or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block; history of myocardial
             infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina), coronary
             angioplasty, or stenting or bypass grafting within six months of Screening; pulmonary
             hypertension

          -  Known active infection requiring parenteral or oral anti-biotic treatment

          -  Previous or concurrent malignancies are allowed if it is clear that the other tumor is
             not contributing to the subject's illness. The subject must not be receiving active
             therapy, other than hormonal therapy, for this disease and the disease must be
             considered medically stable for at least 2 years.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female

          -  Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection

          -  Subjects who are Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbSAg) positive. Subjects with a
             positive test for Hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are excluded, regardless of viral load.
             If hepatitis C antibody is positive, a confirmatory recombinant immunoblot assay
             (RIBA) test may be performed. If the RIBA test is negative, the subject is eligible
             for the study
