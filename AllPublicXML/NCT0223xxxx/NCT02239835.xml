  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of
      tipranavir (TPV) in combination with ritonavir (TPV/r) compared with a standard dual PI
      combination of saquinavir (SQV) and ritonavir (RTV) and to evaluate the dose response of two
      different doses of TPV in combination with RTV for efficacy and safety.

             negative within 14 days of study entry)

          -  Evidence of substance abuse, which in the investigator's opinion could affect
             adherence to the protocol

          -  In the investigator's judgment, inability to comply with the protocol requirements for
