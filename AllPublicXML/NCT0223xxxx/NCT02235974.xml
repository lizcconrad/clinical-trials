  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To perform an exploratory single center randomized study that will form the basis for a
      larger scale, more definitive randomized clinical trial to determine the optimal time after
      stroke for intensive motor training. The investigators will perform a prospective exploratory
      study of upper extremity (UE) motor training delivered at higher than usual intensity at
      three different time points after stroke:

        -  early (initiated within 30 days)

        -  subacute/outpatient (initiated within 2-3 months)

        -  chronic (initiated within 6-9 months)

      The control group will not receive the therapy intervention during the 1-year study.

      Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6 months and
      one year after stroke onset.

      Compared to individuals randomized during the outpatient (2-3 months after stroke onset) or
      chronic (6-9 months after stroke onset) time points, participants randomized to early
      intensive motor training will show greater upper extremity motor improvement measured at one
      year post stroke.
