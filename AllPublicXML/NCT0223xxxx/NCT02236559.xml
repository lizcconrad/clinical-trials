  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to determine if Vapotherm high flow nasal cannula
      therapy (HFT), when used to treat respiratory failure in the ED, is at least equivalent to
      the current standard of care for non-invasive ventilatory support, non-invasive positive
      pressure mask ventilation (NIPPV). Moreover, this study will investigate the potential that
      HFT has possible advantages over NIPPV, such as decreased time to patient stability from
      respiratory failure, and the ease of use as a first line intervention for respiratory failure
      in the ED environment.

      The hypothesis is that HFT via the Vapotherm Precision Flow will demonstrate clinical
      non-inferiority when compared to NIPPV with regard to treatment failure by way of an impact
      on ventilation indices and a lower intolerance rate, and have a positive association with
      hospital disposition and length of stay.

    <description>Determine the efficacy of HFT compared to NIPPV in treating respiratory failure. The primary endpoint will be treatment failure within 72 hrs as determined by intolerance, failure to adequately oxygenate or ventilate and medical deterioration. The data will be sub-analyzed for intubation within the ED and within the first 4 hrs of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ventilatory indices</measure>
    <time_frame>At one and four hours</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the capability of HFT, compared to NIPPV, to affect indices of ventilation. The secondary endpoint is the degree of physiologic improvement in blood oxygen and CO2 levels that signify a reduction in both hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. These indices of ventilation will be blood gas/chemistry analyses taken at baseline (presentation) and the follow up periods 1 hr and 4 hr (if still on therapy); vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, perceived dyspnea/comfort level) recorded at baseline, 30min, 1 hr, 90 min, and 4 hrs (if still on therapy) and at treatment failure/intubation (if applicable); and clinician perception of efficacy recorded at the end of the treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post emergency department discharge disposition</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 72 hrs</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the impact of HFT compared to NIPPV on post ED discharge disposition and hospital stays for the first 72 hrs after presentation to the ED. The tertiary endpoint will be to compare the treatment groups with respect to time spent in the ED, ICU, medical floors and outpatient step-down units. Disposition and length of stay in any unit is at the discretion of the medical team treating the patient.</description>

    <description>Patients will be fit with an oronasal mask using a fitting gauge that will be applied by a respiratory therapist or other clinician skilled in management of NIPPV. Initial pressures will be at low end of suggested range but can be increased as rapidly as necessary to alleviate respiratory distress. Targets should be to lower respiratory rate to the low 20s and achieve tidal volumes of 6-8 ml/kg ideal body weight. If patients find pressures uncomfortably high, they can be lowered as necessary by 1 to 2 cmH2O decrements to enhance tolerance. EPAP (PEEP) can also be adjusted upward as needed to reduce triggering effort (by counterbalancing auto-PEEP) or to improve oxygenation.
FIO2 will be 1.0 initially to assure adequate oxygenation, but should be adjusted promptly to maintain an FIO2 of no greater than 0.6 with an EPAP (PEEP) of not more than 10 cm H2O to maintain a PaO2 &gt; 88%.</description>

    <description>Patients will be fit with a Vapotherm adult nasal cannula that will be applied by a respiratory therapist or other clinician skilled in management of HFT. Initial flow will be set to 35 L/min but can be decreased or increased as rapidly as necessary to alleviate respiratory distress and optimize patient comfort. Targets should be to lower respiratory rate to the low 20s and with a HFT flow rate between 20 to 35 L/min. Starting temperature will be between 35 to 37 C; if patients find the gas temperature to be uncomfortable, it can be lowered as necessary down to 33 C to enhance tolerance.
FIO2 will be 1.0 initially to assure adequate oxygenation, but should be adjusted promptly to maintain an FIO2 of no greater than 0.6 to maintain a PaO2 &gt; 88%.</description>
