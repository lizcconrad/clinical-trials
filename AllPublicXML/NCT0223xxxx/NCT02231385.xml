      The purpose of this study is to compare the additional diagnostic yield obtained by using the
      acetic acid as vital substance to improve the detection of serrated lesions at colonoscopy.

      Patients who are scheduled for screening, surveillance or diagnostic colonoscopy will be
      recruited to the study and randomized to one of two groups. Each enrolled subject will
      undergo two &quot;back-to-back&quot; procedures limited to the examination of the right colon.

      Subjects in Group A (study group) will undergo a standard colonoscopy. Once the right colon
      has been fully examined, acetic acid 2% will be sprayed and the right colon re-examined from
      cecum to hepatic flexure with within a frame-time of two minutes. Subjects in Group B
      (control group) will undergo a second examination of the right colon without acid acetic and
      within the same frame-time.

      Results from the two groups will be analyzed and compared, with primary outcome measures
      being detection rates for serrated lesions. Secondary outcome measures will include adenoma
      detection rate in the right colon or other locations, characteristics of polyps detected,
      including size and histological results.

      Subjects will be followed through a 24-72 hour telephone interview for analysis of unexpected
      adverse events. Clinical results will be analyzed using various statistical measures of
      significance.
