    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of the TFV/LNG intravaginal ring (IVR),
      TFV-only IVR, and placebo IVR, evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of TFV and LNG, evaluate
      pharmacodynamic (PD) surrogates of contraceptive efficacy of LNG, and to evaluate
      acceptability of the IVRs.
