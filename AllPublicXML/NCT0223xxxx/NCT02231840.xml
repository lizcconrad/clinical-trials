      Background:

      - About 17 million adults had an alcohol use disorder in 2012. Researchers want to follow
      people that have alcohol problems and want treatment, as well as those who do not want
      treatment and healthy volunteers. They also want to gather information on people with and
      without alcohol problems, including information on genes and biological processes in the
      body.. This will help them better understand, prevent, and treat alcohol problems.

      Objective:

      -To look at a broad range of traits in people who are healthy people and people with alcohol
      problems. To study them for potential eligibility for other research protocols conducted at
      the NIH Clinical Center.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults age 18 and older.

        -  Not being pregnant or imprisoned.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a physical exam. They will answer questions about their health
           and alcohol and drug use. They will have an electrocardiogram to check their heart. They
           will have blood, urine, and breath alcohol tests.

        -  Participants without alcohol problems, or who have them but do not want treatment, can
           sign the second consent for screening and research.

        -  Participants that have alcohol problems and want treatment will be treated at the NIH
           Clinical Center. They will be offered to sign the second consent at a later time.

        -  Participants may join an inpatient treatment and detox program. It could last up to 6
           weeks. Or they may join an outpatient program. Some may do both.

        -  After discharge, participants may be called and asked questions about their drinking and
           health.

        -  If participants sign the second consent, they:

        -  will complete paper- and computer-based questionnaires.

        -  will give blood samples.

        -  may have a brain scan using magnetic resonance imaging. They will lie on a table that
           slides in and out of a cylinder that takes pictures. The machine makes loud noises. They
           will get earplugs.

      This study represents the natural history protocol for NIAAA with the main objectives of
      providing assessment, clinical care, evaluation, characterization and screening. The specific
      goals of this protocol are the following:

        -  To provide clinical care, including but not limited to medically assisted withdrawal
           from alcohol ( detoxification ), as well as standard behavioral and/or pharmacological
           therapies where indicated to those who wish to receive treatment for alcohol use
           disorders (AUD) and related clinical conditions.

        -  To gather characterization measures for individuals wishing to participate in this
           protocol and in future NIH protocols (for which this protocol serves as the screening
           protocol), including a standardized set of clinical, behavioral, biochemical and
           structural MRI-based phenotypic assessments, as well as whole genome genotypes

        -  To screen and evaluate individuals wishing to participate in NIH clinical protocols
           (both those providing treatment and those that do not provide treatment for AUD) for
           which the present protocol serves as the screening platform. Participants may be
           individuals with no current or past AUD, as well as individuals who meet current or past
           DSM criteria for AUD. Healthy volunteers and other volunteers will also be enrolled in
           this protocol.

        -  Finally, this protocol may also serve for training purposes, as it may provide
           opportunities for training of fellows and other staff members of the NIAAA Clinical
           Programs.

        -  ANA Substudy objective: To obtain assessments built around three neuroscience domains,
           incentive salience, negative emotionality, and executive function, related to addiction
           for purposes of identifying neuroscience-based, clinically-relevant subtypes of alcohol
           use disorder and alcohol use patterns

      We will collect information including such items as psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms,
      biomarkers of liver and other organ damage, quantitative alcohol use history, other substance
      use, and family history of alcoholism. Using this information, investigators will be able to
      clinically manage any disorders in need of clinical attention, and determine whether subjects
      are eligible for any NIH research studies (for which this protocol serves as the screening
      platform) based on results of screening evaluations and the participants interest in
      receiving treatment for AUD. We will also acquire whole genome data, with which investigators
      will be able to examine the relationship between genetic variation and alcohol-related
      phenotypes.

      Consenting for this protocol will be a two-step process. The first consent (named Clinical
      Management Consent) will allow Investigators to assess the acute needs and provide
      appropriate clinical care. The second consent (named Screening and Research Consent) will
      allow Investigators to conduct screening and research data collection and analysis.The
      substudy will have its own consent, the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) consent.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any individual with greater than or equal to 18 years of age who expressed interest in
        participating in this study and/or other research studies offered at NIAAA during the brief
        telephone pre-screening may be enrolled. Age is verified at the NIH Clinical Center (CC)
        Admissions team at the time the patient signs the NIH Clinical Center General Admission
        Consent. This is standard operating procedure at the NIH CC for both outpatient and
        inpatient participants.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Given that this is a screening protocol, there are no exclusion criteria per se that apply
        after a participant signs the Clinical Management consent. In fact, we will evaluate
        participants (including medical and psychiatric evaluations) only after the first-step
        Clinical Management Consent form is signed. However, potential participants are
        pre-screened on the phone and, based on the information provided on the phone, the
        following categories are excluded because they are not suitable study participants:

          -  Women who are pregnant

          -  Individuals &lt; 18 years of age

          -  Prisoners

          -  Exclusionary for ANA substudy: positive breath alcohol test (BrAC) on the day(s) of
             testing

        It is important to keep in mind that after participants sign the consent, new information
        may be made available during the study that can lead the Investigators to withdraw a
        participant. For example, a participant may have a positive pregnancy test (i.e., she was
        not aware or did not report during the telephone pre-screening). In this case, the
        participant will be referred to appropriate care that can best manage and follow-up with
        their specific clinical needs. Another scenario may be that a participant may be arrested
        during their participation in the study based on new found information obtained by proper
        authorities (including NIH Police); in this case, a member of the NIH Clinical Center
        Social Worker Department will be notified.

        Finally, at the time of the consent process, those participants who are unable to complete
        all of the questions in the NIDA/NIAAA Evaluation of Potential Research Participants
        Ability to Consent will not be enrolled (i.e., they will not sign the consent form) and
        will be referred for appropriate care.
