  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to describe neurologists' population of patients
      treated with pramipexole and suffering from Parkinson's disease (so called 'primary care'
      population).

      The secondary objectives were:

        -  Evaluate the mean dose of pramipexole prescribed under actual conditions of use
           depending on the severity of the disease.

        -  Evaluate the reasons for choosing pramipexole as treatment.

        -  Identify the patient profiles determining the choice of dose of pramipexole prescribed
