    <textblock>
      Although post-op renal function decrease is determined by serum creatinine, serum creatinine
      has disadvantages that it increases a long time after renal function decrease and it has
      various increasing time based on the level of renal function. Neutrophil
      Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL's) usefulness as an evidence for acute kidney damage
      occurring from post-op cardiac surgery, being critical patients and contrast medium use is
      already proven.

      But NGAL's usefulness for renal function after non-cardiac surgery is not proven and
      especially, NGAL's usefulness for renal injury after non-cardiac surgery in chronic renal
      disease patients is not proven.Therefore, the investigators will study about renal function
      decrease after non-cardiac surgery with NGAL and serum creatinine.
