  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MEOPA is used to obtain an analgesia of the short-term painful acts. To the population of
      elderly patients, the therapeutic resources to control the passing pain require in their
      manipulation a certain caution and are not divested of side effects badly tolerated at this
      age. An alternative in the opioid presents all its interest. The MEOPA is here an alternative
      of choice in the care of these pains, in particular in case of pre-existent cognitive
      achievement, of polypathologies or of polymédication.

      The gas MEOPA administered to the mask could thus be an effective additive in the
      physiotherapy treatment of the elderly person.

      The main objective is to Assess the efficacy , in terms of recovery of the hip and knee joint
      articular amplitude, of 3 sessions of reeducation using MEOPA versus standard reeducation
      within a population of elderly patients presenting a pain during the physiotherapy treatment.
