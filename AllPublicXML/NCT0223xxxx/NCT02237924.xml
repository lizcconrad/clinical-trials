  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 120 patients with pathologically confirmed locally advanced low-risk
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. They were randomly divided into two groups, with 60
      patients in each group. One group was treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) combined with Endostar and the other group was treated with IMRT combined with
      concurrent chemotherapy. The short term efficacy and the toxic and side effects of these
      treatments were evaluated. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year overall survival and progression-free
      survival of patients were analyzed. Our data may provide an alternative option for the
      treatment of locally advanced low-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma with high efficacy and low
      toxicity.

      This study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial. A set of
      unified standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria,
      exclusion criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. Six medical centers
      participated in this study and 120 patients with pathologically confirmed locally advanced
      low-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. These patients were stratified according to
      clinical stage and participating center, and were randomly divided into two groups: IMRT
      combined with Endostar group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, Endostar 7.5mg / m2, 2 cycles of intravenous
      infusion, and 2 cycles of maintenance therapy after radiotherapy) and IMRT combined with
      concurrent chemotherapy group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, DDP 100mg / m2, intravenous infusion over 2
      hours , for 2-3 cycles). After treatment, follow-up was performed every 3 months. The
      treatment toxicity, local control rate, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival,
      progression-free survival were observed and assessed.
