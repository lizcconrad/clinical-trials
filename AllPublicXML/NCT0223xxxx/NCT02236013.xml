      The purpose of this study is to describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and define the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASP2215 when combined with cytarabine/idarubicin or
      daunorubicin remission induction in a 7+3 schedule. Safety and tolerability of ASP2215 will
      also be evaluated. This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP2215
      when given in combination with cytarabine/idarubicin or cytarabine/daunorubicin remission
      induction and high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) consolidation therapy in newly diagnosed acute
      myeloid leukemia as well as evaluate the effect of ASP2215 on the PK of cytarabine.

      This is a three-part trial. In Part 1, subjects will be enrolled to successive cohorts to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Dose escalation decision will be made based on
      DLTs that occur after the first dose of ASP2215 during remission induction. The treatment
      will consist of three distinct periods: remission induction, consolidation and maintenance.

      In Part 2, subjects will be enrolled into an expansion cohort. Subjects will receive ASP2215
      at the MTD established in Part 1 or recommended expansion dose, and will also receive
      remission induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy. The DLT observation period during
      the expansion cohort will be from the start of dosing of ASP2215 during the first remission
      induction treatment until Day 21 of the first consolidation cycle or before the start of the
      second consolidation cycle, whichever is sooner; as well as from the start of maintenance
      treatment until Day 28 of the second maintenance cycle. If testing at a dose level must be
      stopped, then a lower dose may be tested for remaining subjects to be enrolled.

      In Part 3, two cohorts will be enrolled to evaluate an alternative anthracycline and ASP2215
      schedule. During remission induction, ASP2215 dosing will begin at day 8 and continue for 14
      days to day 21. Subjects will be hospitalized during remission induction therapy while
      receiving chemotherapy.

      In cohort 3A, some subjects will be enrolled to receive 7+3 regimen consisting of cytarabine
      and an alternative antracycline, daunorubicin. During remission induction subjects will
      receive a 7+3 induction regimen consisting of daunorubicin IV infusion on days 1 through 3
      and cytarabine as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 7.

      In cohort 3B, some subjects will be enrolled to receive 7+3 regimen consisting of cytarabine
      and idarubicin at an alternative dosing schedule for ASP2215 during remission induction.
      During remission induction subjects will receive a 7+3 induction regimen consisting of
      idarubicin by IV infusion on days 1 through 3 and cytarabine as a continuous infusion on days
      1 through 7.

      For Part 3, if day 21 bone marrow evaluation shows residual blasts and the bone marrow is not
      aplastic, a second induction cycle with the same regimen will be given starting at least 7
      days after last dose of ASP2215 and no later than day 35 of the first induction cycle.
      Consolidation and Maintenance therapy follow the same schedule and dosage outlined in Part
      1.The DLT observation period for dose escalation decisions will be from the start of ASP2215
      administration during the first remission induction treatment until day 42 of the last
      remission induction treatment cycle or before the start of the first consolidation cycle,
      whichever is sooner.

      A subject that receives less than 80% of the intended dose of any of the study drugs during
      the remission induction period may be replaced.

      Part 3 may be expanded for additional subjects to ensure at least some subjects are FLT3 + in
      each of the Alternative Anthracycline and Schedule Cohorts.
