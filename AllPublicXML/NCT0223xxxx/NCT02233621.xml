  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a benign chronic disease responsible for infertility and pelvic pain. One of
      the main problem of endometriosis is the significant delay of diagnosis.This delay has
      significant consequences for patients. Currently the definitive diagnosis of endometriosis
      and the evaluation of its lesional extension require performing laparoscopy and a
      histological analysis of biopsy and pathologic areas. Lesions of endometriosis whose
      development and growth are estrogen-dependent, express estrogen receptor (ER). [18F]FES
      (16α-[18F]Fluoro-17β-estradiol) is an analog of estrogen, used in positron emission
      tomography (PET), and a specific tracer of ER. We propose to evaluate the performance of this
      functional imaging as a diagnostic tool for endometriosis.

      The aim of this multicenter, prospective, open study is to assess sensitivity of PET with
      [18F] -FES for diagnosing endometriosis compared to the gold standard (histological
      confirmation on biopsy or excision of lesions performed during laparoscopy) in women care for
      suspected endometriosis and for whom laparoscopy is already scheduled.
