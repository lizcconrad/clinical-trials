  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects an estimated 1.5 billion people world-wide and is a chief contributor to
      death, stroke, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, coronary artery disease and
      dementia. A number of important causal environmental factors have been identified and include
      excessive salt or alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, inadequate fruit, vegetable and
      potassium intake and obesity. Although there have been significant improvements in
      management, a high percentage of patients still do not achieve target blood pressures.

      Coffee is a popular beverage globally and elevates blood pressure variably among individuals.
      Customers in the United States comprise more than half of the population over the age of 18
      years, consume an average of 1 cup (typical size: 270 ml) of coffee three times per day and
      spend an estimated $ 40 billion on the purchase of it each year. A major active constituent
      in coffee is caffeine, which is the most widely used pharmacological substance in the world.

      Drug therapy plays a major role in the management of hypertension. Concomitant intake of
      coffee is likely substantial. However, the interaction between coffee or caffeine and blood
      pressure lowering drugs has been assessed in only a few clinical studies conducted more than
      two decades ago. Moreover, it appears to have the potential to confound the routine drug
      management of hypertension.

      This clinical investigation reports the actions of a customary amount of coffee on the
      circulatory effects and blood concentrations of felodipine, a drug belonging to a class of
      drugs commonly used to treat hypertension. Application of results from this study to clinical
      practice has the possibility to improve the management of hypertension.
