  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad goal of this study was to examine the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine
      (flexible dose) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in symptomatic women
      around the menopausal transition. We hypothesized that an eight-week treatment with
      vortioxetine would promote a significant improvement of depression symptoms and other
      menopause-related physical symptoms.

      Forty-seven peri- and postmenopausal women were enrolled in this open-label study. This was
      an 8-week intervention using open-label vortioxetine with flexible dose between 5-20 mg,
      dependent on participant response and tolerability. In addition to assessment of depressive
      symptoms, improvement of menopause-related physical and emotional symptoms that occur with
      MDD, including vasomotor symptoms, cognition, fatigue, anxiety, sleep complaints, and quality
      of life, were also examined.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale Score (MADRS) at Week 8 (Visit 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (Visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of vortioxetine for trea-ting depressive symptoms was measured by mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) depression score from Baseline (Visit 1) to Week 8 (Visit 5). The MADRS score was assessed at every study visit (Visits 1-5). Participants were considered to have responded to vortioxetine if their MADRS score was reduced by 50% or more from baseline to the end of treatment, and to be in remission if their final MADRS score was less than 10. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression. The overall MADRS score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (Visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety was measured by self-report responses to Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). It is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety in children and adults. Several studies have found the Beck Anxiety Inventory to be an accurate measure of anxiety symptoms in children and adults. Higher scores on the BAI indicate more anxiety symptoms. The range of BAI scores is from 0 to 63, with 0-9=Minimal anxiety, 10-16=Mild anxiety, 17-29=Moderate anxiety, and 30-63=Severe anxiety.</description>

    <description>Sleep quality and disturbances during the past month were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI also incorporates daytime functioning into the total score. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. The range of scores is 0-21.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Menopause Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (Visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life, menopause-specific, is assessed by the Menopause Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL).
The MENQOL is self-administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert-scale format. Each item assesses the impact of one of four domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1-3), psychosocial (items 4-10), physical (items 11-26), and sexual (items 27-29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how bothersome on a zero (not bothersome) to six (extremely bothersome) scale. Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain's items by the number of items within that domain. Non-endorsement of an item is scored a &quot;1&quot; and endorsement a &quot;2&quot;, plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible score on any item ranges from 1-8. Total score also ranges from 1-8. Higher scores indicate that menopause symptoms are more bothersome.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (Visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of illness was assessed by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. The range of scores is 0-7. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (Visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Menopause related symptoms were assessed using the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS). The Greene Scale provides a brief measure of menopause symptoms. It can be used to assess changes in different symptoms, before and after menopause treatment. Three main areas are measured:
1. Psychological (items 1-11). 2. Physical (items 12-18). 3. Vasomotor (items 19, 20).
A higher score indicates that menopause symptoms are more bothersome. The range of scores is from 0 to 63.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (Visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Processing speed, working memory, visuospatial processing and attention was assessed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST).
The DSST test requires the examinee to transcribe a unique geometric symbol with its corresponding Arabic number. The examinee is initially shown a key containing the numbers from 1 to 9. Under each number there is a corresponding geometric symbol. The examinee is then shown a series of boxes containing numbers in the top boxes, and blank boxes below them. After a short practice trial, they are then asked to copy the corresponding geometric symbol under each number. The raw score is the number of correct items completed within the prescribed time limit. Higher scores indicate faster processing speed, working memory, and visuospatial processing and attention. The range of scores is 0-63.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale Score (MADRS) at Week 8 (Visit 5)</title>
        <description>The efficacy of vortioxetine for trea-ting depressive symptoms was measured by mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) depression score from Baseline (Visit 1) to Week 8 (Visit 5). The MADRS score was assessed at every study visit (Visits 1-5). Participants were considered to have responded to vortioxetine if their MADRS score was reduced by 50% or more from baseline to the end of treatment, and to be in remission if their final MADRS score was less than 10. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression. The overall MADRS score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</title>
        <description>Anxiety was measured by self-report responses to Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). It is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety in children and adults. Several studies have found the Beck Anxiety Inventory to be an accurate measure of anxiety symptoms in children and adults. Higher scores on the BAI indicate more anxiety symptoms. The range of BAI scores is from 0 to 63, with 0-9=Minimal anxiety, 10-16=Mild anxiety, 17-29=Moderate anxiety, and 30-63=Severe anxiety.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Menopause Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</title>
        <description>Quality of life, menopause-specific, is assessed by the Menopause Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL).
The MENQOL is self-administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert-scale format. Each item assesses the impact of one of four domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1-3), psychosocial (items 4-10), physical (items 11-26), and sexual (items 27-29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how bothersome on a zero (not bothersome) to six (extremely bothersome) scale. Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain's items by the number of items within that domain. Non-endorsement of an item is scored a &quot;1&quot; and endorsement a &quot;2&quot;, plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible score on any item ranges from 1-8. Total score also ranges from 1-8. Higher scores indicate that menopause symptoms are more bothersome.</description>

        <description>Severity of illness was assessed by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. The range of scores is 0-7. Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</title>
        <description>Menopause related symptoms were assessed using the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS). The Greene Scale provides a brief measure of menopause symptoms. It can be used to assess changes in different symptoms, before and after menopause treatment. Three main areas are measured:
1. Psychological (items 1-11). 2. Physical (items 12-18). 3. Vasomotor (items 19, 20).
A higher score indicates that menopause symptoms are more bothersome. The range of scores is from 0 to 63.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) Score at Week 8 (Visit 5)</title>
        <description>Processing speed, working memory, visuospatial processing and attention was assessed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST).
The DSST test requires the examinee to transcribe a unique geometric symbol with its corresponding Arabic number. The examinee is initially shown a key containing the numbers from 1 to 9. Under each number there is a corresponding geometric symbol. The examinee is then shown a series of boxes containing numbers in the top boxes, and blank boxes below them. After a short practice trial, they are then asked to copy the corresponding geometric symbol under each number. The raw score is the number of correct items completed within the prescribed time limit. Higher scores indicate faster processing speed, working memory, and visuospatial processing and attention. The range of scores is 0-63.</description>
