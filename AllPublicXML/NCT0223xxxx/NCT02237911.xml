  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although total knee replacement (TKR) improves pain in numerous patients, it does not resolve
      many of the substantial functional limitations and physical inactivity that existed for a
      long time prior to the surgery. Exercise is an intervention that could improve these
      long-term limitations. To promote these improvements, exercise should be implemented at later
      stage post TKR when patients can tolerate doses of exercise sufficiently high to promote
      substantial changes. To date, we just don't have enough good research to tell us which type
      of exercise works best for which patients and under which circumstances at later stage post
      TKR. This research study will provide evidence for recommended interventions during the later
      stage post TKR. The specific research questions are: (1) How do group exercise in the
      community and individual exercise in rehabilitation clinic compare with usual medical care on
      physical function and activity outcomes? (2) Who are the patients most likely to respond to
      each exercise intervention? (3) Are the approaches safe?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative effectiveness study, designed as a 3-group single-blind randomized
      clinical trial. Two hundred forty older adults who underwent TKR at least 2 months prior and
      are otherwise eligible will be randomized into one of three treatment approaches: 1)
      clinic-based individual outpatient rehabilitative exercise; 2) community-based group exercise
      classes; or 3) usual medical care. Subjects will be treated for 3 months. Data will be
      collected before intervention, after intervention (3 months), and 6 months after
      randomization. Physical function is a primary outcome and will be assessed by the Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and a battery of performance-based tests
      germane to patients post TKR that includes ability to walk, manage stairs, lift from the
      floor and the chair, and one-leg balance. We will also use an accelerometer-based monitor
      that provides a real-time measure of physical activity during normal daily living and is able
      to accurately capture most levels of activity. Linear mixed models will be fitted to compare
      the changes in outcome across groups. Logistic regression will identify patient
      characteristics that predict functional recovery in the exercise groups. Survival analysis
      and instrumental variable methods will be used to compare attrition, adherence and adverse
      events between groups.

    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC-PF consists of 17 items related to physical function. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-type Scale with descriptors from 0-4 (none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme difficulty). Scores of each item are summed for a maximum total score on the WOMAC-PF of 68. Higher scores indicate worse functional limitations.</description>
