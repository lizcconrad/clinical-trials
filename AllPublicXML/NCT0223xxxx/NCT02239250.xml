    <textblock>
      DelAgua Health Rwanda (Implementation) Ltd. together with Rwanda Ministry of Health (MoH) are
      delivering an intervention, consisting on the free distribution of one advance water filter
      and one improved cookstove to all household classified as ubudehe 1 and 2 according to
      government approved registers (poorest tertile), in Western Province. The aim of this
      intervention is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhoeal diseases and
      pneumonia in Rwanda.

      The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) will be undertaking an independent
      evaluation of this large-scale intervention to assess its impact on health. The trial will
      evaluate whether the provision of improved cookstoves and advance water filters can reduce
      pneumonia and diarrhoea disease in children under 5 years of age.

      A cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) with two arms of unequal size (3:1 ratio) will
      be use to answer this question. The 96 sectors in Western Province, Rwanda, will be
      randomised to either receive the intervention or the control. Each eligible household in
      intervention sectors will receive one EcoZoom™ Spartan and one Vestergaard Frandsen Lifestraw
      Family™ 2.1 water filter free of charge. Eligible households in control sectors will continue
      with their traditional cooking and drinking practices. Health data on children under 5 years
      of age will be collected from community health worker (CHW) and health facility records all
      across Western Province to evaluate the health impact of the intervention. The study will
      encompass 12 months of follow-up. After this time the control sectors will receive the
      intervention.

      This independent evaluation will also include a nested village-level study within the larger
      sector-level study, with the aim to evaluate uptake, consistent use and acceptability of the
      intervention, as well as to assess the impact on environmental exposures and health outcomes.
      174 villages (74 controls and 74 intervention) will be selected for participation. Household
      surveys will be used to collect data on intervention use and acceptability as well as on
      self-reported health data. Water samples will be collected and monitoring of exposure to
      Households Air Pollution (HAP) will be undertaken. Measurements of blood pressure, expirated
      Carbon monoxide (CO) and pulse CO-oximetry will be undertake in primary cooks and or children
      under 5 years of age. Additionally, as part of this nested study, two exploratory studies
      will also be conducted. One will be focused on assessing the potential of biomarkers as
      indicators of environmental exposures (mainly HAP and water quality) and health status, while
      the other exploratory sub-study will assess the reactivity of participants to the use of
      remotely reporting electronic sensors to measure target behaviours.

    <description>The Vestergaard Frandsen Lifestraw Family™ 2.1 is a point-of-use water treatment system.Water is poured through a 20 micron pre-filter into a 6L influent water tank.This water then filters through a 0.20 micron hollow-fiber ultrafiltration membrane into a 5.5L storage container.Water is then poured through a plastic tap, which prevents re-contamination.This system filters up to 18,000L of water.The system exceeds the WHO's &quot;highly protective&quot; standard for household water treatment technologies.The EcoZoom™ Spartan stove concentrates the combustion process while channeling airflow to completely burn the fuel provided.The stove has a ceramic combustion chamber within a steel housing, which is topped with a cast iron stove.The stove includes a rack for placing firewood and a pot skirt that improves the thermal efficiency.The cookstoves and filters will be delivered together at no cost to participating households.Households will receive instructions on how to operate these devices.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Sector-level study:

          -  All households shown on updated 2012 government registers to be members of ubudehe 1
             and 2 in Western Province, Rwanda will be eligible to participate in the study.

          -  For nested village-level study:

          -  All villages from all sectors in Western province, according to official Government
             lists will be eligible for participation with the exception of those villages that
             were selected for participation in Phase 1.

          -  At the village-level, all households that are classified as ubudehe 1 &amp; 2 according to
             updated 2012 government registers, are part of the village, are able to provide
             informed consent, and that have at least one child under 4 years of age at the time of
             enrollment will be eligible for participation. Presence of a child under 4 years of
             age will be assessed by checking dates of birth or recorded age in months in the CHW
             register of children &lt;5 years (Igitabo Cy'Ibikorwa Byo Gukurikirana), which are
             maintained at the village by CHW (though occasionally these are transferred to health
             centers). If this data is missing will be assesses based on CHW's report. In those
             cases where a village has more than the required number of participating households
             (10 household), a random selection of 10 households will be drawn.

          -  For the assessment of personal exposure to HAP a stricter set of eligibility criteria
             will be applied. Households that comply with the following eligibility criteria will
             be eligible for the exposure to HAP sub-study.

               -  Have a child 1.5-4 year old,

               -  Have a child healthy enough to wear the monitoring equipment (as perceived by the
                  mother),

               -  Have a non-smoking primary cook,

               -  Have a primary cook that is currently not pregnant (as far as she is aware of),
                  and

               -  Have a primary cook that is in a healthy state to wear the monitoring equipment

          -  The first two households identified from a randomised list will be invited to
             participate.

          -  For the biomarker sub-studies, both the primary cook and the child under 4 years of
             age from households undergoing HAP exposure assessment will be eligible for the
             inflammatory cytokine biomarker study. For the enteric seroconversion study, all
             children aged 6 to 12 months will be eligible for participation.
