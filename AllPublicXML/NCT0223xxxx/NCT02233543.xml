  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether a fixed dose combination of indacaterol
      and glycopyrronium (QVA149) has an impact on night-time blood oxygen levels in Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of COPD (according to GOLD guidelines, updated 2014) with a
             post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70

          -  Patients with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥30% and &lt;60% of the predicted normal value

          -  Resting daytime oxygen saturation levels measured by pulse oximetry of ≤95% SpO2

          -  Smoking history of at least 10 pack years (Ten pack-years are defined as 20 cigarettes
             a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An exacerbation of COPD (treatment with oral or parenteral antibiotics and/or
             glucocorticosteroids and/or hospitalization related to COPD) within 4 weeks prior to
             screening or during the run-in period

          -  Diagnosed asthma

          -  Patients receiving regular long term oxygen therapy (LTOT)

          -  Ongoing / planned rehabilitation during the study period

          -  Three or more awakenings during the night leading to toilet visit or other reasons for
             exiting the bed during the last week prior to the screening visit due to non-COPD
             reasons

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
