  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to compare standard patient navigation with an enhanced navigation
      partnered with the Medical Legal Partnership | Boston (MLP) to determine if assessing legal
      needs of newly diagnosed cancer patients in addition to other barriers to care leads to
      better clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Differences and delays in the delivery of cancer care lead to more advanced cancer at the
      time of diagnosis and ultimately to more deaths for low-income and minority communities. Our
      group helped develop a patient-navigation model using lay health workers to address patient
      barriers and coordinated cancer-care services, leading to more timely care. Despite the fact
      that patient navigation is now a standard required by the Commission on Cancer, the
      investigators' research shows that delays in care persist for our low-income patients with
      socio-legal barriers. Socio-legal barriers are defined as social problems related to meeting
      life's most basic needs that are supported by public policy or programming and thus
      potentially remedied through legal advocacy/action (e.g., unsafe/unstable housing, unlawful
      utility shutoffs, or job termination). Direct feedback from cancer patients suggests a
      critical need to address socio-legal barriers in order to achieve quality care for all. To
      expand the current impact of patient navigation on quality care for low-income patients, the
      investigators will partner with patients, key community stakeholders, and the Medical-Legal
      Partnership (MLP)|Boston, the founding site of a nationwide program assisting healthcare
      teams in addressing socio-legal barriers to health. Under direction from a Patient Advisory
      Group and a Community Advisory Board, the investigators will conduct a study to compare
      standard navigation with an MLP navigation intervention enhanced by legal support for
      low-income cancer patients.

      The investigators will enroll 374 low-income, racially diverse, newly diagnosed cancer
      patients. Half will receive standard navigation, i.e., a lay navigator integrated into the
      healthcare team who provides one-on-one patient contact to address traditional system
      barriers to care. The other half will receive MLP navigation, i.e., standard navigation
      enhanced by legal support including:

        1. a full socio-legal needs assessment and care plan in consultation with MLP; and

        2. legal assistance for eligible urgent legal needs. We will compare each group on all
           outcomes.

      Compared to standard navigation, we expect that addressing socio-legal barriers to care with
      MLP navigation will improve patient-reported outcomes and lead to more timely care delivery.
      Because of widespread national availability of patient navigation and MLP programs at
      hospitals serving vulnerable patients, this intervention can be quickly replicated to improve
      patient experience and survival.

    <description>The receipt of timely care will be defined as initiation of care within 90 days, as this the shortest delay that has been shown to consistently affect mortality The time element will be calculated from date of diagnosis (Time0) to date of treatment initiation (Time1) .The date chosen for the Time1 variable will depend on the recommended care plan for each patient, as derived from the chart abstraction and based on patient presentation, including but not limited to stage at diagnosis and co-morbid medical conditions.</description>

    <description>Distress and patient centered needs will be assessed through patient interviews utilizing the Cancer Needs Distress Inventory (CaNDI) instrument. The CaNDI is a 39-item self-report instrument that rates need and distress level in the past two weeks from a scale 5 -point Likert scale</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Efficacy will be assessed through patient interviews utilizing the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy (CASE). The CASE is a 12-item instrument that rates self-efficacy in three domains: (1) seeking and obtaining information, (2) understanding and participating in care, and (3) maintaining a positive attitude.</description>

    <description>The receipt of quality care will be defined as a dichotomous variable (Y/N) based on select measures of quality care, as developed jointly by the Commission on Cancer, NCCN and American Society of Clinical Oncology. Quality care will be measured using data abstracted from medical chart.</description>
