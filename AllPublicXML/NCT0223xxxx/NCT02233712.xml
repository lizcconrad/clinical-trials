  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label, dose-finding, schedule-changing, sequential, multiple dose, multi-center study
      in patients with Stage I-III gastric cancer. The first group of patients received a starting
      dose of 250 µg at weeks 0, 1, and 3. Thereafter, allocation to treatment with 100 µg or 500
      µg was based on antibody response and dose tolerability.
