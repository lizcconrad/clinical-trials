  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access use of Stiripentol in Dravet Syndrome or epileptic
      encephalopathies associated with sodium channel mutations who have failed other drugs in an
      effort to give them the best chance at seizure control and quality of life. As a treatment
      protocol and not a research study, children will only be monitored on a clinical basis for
      seizure improvement and side effects predominantly by parent and caregiver report.

    <textblock>
      The initial dose of Stiripentol will be determined by the prescribing neurologist and
      titrated up to an initial goal dose of 50 mg/kg/day divided into 2 to 3 doses per day.
      Further dose increases by 10-20 mg/kg/day increments up to a max of 100 mg/kg/day or 4000 mg
      total daily dose may be necessary for improved seizure control.

      Stiripentol is available as gelatin capsules and powder sachets (250 mg, 500 mg). The same
      granule formulation (i.e. active, PVP and portion of sodium starch glycolate) used for the
      capsule is used in the final powder blend with a few additional excipients. Depending upon
      patient weight, the 250 mg or 500 mg formulation will be utilized for each participant.

      Caretakers will be queried about common adverse effects including drowsiness, tremor, ataxis,
      nausea, anorexia, weight loss, and emesis. Intolerable adverse effects will prompt dose
      reduction or withholding medication.

      Monitoring of these and other potential AEs will occur during study visits and
      participant-initiated telephone calls throughout the study. Safety events and tolerability
      will be recorded as adverse events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE).

      Physical examination, weight, vital signs, and laboratory tests (cbc, complete metabolic
      panel, and AED levels) will be conducted at baseline and at least every 6 months and as
      clinically warranted.
