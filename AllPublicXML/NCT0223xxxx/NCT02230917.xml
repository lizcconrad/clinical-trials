  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lytic bone disease continues to be one of the most devastating complications of multiple
      myeloma (MM) despite recent and dramatic advancements in MM management, and bone lesions
      persist and can continue to significantly impact a patient's morbidity, even when an
      individual's myeloma is otherwise under good control. To date, no agent has been shown to
      have a prolonged bone anabolic response in myeloma.

      Preliminary studies treating healthy postmenopausal women with a single dose of sotatercept
      demonstrated a rapid and sustained increase in serum biochemical markers of bone formation
      and a decrease in markers of bone resorption. Similarly, the murine analog to sotatercept,
      RAP-011, increases bone mineral density and strength in murine studies of both normal animals
      and models of bone loss. We hypothesize that sotatercept will provide an anabolic response
      for bone in myeloma patients with bone disease.
