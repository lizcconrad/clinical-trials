    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study study is to determine whether the Feldenkrais method is effective
      on pain control, functional recovery and quality of life in patients with chronic low back
      pain by comparing it with a Back School program.

    <measure>Change of Visual analogue scale (VAS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is based on a ten point scale, where 0 means no pain and 10 the greatest pain ever. It enables the patients to express their pain intensity as numerical values.</description>

    <measure>Change of SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is divided into eight sub-categories that measure the physical activity, role limitations due to physical health and emotional state, physical pain, the perception of general health, vitality, social activities, mental health and changes in health status and two indices that summarize the overall assessment of the subject with respect to his physical health (ISF) and mental (ISM).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of McGill Pain Questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scales evaluates the degree of functional impairment in activities of daily life caused by pain. It consist of ten sections including pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting standing, sleeping, sex, social life and travelling. Each section includes six sentences relating to different level of limitation in the same activity (0: no limitation, 5: maximal limitation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Waddell Disability Index from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It includes nine parameters: pain experienced in a sitting position, travelling, standing,walking and lifting weights and the need to put on or remove footwear, sleep disturbance, life restriction and sex life restriction to measure. The maximum score is 9 points. A score &gt; 5 indicates significant disability.</description>

    <measure>Change of Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awarness (MAIA) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is divided into 32 items organized into eight subcategories consisting of three to seven items each. The subcategories measure: the awareness of unpleasant, pleasant or neutral body sensations, the tendency not to ignore the feelings of pain or discomfort, not to worry about painful sensations or discomfort, the ability not to draw attention away from body sensations, awareness of the existence of connections between body sensations and emotional status, the ability to control the psychological stress by focusing on body sensations, the ability to listen to your body and the belief that the experiences coming from your body are safe and reliable. It 'a multidimensional assessment questionnaire and self-administered. For each subcategory, the patient may express a score from 0 (never) to 5 (always), the highest score corresponds to a higher level of awareness.</description>

    <description>The Feldenkrais method is a self education method that uses the somatic sensory-motor learning to enhance the functions of people in daily life activities through the awareness of their motor habits and the experience of more efficient alternatives.</description>

    <description>The Back School teaches the patient, with theoretical and practical knowledge, how to defend his own back from the pain and how to prevent their disease, considering awareness and education as important parts of the therapeutic process .</description>

    <description>The program of Awareness Through Movement Â® chosen for this study, teaches the basic movements of the column. The aim is to stimulate changes in the chronic pathological patterns and in the distorted kinesthetic perceptions that so often hinder the rehabilitation of chronic non-specific low back pain. The patients will be treated in outpatient with the Feldenkrais method. Each group will consist of four or five patients who carry out the rehabilitation treatment with a frequency of twice a week for five consecutive weeks for a total of 10 sessions, each lasting about one hour.</description>

    <intervention_name>Back School</intervention_name>
    <description>The rehabilitation program of Back School is divided into two parts: one theoretical and one practical. To obtain an effective action not only in reducing pain but also in preventing relapse, the Back School acts on the typical risk factors of chronic non-specific low back pain, such as incorrect postures and movements, psychological stress, poor physical fitness, overweight, obesity, smoking, and insufficient knowledge of the spine. The patients will be treated in outpatient with a Back School program. Each group will consist of four or five patients who carry out the rehabilitation treatment with a frequency of twice a week for five consecutive weeks for a total of 10 sessions, each lasting about one hour.</description>
