  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In human gait there is a certain amount of variation between steps; some considered
      physiological and owed to variations in environment or posture, and some severe enough to be
      indicative of gait instabilities that may lead to stumbling and falling. In users of lower
      limb prosthetics, such gait instabilities are of especially great interest.

      The study investigates the correlation between socket alignment quality and gait step-by-step
      variability in users of trans-tibial-prosthetics. It is hypothesized that a clearly defined
      range of step-by-step variability exists, and that therefore step-by-step variability is
      suitable as an outcome variable for the assessment of socket alignment.

      A sample of ten persons with trans-tibial amputation will be recruited for this pilot study.
      Subjects will be asked to walk on different natural surfaces while the socket alignment is
      successively perturbed. Step-by-step variations in horizontal ground reaction forces and
      torsional moments will be measured and statistically compared.

    <description>Peak horizontal ground reaction force (Fx and Fy) as well as peak axial torsion moment (Mz) will be extracted for 10 consecutive intermediary steps for each testing condition. Total range in Newtons over the 10 step sample, as well as maximal difference between consecutive steps in Newtons and percent will be reported for statistical analysis.</description>
