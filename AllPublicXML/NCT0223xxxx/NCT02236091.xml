  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to monitor everyday life activity of children with
      neurological disorders undergoing rehabilitation using wearable sensors capable of accurate
      and unobtrusive long-term measurement.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To adapt the sensors for the use by children with neurological disorders. The focus lies
           on the exact positioning and the investigation of the needed amount of IMUs.

        2. To validate the sensor data with collected video recordings and to develop specific
           algorithms to automatically extract specific movements and to analyze long-term sensor
           recordings.

        3. To perform a cross-sectional study to assess intensity, task-specificity and duration of
           upper and lower limb activity during rehabilitation. There, we aim to gain objective
           information about levels and types of activity during rehabilitation in relation to age,
           gender and disorder.

        4. To conduct a responsiveness study to assess whether or not the sensor output is able to
           highlight changes over time during rehabilitation.

      Therefore, at time point T=0 (shortly after admission to our center), participants are
      equipped with 3 inertial measurement units (1 at each wrist and 1 at the sternum).
      Additionally, a small wearable camera is mounted to the chest. The participants then return
      to their everyday life for 4 hours (no therapies, measurement period is in the evening).
      Afterwards, the equipment is removed again. To investigate responsiveness, the same protocol
      is being repeated 4 weeks later (time point T=1).

    <measure>Motor assessment: Melbourne 2 at time point T=0</measure>
    <time_frame>At T=0</time_frame>
    <description>The Melbourne Assessment 2: a test of unilateral upper limb function is a validated and reliable tool for evaluating quality of upper limb movement in children with neurological conditions aged 2.5 to 15 years. For ease of use the assessment's full title is simplified to The Melbourne Assessment 2 or MA2.
The MA2 is a criterion-referenced test that extends and refines the scale properties of the original Melbourne Assessment. The MA2 measures four elements of upper limb movement quality: movement range, accuracy, dexterity and fluency. It comprises 14 test items of reaching to, grasping, releasing and manipulating simple objects. Each child's test performance is videorecorded for subsequent scoring.</description>

    <description>The ABILHAND-Kids is a measure of manual ability for children with upper limb impairments. The scale measures a person's ability to manage daily activities that require the use of the upper limbs, whatever the strategies involved.</description>
