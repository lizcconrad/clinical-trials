      The primary efficacy endpoint:

        1. The primary end point was the duration of illness which was defined as the time from
           onset of symptoms to the alleviation of the ten influenza-like symptoms including ,
           nasal obstruction, running nose, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia, chills
           and sweating.

        2. The time to defervescence, defined as the time from the first dose of study medication
           to the time when the body temperature declined to lower than 37.4ºC and was sustained
           for at least 24 hours.

      Secondary efficacy endpoint:

      The secondary end points included: 1) viral shedding duration, defined as the time from the
      illness onset to the first time the viral nucleic acid test was negative; 2) the severity of
      the disease,assessed by an area under the curve (AUC) analysis of a total of nine
      influenza-like symptom scores, the AUC was calculated as the product of the daily symptom
      scores times the duration of illness;3)frequency of Usage of Acetaminophen;4)and incidence of
      secondary complications of influenza, such as otitis, bronchitis, pneumonia，Nasosinusitis
      ,suppurative tonsillitis,acute parotitis，Reye'ssyndrome，central nervous system disease,
      Myocarditis and pericarditis, acute myositis, and toxic shock syndrome.5) economic
      evaluation.

      Specimen:

      the pharyngeal or the throat swab，blood. Pharyngea /throat secretions will be obtained from
      the upper respiratory tract of each patient.

      All specimens will be stored at -80℃ in virus laboratory of the first affiliated hospital of
      guangzhou medical university for 5 years.
