  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tennis elbow is a common occurrence in the general population that causes lateral elbow pain
      and diminished grip strength, which may be debilitating. Most affected individuals achieve
      symptom resolution within 6 months to 1 year with measures such as physiotherapy,
      anti-inflammatories and corticosteroid injections, but a small subset will go on to develop
      chronic symptoms. Chronic tennis elbow can be treated surgically, with arthroscopy gaining
      popularity in recent years as it presents a less invasive option, allows for direct
      visualization of the elbow joint for other pathology and has a faster return-to-work time
      compared to other surgical procedures. Despite its promise there have been no high quality
      studies evaluating the efficacy of arthroscopic tennis elbow release, bringing the actual
      efficacy of this procedure into question. We propose a randomized, double-blind controlled
      trial comparing arthroscopic release with arthroscopic debridement for the management of
      chronic tennis elbow in an effort to definitively answer this question and provide better
      recommendations for the use of this procedure.
