    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Swedish Prison Program which started back in 1987 and up until 2009 was
      called &quot;The Social Medicine Remand Prison Project&quot; is to target injecting drug users (IDU)
      with primary and secondary health interventions with regards to injecting and sexual risk
      behaviours and infectious diseases such as hepatitis C and B, HIV and sexually transmitted
      infections (STI).

      The overall aim is to assess the effect of different prevention efforts on HIV/HCV risk
      behaviour and disease outcome among IDUs over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Risk behaviour for IDU is sexual risk taking, i.e., sex without a condom, buying or selling
      sex and injection risk taking, i.e., sharing needle, syringe or paraphernalia.
