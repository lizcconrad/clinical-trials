      Is Yogic Exercises increasing respiratory function in patients with obstructive lung
      diseases. Will YE improve respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, inspiratory and
      expiratory pressure, lung function, perceived dyspnea, dyspnea-related distress (DD), less
      frequency of dyspnea and heart rate variability in patients with pulmonary disease.
      Qualitative content analysis will be performed on approximately 15 interviews with patients
      participated in the yoga group about their experiences and their benefits
      perceived/experienced of the yogic exercises

      We want to try YE as an alternative treatment in patients with mild to severe pulmonary
      disease.
