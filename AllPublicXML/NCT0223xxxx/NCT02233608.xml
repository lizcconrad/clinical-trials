  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy is a common and effective treatment for prostate cancer but is
      associated with urinary incontinence that can persist for several months after surgery and
      significantly reduce quality of life. Studies have shown that routine performance of pelvic
      floor exercises after radical prostatectomy can aid in the recovery of urinary control;
      however, conventional pelvic floor exercises do not produce consistent results. Research
      indicates that incorporating other deep abdominal muscles can further activate the pelvic
      floor making it stronger than by activating the pelvic floor alone. Specifically, 'Pfilates'
      and 'Hypopressives' are two new techniques that combine traditional pelvic floor exercises
      with activation of supportive muscles. Our proposed study will be the first to test the
      effect of an advanced pelvic floor exercise training program that includes Pfilates and
      Hypopressives to treat urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy. Our primary aim
      of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale RCT of an advanced
      pelvic floor exercise training program, including standard pelvic floor exercises, Pfilates,
      and Hypopressives techniques on urinary incontinence. Feasibility will be determined by
      measuring recruitment success, retention, outcome capture, and intervention adherence,
      tolerance, and safety. We hypothesize men under going radical prostatectomy for prostate
      cancer in the advance pelvic floor training program will report greater improvement in
      urinary incontinence and health-related quality of life.

    <time_frame>When recruitment is complete (approximately 12 months after study initiation; October 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>Prior pelvic floor training trials in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy have observed recruitment rates of 21-70%. We will measure recruitment success through participant recruitment per week and record reasons for non-participation from those who inquire about the study and are eligible to participate but refuse.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to intervention group</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to the two groups (standard pelvic floor exercises and advanced pelvic floor exercises) will be measured through a logbook that is included in their respective program manuals as well as a logbook completed by the research coordinator during the weekly telephone communications.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Study retention</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks post-operative</time_frame>

    <measure>24-hour Pad Test for Urinary Leakage</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, approximately 1 week prior to surgery, and 2, 6, 12, 26 weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>A 24-hour pad test will be used to measure urinary incontinence by assessing the quantity of urine lost in one day. A urinary leakage pad is measured after a 24-hour period and compared to the unused pad weight and is used to most accurately assess the severity of urinary incontinence.</description>

    <measure>Pelvic Floor Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, approximately 1 week prior to surgery, and 2, 6, 12, 26, weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Digital rectal examination of pelvic floor strength by a specially trained pelvic floor physiotherapist will be conducted. Pelvic floor strength will be graded on the Modified Oxford Scale.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, approximately 1 week prior to surgery, and 2, 6, 12, 26 weeks post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate specific quality of life will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Prostate (FACT-P) and the Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale (PORPUS).</description>

    <measure>3-Day Bladder Diary for Urinary Incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, approximately 1 week prior to surgery, and 2, 6, 12, 26 week post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The bladder diary is a standard instrument for self-reporting voiding patterns. Items include fluid intake, frequency of toilet voids, episode of urine loss, number of pads used, and activity during event for the three-day period. Bladder diaries are widely used in clinical trials assessing urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.</description>

    <description>Urological symptoms are assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Additional, a single item regarding leaking urine and bladder control from the PORPUS will be used to evaluate incontinence. Erectile function will be assessed using the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function scale (5-IIEF).</description>

    <description>The usual care group will receive generic pelvic floor muscle exercise (PMFX) instructions and demonstrations by the research coordinator at the initial post-operative time point. This will include instruction on how to engage the pelvic floor and specific PFMX prescription. Repetition volume will start at 20 repetitions per day during weeks 1-2; 60/day during weeks 3-4; and 90/day during weeks 5-6, and 100+/day for weeks 7-26. The total number of repetitions will be divided equally between rhythmic (contract and relaxed over one second) and sustained contractions (contract and hold for up to 10 seconds).</description>
