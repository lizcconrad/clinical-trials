      A dose escalation, safety study of local (intra-arterially) delivered gemcitabine to the
      pancreas using the RenovoCath R120 catheter to determine the maximum tolerated dose.

    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer who may or may not have had prior
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be eligible to enroll in this dose escalation study to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine to be delivered locally to the pancreatic
      tumors using the RenovoCath R120 catheter. Patients enrolled may receive up to 8
      catheterizations for delivering gemcitabine directly to the pancreatic tumors starting at a
      reduced dose( 1/4 of standard i.v. gemcitabine dose), then every two doses, increase the dose
      by 25% if there are no toxicities up to a maximum dose of 1000 mg/m2. There are four cycles,
      with two doses per cycle. Imaging studies will be conducted as well as assessment for
      standard, myelosuppresive and gastric toxicities will be assessed. Pain will also be measured
      throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be eligible to participate in the study if all of the following criteria are
        met:

          1. Males and female subjects 18 years of age and older.

          2. Subjects with locally advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma (cytological or histologic
             proof required) of the pancreas.. Patients with islet cell tumors are not eligible.

          3. No clinical evidence of distant metastases, excluding single liver metastasis and
             local lymph node involvement. Patients with more than a single liver metastasis and/or
             other metastases who have already failed systemic chemotherapy and/or are on a break
             from systemic chemotherapy who are not surgical candidates can also qualify for this
             study.

          4. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &gt;60.

          5. Adequate renal, and bone marrow function described as:

               1. Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/uL

               2. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/uL

               3. Platelets ≥100,000/uL

               4. Serum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL. Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or
                  creatinine clearance greater than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine
                  levels above institutional normal, as calculated by the Cockcroft Gault formula.

               5. Hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL (may be receiving supportive therapy)

               6. PT/PTT (WNL)

          6. Adequate Hepatic function (endoscopic or percutaneous drainage as needed) described
             as:

               1. Total bilirubin ≤3 times UNL (less than or equal to 2 mg/dL)

               2. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 times ULN or ≤5 times ULN in the setting of liver
                  metastases.

               3. Lipase and Amylase within normal limits.
