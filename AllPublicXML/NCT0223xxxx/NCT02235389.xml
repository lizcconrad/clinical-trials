  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of treating acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI) by physician-directed pre-hospital thrombosis, using accelerated alteplase
      (Actilyse®) and a diagnostic technique involving remote electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition
      by paramedics

          -  Patient will be ineligible for pre hospital administration of actilyse if any of the
             following apply:

               -  Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with a thrombolytic agent within the
                  preceding 4 days

               -  BP (blood pressure) &gt; 180/100 mmHg (on one measurement)

               -  Significant bleeding disorder within the past 6 months

               -  Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma (including

                  to the subject if the investigational therapy was to be initiated

          -  Patients who are not excluded from thrombolytic therapy by the criteria above will, in
             addition, need to satisfy the following 'inclusion' criteria prior to the pre -

                  electrocardiogram (ECG) standard leads indicative of AMI, or ST elevation &gt;= 0.2
                  mV in two contiguous chest leads and all left bundle branch block (LBBB) with
                  clinical indication of AMI
