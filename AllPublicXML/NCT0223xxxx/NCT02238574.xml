  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in therapy, head and neck carcinomas still have a poor prognosis with a
      5-year survival of ~ 50%. Malignancies of the head and neck area are (almost) always preceded
      by precursor lesions. Treatment of these premalignant mucosal abnormalities is generally
      limited and not very inconvenient for the patient. If this precursor lesion remain untreated,
      it may develop into a malignancy of the head and neck. Extensive treatment will be necessary.
      This means loss of function of the mouth, eg chewing, speaking and swallowing.

      The hypothesis is that chromosomal instability (CIN) detected by fluorescence is situ
      hybridization (FISH) is a reliable indicator for progression to malignancy. By intensifying
      the follow up and treatment in premalignant CIN lesions, the incidence of progression to
      invasive carcinoma is expected to be significantly reduced. If this hypothesis is justified,
      there will be a place for CIN detection as a risk indicator in the diagnostic work up of
      premalignant lesions in the head and neck.

      The investigators second hypothesis is that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detected bij DNA
      markers is a reliable indicator for progression to malignancy. By intensifying the outpatient
      clinic follow up and treatment in premalignant lesions, the incidence of progression to
      invasive carcinoma is expected to be significantly reduced. If this hypothesis is justified,
      there will be a place for CIN and LOH detection as a risk indicator in the diagnostic work up
      of premalignant lesions in the head and neck.
