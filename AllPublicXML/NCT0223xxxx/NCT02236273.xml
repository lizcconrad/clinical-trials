  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging communication technologies, such as text messaging offer low-cost, scalable
      opportunities to improve health literacy and promote healthy behaviors, such as vaccination.
      While the investigators reported the success of text message vaccine reminders, effects were
      limited by their untailored approach. The trans-theoretical model of behavior change supports
      tailoring interventions to an individual's stage of decision-making. Human papillomavirus
      (HPV) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted virus in the U.S. and can lead to genital
      warts, and cervical, anal and penile cancer. The three-dose vaccine is 90-100% efficacious.
      Minorities are at greatest risk for such cancers but have low HPV vaccine completion rates.
      Limited health literacy regarding the vaccine can affect series completion. The investigators
      will compare the effects of enhancing text message vaccination reminders with interactive,
      vaccine health literacy-promoting information tailored to vaccine decision making-stage on
      HPV vaccine series completion. The effects of these messages represent a new paradigm in
      interactive health communications.
