    <textblock>
      This is an Open clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of Chandrakanthi Choornam in
      40 patients with Oligospermia. Chandrakanthi choornam is a formulation consisting of 25
      ingredients. They are Curculigo orchioides -rhizome, Madhuca longifolia - flower, Cinnamomum
      verum -bark,Cinnamomum tamala-Leaf, Syzygium aromaticum - flower bud,Coscinium
      fenestratum-stem bark,Mesua ferrea-flower, Maerua arenaria-tuber, Adhatoda vasica- seed,
      Moringa oleifera-seed, Lawsonia inermis-seed, Vitis vinifera- fruit, Bombax ceiba- gum,
      Bambusa aurundinaceae-salt,Phoenix dactilifera- fruit,Ilicium verum- flower, Mucuna
      prurita-seed, Cyperus rotundus- rhizome, Glycyrrhiza glabra-root, Tribulus terrestris-fruit,
      Cuminum cyminum-seed,Costus speciosus-root,Myrsitica fragrans-seed, Alternanthera
      sessilis-seed and asphaltum-mineral. Treatment duration is three months.Study is conducted in
      India (Chennai). Primary outcome measure is to see the changes in sperm count, motility and
      morphology. Secondary Outcome measure is to see the impact on the harmone level.
