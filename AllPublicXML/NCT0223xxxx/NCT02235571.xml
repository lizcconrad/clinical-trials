  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed iChoose Kidney -- a shared decision-making support tool
      accessible through iPad, iPhone, or the web -- to provide ESRD patients and their providers
      with a simple, standardized, easily accessible, statistically robust tool for use in the
      clinic to guide patient education and healthcare decision-making about treatment options of
      dialysis or kidney transplantation. The iChoose Kidney decision aid provides patients with
      estimates of their individualized 1 and 3-year risks of mortality on dialysis vs.
      transplantation, based on previous national data. The tool has the potential to improve
      communication and decision-making between patients and their healthcare providers and improve
      access to kidney transplantation among patients with ESRD.

      This will be a two-arm, randomized study, and will be conducted at 3 large transplant centers
      with diverse patient populations. One group of patients will receive standard education alone
      during their scheduled transplant evaluation. The second group will receive the standard
      education as well have the provider use the iChoose Kidney aid with them. The project
      timeline will be a total of 24 months inclusive of enrollment, follow-up, data analysis, and
      outcome evaluation.

      This study will assess how well the iChoose decision aid works in improving patient
      knowledge, preferences for treatment, and patient access to transplant. The study will also
      assess whether providers find the tool useful for providing ways to share information with
      patients about ways to treat their kidney disease.
