  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced
      patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal
      tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. We hypothesize
      that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of
      the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in real-time as
      operate. This is a safety study to assess the safety of BLZ-100 in patients with gliomas
      undergoing surgery.

      Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent will be screened for eligibility.
      Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to
      participate.

      Subjects will be required to arrive at the hospital (or phase 1 unit if applicable) for
      dosing at least 2 hours before the planned surgical excision. Following dosing, subjects will
      be monitored for safety and surgical excision will occur at least 2 hours after study product
      administration.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects aged 18- 75 years.

          2. Subjects must have glioma for which surgical resection is clinically indicated. Grade
             I, II, III and IV glioma patients will be included (for example glioblastoma,
             astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma). Histological confirmation not required prior to
             surgery. Subjects with recurrent disease will be eligible only if the duration between
             last brain surgery and scheduled new surgery is ≥3 months. The grade of a recurrent
             tumor will be presumed that of the primary tumor for purposes of group allocation.

          3. Able to provide written informed consent.

          4. If of child-bearing potential, agree to the continued use of effective contraceptive
             from study entry (Informed consent) through 30 days after BLZ-100 administration.

          5. Available for all study visits and able to comply with all study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of metastatic disease.

          2. Female who is lactating/breastfeeding

          3. Female with a positive pregnancy test or who is planning to become pregnant during the
