    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the adhesiveness of 2 different patch
      formulations of Rotigotine using the largest patch size of 40 cm^2, under the assumption that
      both patch formulations show similar adhesiveness properties.

    <measure>Change in Average Adhesiveness Score of 2 Days of 24 Hours Patch Application as Rated by the Investigator (or Designee) Assessed According to the EMA Draft Guideline</measure>
    <time_frame>Patch adhesiveness was measured after 24 hours (±1 hour) after previous patch application on Day 2, 3, 4 and 5</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment was performed according to the adhesion score adapted from the EMA draft guideline on quality of transdermal patches (EMA/CHMMP/QWP/911254/2011, 2012).
0 = &gt; 95 - 100 % of the patch area adheres
1 = &gt; 90 - 95 % of the patch adheres
2 = &gt; 85 - 90 % of the patch adheres
3 = &gt; 80 - 85 % of the patch adheres
4 = &gt; 75 - 80 % of the patch adheres
5 = &gt; 70 - 75 % of the patch adheres
6 = ≥ 50 - 70 % of the patch adheres
7 = &lt; 50 % of the patch adheres
8 = Patch completely detached
The recorded scores 6, 7, and 8 were combined in order to create a cumulative group &quot;less than or equal to 70 % adhered or patch detachment&quot; which was regarded as significant patch adhesion failure in the draft EMA guideline.
The average of patches 1 and 2 is presented by Treatment Arm below.</description>

    <measure>Patch Adhesiveness Per Day as Rated by the Investigator 24 Hours After Patch Application According to the FDA/Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Score for Patch 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Patch adhesiveness was measured 24 hours (±1 hour) after previous patch application on Day 2 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment was performed according to the adhesion score adapted from the EMA draft guideline on quality of transdermal patches . Afterwards, EMA scores were translated into FDA/CDER scores:
0 (&gt;95-100% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 0 (FDA/CDER)
1 (&gt;90-95% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 0 (FDA/CDER)
2 (&gt;85-90% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
3 (&gt;80-85% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
4 ( &gt;75-80% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
5 (&gt;70-75% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 2 (FDA/CDER)
6 (≥50-70% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 2 (FDA/CDER)
7 (&lt;50 % of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 3 (FDA/CDER)
8 (Patch completely detached) &gt;&gt; 4 (FDA/CDER)
Due to a slight mismatch of limits between FDA scores 0 and 1 as compared to EMA scores 1 and 2, the theoretical value of exactly 90 % of adh. fell into score 1 with the FDA scoring. A similar limit mismatch occured at exactly 75 %. These mismatches may have resulted in a slightly worse estimation of the adh. with the FDA score as compared to previous adh. studies.</description>

        <title>Change in Average Adhesiveness Score of 2 Days of 24 Hours Patch Application as Rated by the Investigator (or Designee) Assessed According to the EMA Draft Guideline</title>
        <description>The assessment was performed according to the adhesion score adapted from the EMA draft guideline on quality of transdermal patches (EMA/CHMMP/QWP/911254/2011, 2012).
0 = &gt; 95 - 100 % of the patch area adheres
1 = &gt; 90 - 95 % of the patch adheres
2 = &gt; 85 - 90 % of the patch adheres
3 = &gt; 80 - 85 % of the patch adheres
4 = &gt; 75 - 80 % of the patch adheres
5 = &gt; 70 - 75 % of the patch adheres
6 = ≥ 50 - 70 % of the patch adheres
7 = &lt; 50 % of the patch adheres
8 = Patch completely detached
The recorded scores 6, 7, and 8 were combined in order to create a cumulative group &quot;less than or equal to 70 % adhered or patch detachment&quot; which was regarded as significant patch adhesion failure in the draft EMA guideline.
The average of patches 1 and 2 is presented by Treatment Arm below.</description>

        <title>Patch Adhesiveness Per Day as Rated by the Investigator 24 Hours After Patch Application According to the EMA Draft Guideline for Patch 2</title>
        <description>The assessment was performed according to the adhesion score adapted from the EMA draft guideline on quality of transdermal patches (EMA/CHMMP/QWP/911254/2011, 2012).
0 = &gt;95 - 100 % of the patch area adheres
1 = &gt;90 - 95 % of the patch adheres
2 = &gt;85 - 90 % of the patch adheres
3 = &gt;80 - 85 % of the patch adheres
4 = &gt;75 - 80 % of the patch adheres
5 = &gt;70 - 75 % of the patch adheres
6 = ≥50 - 70 % of the patch adheres
7 = &lt;50 % of the patch adheres
8 = Patch completely detached
The recorded scores 6, 7, and 8 were combined in order to create a cumulative group “less than or equal to 70 % adhered or patch detachment” which was regarded as significant patch adhesion failure in the draft EMA guideline.</description>

        <title>Patch Adhesiveness Per Day as Rated by the Investigator 24 Hours After Patch Application According to the FDA/Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Score for Patch 1</title>
        <description>The assessment was performed according to the adhesion score adapted from the EMA draft guideline on quality of transdermal patches . Afterwards, EMA scores were translated into FDA/CDER scores:
0 (&gt;95-100% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 0 (FDA/CDER)

7 (&lt;50 % of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 3 (FDA/CDER)
8 (Patch completely detached) &gt;&gt; 4 (FDA/CDER)
Due to a slight mismatch of limits between FDA scores 0 and 1 as compared to EMA scores 1 and 2, the theoretical value of exactly 90 % of adh. fell into score 1 with the FDA scoring. A similar limit mismatch occured at exactly 75 %. These mismatches may have resulted in a slightly worse estimation of the adh. with the FDA score as compared to previous adh. studies.</description>

        <title>Change in Average Patch Adhesiveness Score of 2 Days of 24 Hour Patch Application as Rated by the Investigator (or Designee), Assessed According to the FDA/Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Score</title>
        <description>The assessment was performed according to the adhesion score adapted from the EMA draft guideline on quality of transdermal patches . Afterwards, EMA scores were translated into FDA/CDER scores:
0 (&gt;95-100% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 0 (FDA/CDER)
1 (&gt;90-95% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 0 (FDA/CDER)
2 (&gt;85-90% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
3 (&gt;80-85% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
4 ( &gt;75-80% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
5 (&gt;70-75% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 2 (FDA/CDER)
6 (≥50-70% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 2 (FDA/CDER)
7 (&lt;50 % of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 3 (FDA/CDER)
8 (Patch completely detached) &gt;&gt; 4 (FDA/CDER)
Due to a slight mismatch of limits between FDA scores 0 and 1 as compared to EMA scores 1 and 2, the theoretical value of exactly 90 % of adh. fell into score 1 with the FDA scoring. A similar limit mismatch occured at exactly 75 %. These mismatches may have resulted in a slightly worse estimation of the adh. with the FDA score as compared to previous adh. studies.</description>

          <title>Change in Average Patch Adhesiveness Score of 2 Days of 24 Hour Patch Application as Rated by the Investigator (or Designee), Assessed According to the FDA/Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Score</title>
          <description>The assessment was performed according to the adhesion score adapted from the EMA draft guideline on quality of transdermal patches . Afterwards, EMA scores were translated into FDA/CDER scores:
0 (&gt;95-100% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 0 (FDA/CDER)
1 (&gt;90-95% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 0 (FDA/CDER)
2 (&gt;85-90% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
3 (&gt;80-85% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
4 ( &gt;75-80% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 1 (FDA/CDER)
5 (&gt;70-75% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 2 (FDA/CDER)
6 (≥50-70% of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 2 (FDA/CDER)
7 (&lt;50 % of patch adheres) &gt;&gt; 3 (FDA/CDER)
8 (Patch completely detached) &gt;&gt; 4 (FDA/CDER)
Due to a slight mismatch of limits between FDA scores 0 and 1 as compared to EMA scores 1 and 2, the theoretical value of exactly 90 % of adh. fell into score 1 with the FDA scoring. A similar limit mismatch occured at exactly 75 %. These mismatches may have resulted in a slightly worse estimation of the adh. with the FDA score as compared to previous adh. studies.</description>
