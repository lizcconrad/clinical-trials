  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, iron- and zinc-biofortified pearl millet will be fed to young children in
      Mumbai, Maharashtra, India over a period of nine months to measure growth and immune function
      in comparison to children receiving non-biofortified pearl millet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron and zinc deficiency remain a major worldwide public health problem, especially in
      developing countries such as India. In this randomized study, 700 children aged 12-18 months
      from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India will be fed either iron and zinc biofortified pearl millet or
      control pearl millet three times per day, six days per week, for nine months. The goal of
      this study is to examine the effects of iron and zinc biofortified millet on immune function,
      growth, and cognitive function in this age group. The key outcome measures are biomarkers of
      iron and zinc status, growth, and immune function. Serum concentrations of hemoglobin,
      ferritin, serum transferrin receptor, and zinc will be assessed at enrollment (baseline), at
      an intermediate time point (midline; random serial sampling) and after 9 months of follow-up
      (endline). Additionally, we will measure concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha
      1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as iron and zinc biomarkers can be influenced by inflammation. To
      assess cognitive function in a subset, multiple specific aspects of memory, attention, and
      processing speed will be assessed. Higher-level, integrative cognitive abilities that require
      the coordination of multiple specific functions, such as problem-solving and exploratory
      behavior and global aspects of attention during free play with toys, will also be assessed.
