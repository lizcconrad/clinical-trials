    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of Medihoney and Hydrophor on radiation
      dermatitis reactions in a group of women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer. It
      is hoped that the outcome of this pilot study will provide evidence supporting the use of
      Medihoney in preventing and treating radiation dermatitis as well as sufficient preliminary
      data to expand this study to larger, federally funded research (R01) looking at the
      beneficial aspects of Medihoney across a spectrum of radiation dermatitis and mucositis in
      several disease settings.

      Background: Radiation dermatitis, also known as radiodermatitis or radiation skin reaction,
      is a widely reported side effect of radiation therapy in cancer. The most common radiation
      therapy-induced side effect is acute skin reaction, which can range from mild erythema to
      confluent moist desquamation. Almost all patients receiving radiation therapy have a risk of
      developing radiation dermatitis (Trueman, 2012).

      When not managed appropriately, radiation dermatitis can affect patients' physical
      functioning and quality of life. It can also cause pain and discomfort and may result in
      infection and/or interruption of treatment (Feight et al., 2011). An important role for
      oncology nurses is in educating, assessing, and monitoring patients for radiation dermatitis.
      Many nursing interventions are in use, including those based on tradition, physician
      preference, and published reports. In routine practice, most interventions for radiation
      dermatitis are institution-specific and not reliably evidence based.

      At the investigators institution, Hydrophor (Aquaphor), an ointment containing petrolatum,
      mineral oil, ceresin, and lanolin alcohol is the current standard of care for preventing and
      treating radiation dermatitis. Some women under treatment for breast cancer report disliking
      the smell and/or texture of Hydrophor. Rarely reported side effects have included allergic
      reactions, burning, stinging, and/or redness. Honey is an ancient remedy that has most
      recently shown promising results in treating burns, oral infections, and promoting surgical
      wound healing and palliation. The topical application of honey has been reported to be
      advantageous in radiation mucositis (Biswal et al., 2003). In a continuing effort to identify
      those treatment options that can make the investigators patients more comfortable and reduce
      complications from radiation dermatitis, the investigators are interested in conducting a
      small pilot study comparing the effectiveness of a honey-based treatment (Medihoney) with
      that of the investigators current standard of care (Hydrophor).

    <description>Group A (current standard of care): Patients will be instructed (by nurses and with printed study materials) to apply a thin layer of the Hydrophor daily, starting at the onset of radiation therapy (RT) and continuing until 2 weeks after the final RT session or until the RT site is healed (whichever is first). Hydrophor application should include the entire treatment area, including the axillae and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. To avoid possible build-up effects, patients should not apply the Hydrophor within 4 hours of receiving RT. Patients should wash the application area daily with perfume-free soap and tap water. Patients will be asked to refrain from using other topical agents in the irradiated area.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Whom Received Medihoney Treatment and Were Analyzed Weekly for Skin Changes While Undergoing Radiation Therapy</title>
        <description>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of Medihoney and Hydrophor on radiation dermatitis reactions in a group of women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer. It is hoped that the outcome of this pilot study will provide evidence supporting the use of Medihoney in preventing and treating radiation dermatitis as well as sufficient preliminary data to expand this study to larger, federally funded research (R01) looking at the beneficial aspects of Medihoney across a spectrum of radiation dermatitis and mucositis in several disease settings.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Participants were analyzed for skin changes (during weekly visits with physician) during radiation treatment. Only 15 participants from each group completed the study, 1 subject from Group A and 3 subjects from Group B withdrew.</population>

          <group group_id="O1">
            <title>Hydrophor (Group A)</title>
            <description>Group A (current standard of care): Patients will be instructed (by nurses and with printed study materials) to apply a thin layer of the Hydrophor daily, starting at the onset of radiation therapy (RT) and continuing until 2 weeks after the final RT session or until the RT site is healed (whichever is first). Hydrophor application should include the entire treatment area, including the axillae and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. To avoid possible build-up effects, patients should not apply the Hydrophor within 4 hours of receiving RT. Patients should wash the application area daily with perfume-free soap and tap water. Patients will be asked to refrain from using other topical agents in the irradiated area.
Hydrophor (Group A): •Rehydrates dry, chapped or chafed skin
•May be used alone as a skin lubricant or protectant</description>

            <title>MediHoney (Group B)</title>
            <description>Group B (study target): Patients will be instructed (by nurses and with printed study materials) to apply a thin layer of the Medihoney daily, starting at the onset of RT and continuing until 2 weeks after the final RT session or until the RT site is healed (whichever is first). Medihoney application should include the entire treatment area, including the axillae and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. To avoid possible build-up effects, patients should not apply the Medihoney within 4 hours of receiving RT. Patients should wash the application area daily with perfume-free soap and tap water. Patients will be asked to refrain from using other topical agents in the irradiated area.
MediHoney (Group B): It helps the body’s natural healing processes in three key ways which have been shown to have healing benefits:
Maintain a balanced environment for healing.
Aids in reducing dermatitis.
Reduce affected area pH.2-3</description>
