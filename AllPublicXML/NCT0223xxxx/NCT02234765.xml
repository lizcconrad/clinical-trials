  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is characterized by the manifestation of excessive
      sleepiness secondary to repeated obstruction of the upper airway during sleep and
      cognitive-behavioral, respiratory, cardiac, metabolic or inflammatory disorders.
      Epidemiological studies in our country have shown that OSA is a highly prevalent disease in
      the general population, affecting 2-4% of the adult population. The most important clinical
      manifestations of OSAS is a deterioration in the quality of life and an increase in
      cardiovascular disease. OSA is also associated with traffic accidents. Therefore, and
      considering the medical complications of OSA, as well as the sociolaboral impact and its
      negative impact on quality of life and survival; is stated that this disease is a public
      health problem that requires the physician to identify patients eligible to treatment.
      Moreover, it has been shown that undiagnosed patients, duplicate the consumption of health
      resources, comparing when the diagnosis and treatment has been established. Finally, we have
      a highly effective treatment using positive pressure in the upper airway (CPAP) that has been
      shown to be effective and cost-effective. The current situation in which all patients
      diagnosed with OSA and receiving different treatments are monitored and controlled by the
      Sleep Units (SU) is an oversized medicine specialist at the expense of primary care (PC). Our
      working hypothesis is: &quot;By the coordination of actions at various levels including
      interactive training equipment AP, use the bilateral (SU-AP) of electronic medical records
      and the use of new technologies can be achieved in AP satisfactory management of the
      diagnostic and therapeutic process of patients with suspected OSA. Patients assisted in both
      areas have a level of clinical response, satisfaction, compliance and avoidance of
      complications, similar to that obtained with monitoring by SU. In addition, management by AP
      will be more cost-effective than in the SU.&quot;
