  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one the most commonly encountered conditions in a daily
      outpatient Hepatology clinic. Secondly our country is the diabetic capital of the world and
      so the incidence of NAFLD (Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) is expected to rise in the
      future. It is a spectrum of hepatic pathology, ranging from simple steatosis,
      steatohepatitis, to cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more advanced form of
      disease where steatosis is accompanied by hepatocyte injury as well as infiltration of
      inflammatory cells. Approximately 10-20% of patients with NASH may progress to cirrhosis.
      NASH is felt to be a major etiology of cryptogenic cirrhosis. Around 6230 human studies out
      of which 49 RCTs have been done till date to define the appropriate treatment of nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis. However, still a controversy and no recommended treatment available till
      date. Recently published PIVENS trial has shown that Vitamin E has proven benefit in NASH.
      Other trials have also shown that pentoxiphylline has shown benefit in the form of
      histological improvement and biochemical improvement in the form of liver enzymes. Role of
      SAMe has been studied in alcoholic liver disease and showed to improve in both biochemical
      and histological features. However the usefulness of SAMe in NAFLD is not known till now.
      Hence this study has been designed.
