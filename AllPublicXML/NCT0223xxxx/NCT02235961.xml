    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of the trial is to
      investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the
      body) for single doses of NNC9204-0530 alone and in combination with liraglutide in
      overweight to obese but otherwise healthy male subjects.
