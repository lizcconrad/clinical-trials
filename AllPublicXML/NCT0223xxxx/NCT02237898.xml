    <textblock>
      Through a smartphone platform, financial incentives for smoking abstinence in postpartum
      women can be delivered remotely, thus minimizing the need for participants to come to the
      office to receive traditional contingency management.

      The specific aims of the proposal are:

        1. To develop through a 15-month pilot study, a novel smartphone-based system, Momba
           Smoking, that can be used in further relapse prevention trials for postpartum smokers.

        2. To determine, through a pilot randomized controlled trial, the potential feasibility,
           acceptability, and methodological parameters that are necessary to design a subsequent,
           appropriately powered, randomized controlled trial of the Momba Smoking smartphone-based
           system.

        3. To advance discovery and understanding on the use of technology to translate smoking
           cessation interventions from clinical to community settings through the training of the
           next generation of scientists.

    <description>Primary Outcome - Acceptability of the delivery of financial incentives for smoking abstinence in postpartum women through a smartphone platform as compared to traditional, in office contingency management. Acceptability of the smartphone application to low-income, pregnant women defined by the percentage of women who would recommend the site to a friend.</description>

    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Outcome - Feasibility of the delivery of financial incentives for smoking abstinence in postpartum women through a smartphone platform as compared to traditional, in office contingency management. Feasibility: participation rate of &gt; 60% for eligible women between screening and enrollment; retention set at 80% for the Momba Smoking group; challenge completion and in-office visit attendance to assess compliance, using mixed-effects regression models for group comparisons. Also, to confirm the sensor, correlation coefficients between the piCO+™ and the Sensordrone™ specific to expired CO measurement and verified through urine cotinine levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short term abstinence from smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome - Short term abstinence from smoking. Immediate smoking prevalence as determined by # of negative breath tests and self-reports; the pilot will also utilize urine tests to measure negative cotinine levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Long term abstinence from smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome - Long term abstinence from smoking equals 7-day point prevalence determined through # of negative breath tests and self-reports based on the Timeline Follow Back.</description>
