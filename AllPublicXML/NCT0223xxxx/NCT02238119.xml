        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients had to sign an informed consent consistent with International Conference
             on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines prior to participation in
             the trial, which included medication washout and restrictions

          2. All patients had to have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had
             to meet the following spirometric criteria:

               -  Patients had to have relatively stable moderate to severe airway obstruction with
                  an FEV1 ≤ 60% of predicted normal and FEV1 ≤ 70% of FVC (Visits 1 and 2)

          3. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older

          4. Patients had to be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of more than 10
             pack-years (Patients who had never smoked cigarettes had to be excluded)

          5. Patients had to be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and
             had to be able to maintain records (Patient Daily Diary Record) during the study
             period as required in the protocol

          6. Patients had to be able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the
             HandiHaler® device, the Blue Inhaler device and from a metered dose inhaler (MDI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD had to be excluded. A significant
             disease was defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study

          2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry, or
             urinalysis if the abnormality defined a disease listed as an exclusion criterion

          3. All patients with an serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) &gt; 80 IU/L, serum
             glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &gt; 80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt; 17 μmol/L or creatinine
             &gt; 110 μmol/L (males) / 95 μmol/L (females) had to be excluded regardless of clinical
             condition

          4. Patients with a recent history (i.e., six months or less) of myocardial infarction

          5. Patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy or who had been
             hospitalised for heart failure within the past three years

             basal cell carcinoma were allowed

          7. Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction.

             Patients with prostatic hypertrophy controlled by medication were allowed

          8. Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma

          9. Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or who had a total blood
             eosinophil count ≥600 mm3

         10. Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of

             history of thoracotomy for other reasons had to be evaluated as per exclusion
             criterion No. 1

         14. Patients who completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior to
             the Screening Visit (Visit 1)

         15. Patients who regularly used daytime oxygen therapy

         16. Patients who had taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives
             (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Visit (Visit 1)

         17. Patients who were treated with beta-blocker medications. Note: cardioselective beta
             blocker eye medications (e.g. Betoptic®) for treatment of non-narrow angle glaucoma
             were allowed

         18. Patients who were treated with oral beta-adrenergics

         19. Patients who were treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium

         20. Patients who were treated with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists),
             antileukotrienes or leukotriene receptor antagonists for asthma or excluded allergic
             conditions. See exclusion criterion No. 9

         21. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six
             weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone
             per day or 20 mg every other day

         22. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, beta-adrenergics,
             lactose or any other components of the inhalation capsule delivery systems

         23. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception for the previous 3 months (i.e. oral contraceptives,
             intrauterine devices, diaphragm or subdermal implants e.g., Norplant®)

         24. Patients with previous participation (receipt of randomised treatment) in this study
