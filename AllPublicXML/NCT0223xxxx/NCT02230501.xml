  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Formerly, the investigators demonstrated in an uncontrolled proof-of principle study (NCT
      01680926) that protein-rich meal replacement (PRMR) was successful in reducing daily insulin
      demand, HbA1c and weight in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients injecting &gt;100 IE
      insulin/day. The aim of the present study was to investigate in a randomized-controlled trial
      if PRMR is also effective in T2DM patients treated with oral antidiabetic medication or
      insulin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients had been randomized into two groups. During the 1st
      week the intervention group with stringent diet regime replaced 3 main meals by 50 g PRMR
      (Almased-Vitalkost, Almased Wellness GmbH, Bienenbüttel, Germany) each (=1100 kcal/day). In
      2nd-4th week 2 meals were replaced and a protein-rich lunch was allowed. In 5th-12th week
      only dinner was replaced. The control group with moderate diet regime replaced breakfast and
      dinner for 4 weeks and then only dinner during the next 8 weeks. Clinical parameters were
      determined at the study center at baseline, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Primary endpoint was
      reduction of HbA1c, secondary endpoints reduction of weight and antidiabetic medication.
