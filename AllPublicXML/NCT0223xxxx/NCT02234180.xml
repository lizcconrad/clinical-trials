  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well regorafenib works in treating patients with
      cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction that has spread from where it started to
      nearby tissue or lymph nodes and have completed chemoradiation therapy and surgery.
      Regorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with resected esophageal and
      gastroesophageal (GE) junction adenocarcinoma treated with regorafenib vs. placebo in the
      adjuvant setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the safety profile of adjuvant regorafenib vs. placebo in patients with locally
      advanced resectable esophageal and GE junction adenocarcinoma.

      II. To compare the overall survival (OS) for patients with resected esophageal and GE
      junction adenocarcinoma treated with regorafenib vs. placebo in the adjuvant setting.

      III. To compare the DFS in those patients that receive at least 1 cycle of therapy.

      IV. To collect tumor samples for future genomic analysis to explore the biology of locally
      advanced esophageal and GE junction adenocarcinoma.

      V. DFS will be compared between the arms from the time of surgery as well.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Within 6-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) on days 1-21.

      ARM II: Within 6-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-21.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      every 6 months for up to 5 years.

    <description>The distribution of DFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. DFS will be compared between the 2 treatment arms using the log-rank test. DFS will also be compared between the arms from the time of surgery as well. This analysis will be done in two ways. First, the DFS will be compared based on all eligible randomized patients that at least started treatment and second, DFS will be compared in only those patients that receive at least 1 course of therapy.</description>

    <description>The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine adverse event patterns. The overall adverse event rates for grade 3 or higher adverse events, will be compared using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Adverse events will be assessed individually and will also compared between the 2 arms.</description>
