  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-interventional, prospective, observational study is to assess the
      effectiveness and tolerability of RoActemra (tocilizumab) used as a first-line biologic
      treatment in participants with moderate to severe active RA who are inadequate responders to
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or participants who are intolerant to DMARDs,
      in a routine clinical practice setting in Poland. The length of the entire study will be 24
      months.
