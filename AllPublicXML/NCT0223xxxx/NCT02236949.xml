    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of short refresher
      sessions. &quot;Pain Practice Change Boosters&quot; given at regular intervals to sustain improved pain
      process (assessment and management) and clinical outcomes (pain intensity) achieved during a
      15 month knowledge translation intervention, Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality
      (EPIQ), in 8 children's hospitals in Canada; and to determine the factors that affect that
      sustainability. The CIHR Team in Children's Pain (2006-2011) evaluated the effectiveness of
      the EPIQ intervention in 32 hospital units (4 units at each hospital site). 16 hospital units
      were allocated to the intervention group and 16 units continued with standard care. The
      current study focuses on the 16 hospital units that implemented the EPIQ intervention only.

      This is an 8 hospital repeated measures Randomized Controlled Trial design using a centrally
      controlled cluster random allocation of units with stratification by hospital. The sample
      consisted of the 16 hospital units that implemented the EPIQ intervention in the CIHR Team in
      Children's Pain study. Randomization was restricted so there was one intervention unit and
      one standard care unit at each site. Outcomes were measured at 3 time points:12 months after
      the completion of the EPIQ intervention: Baseline (Time 1); 12 months following the
      implementation of the Booster intervention (Time 2); and 36 months following the
      implementation of the Booster intervention (Time 3), including the frequency and proportion
      of children receiving pain assessment and management strategies, children's pain intensity
      during painful procedures, and health care professionals' perceptions of the context of
      sustainability.

    <description>Pain intensity was measured through patient observation during routinely scheduled painful procedures at 3 time points, using one of four validated, age-appropriate measures: Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) (Stevens et al., 1996) Faces-Legs-Arms-Cry-Consolability Scale (FLACC) (Merkel et al., 1997), Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) (Hicks et al., 2001), and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (Jensen et a., 1986).

    <description>Pain Practice Change Booster Intervention: 12 months after the EPIQ intervention, and every 4 months for 2 years, a 30-60 minute standardized booster session was delivered to a small group of champions in each hospital unit randomized to the intervention group. Two co-facilitators familiar with the EPIQ intervention conducted all booster sessions via teleconference. Booster sessions included reviewing the effectiveness knowledge translation strategies champions implemented over the past four months to sustain and improve targeted pain practices; determining the sustainability of the pain practice changes, developing a commitment to change plan of action for the next four months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Hospitals met the following inclusion criteria in at least four patient care units:

          -  distinct geographic location and administrative structure;

          -  minimum of 15 beds per unit;

          -  care for children exposed to painful procedures for diagnostic or therapeutic
             purposes; and

          -  implementation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to manage
             pain.

        The 16 participating hospital units had implemented the EPIQ intervention in the CIHR Team
        in Children's Pain study. Patients in the participating hospital units were eligible to be
        included in the determination of the pain practice and clinical outcomes if they:

          -  were between 32 weeks gestational age at birth and 18 years;

          -  received skin breaking procedures; and

          -  were admitted to the unit for &gt;24 hours.

        Surveys used to determine factors influencing sustainability were administered to health
        care professionals in all participating units, who had at least 1 year of professional
        experience, had worked on the unit for at least 6 months, and spoke English or French.
