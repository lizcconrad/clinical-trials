      The main purpose of this study is to assess and compare the hydration status of medical and
      nursing staff and to investigate the relationship between the hydration status, cognitive
      function and serum cortisol (marker of stress).

      We hypothesise that a significant proportion of doctors and nurses will be dehydrated at the
      end of their working day. Some, as in other occupations, may be dehydrated at the start of
      their working day. This is likely to be associated with impairment in cognitive performance
      at the end of the working day compared to the beginning and expected to be more pronounced
      after a night shift. There may be less noticeable difference amongst nursing staff given the
      protected break time. Dehydration and associated impairment in cognition is of important
      clinical value as it can impact patient care. participants will be involved in the study for
      two shifts (one day and one night), aiming at 15 medical and 15 surgical nurses as well as 15
      medical (total 15 day and 15 night shifts from each group) and surgical doctors (total 15 day
      and 15 night shifts from each group). Those that do not work both day and night shifts will
      participate for only one shift and a new participant will be recruited until target number of
      shifts is achieved.

      End points

        1. To assess the hydration status of hospital staff nurses and doctors oncall at work by
           measuring the following:

             1. Urine and serum osmolality

             2. Urine mass produced during the shift

             3. Kidney function (U &amp;Es)

             4. Bioimpedance measures

                2- To assess the effect of hydration on status of cognitive function and subjective
                feelings.

                3- To assess the association between hydration status on stress hormone (cortisol)
                levels.

                Inclusion criteria All medical and nursing staff working on acute medical and
                surgical admissions at the Queens Medical Centre Nottingham.

                Exclusion Criteria:

                Pregnancy Pre-existing kidney disease Patients on diuretics Unwell in the past 6
                week with acute illness that warrants hospital admission or prescribed medication.

    <description>Using urine osmolality as a marker of hydration we aim to assess the prevalence of dehydration in health care professionals before and after day and night shifts.

    <description>The impact of hydration status on serum cortisol concentrations as a surrogate marker of stress will be assessed before and after day and night shifts. with day and night shifts assessed separately given the diurnal variations in cortisol.</description>
