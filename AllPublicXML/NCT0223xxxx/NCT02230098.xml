  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death in Denmark, and ischemic heart
      disease accounts for the bulk of it. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether a
      mechanical method of remote ischemic conditioning in the form of short-term obstruction of
      the blood supply to the arm, can improve the heart's blood supply in patients with ischemic
      heart disease. This will be attempted through experiments on patients with ischemic heart
      disease and experimental animal studies with simulated cardiovascular disease.

      This study will help to clarify whether remote ischemic preconditioning can be used to treat
      patients with ischemic heart disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients referred for routine myocardial Rb82-PET scanning at Dept. of Nuclear
             Medicine &amp; PET center, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Denmark.

          -  Able to understand the written patient information and to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not undergoing Rb82-PET with adenosine stress test.

          -  Strenuous exercise (running, bicycling, fitness), intake of beta-blockers or alcohol
             intake on the day before and on the day of investigation.
