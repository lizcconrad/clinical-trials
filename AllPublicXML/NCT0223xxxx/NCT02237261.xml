      The purpose of this study is to improve efficacy of treatment for patients with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy followed by
      autologous stem cell transplantation by Bendamustin, Bortezomib (Velcade), and Prednisone.

      1. Objectives Primary

           -Therapeutic efficacy of BPV regimen for multiple myeloma as evidenced by the overall
           response defined as partial response (PR) or better

           Secondary

             -  to assess overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)

             -  to determine response duration

             -  to investigate improvements of renal function

             -  to evaluate safety and toxicity (with respect to adverse events of CTCAE grade ≧3
                and SAEs)

             -  to analyze the efficacy for genetically defined subgroups of myeloma patients based
                on iFISH and gene-expression profiling

        2. Investigational Medicinal Products Bortezomib Bendamustine both in combination with
           Prednisone
