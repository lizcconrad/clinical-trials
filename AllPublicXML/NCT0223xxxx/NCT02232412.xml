  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients are frequently transfused with red blood cell (RBC) units with the
      predominant intention to increase arterial oxygen content and thus oxygen delivery to the
      tissues.

      To date, RBC transfusions have been proven effective in patients with profound anaemia or
      circulatory shock. However, the impact of the storage process and the so-called storage
      lesion on oxygen-carrying properties and, hence, the efficacy of RBC transfusion regarding
      tissue oxygenation are much debated at present. Alterations of RBC physiology have been
      comprehensively described ex vivo. Reduced deformability, increased adhesiveness and
      aggregability of stored RBC impair their rheological properties; anaerobic cellular
      metabolism with reduced contents of 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
      increases oxygen affinity and impairs oxygen release to the tissues.

      This study aims to monitor the effect RBC transfusion has on the regional cerebral oxygen
      saturation (rSO2) of critically ill patients. rSO2 will be measured indirectly, using near
      infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) . Patients will be monitored once it looms that they might
      require RBC transfusion. The monitoring is continued for the time of transfusion and the
      hours afterwards.

    <description>Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) will be measured before, during and after RBC transfusion. As the decision to transfuse is multifactorial and the condition of critically ill patients often instable, time frames before, during and after transfusion may vary.</description>
