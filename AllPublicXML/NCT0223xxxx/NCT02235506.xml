  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators compared continuous epidural infusion with combined continuous femoral and
      single-shot sciatic nerve blocks. The primary outcome was the incidence of side effects, and
      secondary outcomes were pain relief, motor blockade,morphine consumption, and rehabilitation
      indices.

      The parcicipants were randomly assingned to epidural infusion group and femoral sciatic
      block. In epidural infusion group, a lumbar epidural catheter was placed at the L3-4 level
      using loss-ofresistance procedure. ropivacaine 0.2% and fentayl 2mcg/ml were infused at a
      rate of 5ml/hr from the end of operation. In femoral sciatic group, the femoral and sciatic
      nerve are located using ultrasound and 0.2% ropivacain is injected. A catheter is inserted to
      femoral nerve. From the end of operation, 0.2% ropivacaine was infused through the femoral
      catheter at a rate of 5ml/hr. The incidence of side effects is measured.

    <description>Side effects: The patients were asked to their experience of dizziness, sedation, nausea/vomiting (PONV), and pruritus. Urinary retention: bladder volume was measured by ultrasonography and if the volume was more than 400 mL and if the patient was unable to void spontaneously, single catheterization was performed.</description>
