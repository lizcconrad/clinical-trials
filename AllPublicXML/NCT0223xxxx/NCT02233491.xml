  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common medical complication after kidney
      transplantation, related to both transplant-specific and generic risk factors, and is
      associated with major complications after transplantation. The current PTDM Consensus Report
      recommends lifestyle modification (e.g. weight loss, dietary modification, structured
      exercise program) as the first line therapy of choice. No recommendation is given with
      regards to how such guidance should be delivered. In addition no clinical evidence exists to
      suggest lifestyle modification provides any sustained glycaemic benefits for kidney allograft
      recipients.

      While in the general population the benefits of lifestyle modification have been well
      documented with regards to attenuation of both pre-diabetic and diabetic states in the
      context of randomised controlled trials, no similar level of evidence exists post kidney
      transplantation.

      This prospective randomised controlled trial is designed to compare active versus passive
      lifestyle intervention post kidney transplantation, to determine changes in cardio-metabolic
      risk profile over the course of the intervention.

    <description>This group will be counselled in clinic by clinicians about the risks of glucose intolerance and will receive leaflets outlining lifestyle modification advice. The leaflets include advice on healthy eating, exercise and the importance of weight loss. However there will be no dietician referral, psychosocial intervention or focused exercise and weight loss monitoring programme. Follow up will be at routine clinic visits only where lifestyle modification advice will be reinforced as per usual clinical practise.</description>

    <description>This group will receive active lifestyle modification intervention and will consist of dietician referral, graded exercise programme and weight loss advice. The dietician will be supported by Clinical Psychology services and our collaboration with a recognised expert in behavioural change therapy. The dietician will be trained with motivational interviewing skills and psychological tools will be utilised to support the active lifestyle intervention.</description>
