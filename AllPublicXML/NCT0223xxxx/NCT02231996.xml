    <textblock>
      CGD is a rare inherited primary immunodeficiency which is caused by the defect in one of the
      subunits of NADPH oxidase complex.We tend to collect and analyze Chinese CGD patients who are
      diagnosed in hospitals affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine,
      including clinical feature, laboratory data and genetic information. we aim to find out
      clinical, distribution, genetic characteristic of CGD in Chinese population, etc., thus
      further improving the level of diagnosis and treatment for CGD.
