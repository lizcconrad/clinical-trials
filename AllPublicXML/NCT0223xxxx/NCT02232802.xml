  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, randomised, single-dose, 2-way crossover study to determine the
      comparative bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium from the Chemi Enoxaparin s.c. (80 mg/0.8mL)
      with that from the reference IMP, Clexane® s.c. (80 mg/0.8mL), following single dose
      administration in healthy male and female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will receive each treatment over two separate treatment periods under fasting
      conditions. Each dosing day for male subjects will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 7 days. The study will comprise of a pre-study screen (within 14 days of the first
      dose), followed by 2 Treatment Periods (1 and 2). During each treatment period, subjects will
      reside at Simbec from the evening before dosing (Day 1), until at least 36 h post dose
      (evening of Day 2). On admission (Day -1), subjects will provide a urine sample for a drugs
      of abuse screen; this sample will also be tested to confirm a negative pregnancy result in
      female volunteers.

      A single dose of the randomised treatment will be given on the morning of Day 1 following an
      overnight fast and blood PK/PD samples collected from pre-dose up to 36 h post dose (14
      samples). Safety will also be evaluated at specified times throughout the study.

      The post study visit will be conducted on Day 2 (36 h post-dose) of Treatment Period 2.
