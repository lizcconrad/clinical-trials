  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop a novel intervention that targets the system
      (Collaborative Care), PCP (computerized decision support for opioid therapy) and veteran
      (CM-delivered MI) to reduce problematic prescription opioid use and encourage non-opioid pain
      management alternatives.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop and test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary
      efficacy of a Collaborative Care intervention in which one of two Care Managers delivering
      both interventions will assist primary care providers (PCPs) by using Motivational
      Interviewing to communicate computer-based ATHENA-OT (opioid therapy) decision support
      guidelines to veterans with chronic pain. Specifically, after honing the intervention, the
      investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of Collaborative
      Care/Motivational Interviewing in 100 veterans (ages 18 and older) with chronic pain in
      primary care who are prescribed opioid pain medications and exhibit at least one &quot;high-risk&quot;
      opioid use behavior (e.g. obtaining early opioid refills, etc.). Using ATHENA-OT decision
      support, PCPs will make guideline-concordant recommendations to all enrolled study patients
      and initiate a Pain Care Plan. Veterans randomized to Collaborative Care, will have one MI
      session with their assigned study Care Manager followed by 3 Care Manager-delivered telephone
      MI/monitoring sessions; patients randomized to the Attention Control arm will have one brief
      session with their assigned Care Manager, followed by 3 Care Manager-delivered neutral
      telephone sessions

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of augmenting ATHENA-OT decision support with a Collaborative Care intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>PCPs and the CM in the Collaborative Care arm will report greater self-efficacy in communicating ATHENA-OT pain management recommendations and in developing a Pain Care Plan with chronic pain patients
The CM will conduct MI communication with high fidelity.
Veterans in the Collaborative Care arm will report greater satisfaction with pain-related care.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of ATHENA-OT decision support plus Collaborative Care (CC) to improve prescription opioid safety and adherence to non-opioid pain management alternatives among primary care patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Compared to ATHENA-OT plus Attention Control:
H2.a. Veterans randomized to Collaborative Care (CC) will be more likely to achieve a decrease in opioid risk behavior that is sustained during an 8-week post-intervention period of no contact.
H2.b. Veterans randomized to CC are more likely to initiate and sustain â‰¥ 1 non-opioid strategies.
H2.c. Veterans randomized to CC are more likely to report sustained improvements in pain disability.
H2.d. Substance use disorders and treatment will moderate CC efficacy; Care Manager MI-consistent communication in the CC arm will correlate with reduced opioid risk behavior in veterans.</description>

    <description>The neutral 10-15 minute visit with the Care Manager will consist of a brief review of ATHENA-OT safety education and the patient's Pain Care Plan. The CM will answer patient questions, but will avoid using Motivational Interviewing communication. The Care Manager will review upcoming telephone check-in and assessment sessions.</description>
