    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that cancer patients on systemic anticancer therapy can measure
      a home blood count, temperature, record qualitative data and transfer the results
      electronically to the hospital clinical team.

      A low neutrophil blood cell count (neutropenia) can be a dose-limiting toxicity of systemic
      anti-cancer therapy (SACT) and can be life-threatening when complicated by sepsis. Neutrophil
      count is usually obtained by venepuncture by a health-care professional. The Minicare H-2000
      is a new device which facilitates home self-testing of blood count, temperature and symptoms.
      The four components are i) blood count recorder using a capillary sample obtained via
      finger-prick ii) Bluetooth linked thermometer iii) tele-hub collecting patient-reported
      outcomes and iv) secure communication through the 3G network.

      The investigators propose a single-centre, non-randomised feasibility study to test the
      process of patients on chemotherapy using the Minicare H-2000 to deliver self-tested blood
      count readings, temperature and qualitative data electronically to the hospital clinical
      team. The aim is to test training of patients to use a finger-prick method of obtaining blood
      count, patient ability to perform the test, retention of training, the ability of the
      Minicare H-2000 to facilitate the data transfer and to test the secondary care interface.
      This study will provide preliminary data on the potential of Minicare H-2000 to prevent
      wasted hospital journeys when the blood count has not recovered sufficiently for subsequent
      SACT cycles. The investigators intend to obtain informed consent to recruit between 30 to 80
      patients to this study which will be performed in addition to current local standard of care.

      This study enables identification of suboptimal areas of the process prior to investigating
      the application of the minicare H-2000 within oncology to improve the clinical patient
      pathway. The investigators ongoing intentions are to trial the use of the Minicare H-2000 to
      reduce frequency and severity of neutropenic complications, prevent wasted hospital journeys
      and hospital resources, reduce non-elective hospital admissions and personalise delivery of
      SACT.
