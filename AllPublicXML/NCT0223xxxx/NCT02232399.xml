    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the ability of Levosimendan to reduce the postoperative
      acute kidney injury in pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease
      (CHDs). Young children, between the age of 1 to 12 months, with congenital heart disease in
      need of elective heart surgery will be included in this study.

      The trial will contain two study groups, 35 patients in each. One group will receive
      Levosimendan and the second group will receive Milrinone as a heart muscle-strengthening
      agent during and after the operation. Milrinone is currently used as the drug of choice in
      many pediatric cardiac surgery centers. It remains to see if Levosimendan can exert a kidney
      protecting function in addition to its heart muscle-strengthening properties.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the preventive effect of Levosimendan
      on postoperative acute kidney injury in pediatric patients undergoing surgery for their CHDs.
      Creatinine levels postoperatively will be the primary endpoint. Creatinine, the common marker
      of kidney injury, will be measured daily.

      The treatment with Levosimendan or Milrinone will be started during the operation (after
      initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) and will last 24 hours. Blood samples will be obtained
      at six occasions perioperatively. Patients will be followed 4 days after termination of
      treatment (totally 5 days).

      The duration of study will be 30 days (24 hours treatment + 4 days follow up +
      30-days-mortality registration).

      Creatinine is the primary outcome in this study. Inflammatory biomarkers and other relevant
      biomarkers will comprise the secondary outcome variables.
