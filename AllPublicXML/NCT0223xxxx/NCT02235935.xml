  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes and is divided into non
      proliferative DR and proliferative DR. The damage is caused by either macular edema, macular
      ischemia that can be followed by vascular proliferation.

      Hyperbaric chamber treatment assists in increasing the amount of oxygen in the plasma and in
      the tissues and has been proven to be beneficial in treating different wounds in diabetic
      patients but its effect hasn't been tested in diabetic retinopathy yet.

      This study will recruit 40 diabetic patients who are scheduled for hyperbaric treatment due
      to different indications such as chronic wounds or radiation damages and who also have
      diabetic retinopathy. These patients will undergo opthalmic physical examination including
      fundus photography and OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography - optical IR retinal photography).
      Screening for these patients will be conducted at the Hyperbaric chamber at Assaf Harofe
      Medical Center for all diabetic patients prior to their first treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients between ages 18-90 with Diabetes type I or II and diabetic retinopathy who
             are scheduled for hyperbaric treatment for other indications than DR.

          2. Patients who signed an informed consent form and agree to undergo an ophthalmic
             physical examination, Fundus photography and OCT prior to hyperbaric treatment and oCT
             exam following every 10 treatments in hyperbaric chamber. Total number of hyperbaric
             treatments will be conducted according to the main indication for which they have been
             assigned this treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Carotid stenosis of more than 70%

          2. Anemia of &lt; 10mg/Dl

          3. Patients with chest X ray pathology which cannot be admitted to hyperbaric chamber
             treatment.

          4. Patients with claustrophobia or that cannot decompress properly.

          5. Patients with any malignant disease

          6. Patients with inability to sign informed consent

        Decompression treatment will last 90 minutes in 2 atmospheres pressure with 100% oxygen.
