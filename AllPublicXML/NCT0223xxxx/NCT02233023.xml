    <textblock>
      Study to assess and compare the safety of long term oral treatment for Parkinson's Disease
      with pramipexole versus bromocriptine or other dopamine agonists, by measuring
      cross-sectional the incidence of ophthalmologic disturbances, especially signs of retinal
      degeneration, in a matched pair design

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease

          -  Patients treated consecutively with either pramipexole or bromocriptine (or other
             dopamine agonists except ropinirole) for at least two and a half years (i.e. 30
             months). Interruptions of ongoing dopamine agonists treatment for less than one month
             per year duration are acceptable, however, interruptions within the last 6 months are
             not acceptable. Patients currently participating in ongoing open-label extension
             trials with pramipexole may be included if they meet the requirement of 30 month
             treatment

          -  Written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local
             legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have been treated less than two and a half years (i.e. 30 months) with
             their actual dopamine agonist (regardless of the duration of treatment with a previous
             dopamine agonist)

          -  Patient treated with ropinirole

          -  Patients with any of the following:

               -  Patients with a hereditary retinal disease and/or a family history of hereditary
                  retinal disease

               -  Patients with a history of drug-induced retinopathies

               -  Patients with a history of surgically or laser-treated diabetic retinopathy

          -  Patients with atypical parkinsonian syndromes due to drugs, metabolic disorders,
             encephalitis or degenerative diseases (e.g. progressive, supranuclear palsy,
             multisystem atrophy)

          -  Dementia or other disorders that could impair the signing of informed consent

          -  Patients who are participating in other drug studies or who receive other
             investigational drugs within 30 days prior to the first visit (patients currently
             participating in ongoing open-label extension trials with pramipexole may be included
             if they meet the requirement of 30 months treatment duration
