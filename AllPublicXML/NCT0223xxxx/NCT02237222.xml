  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this project are to evaluate the psychometric properties of the German versions
      of the two performance questionnaires 'Functional Mobility Scale' (FMS) and 'Gillette
      Functional Assessment Questionnaire - walking scale' (GFAQ) in children between 6-18 years
      with a neuromuscular diagnosis.

    <textblock>
      The German versions of the two questionnaires 'Functional Mobility Scale' (FMS) and 'Gillette
      Functional Assessment Questionnaire - walking scale' (GFAQ) are evaluated in terms of
      construct validity, inter- and intra-rater reliability as well as responsiveness in children
      with a neuromuscular diagnosis, who absolve an inpatient stay in the rehabilitation center of
      the University Chilren's Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of the rehabilitation stay, an expected average of 12 weeks, with measurements at admission and discharge.</time_frame>

    <measure>Global Rating Scale (GRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of the rehabilitation stay, an expected average of 12 weeks, with only one measurement at discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>A global rating on the perceived change of the child's functional mobility over the rehabilitation period and whether this change is perceived as meaningful or not; on a 5-point Likert scale, scored by the parents and the physiotherapist.</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of the rehabilitation stay, an expected average of 12 weeks, with measurements at admission and discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>The WeeFIM-Item Locomotion (Walking) is scored by the primary nurse.</description>

    <measure>10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of the rehabilitation stay, an expected average of 12 weeks, with only one measurement at discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of the construct validity of the FMS and the GFAQ, the 10MWT comfortable speed as well as maximal speed will be performed shortly before discharge on a 14-meter long track with standardized instructions.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of the rehabilitation stay, an expected average of 12 weeks, with only one measurement at discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of the construct validity of the FMS and the GFAQ, the 6MinWT is performed shortly before discharge on a 30-meter long track with standardized instructions.</description>
