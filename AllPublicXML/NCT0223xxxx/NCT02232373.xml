    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is explore the issues that relate to testing a particular dietary
      treatment, the low FODMAP diet, in a randomised trial using an appropriate control diet with
      which to compare it. In this trial the investigators will look at its effect on symptoms of
      people with persistent disturbance in their bowel pattern 3 months after an intestinal
      infection with Campylobacter.

      The investigators will also look at the changes in gut bacteria that occur with the diet.

             &quot;have your bowels returned to normal since your Campylobacter infection?&quot;

          -  Will consent to use of data and samples acquired for CERAMIC in the analysis of CEDRIC

        As for CERAMIC study (so already confirmed)

          -  Pregnancy declared by the candidate

          -  History declared by the candidate of pre-existing gastrointestinal disorder, including
             but not limited to: Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Coeliac Disease; Pancreatitis;
             Gallstone disease (biliary colic, cholecystitis); Diverticulitis; Cancer of the
             gastrointestinal tract; Irritable Bowel Syndrome

          -  Reported history of previous resection of any part of the gastrointestinal tract other
             than appendix or gallbladder

          -  Intestinal stoma

          -  Habitual use of opiate analgesics likely to alter bowel function e.g. morphine

          -  Use of antibiotics in the preceding four weeks other than for treatment of index
             infection. Any condition where the candidate is likely to require a course of
             antibiotics in the next 3 months e.g. severe chronic respiratory disease, recurrent
             urinary tract infection, lower limb ulceration

          -  Inability to complete the symptom questionnaires e.g. cognitive dysfunction, limiting
             memory and understanding

          -  Anyone who in the opinion of the investigator is unlikely to be able to comply with
             the protocol e.g. cognitive dysfunction, chaotic lifestyle related to substance abuse

        Addition criteria for CEDRIC study:

          -  Use of antibiotics or prescribed probiotics during the CERAMIC study

          -  Failure to provide research stool samples during CERAMIC study

          -  Dietary practice not compatible with safe implementation of the trial diet
             e.g.veganism

          -  Medical reasons for pre-existing controlled diet that cannot be safely randomised e.g.
             end-stage kidney disease, diabetes
