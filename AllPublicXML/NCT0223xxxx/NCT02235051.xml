  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies how well an exercise intervention works in preventing
      breast cancer from coming back in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Regular exercise
      may be able to train the body to repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) more efficiently and to
      respond to inflammation more proficiently, helping to prevent primary and recurrent breast
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that regular exercise increases DNA repair capacity.

      II. To test the hypothesis that regular exercise reduces inflammatory response.

      III. To test the hypothesis that regular exercise modulates telomerase activity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess adherence to the study protocol.

      II. To examine differences in body composition before and after the exercise intervention.

      III. To examine differences in fitness before and after the exercise intervention.

      IV. To test the hypothesis that regular exercise increases quality of life in breast cancer
      survivors.

      V. To examine the safety of the exercise intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients participate in a supervised Curves exercise program three days a week for 16
      weeks. The circuit-style workout consists of 14 exercises constructed with pneumatic or
      hydraulic resistance that target opposing muscle groups in a concentric-only fashion. Each
      session at a Curves facility will include two complete circuits which correspond to
      exercising for approximately 30 minutes followed by a standardized stretching routine.

      ARM II: Patients do not participate in a formal exercise program for 16 weeks. Patients are
      then offered the Curves exercise intervention.

    <measure>Change in 60 minutes mean olive tail moments measured by the Comet assay</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Comet assay data will be analyzed according to methods by Wiklund et al. Log-transformed, mean Olive tail moments, assessing DNA damage, will be calculated and compared using a paired t-test. For the ex vivo analyses using a challenge assay, Log-transformed, mean Olive tail moments will be calculated before and after the introduction of the damaging agent at 0, 1 and 6 hours. Differences between the changes will be analyzed using the paired t-test. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for repeated measure will be performed and linear regression models will be fitted.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Paired t-tests will be used to compare pre-exercise cytokine concentrations in order to test whether the 16-week Curves exercise intervention decreased markers of inflammation. As secondary analysis linear regression models will be fitted.</description>

    <measure>Change in telomerase activity using the Trypan blue method and ImagedQuant</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Paired t-tests will be used to compare pre-exercise telomerase activity in order to test the 16-week Curves exercise intervention. As a second analysis regression models will be fitted. Potential confounding factors that may contribute to differences within the two groups of women (e.g. BMI, exercise intensity, etc.) will be investigated and included as appropriate. The impact of exercise intensity via CurvesSmart card will also be examined.</description>

    <measure>Change in the number of gamma-H2A histone, member X (H2AX) foci measured by the gamma-H2AX assay</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>First, gamma-H2AX foci will be counted, and compared using the paired t-test. Second, for the ex vivo analyses gamma-H2AX foci will be counted before and after the introduction of a damaging agent at 0, 1 and 6 hours. For each time point, a foci change will be obtained. Differences in the foci changes at baseline and 16-weeks will be analyzed using the paired t-test. MANOVA for repeated measures will be performed to allow for the assessment of overall multivariate and univariate results, and linear regression models will be fitted.</description>
