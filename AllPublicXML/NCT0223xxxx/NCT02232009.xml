    <textblock>
      This study investigates a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system designed by GEHC for
      imaging viable neonate and infant populations. This MR system has a smaller size and design
      features that may make it more feasible to locate the system in close proximity to care areas
      for neonates (birth - 1 month) and infants (less than 1 month to two years), such as clinical
      neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and other infant and neonatal care departments.

      This study investigates a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system designed by GEHC for
      imaging viable neonate and infant populations. This MR system has a smaller size and design
      features that may make it more feasible to locate the system in close proximity to care areas
      for neonates (birth - 1 month) and infants (&gt;1 month to two years), such as clinical neonatal
      intensive care units (NICUs) and other infant and neonatal care departments.

      This is a two-phase prospective clinical study evaluating the performance and safety of the
      investigational MRI device for neonates and infants, including:

        -  Phase 1 - Initial feasibility assessment and optimization study (Phase 1) which may
           include hardware and software modifications. These studies are guided by a series of MR
           scanning procedures defined in sequential Sponsor-provided MR Procedure Documents

        -  Phase 2 - Controlled image and data collection study based on Phase 1 results, in which
           optimized scan procedure(s) according to MR Procedure Document(s) will be provided at
           the start of Phase 2 scanning and a fixed hardware and integrated software configuration
           will be applied for all subjects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be included that are:

          1. Currently admitted for treatment or observation at the investigational site at the
             time of enrollment;

          2. In the weight range less than 5.0 kg (&lt;5.0 kg ) and more than 0.5 kg (&gt;0.5 kg );

          3. Viable neonates (birth to 1 month of age) or infants (&gt;1 month to two years of age);

          4. Able to safely undergo an MRI scan, as determined by the site's co-investigator
             neonatologist or medically qualified delegate;

          5. Have parent(s), guardian(s), or legally authorized representative(s) willing and able
             to provide written informed consent for the subject's participation;

          6. Are of appropriate size and shape to fit into the bore of the magnet, inclusive of all
             monitoring equipment, if any, necessary for the subject's routine clinical care:

               1. Maximum width (shoulder-to-shoulder measurement) less than eighteen (18 cm).

               2. Maximum length (head-to-foot measurement) less than sixty (60) cm. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded that:

               1. Have parent(s), guardian(s), or legally authorized representative(s) that require
                  that they accompany the subject into the MR environment that have
                  contraindications to the MR environment or would otherwise be put at undue risk
                  or discomfort, as determined by the investigators;

               2. Require any non-removable medical devices that are not compatible with MR
                  scanning (labeled as MR Unsafe, MR condition for which the scanning conditions
                  are not met, or no MR safety labeling) that may pose hazards in the MR scanning
                  or MR environment, in the opinion of the neonatologist co-investigator or
                  medically qualified delegate;
