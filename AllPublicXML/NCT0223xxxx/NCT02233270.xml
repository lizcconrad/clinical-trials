  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When compared to existing analyses: manometry, Smart Pill and lactulose breath testing,
      external Acoustic Esophago-Gastro-Intestinal Surveillance (AEGIS) may identify unique audible
      patterns characteristic of features of gastroinestinal (GI) motility, gastric and small bowel
      contractions and emptying and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This research
      study is designed to test the capabilities of AbStats/AEGIS to identify and associate
      symptoms and traditional diagnostics with sound readings and correlate this data with
      treatment outcomes and successes in standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In partnership with Dr. William Kaiser and the UCLA Wireless Health Institute, our research
      groups are developing and validating the diagnostic capabilities of device that conducts
      AEGIS. A belt (AbStats) fits externally around the abdomen and is embedded with acoustic
      sensors, similar to &quot;electronic stethoscopes.&quot; The investigational software is designed to
      continuously, safely, and comfortably monitor acoustic signals emanating from the esophagus,
      stomach, and intestines, and stores the data in a HIPAA compliant hard drive. Through the
      study of associating these readings with current diagnostics and treatments we anticipate
      that the AEGIS device will eventually provide clinically interpretable information that is
      immediately actionable. In this study, the Abstats sensor will track signals in tandem with
      current techniques and standard of care treatments based on those diagnostics. AEGIS analysis
      could potentially refine, support, or even replace, existing costly and invasive techniques
      in the diagnosis of gastroparesis, intestinal psueodo-obstruction, colonic inertia, and
      disorders related to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).
