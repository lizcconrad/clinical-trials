  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether super-selective intra-arterial
      administration of verapamil immediately following successful intra-arterial thrombolysis is
      safe as a potential neuroprotective agent. Standard procedures are cerebral angiography and
      intra-arterial thrombolysis (intra-arterial administration of tPA and/or mechanical
      thrombectomy). Experimental procedure is superselective injection of verapamil
      intra-arterially.

      This trial represents the first time that verapamil will be evaluated in human subjects as a
      superselectively administered neuroprotective agent administered in an acute time frame as an
      adjunct to intra-arterial thrombolysis. The methods for administration, along with the
      routinized followup, will provide a paradigm for studying other potential neuroprotective
      agents. Subjects will undergo cerebral angiography with intra-arterial thrombolysis, which is
      standard of care. 'Intra-arterial thrombolysis will include possible intra-arterial
      administration of tPA, as well as possible mechanical thrombectomy with an accepted
      thrombectomy device. This includes the Mercí Retriever (Concentric Medical, Mountain View,
      CA), the Penumbra System (Penumbra, Alameda, CA), the Solitaire stent-triever (EV3, Covidien,
      Irvine, CA), and the Trevo stent-triever (Concentric Medical, Mountain View, CA). Immediately
      after the intra-arterial thrombolysis component of the angiographic procedure is completed,
      the microcatheter used during the procedure will be left in or guided into the vessel
      location of the clot. 10mg of verapamil in 20cc of normal saline will be administered over 20
      minutes (1cc/minute) through the microcatheter and into the vessel previously obstructed by
      clot. At the conclusion of infusion, the microcatheter will be removed. Angiography through
      the guide catheter of the cerebral circulation in question will be performed to ensure no new
      thromboembolic event from the microcatheterization (standard of care). The catheters will be
      removed, and the arterial puncture site closed in the standard fashion. Patients will receive
      a noncontrast CT scan or MRI approximately 24 hours after intervention to determine the
      presence or absence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after intervention. This would be
      considered standard practice for intra-arterial thrombolysis. Both imaging studies can detect
      ICH, and the choice of one or the other will be determined by clinical criteria; CT or MRI
      may be preferable for different reasons depending upon the patient's clinical scenario. The
      determination of hemorrhage will be made by the official dictation of a diagnostic
      neuroradiologist not directly involved in the study. The hemorrhage will be considered an
      adverse event if it is deemed symptomatic in accordance with the criteria used in the
      International Management of Stroke (IMS) III study. Briefly, a hemorrhage is defined as
      symptomatic if occurring within 24+/-6 hours after study inclusion, temporally related to the
      intervention, and occurs with worsening neurological status as documented in the clinical
      exam. A 4 point or more increase in the NIHSS stroke scale would qualify as a significant
      worsening in status. Furthermore, hemorrhage that requires intervention surgically or
      endovascularly would be deemed significant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients 21-85 years old, male or female

          2. Suspected acute ischemic stroke based on clinical and radiographic evidence as
             determined and documented by the Stroke Neurology team at University of Kentucky.

          3. Patients must meet criteria for intra-arterial thrombolysis as determined and
             documented by Interventional Neuroradiology attending physician (JF or AA).

          4. Patients must have an acute thromboembolus within an intracranial artery (internal
             carotid, anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, posterior cerebral, basilar, vertebral)
             which undergoes pharmacologic (tissue plasminogen activator - tPA) and/or mechanical
             (eg. Merci or Penumbra clot retrieval) thrombolysis.

          5. Patients with impaired capacity may be included, as the pathology to be studied
             (stroke) may impair their capacity (please see attached required documentation
             regarding impaired capacity).

          6. Patients must have a TICI 2A or better revascularization via intra-arterial
             thrombolysis.

        For reference, the TICI Scale is defined below:

        0 = No Perfusion

          1. = Perfusion past the initial obstruction but limited distal branch filling with little
             or slow distal perfusion

          2. A = Perfusion of less than 50% of the vascular distribution of the occluded artery

        2B = Perfusion of 50% or greater (but not complete) of the vascular distribution of the
        occluded artery 3 = Full perfusion with filling of all distal branches

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women (would not qualify for intra-arterial thrombolysis as standard of
             care).

          2. Patients who undergo intra-arterial thrombolysis for acute stroke, in whom only TICI 0
             or 1 revascularization is obtained.

          3. Patients with occlusion of the cervical common or internal carotid artery will be
             excluded from the study.
