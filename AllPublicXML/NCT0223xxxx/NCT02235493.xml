      The purpose of this study is to characterize the natural history of HPP in patients with
      Juvenile-onset HPP who served as historical controls in ENB-006-09.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease
      characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation
      that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and
      deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and
      respiratory failure. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for patients with
      this disease. There is also limited data available on the natural course of this disease over
      time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form.

    <description>The MPOMA-G is a 5-component assessment that is used to evaluate gait performance. The first component has 4 sub-components. For 2 components and 2 sub-components, scores of 0 or 1 are assigned while scores of 0, 1 or 2 are assigned to the rest of the 2 components and 2 sub-components based on type of ambulation pattern observed. The maximum total score of 12 points = no impairment and 0 points = worst impairment.</description>

            <groups_desc>Videos were reviewed and scored by 3 independent raters who were masked to patient identifiers and the clinic visits and dates when the videos were recorded. Each rater scored the individual components required for the calculation of the total MPOMA-G score for each evaluable patient video. The median of the scores across the 3 raters was obtained for each individual component and summed to generate the median MPOMA-G score used in the analyses.</groups_desc>

        <description>The POMA-G is a 7-component assessment that is used to evaluate gait performance. The second component has 4 sub-components. Scores of 0, 1 or 2 are assigned to 2 components while scores of 0 or 1 are assigned to the rest of the 4 components and 4 sub-components based on type of ambulation pattern observed. The maximum total score of 12 points = no impairment and 0 points = worst impairment.</description>
