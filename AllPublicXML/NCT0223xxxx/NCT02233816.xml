      A phase II trial multicenter, observer-blind, randomized, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a single intramuscular
      injection of plant-derived Seasonal VLP Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine administered to
      healthy adults 18-49 years of age.

      A total of three hundred subjects will be randomized in four (4) groups of 75 subjects to
      receive one injection of either a low, a medium, or a high dose level of the quadrivalent VLP
      influenza vaccine or the placebo preparation (100 millimolar (mM) phosphate buffer + 150 mM
      sodium chloride (NaCl) + 0.01% Tween 80).

      This study will be a dose escalation, cohort staggering (slow enrollment) for the 3 dose
      levels (low, medium or high dose level) with a placebo-controlled group:

        -  Cohort 1: A first cohort of one hundred nineteen subjects (119) will be randomized; of
           these, seventy five (75) will be dosed with the lowest dose of the quadrivalent VLP
           vaccine, nineteen (19) will be dosed with the medium dose of the quadrivalent VLP
           vaccine, and twenty five (25) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the
           immunization will be collected and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board
           (DSMB) consisting of the Principal Investigator (PI), the Sponsor's Medical Officer and
           three external medical experts as voting members, prior to permitting immunization with
           the cohort 2.

        -  Cohort 2: A second cohort of one hundred subjects (100) subjects will be randomized; of
           these, fifty six (56) will be dosed with the medium dose of the quadrivalent VLP
           vaccine, nineteen (19) be dosed with the high dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, and
           twenty five (25) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization
           will be collected and reviewed by the DSMB, prior to permitting immunization with the
           highest dose.

        -  Cohort 3: A third cohort of eighty one subjects (81) subjects will be randomized; of
           these fifty six (56) dosed with the high dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and twenty
           five (25) will receive a placebo.

      Three (3) and 21 days after immunization, key safety (Day 3) and immunogenicity (Day 21) data
      will be collected and analyzed. All subjects will be followed for safety until Day 201
      (6-month follow up), regardless the phase of the study.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of ≥18 and ≤32.

          3. Give his/her consent to participate in this study (by signing the informed consent
             form). In the opinion of the Investigator, competence and willingness to provide
             written, informed consent for participation after reading the informed consent form.
             The subject must have adequate opportunity to discuss the study with an Investigator
             or qualified designee.

          4. Healthy as judged by the Investigator or designee and determined by complete general
             physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and medical history
             conducted no more than 30 days prior to study vaccine administration. Subjects with a
             pre-existing chronic disease will be allowed to participate if the disease is stable
             and, according to the Investigator's judgment, the condition is unlikely to confound
             the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subject by participating in
             the study. Stable disease is generally defined as no new onset of exacerbation of
             pre-existing chronic disease 6 months prior to immunization. Based on the
             Investigator's judgment, a subject with more recent stabilization of a disease could
             also be eligible.

          5. Comprehension of the study requirements, expressed availability for the required study
             period, ability to attend scheduled visits, accessible by phone on a consistent basis.

             month prior to immunization and agrees to continue employing adequate birth control
             measures for at least 60 days post-immunization. Moreover, she must have no plan to
             become pregnant for at least 2 months post-immunization. Abstinent subjects should be
             asked what method(s) they would use, should their circumstances change, and subjects
             without a well-defined plan should be excluded.

             The following relationship or methods of contraception are considered to be effective:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (e.g., injectable, topical [patch], estrogenic vaginal
                  ring, etc.);

               -  Intra-uterine device (IUD) with or without hormonal release;

               -  Male partner using a condom plus spermicide or sterilized partner (at least 1
                  year prior to immunization);

               -  Credible history of abstinence (self-reported);

               -  Post-menopausal (absence of menses for 24 consecutive months and age consistent
                  with natural cessation of ovulation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. According to Investigator's opinion, presence of significant acute or chronic,
             uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:

               -  Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study
                  vaccine administration;

               -  Requiring a change in medication dosage in one month prior to study vaccine
                  administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage

             live attenuated Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine (TIV) or Quadrivalent Inactivated
             Vaccine (QIV) vaccine IN or split TIV or QIV vaccine by either intra-dermal or
             intramuscular route) prior to the 30 day exclusion period mentioned above would be
             acceptable.

          6. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to study
             enrolment or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate in any
             other investigational or marketed drug study while participating in this study
             (approximately 8 months).

          7. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone per
             day, or equivalent for more than 7 consecutive days or for 10 or more days in total,

             immunosuppressant drug, or any immunoglobulin preparation within 3 months of
             vaccination. Low doses of nasal or inhaled glucocorticoids are allowed.

          8. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or
             heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet medications (e.g., low-dose
             aspirin [no more than 325 mg/day]), and without a clinically apparent bleeding
             tendency are eligible. Subjects treated with new generation drugs that will not
             increase risk of intramuscular bleeding (such as clopidogrel) are also eligible.

          9. History of allergy to any of the constituents of the VLP quadrivalent study vaccine,
             or to the phosphate buffered saline (PBS; used as placebo), or tobacco allergy.

         16. Vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure and/or diastolic blood pressure,
             heart rate and respiratory rate. Although a vital signs measurement is out of the
             acceptable ranges, a subject may be included in the study based on Investigator's
             judgment. Presence of any febrile illness (including oral temperature (OT) ≥38.0˚C
             within 24 hours prior to immunization). Such subjects may be re-evaluated for
             enrolment after resolution of illness.
