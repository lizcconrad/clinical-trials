      aldoxorubicin plus gemcitabine in subjects with metastatic solid tumors administered at doses
      of 170, 250 or 350 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion (IVI) on Day 1 every 21 days plus 900 mg/m2
      gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary safety of administration of aldoxorubicin in combination with gemcitabine in subjects with metastatic solid tumors as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiograms (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans, electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and weight.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the activity of aldoxorubicin in combination with gemcitabine in this population, assessed by overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS).</description>

          1. Age between 15-80 years, male or female.

          2. Advanced, unresectable, metastatic solid tumor that has either relapsed or was
             refractory to treatment with at least 1 prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimen
             and for which no standard approved therapy exists.

          3. Progressive disease (PD) &lt; 6 months prior to enrollment.

          4. Capable of providing informed consent and complying with trial procedures.

          5. ECOG PS 0-2 (Appendix B).

          6. Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks.

          7. Measurable tumor lesions according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          8. Women must not be able to become pregnant (eg post-menopausal for at least 1 year,
             surgically sterile, or practicing adequate birth control methods) for the duration of

             last menstrual period of the female partner during the study treatment and for 6
             months after the final dose of study treatment.

         10. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at
             the Screening Visit and be non-lactating.

             medications. Concomitant use of medications associated with a high incidence of QT
             prolongation is not allowed (Appendix G).

         10. History or signs of active coronary artery disease with or without angina pectoris.

         11. Serious myocardial dysfunction defined scintigraphically (eg MUGA, myocardial
             scintigram) or ultrasound determined absolute LVEF &lt;45% of predicted.

         12. History of HIV infection.

         13. Active, clinically significant serious infection requiring treatment with antibiotics,
             anti-virals or anti-fungals.

         14. Major surgery within 21 days prior to enrollment.

         15. Substance abuse or any condition that might interfere with the subject's participation
