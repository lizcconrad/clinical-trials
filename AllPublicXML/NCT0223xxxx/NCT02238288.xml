  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients using anticoagulants present an increased risk of bleeding when subjected to oral
      surgery. Suspending or reducing the oral anticoagulant dose to perform invasive procedures,
      may result in thromboembolic events, putting patients health in risk. Recent studies advocate
      the dental surgery treatment without suspending the anticoagulant therapy, since the values
      of the international normalized ratio (INR) are in acceptable therapeutic levels and local
      measurements are taken for the hemostasis control. The aim of this study is to compare the
      effectiveness use of intra-alveolar epsilon amino caproic acid (EACA) associated to daily
      rinses with the drug, with routine post-surgical procedures, to control the post-exodontic
      bleeding in anticoagulated patients. Patients will be referred by the anticoagulation clinic
      of the Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital. Once the study criteria is met patients
      will be randomly allocated into two groups and subsequently subjected to clinical and
      periodontal examination, radiographic examination and pre-operative periodontal therapy.
      Laboratory tests (partial thromboplastic time, prothrombin time, international normalized
      ratio and platelet count) will be held on the day of the extraction. Patients in group 1 (
      EACA ) will receive a paste composed of 01 macerated EACA tablet (500 mg), mixed with 0.9%
      saline solution in the alveolar socket, and routine post-operative care. Additionally,
      patients will perform oral rinses three times a day, on the first two post-operative days,
      with a solution from the macerated EACA 500mg tablet diluted in 2 spoons of filtered water.
      Patients allocated in group 2 (control) will receive routine post-operative care.
      Classification of immediate bleeding will be held by the professional, on the day of the
      surgery, immediately after the suture and twenty minutes later and the delayed bleeding,
      recorded by the patient through a daily questionnaire. The Statistical Package for the Social
      Sciences (SPSS)© (IBM, Chicago, USA) 20.0 is used as the database and the Chi-square,
      Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests will be applied to statistical analysis of the
      results.The study was approved by the ethical and research committee of the Clementino Fraga
      Filho University Hospital . All patients will sign a free consent and informed term.

      All patients will be submitted to clinical and radiographic examination. Once selected,
      patients will receive hygiene instruction and will be submitted to full mouth scaling one
      week before the procedure with an ultrasonic device (CavitronR - Dentsply). The random
      allocation of patients will obey the order obtained in the computerized program Allocation
      1.0 Software© (Isfahan, Iran, 2004). All patients should have the prothrombin time (PT) and
      INR, active thromboplastin partial time (aTPT) and platelet counts tests on the day of
      surgery. Patients who present INR&lt; 2.0 e &gt; 4 will be assessed by the medical team about the
      possibility of change in the dose of medication to the surgical procedure. Patients with
      predisposing heart conditions the bacterial endocarditis will receive antibiotic prophylaxis
      as recommendations from American Association of Cardiology (AHA) of 2007. All extraction
      procedures will be performed by non-traumatic conventional surgical techniques, under local
      anesthesia (2% lidocaine and epinephrine 1: 100,000). Just one extraction will be performed
      in each surgical procedure, by the same surgeon. All patients will receive digital
      compression of socket with sterile gauze for 5 minutes (Chompret `s manoeuver) and suture
      with non-resorbable wire, silk 3.0 type . Everyone will receive the base analgesic
      prescription Paracetamol 750 mg (Tylenol© - Johnson &amp; Johnson), 01 tablet every 6 hours, by
      oral administration, for control of postoperative pain. Patients are divided into two groups:

      Group 1 (EACA) - patients will receive the intra-alveolar application of a 500 mg tablet of
      the epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA - Ipsilon® - Nikko Brazil, RJ) crushed in 0.9% saline.
      Additionally, they will be instructed to rinse with 500mg EACA tablets macerated and diluted
      in 2 tablespoons of water three times a day, in the two days after the extraction.

      Group 2 (control) - patients will receive routine postoperative care.

      Classification of Bleeding will be performed by the professional on the day of surgery at two
      times: one time (immediately after extraction) and time 2 (after 20 minutes). The bleeding
      will be classified as follows:

        -  No bleeding

        -  Light bleeding - blood in saliva

        -  Moderate Bleeding - bleeding controlled with local measures

        -  Severe Bleeding - when surgical intervention is required

      Late bleeding will be recorded by the patient through daily questionnaire. The bleeding will
      be classified as follows:

        -  No bleeding

        -  Blood stained saliva

        -  Bleeding that stopped after compression bandage and ice pack for 20 minutes

        -  Bleeding stopped only after professional intervention
