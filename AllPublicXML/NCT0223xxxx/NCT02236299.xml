  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart requires nutrients and oxygen carried in the blood to generate energy for healthy
      pump function. Blood is supplied via heart vessels called coronary arteries. When the
      arteries narrow the investigators call this coronary artery disease. Narrowing and blockage
      of the coronary arteries can cause chest pain (angina), breathlessness (due to a reduction in
      pump function) and if prolonged even irreversible muscle damage known as a heart attack. The
      investigators can treat patients with coronary artery disease with drugs that reduce the
      workload on the heart or with balloons and hollow metal tubes (stents) to open the narrowed
      coronary arteries and improve the blood supply. These treatments can relieve angina, improve
      breathlessness and avert heart muscle damage during a heart attack. A potential new
      mechanistic effect is emerging by modulating the type of fuel used by the heart to generate
      energy more efficiently has been tested in the left ventricle. This study is designed to see
      if mechanistic effect provides the same protection in the right ventricle. It is hoped that
      this may further improve heart pump function and reduce the size of a heart attack in
      patients with coronary artery disease.

    <description>Tau - the time constant of diastolic relaxation is a sensitive measure of ventricular function.
Control Group - 15 patients are randomised to receive a placebo saline infusion.
GLP-1 Group - 15 patients are randomised to receive a GLP-1 infusion.
Balloon Occlusion One - is performed at the start of the procedure and is a measure of baseline ventricular function.
Balloon Occlusion Two - is performed directly after a 30 minute infusion of either the saline control or GLP-1.
All measurements are performed while the patient is in the catheter laboratory.</description>

    <time_frame>Change betweeen Balloon Occlusion One (Baseline) and Balloon Occlusion Two (30 minutes later)</time_frame>
    <description>EF - the Ejection Fraction is the percentage of blood ejected by the ventricle and is considered as a sensitive measure of ventricular function.
Control Group - 15 patients are randomised to receive a placebo saline infusion.
GLP-1 Group - 15 patients are randomised to receive a GLP-1 infusion.
Balloon Occlusion One - is performed at the start of the procedure and is a measure of baseline ventricular function.
