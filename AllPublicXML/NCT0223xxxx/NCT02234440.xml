    <textblock>
      In this study, consecutive patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis (NASH-related cirrhosis),
      coming to ILBS (Institute of Liver &amp; Biliary Sciences) OPD (Out patient Department) or
      getting admitted in the ward will be enrolled on fulfillment of inclusion/exclusion criteria
      and consent of the patient. These patients will be randomised to either metformin arm or
      conventional treatment arm. After enrollment these subjects will be monitored every three
      monthly for total of 12 months or till the primary endpoint is achieved. At the end of the
      study, outcome will be measured appropriately.
