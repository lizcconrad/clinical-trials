  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the Chocolate PTA Balloon to standard Percutaneous
      Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) catheters. The investigators will use Optical Coherence
      Tomography (OCT) and Quantitative Vascular Angiography to evaluate the acute vascular
      response of vessels treated with the Chocolate Balloon to a standard balloon catheter, with
      the primary endpoint being luminal gain assessed by OCT lumen volume measurements.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects will be randomized to treatment with either the Chocolate Balloon catheter or a
      standard balloon angioplasty catheter. All angioplasty procedures will be conducted with
      treatment balloon at the full discretion of the physician and according to the standard
      practice at the hospital and the device Instructions for Use. All patients will undergo
      baseline OCT imaging in addition to standard angiography. Post-PTA, all patients will then
      undergo repeat OCT imaging immediately post-procedure and then again at 10-minutes
      post-procedure to assess for vascular recoil.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Luminal Gain</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Luminal Gain as defined by OCT lumen volume measurements. Luminal gain is assessed as the percentage change comparing pre-treatment and post-treatment volume measurements in cubic centimeters (CC) or millimeters (m3).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dissection</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Dissection severity (extension) as defined by both angiographic and OCT metrics.
Dissections occur when the blood goes into the vessel wall instead of staying in the vessel lumen. Dissection severity is determined by a visual review of the angiogram and OCT images by an independent core lab. Dissections are classified as flow-limiting (more severe) vs. non-flow limiting (less severe) based upon the amount of the blood that is flowing into the vessel wall.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hematoma</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of intramural hematoma on OCT.
A hematoma can be visually observed on a angiogram and an OCT image. The images will be independently reviewed by a core lab expert who will document if a hematoma is present or not.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimal PTA</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Achievement of Optimal PTA (&lt;30% Diameter stenosis without flow limiting dissection)
&lt;30% Diameter stenosis and flow limiting dissections are visual assessments that will be conducted by an independent core lab review. The % diameter stenosis measures the amount of plaque that is in the vessel and a flow-limiting dissection is observed as either present or not present.</description>
