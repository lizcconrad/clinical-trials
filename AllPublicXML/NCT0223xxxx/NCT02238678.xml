    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that ligaments, both cardinal and uterosacral contain a considerable
      amount of autonomic nerve tissues. The resection of deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules
      at the level of the uterosacral ligaments or the rectovaginal space is supposed to damage the
      supplying autonomic nerve fibers of the lower urinary tract. The bladder receives motor and
      sensitive innervations from both the sympathetic fibers, most of which arise from the
      hypogastric plexuses and nerves, and the parasympathetic fibers, which arise from the pelvic
      splanchnic nerves and the inferior hypogastric plexus; therefore, even bladder function may
      be impaired in women affected by deep endometriosis.

      Very few data have been published regarding the urodynamic functional evaluation of bladder
      in patient with deep endometriosis.So far, it is unknown if the surgery itself causes the
      postoperative bladder dysfunction or if the surgery unmasks a subclinically pre-existing
      detrusor pathology.

      Since the urinary postoperative complications have a strong impact on quality of life of the
      deep endometriosis patients and often requires management (due to a poor spontaneous
      remission), it is crucial a better understanding of the problem. That will help for a more
      appropriate pre-operative counselling.

      Aims of this study are to evaluate the bladder function before and after deep endometriosis
      surgery, using standardized validated instruments and to correlate the localisation of the
      endometriosis lesion, the type/area of surgical dissection with the postoperative bladder
      function.

      This is a prospective multicenter cohort study involving the Department of General
      Gynaecology and Gynecological Oncology of Medical University of Vienna (Austria) and the
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Insubria University, Varese (Italy).

      A total of 50 patients are planned to be included. The study protocol consider a Preoperative
      Assessment (clinical examination, transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, preoperative specific
      questionnaire including obstetric, medical, and surgical history and standardized questions
      on pelvic floor dysfunctions, standardized instrumental assessment of the pelvic floor) a
      Intraoperative Assessment (during laparoscopy, the localizations of endometriotic lesions
      recorded and identified by anatomical sites, numbers, and depth of infiltration). Before and
      3 months after surgery a Urodynamic assessment is planned.
