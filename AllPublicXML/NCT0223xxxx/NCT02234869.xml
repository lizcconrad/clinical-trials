  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate, in participants with RMS, safety and
      tolerability (as defined by the frequency of adverse events [AEs] of flu-like symptoms [FLS;
      chills, pyrexia, myalgia, and asthenia], injection site reactions [ISRs], and injection site
      reaction pain [ISR-P]) over 6 months of treatment (the active comparator period) with BIIB017
      125 μg subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks versus standard-of-care SC interferon-beta (IFN-β)
      therapy. Secondary objectives of this study are to assess the following measures during the
      first (6-month) period of the study in participants treated with BIIB017 versus
      standard-of-care SC IFN-β therapy: patient-reported treatment satisfaction using the
      following patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs): Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for
      Medication (TSQM-9), Adapted MS Treatment Concerns Questionnaire (MSTCQ), Adapted MSTCQ Side
      Effects Score, Pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) diary and the McGill Pain Questionnaire
      Short Form (SF-MPQ), the treatments' impact on RMS using the following PROMs: Multiple
      Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale-5 Item (MFIS-5), EuroQol
      Group 5-Dimension 3-Level Version (EQ-5D-3L), Health-Related Productivity Questionnaire
      (HRPQ), Beck Depression Inventory, second edition (BDI-II), participant adherence to study
      treatment, clinical status as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and
      relapse activity, safety and tolerability of study treatment after a change in
      standard-of-care SC IFN-β therapy and the immunogenicity profiles of participants changing
      from standard-of-care SC IFN-β to BIIB017.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MSIS-29 is a self-report questionnaire measuring the physical (20 items) and psychological (9 items) impact of MS from the patient's perspective. Each of the 29 questions can take 1 of 5 responses, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely).

    <description>The MFIS-5 is a structured, self-report questionnaire, modified from the Fatigue Impact Scale. The abbreviated version (MFIS-5) has 5 items taken from the physical (2 items), cognitive (2 items), and psychological (1 item) subscales of the standard 21-item MFIS. The participant is asked to score each item from 0 to 4. All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a participant's activities. The MFIS-5 total score consists of the sum of the raw scores on the 5 items, and thus can range from 0 to 20.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a confirmed diagnosis of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS), as defined by
             McDonald criteria.

          -  An Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.0.

          -  On continual treatment for ≥6 months with a single standard-of-care subcutaneous (SC)
             interferon beta (IFN-β) therapy, including IFN β-1b 0.25 mg SC every other day or IFN
             β-1a 44 μg SC 3 times weekly, and from a clinical perspective be able to continue this
             therapy (i.e., no significant untoward events attributed to IFN therapy that would
             preclude continuation of the existing IFN therapy).

          -  A candidate for change to BIIB017 therapy (candidacy for therapy change is determined
             by the treating physician; however, it is recommended to exclude patients with high
             disease activity and who are candidates for escalation therapy according to local
             guidelines).

          -  Patients who are randomized to their current standard-of-care IFN-β therapy for the
             first 6 months of the study must be willing to receive their treatment via the
             formulation provided in the study (i.e., Rebif 44 μg in a prefilled syringe or
             Betaferon/Betaseron 0.25 mg in single-use vials of lyophilized powder accompanied by a
             prefilled single-use diluent syringe).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary progressive, secondary progressive, or progressive relapsing MS.

          -  History of inadequate response to SC IFN therapy (as determined by the treating
             physician).

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or known hypersensitivity to
             study drug or its excipients. - Known allergy to any component of the BIIB017
             formulation.

          -  History of any clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator) cardiac,
             endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary,
             neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, or other major disease that would
             preclude participation in a clinical study.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or
             aspirin that would preclude use of at least one of these during the study.

          -  An MS relapse that has occurred within the 50 days prior to randomization and/or lack
             of stabilization from a previous relapse prior to randomization.

          -  Any previous treatment with BIIB017.

          -  Treatment with other agents for MS.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
