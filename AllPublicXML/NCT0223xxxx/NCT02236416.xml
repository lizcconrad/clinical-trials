  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to verify whether a program of supervised, multimodal
      physical exercise improves cognitive function and/or reduces the rate of cognitive decline in
      older adults

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-dwelling volunteers, recruited from social centers, were invited to an in-person
      assessment that included a medical history questionnaire and examination, anthropometric
      measurements, blood tests for cardiovascular risk, and several outcome measures. Participants
      meeting the inclusion criteria were divided in 3 groups (participants without subjective or
      objective cognitive impairment, with subjective memory complaints and with mild cognitive
      impairments) and randomly assigned (1:1) to an experimental group or a control group, using a
      list of random numbers generated by a statistical software. The list was kept in a sealed
      envelope and a researcher, not directly involved in the recruitment and in the evaluation of
      the participants, assigned the allocation numbers.
