      This study will enroll specimens from subjects diagnosed with various cancers and who have
      either:

        1. RETROSPEFCTIVE / ARCHIVAL SAMPLES already undergone surgical resection of their tumor
           and have one or more formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks on file within
           the local (or affiliated) pathology archive (replicate blocks from same tumor) or blocks
           no longer required to be maintained on file - discard blocks, or

        2. PROSPECTIVE SAMPLES are scheduled to undergo surgical treatment and who prior to
           scheduled surgery, provide informed consent and donate a 10-20 ml blood sample. After
           surgery, surplus tissues (including tumor and adjacent normal tissues) not required for
           diagnosis will be collected.

      Subject clinical information will be collected, including basic demographic information,
      medical history, current cancer history and treatment. A final pathology report will be
      obtained for each subject's surgical specimen. In some instances, and based on the cancer
      indications required, longitudinal data may also be collected at a frequency of every 6
      months to once per year. Longitudinal data will include information on study subject survival
      and disease recurrence.
