    <textblock>
      Blepharitis is a endemic inflammatory disease caused mainly by Demodex folliculorum and
      Demodex Brevis, This mites are often associated with anaerobic bacteria that produces a skin
      inflammation, so a intervention that reduces the number of mites and bacteria would be
      desirable. Ivermectin a macrolid compound have demonstrated activity against scabies and lice
      in humans and in animals and a single application have show a good response in lice
      eradication.

      In this study , investigators will determinate the security and effectiveness of this
      compound in the eradication of mites
