  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple sites phase II trial, randomized, observer-blind, dose ranging,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a single
      intramuscular injection of plant-based Seasonal VLP Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine
      administered in elderly subjects (50 years old and more).

      A total of four hundred fifty (450) subjects will be randomized in six (6) groups of 75
      subjects to receive one injection of either a non-adjuvanted low, medium or high dose level
      of VLP, a low or high dose level of VLP of the quadrivalent VLP influenza vaccine combined
      with Alhydrogel® as adjuvant or the placebo preparation (100 millimolar (mM) phosphate buffer
      + 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) + 0.01% Tween 80)

      This study will use cohort staggering (slow enrollment) for 3 non-adjuvanted dose levels
      (low, medium, high dose level of VLP per strain), 2 adjuvanted dose levels (low or high dose
      level of VLP per strain) and a placebo-controlled group divided in 3 cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Approximately one hundred and thirty-eight (138) subjects will be randomized
           and dosed as follows: seventy-five (75) subjects with the lowest non-adjuvanted dose of
           the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) subjects with the medium non-adjuvanted dose
           of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) subjects with the lowest adjuvanted dose
           of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and twenty-five (25) subjects with a placebo. The 7-day
           safety data after the immunization will be collected by the clinical staff and will be
           reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB consisting of the PIs,
           the Sponsor's Medical Officer and 3 external medical advisors (voting members); the
           members will determine if the clinical sites are allowed to continue with the
           immunization of the second cohort.

        -  Cohort 2: Approximately one hundred and seventy-five (175) subjects will be randomized
           and dosed as follows: fifty-six (56) subjects with the medium non-adjuvanted dose
           quadrivalent VLP vaccine, fifty-six (56) subjects with the lowest adjuvanted dose
           quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) subjects with the highest adjuvanted dose
           quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) subjects with the highest non-adjuvanted dose
           quadrivalent VLP vaccine and twenty-five (25) subjects with a placebo. The 7-day safety
           data after the immunization will be collected by the clinical staff and reviewed by the
           DSMB prior to allowing immunization of the third cohort.

        -  Cohort 3: Approximately one hundred and thirty-seven (137) subjects will be randomized
           and dosed as follows: fifty-six (56) subjects with the highest adjuvanted dose,
           fifty-six (56) subjects with the highest non-adjuvanted dose and twenty-five (25)
           subjects with a placebo.

             disease is defined as no new onset of exacerbation of pre-existing chronic disease 6
             months prior to immunization. Based on Investigator's judgment, a subject with more
             recent stabilisation of a disease may still be eligible.

          5. Comprehension of the study requirements, expressed availability for the required study
             period, ability to attend scheduled visits, accessible by phone on a consistent basis.

          7. Female of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception for 1
             month prior to immunization and agrees to continue employing adequate birth control
             measures for at least 60 days post-immunization. Moreover, she must have no plan to
             become pregnant for at least 2 months post-immunization. Abstinent subjects should be
             asked what method(s) they would use, should their circumstances change, and subjects
             without a well-defined plan should be excluded.

             The following relationship or methods of contraception are considered to be effective:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (e.g., injectable, topical [patch], estrogenic vaginal
                  ring, etc.);

               -  Post-menopausal (absence of menses for 24 consecutive months and age consistent
                  with natural cessation of ovulation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. According to Investigator's opinion, presence of significant acute or chronic,
             uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:

               1. Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study
                  vaccine administration which would interfere with vaccine evaluation or study
                  completion (subject requiring medical or surgical treatment that would not
                  interfere with evaluation [e.g., minor knee surgery, cataracts, etc.] would be
                  eligible);

          2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject unable to
             provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and reporting.

          3. Any autoimmune disease or any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or
             immunodeficiency including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,
             Hepatitis B or C, or the presence of lymphoproliferative disease.

          4. Administration of any vaccine (including any other influenza vaccine) within 30 days
             prior to study enrolment or planned administration within the period from the
             vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 21 or within 30 days prior to blood sampling
             at Day 201. Immunization on an emergency basis will be evaluated in a case-by-case by
             the Investigator.

          5. Administration of any adjuvanted or investigational influenza vaccine within 1 year
             prior to study enrolment or planned administration prior to the end of this trial (Day
             201). Administration of any 'standard', not adjuvanted influenza vaccine (e.g., live
             attenuated Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) or Quadrivalent Inactivated
             Vaccine (QIV) vaccine IN or split TIV or QIV vaccine by either intra-dermal or
             intramuscular route) prior to the 30-day exclusion period mentioned above would be
             acceptable.

          6. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to study
             enrolment or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate in any
             other investigational or marketed drug study while participating in this study
             (approximately 7-12 months [depending when subjects undergo screening session and Day
             201 visit]).

          7. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone per
             day, or equivalent for more than 7 consecutive days or for 10 or more days in total,

             immunosuppressant drug, or any immunoglobulin preparation within 3 months of
             vaccination. Routine use of standard doses of nasal or inhaled glucocorticoids is
             allowed.

          8. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or
             heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet medications, e.g., low-dose
             aspirin (no more than 325 mg/day), and without a clinically apparent bleeding tendency
             are eligible. Subjects treated with new generation drugs that will not increase risk
             of intramuscular bleeding (such as clopidogrel) are also eligible.

          9. History of allergy to any of the constituents of the VLP quadrivalent study vaccine,
             Alhydrogel® (aluminum hydroxide) or to the phosphate buffered saline (PBS; used as
             placebo), or tobacco allergy.

         10. History of anaphylaxis reaction to any food, medication or bee sting.

         11. Any history of severe asthma (e.g., status asthmatic, hospitalization for asthma
             control) or recurrent asthma episodes requiring medical attention in the last 3 years
             (≥ 1 episode/year).

         12. Continuous use of anti-histamines in the last 4 weeks prior to immunization or use of
             anti-histamines 48 hours prior to study immunization.

         13. Have a rash, dermatological condition, tattoos, muscle mass, or any other
             abnormalities at injection site which may interfere with injection site reaction
             rating.

         14. Have received a blood transfusion within 90 days prior to study vaccination.

         16. Vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure and/or diastolic blood pressure,
             heart rate). Although a vital signs measurement is out of the acceptable ranges, a
             subject may be included in the study based on Investigator's judgment. Presence of any
             febrile illness (including oral temperature (OT) ≥38.0˚C within 24 hours prior to
