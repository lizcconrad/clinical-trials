      The main purpose of the study is to assess the impact of environmental conditions on
      live-birth rates after intraconjugal IVF.

      The second purposes are

        -  to assess the impact on pregnancies (prematurity, preeclampsia);

        -  to assess the impact on newborn's health (stunted growth);

        -  to evaluate the consistency of results observed between assisted pregnancies and
           spontaneous pregnancies.

      This multicenter epidemiological study aims to analyze the individual standardized clinical
      records, collected prospectively since 2008 in the medically assisted procreation centers
      (MAP).

      These individual data will be mapped to the environmental data (meteorological and air
      quality), recorded in the area of residence of the mother at the time of conception and
      pregnancy, as well as to the socio-economic data.

      Choice of centers:

        -  The study will be proposed to the 106 private or public centers in metropolitan France
           who are authorized for MAP procedures such as IVF and ICSI.

        -  Only the centers who perform more than 200 oocyte retrievals per year will be selected
           to participate in the study.

      More than 80% of attempts performed by the selected centers should be available (without
      missing data) on the induced pregnancies and their outcome (minimum data set for each case:
      age of man and woman, cause of infertility, technique used, sperm collection method
      (ejaculation, surgical sperm retrieval techniques), total number of embryos obtained,
      clinical pregnancy or not, term of pregnancy, weight and height of the child at birth).

        The study focuses on intraconjugal IVF attempts (conventional IVF, microinjection
        intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and frozen embryo transfers) realised for MAP
        procedures in metropolitan France, in the period of 01/01/2008 to 12/31/2012 (5 years).
