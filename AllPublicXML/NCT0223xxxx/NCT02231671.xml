    <description>Part 1 of this study is an absolute bioavailability study where the IV (intravenous) microtracer dose of ALS-008112 is administered 15-30 minutes after the oral dose to determine the bioavailability of the oral dose compared to the IV dose. The maximum microtracer IV dose administered in Part 1 of this study will not exceed a single dose of 100 μg [14C]-ALS-008112 containing NMT (not more than) 37.0 kBq (1000 nCi) 14C. Based upon previous clinical observations, it is anticipated that the single oral dose and IV microdose to be utilised in Part 1 will provide acceptable PK data and will be safe and well tolerated.</description>

    <description>Part 2 of this study is an absorption, metabolism and excretion study, for which a single 375 mg [14C]-ALS-008176 (containing NMT 6.85 MBq (megabecquerel) (185 μCi) 14C) dose has been selected for evaluation based upon data from prior studies. Based upon previous clinical observations, it is anticipated that the dose to be utilised in Part 2 will provide acceptable PK data, will be safe and well tolerated and is within the therapeutic range.</description>
