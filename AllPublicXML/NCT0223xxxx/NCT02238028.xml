      An intervention study to assess the short-term cardiovascular effects of reducing personal
      air pollution exposure by wearing particulate filtering respirators.

    <textblock>
      A group of healthy adult college students fulfilling the recruitment criteria were randomly
      divided into two sub-groups. One sub-group weared the particulate filtering respirators for 2
      continuous days during which the respirator was required to wear as much as possible both
      indoor and outdoor. The other group acted as normal at the same time. The measurements on
      health effects including heart rate varibility, blood pressure, circulating biomarkers as
      well as the ambient air pollution were performed in both groups during the intervention
      period. After a 3-week rest period,the two groups interchanged their roles of wearing the
      respirator or not. The same measurements of both health effects indicators and ambient air
      pollution were repeated.

    <time_frame>up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>HRV is a quantitative health marker reflecting how the autonomic nervous system modulates the sinoatrial node in the heart and HRV has therefore been widely used to estimate cardiac autonomic function and control. Subjects were attached with Holter monitor on the 2nd day in each of the 48-hr intervention period.A total of 8 parameters of HRV were analyzed including 4 time-domain indices and 4 frequency-domain indices. Frequency domain methods assign bands of frequency and then count the number of NN intervals that match each band. The bands are typically high frequency (HF) from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz, low frequency (LF) from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz, and the very low frequency (VLF) from 0.0033 to 0.04 Hz. Parasympathetic activity is a major contributor to the HF component. More problematic is the interpretation of the LF component, which was considered by some as a marker of sympathetic modulation but is now known to include both sympathetic and vagal influences.</description>

Heart rate and heart automatic function indices including the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval(SDNN),the standard deviation of the average NN intervals calculated over short periods(SDANN), the root mean square of the successive differences(rMSSD) were automatically recorded during the intervention.</description>

        <title>Heart Rate Variability-LF Power,HF Power,VLF Power</title>
        <description>HRV is a quantitative health marker reflecting how the autonomic nervous system modulates the sinoatrial node in the heart and HRV has therefore been widely used to estimate cardiac autonomic function and control. Subjects were attached with Holter monitor on the 2nd day in each of the 48-hr intervention period.A total of 8 parameters of HRV were analyzed including 4 time-domain indices and 4 frequency-domain indices. Frequency domain methods assign bands of frequency and then count the number of NN intervals that match each band. The bands are typically high frequency (HF) from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz, low frequency (LF) from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz, and the very low frequency (VLF) from 0.0033 to 0.04 Hz. Parasympathetic activity is a major contributor to the HF component. More problematic is the interpretation of the LF component, which was considered by some as a marker of sympathetic modulation but is now known to include both sympathetic and vagal influences.</description>

            <groups_desc>Paired Student's t tests were used in the absence and presence of wearing respirators. HRV was log-transformed before regression analyses. Linear mixed-effect models were applied to investigate the effects of wearing respirators. Age, sex, body mass index, PM2.5 concentration, 48-h mean temperature and 48-h mean humidity were introduced into the model as fixed-effect terms. At last, we incorporated random-effect intercepts for subjects to account for correlations between repeated measurements.</groups_desc>

        <title>Heart Rate Variability—pNN50</title>
        <description>HRV is a quantitative health marker reflecting how the autonomic nervous system modulates the sinoatrial node in the heart and HRV has therefore been widely used to estimate cardiac autonomic function and control.A total of 8 parameters of HRV were analyzed including 4 time-domain indices and 4 frequency-domain indices. Subjects were attached with Holter monitor on the 2nd day in each of the 48-hr intervention period. Heart rate and heart automatic function indices including the proportion of successive normal NN intervals differing by more than 50 ms in the total number of NNs（pNN50） were automatically recorded during the intervention.</description>
