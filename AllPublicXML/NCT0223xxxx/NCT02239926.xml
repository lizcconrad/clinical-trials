      Will Ranolazine improve bowel function and abdominal pain in human subjects with IBS-D?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study that will use validated
      bowel questionnaires to evaluate the effects of ranolazine administered orally twice daily in
      patients with diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D). The study will consist of a 2 week run in
      period, followed by 4 weeks of treatment period with oral ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily.
      Primary endpoint of the study will be the average Bowel Symptom Scale (BSS) scores for
      diarrhea and adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort are secondary end points.

    <description>BSS is a 100-mm visual analog scale for each symptom of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) (pain or discomfort, bloating, and diarrhea) with an overall severity score. Lower scores indicate symptoms are not present and higher scores indicate severe symptoms.</description>
