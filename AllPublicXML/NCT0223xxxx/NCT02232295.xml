    <textblock>
      The aim of the Study to evaluate the effect of Graded motor imagery on upper limb motor
      functions and quality of life in patients with stroke that was conducted in two centers in
      india. The primary outcome measures were upper limb motor functions at 6 weeks and secondary
      outcome measure was quality of life at 6 weeks.

      Research Hypothesis: There would be significant effect of GMI on Upper limb motor functions
      and quality of life in patients with stroke.

      Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) is essentially a brain based treatment, targeting the activation
      of different brain regions in a graded manner. GMI is a three stage treatment programme
      comprising of Left Right discrimination training, Explicit Motor imagery and Mirror therapy.

      In this Study, GMI approach is applied on the patients with Stroke to enhance their Upper
      limb motor functions and Quality of life.

      Conventional treatment:

      Patients of group A and group B had received conventional treatment for 6 weeks. Conventional
      treatment consists of Task oriented upper extremity functional exercises. Components of Task
      oriented training include weight bearing, supportive reactions, and reaching, grasping,
      holding and release activities. It was performed five days a week for six weeks of one hour
      duration.

      Graded Motor Imagery:

      Patients of group A had received GMI programme with conventional treatment for 6 weeks. It is
      a three stage process, was performed five days a week for six weeks of one hour duration. It
      comprises of:

        -  Left Right discrimination training (Implicit Motor Imagery) - 2 weeks

        -  Explicit Motor Imagery (Imagined movements) - 2 weeks

        -  Mirror Therapy - 2 weeks

    <description>Primary Outcome measures: FMA Scale and CAHAI scale
FMA Scale:
It is a stroke specific, performance based impairment index. This scale includes items related to movements of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand in the upper extremity, as well as the hip, knee, and ankle in the lower extremity. For the present study, only the upper extremity was measured.The total score on the upper extremity part of the FMA ranged from 0 (hemiplegia) to a maximum of 66 points (normal motor performance). The scale was measured at baseline and post intervention.
CAHAI Scale:
The purpose of this measure is to evaluate the functional ability of the hemiplegic arm and hand to perform tasks. It is designed to encourage the bilateral hand to complete the task.Each task was demonstrated once before performance, then the Score was evaluated of the affected upper extremity using the 7 point activity scale from total assistance (1) to complete</description>

    <description>Secondary outcome measure:
SS-QOL (Stroke Specific- Quality of life) Scale It is a self report scale containing 49 items in 12 domains. It is intended to provide an assessment of health related quality of life specific to patients with stroke. Scale domains and items were derived from a series of interviews with patients.The scale was measured at baseline and post intervention.</description>
