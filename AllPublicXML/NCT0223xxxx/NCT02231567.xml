  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an approach based on
      neurocognitive rehabilitation exercises in the form of sensory-motor problems, whose solution
      involves the use of higher cognitive functions (attention, memory, language), not required in
      a traditional approach proprioceptive, in order to obtain a more complete and long-lasting
      recovery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of WOMAC Questionnaire from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire for the assessment of pain, stiffness and physical function. It measures physical function and symptoms of the lower limb and explores the impact of disability and pain on activities of daily living. The questionnaire is self-administered and it is based on a metric scale ranging from 0 (no difficulty) to 100 (extreme difficulty).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Barthel Index from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Index for the evaluation of patient's performance in activities of daily living. The index is divided into eleven sub-categories that assess activities of daily living (ability to feed themselves, to ensure personal hygiene and dressing) and the mobility of the individual (gait, postural changes and transfers, stairs). For each item is assigned a score variable from full to reduced or absent functionality. The questionnaire is administered by an examiner and is based on a metric scale ranging from 0 (total dependence) to 100 (minimum dependence).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is based on a ten point scale, where 0 means no pain and 10 means the greatest pain ever. It enables the patients to express their pain intensity as numerical value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of health status using the SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire. The questionnaire is divided into eight sub-categories that measure the physical activity, role limitations due to physical health and emotional problems, physical pain, the perception of general health, vitality, social activities, mental health and changes in health status and two indices that summarize the overall assessment of the subject with respect to his physical health (ISF) and mental (ISM). Indices are derived from 8 subcategories evaluated and allow to summarize the results. The questionnaire is self-administered and subcategories is that the indices are based on a metric scale ranging from 0 (worst health status) to 100 (best health status) 17, 18.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Psychological Well-Being Questionnaire (PWB) from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire for the assessment of psychological well-being and positive functioning of the individual. It includes 84 items and measures the six dimensions /scales of well-being proposed in the model developed by the American psychologist Carol Ryff: self-acceptance, positive interpersonal relationships, autonomy, environmental control, personal growth and purpose in life. The questionnaire is self-administered and each item is evaluated by a metric scale ranging from 1 (disagree) to 6 (totally agree). The negatively worded items are counted in reverse order. The sum score for each scale is calculated by summing the degree of agreement of each item.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of parameters of Gait Analysis from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It's used to define the pattern of gait. The Gait Analysis provides different types of information such as quantitative kinematics data (angles of flexion-extension, abduction-adduction and external rotation of the main joints), velocity data (moments and powers the major joints) and electromyographic data.</description>
