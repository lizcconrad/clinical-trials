  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of JNJ-42756493 oral
      dose of capsule (reference) versus tablet (test) in healthy participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all people know
      the identity of the intervention), 2 way crossover (method used to switch participants from
      one study group change to treatment group), single-dose study in healthy participants. The
      study will consist of 3 phases: Screening Phase (Day -21 to Day -2), Treatment Phase
      (consists of 2 single-dose treatment period, either JNJ-42756493 capsule or JNJ-42756493
      tablet) and Follow-up Phase (12-14 days after last dose). All the eligible participants will
      be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences to ensure that they receive both of
      the treatments, 1 in each period. Each treatment regimen will be separated by a washout
      period of at least 15 days. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of
      pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Relative bioavailability of
      two dosage form of JNJ-42756493 (test and reference) will be evaluated primarily.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
