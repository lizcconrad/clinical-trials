  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with very low
      frequency electromagnetic fields on the reduction of pain in patients with fibromylgia,
      disease presenting with widespread musculoskeletal pain usually associated with other
      symptoms such as stiffness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale for the assessment of pain and it's based on a ten point scale, where 0 means no pain and 10 the greatest pain ever both at rest and during movements.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Fibromylgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire assesses disability and symptoms. It is divided into ten sub-categories that assess the range of symptoms presented by the patient and the response to therapy and structured in twenty questions that assess disability in activities of daily living (ADL), the difficulties in practice, the feeling of general well-being, sleep, severity of symptoms, including pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety and rigidity. The questionnaire is self-administered disease-specific, and each item is based on a metric scale ranging from 0 (no disability) to 10 (maximum disability).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Fibromylgia Assessment Status (FAS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire assesses the response to therapy and the progression of the disease. Specifically it evaluates fatigue, sleep disorders and pain. The questionnaire is disease-specific, self-administered and is constituted by a &quot;pain map&quot;, called Self-Assessment Pain Scale (SAPS) characterized by a metric scale from 0 to 3 and by two numerical scales for the assessment of fatigue and sleep quality, each characterized by a metric scale between 0 and 106.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses disability. It is divided into eight domains that assess the dressing, eating, getting up, walking, hygiene, activities of achievement and activities of daily life. The questionnaire is self-administered and each item is based on a metric scale ranging from 0 (no disability) to 3 (maximum disability).</description>
