      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of iloprost compared
      with a placebo in preventing lung cancer in former smokers. Chemoprevention is the use of
      drugs to keep cancer from forming or coming back. Inhaled iloprost may help prevent lung
      cancer from forming in patients who used to smoke and who have been found to have abnormal
      cells in their mucus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of inhalational iloprost administered to cohorts of patients
      daily for 2 months, given four times a day (QID) in Cohort A followed by twice daily (BID) in
      Cohort B.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the compliance with BID or QID dosing regimens. II. To evaluate the effect on
      endobronchial histology. III. To evaluate the effect on expectorated sputum cytology by both
      standard cytologic analysis and an automated three dimensional morphologic analysis.

      IV. To evaluate the effect on endobronchial brushing and biopsy gene expression of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), glutathione S-transferase mu (GSTmu),
      carboxylesterase 1 (Ces1), Fos-related antigen 1 (FosL1), cytochrome p4502e1, stearoyl coA
      desaturase 1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member 9, transforming growth factor
      beta (TGFbeta), Jun and a 46 gene panel associated with dysplasia persistence, using
      Affymetrix arrays.

      V. To evaluate the improvement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as measured by
      arterial blood gas (ABG) (improved ventilation perfusion matching), pulmonary function
      testing, 6 minute walk distance, quality of life (St. George's respiratory questionnaire,
      COPD assessment test [CAT]).

      VI. To evaluate whether the in vitro response of cultured airway epithelial progenitor cells
      to iloprost is a predictor of in vivo response in study subjects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are enrolled to Cohort A to completion prior to initiation of Cohort B.

      COHORT A: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive iloprost via inhalation using a nebulizer QID for 60 days.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo via inhalation using a nebulizer QID for 60 days.

      COHORT B: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM III: Patients receive iloprost via inhalation using a nebulizer BID for 60 days.

      ARM IV: Patients receive placebo via inhalation using a nebulizer BID for 60 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days and then annually
      for up to 5 years.

             skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, and bladder carcinoma in situ

          -  Participants must not have received either chemotherapy or radiotherapy within the
             previous 6 months; Note: participants receiving long-term adjuvant hormonal therapy
