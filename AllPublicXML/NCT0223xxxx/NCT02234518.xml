  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal discomfort regularly affects &gt;25% of the population worldwide. One of the
      major contributors to GI discomfort is constipation, which has a prevalence of ~15% and
      symptoms of which have a significant negative impact on the sufferer's quality of life. One
      of the hallmarks of chronic constipation is slow progression of contents through the gut
      (i.e. slow gut / colonic transit time), which may be associated with hard stools that are
      difficult to expel.

      Dietary fiber supplements are widely used as a first-line treatment for constipation although
      little Level 1 evidence exists to support its use in adults. The effectiveness of different
      fiber supplements is difficult to compare given wide differences in water-retention
      capabilities and effects on the colonic microbial ecology. Given the promising, yet largely
      unsubstantiated, benefits of fiber supplementation on symptoms of functional constipation,
      the objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate tolerance and effectiveness of four week
      supplementation of a fiber product, in a dose-ranging fashion, on whole gut transit time and
      gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with functional constipation.
