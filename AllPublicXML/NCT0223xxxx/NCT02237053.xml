      1. To compare the effect of prolonged hyperglucagonemia to that of acute hyperglucagonemia
           on energy expenditure in healthy subjects using room indirect calorimetry in the setting
           of octreotide-mediated prevention of plasma insulin excursions.

        2. To compare the effects of prolonged hyperglucagonemia to acute hyperglucagonemia on EGP
           in healthy subjects in the setting of octreotide-mediated prevention of plasma insulin
           excursions.

        3. To determine the effects of prolonged hyperglucagonemia to acute hyperglucagonemia on
           rates of substrate oxidation, fibroblast growth factor21 and metabolites of interest.
