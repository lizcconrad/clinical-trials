    <textblock>
      At present, there are no established treatments for depression or anxiety in adolescents with
      cancer, creating an important clinical and research gap. Fortunately, there is now
      substantial evidence documenting the efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressed
      and anxious adolescents in the general population.

    <textblock>
      Despite the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in cancer patients, little is known
      about the efficacy of psychotherapy in depressed and anxious adolescents with cancer.

      Behavioral activation therapy (BAT) is a brief, manualized therapy that has shown efficacy in
      the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in
      several controlled trials patients, including adult cancer patients. The goal of this open
      label clinical trial is to obtain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of BAT(6 sessions) in
      a group of adolescent cancer patients with MDD, GAD or adjustment disorder with mood or
      anxiety features.

      We will test the efficacy of BAT using the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children at
      several time points of the treatment.
