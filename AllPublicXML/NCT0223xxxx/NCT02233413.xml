  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a specialized helmet that provides low
      levels of near infrared light, also known as low-level light therapy (LLLT) has any effect on
      the recovery of people who have recently (within 72h) suffered a moderate traumatic brain
      injury (TBI).

      The specific aim of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of using the LLLT helmet
      in patients with moderate TBI and to quantify the response to LLLT using magnetic resonance
      (MR) and clinical outcome measures. We hypothesize that we will be able to quantify the
      response to LLLT through MR imaging and clinical outcome measures.
