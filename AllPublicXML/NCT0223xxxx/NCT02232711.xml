  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy and ease-of-use of a simplified FilmArray
      Respiratory Panel test (FilmArray RP EZ) when performed according to the manufacturer's
      instructions by personnel in laboratories holding Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
      (CLIA) waivers (or equivalent) on nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from volunteers with
      signs and/or symptoms of a respiratory infection. The study data will be used to support an
      application to the FDA for CLIA-waived categorization of FilmArray RP EZ. It is hypothesized
      that the results of the FilmArray RP EZ test performed in a laboratory with CLIA waiver with
      be 95% accurate when compared to FilmArray RP testing performed in a lab with a moderate or
      high complexity CLIA certification.

    <description>In general, performance of the FilmArray RP EZ test in the CLIA-waived setting is expected to meet at least 95% positive and negative percent agreement with the results obtained from FilmArray RP in the moderate/high- complexity setting for each pathogen on the panel.</description>
