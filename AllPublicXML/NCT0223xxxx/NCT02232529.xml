  <brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of MIN-101 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Two-Part Study Designed to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Profile of MIN-101 and Its Main Metabolites Following Single and Multiple Dose Modified Release Prototype Formulation Administration in Healthy Cytochrome P450 2D6 Extensive Metabolizer Male and Female Subjects, and to Evaluate the Relationship Between the Pharmacokinetic Profile of MIN-101 and Its Main Metabolites and Cardiovascular Parameters.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess how MIN-101 is taken up by the body when given in different
      amounts and in different formulations. The drug will be given as a single dose in Part 1 of
      the study and during Part 2 of the study as multiple dose, once daily for 7 days. The
      ultimate aim is to find an optimal formulation which can be developed as a once daily dose
      for the treatment of schizophrenia.
