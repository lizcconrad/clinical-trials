      The purpose of this project is to assess the utility of a new magnetic resonance technique
      called magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) in the non-invasive diagnosis of normal pressure
      hydrocephalus. The investigators hypothesize that MRE produces a unique imaging signature for
      hydrocephalus that distinguishes the disease from the normal (non-hydrocephalic) but
      atrophied brain, a distinction not possible with conventional MR imaging studies that are
      presently available.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be mean shear modulus determined from pre-operative (and pre-drain placement) MRE in patients who demonstrate clinical improvement with trial CSF drainage versus patients who do not demonstrate improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-operative (and pre-drain placement) shear modulus in the experimental group will be compared with various assessments of clinical improvement after VP shunting.</measure>

    <description>Secondary outcomes will compare pre- and post-drain MRE shear moduli with ventricular size and intracranial pressure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;21;

          -  One or more of the following complaints: memory loss/dementia, urinary incontinence,
             or progressive gait disturbance

          -  Ventriculomegaly defined as temporal horn width &gt;2 mm or a FH:ID ratio&gt;30% on computed
             tomography or MRI, where FH is the maximal distance between the frontal horns and ID
             is the internal diameter from inner table to inner table of the skull at this level
             (Greenberg)

          -  A diagnosis of any adult onset hydrocephalus (NPH, post-traumatic, post-hemorrhagic,
             obstructive, or idiopathic) will be considered for enrollment in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Implanted neuro-stimulator or cardiac pacemaker

          -  Known coagulopathy; major organ dysfunction

          -  End-stage congestive heart failure

          -  Oxygen-dependent pulmonary disease, hepatic cirrhosis, or dialysis- dependent renal
             failure; or other condition which, according to the assessment of the treating surgeon
             or anesthesia team

          -  Precludes consideration of elective surgery

          -  Patients who may be pregnant will be excluded from this study as well
