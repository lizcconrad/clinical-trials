  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, patients with benign viral infections (ie: gastro enteritis and/or
      rhinopharyngitis, etc.) often receive several prescriptions from their doctors, although
      there is evidence that these medicines are not efficient.

      We hypothesize that patients could be reassured by health advices, especially if they are
      written. In addition, we believe that doctors would feel less guilty for not prescribing
      drugs if they could hand written consultation reports to patients, in these situations.

      We aim to assess the impact of handing to patients with viral gastroenteritis or upper
      respiratory tract infections, a copy of the consultation report on their medicine
      consumption.

    <textblock>
      In France, 90% of General practitioners' (GPs) consultations end with prescription of drugs
      (versus only 43,2% in Netherlands). A french medical thesis published in 2013 showed that
      drugs prescriptions were not a priority for patients. Rather than medicine's prescription,
      patients preferred attentive listening associated with personalized advices from their GPs.
      Several studies also showed that a commercial relationship exists between doctors and
      patients. The prescription is like an exchange currency against the patient money.

      We aim to assess the impact of handing to patients with viral gastroenteritis or upper
      respiratory tract infections, a copy of the consultation report on their medicine
      consumption.

    <description>We will assess the mean number of medications prescribed by the physician during the consultation.
Two independent investigators will assess, aposteriori from medical records, each prescription to determine the number of prescribed drugs (including rhino pharyngeal desobstruction). In case of discrepancy in their assessments, a third investigator will help in consensus.</description>

    <measure>Number (Proportion) of each class of prescribed drug</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the frequency of each class of medications prescribed by the physician during the consultation.
Classes will be: 1)paracetamol, 2)non steroidal anti inflammatory drug, 3)antibiotics, 4)physiological serum, 5)vasoconstrictor nasal spray, 6)oral spray, 7)cough syrup, 8)loperamide, 9)phloroglucinol, 10)antiemetic drugs, 11) antiseptic lozenges.
Two independent investigators will assess each prescription made by physicians to determine the different prescribed drugs (including rhinopharyngeal desobstruction). In case of discrepancy in their assessments, a third investigator will help in consensus.</description>

    <measure>Number (Proportion) of reconsultation</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A single investigator will recontact all included patients by telephone to assess if they reconsulted a doctor for the same motive in the period. If they cannot be contacted by phone, they will be contacted by e-mail. A second call will be done after 7 days in case they did not answer the first call.
We will compare proportion of reconsultation between the two groups.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A single investigator will recontact all included patients by telephone to assess if included patients self treated themselves using drugs they had at their disposal or using non prescription drugs. If they cannot be contacted by phone, they will be contacted by e-mail. A second call will be done after 7 days in case they did not answer the first call.
We will compare proportion of self treatment between the two groups</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number (Proportion) of adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>One investigator will assess, aposteriori from medical records, if patients reconsulted for a motive that could be associated with an aggravation of the viral infection (gastro enteritis or rhinopharyngitis).
In addition, all included patients will be recontacted by telephone (or e-mail in case they do not answer the phone) We will assess nature and number of cases.</description>
