    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators examined the subjective visual quality including LogMAR
      uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA), best corrected distance visual acuity
      (BCDVA),uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UCIVA), distance corrected intermediate
      visual acuity (DCIVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA) ,distance corrected near visual
      acuity (DCNVA),using logMAR visual acuity chart,and the objective visual quality including
      Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), Strehl ratio(SR), objective scatter index (OSI), OQAS
      value (OV),and the tear-film quality dynamics including the tear break-up time and the
      tear-film OSI between the eyes with multifocal lens and monofocal lenses by optical quality
      analysis system (OQAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 eyes of 50 cataract patients scheduled for phacoemulsification surgery were recruited, the
      multifocal group (25 eyes) ，were implantation with Tecnis® ZMB00；and the monofocal group (25
      eyes) were implantation with Tecnis® ZCB00.

      Methods: All eyes were examined by logMAR visual acuity chart and Optical quality analysis
      system (OQAS) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month,12 month after surgery for the subjective
      and objective visual quality Change during the first year.

      Measures:Subjective and objective visual quality were evaluated.Tear-film quality
      dynamicswere evaluated.

    <description>Diffractive IOLs are a type of multifocal (bifocal) IOL that are based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Specifically, a diffractive IOL has concentric rings in its posterior surface that form 2 primary focal points independent of pupil size. This optical behavior of the IOL can effectively restore far and near vision. However, it can also cause side effects, such as halos and glare and loss of contrast sensitivity.</description>
