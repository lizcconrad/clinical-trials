      Documentation of the effect of an direct or overlapping switch from another dopamine agonist
      to Sifrol® on motor function, psychopathological disturbances and mood, assessment of the
      reasons for the switch and the reasons for using Sifrol®, equivalent doses at the end of the
      switch and tolerability of Sifrol® in ambulatory patients suffering from idiopathic
      Parkinson's disease under routine conditions
