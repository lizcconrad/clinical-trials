  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends prenatal calcium supplementation for
      prevention of preeclampsia in populations with inadequate dietary intake. This study seeks to
      compare the effect of two dosing strategies on the amount of supplement ingested by pregnant
      women and adherence to related recommendations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-inferiority trial that compares the effect of a dosing strategy involving
      lower overall dose and fewer administrations per day to the current WHO recommendation. The
      comparator arm, Regimen B, prescribes 3 doses per day (consistent with current WHO standard)
      and was found to be burdensome in qualitative studies. The experimental arm, Regimen A,
      prescribes 2 doses per day and has been associated with greater satisfaction. On face value
      Regimen A should result in 33% less amount of supplement ingested than Regimen B. However, we
      hypothesize that the difference in amount ingested, when rolled out in routine practice will
      be MUCH LESS than that BECAUSE THE LOWER DOSE REGIMEN RESULTS IN HIGHER LEVELS OF ADHERENCE.
      We hypothesize that THE DIFFERENCE IN AMOUNT CONSUMED WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE OR will not exceed
      15%. Hence, we hypothesize that Regimen A is not inferior to Regimen B in terms of total
      amount of supplement ingested (within a 15% margin of inferiority).
