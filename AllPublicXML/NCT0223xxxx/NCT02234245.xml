    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to estimate the outcomes in health and cost of the follow-up
      of patients with pacemakers.

      The initial hypothesize of this study is that remote monitoring of pacemaker will show a best
      relation of outcomes in costs and effectiveness than the conventional follow-up in hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Diseases are a major cause of global morbidity and mortality, being
      responsible according to the World Health Organization of the 30% of overall mortality.

      Since 2001 that the first pacemaker of remote monitoring was implanted in Europe, more than
      300,000 pacemaker have been implanted around the world. Despite this sharp expansion, the
      scientific evidence on economic evaluations of pacemaker with remote monitoring is very
      limited, and in our knowledge, studies including informal costs have not been conducted.

      In the field of cardiology, telemedicine allows consultations with patients through
      monitoring systems and remote communication analyzing the ongoing heart rates of people with
      pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy and
      subcutaneous Holter. The use of remote monitoring may save time and efforts to both
      healthcare professionals and patients, including their informal caregivers, reducing the
      number of follow up visits to the hospital and reducing the associated costs with patient
      follow-up, which will help to improve sustainability of healthcare services.

      During the 12 months of study, the patients with implant of pacemakers of both groups will be
      assessed of the same parameters, in 4 different moments (pre-implant and months 1, 6, 12 and
      5 years post-implantation).

      The study will estimate: 1) The Clinical features of the patients. 2) The effectiveness
      through of administration of health-related quality of life, functional capacity
      questionnaires and 3) Finally, the hospital and informal costs of patients with pacemakers
      will be estimated by the researches.
