  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of whether and how
      levodopa (a common anti-Parkinson disease medication) alters postural motor learning in
      people with Parkinson disease. A secondary goal is to assess whether motor cortical
      excitability, measured via Transcranial magnetic stimulation, is related to postural motor
      learning.

      Participants with Parkinson disease will complete between 50 and 100 postural perturbations
      (via support surface translations), ON and OFF their dopamine replacement therapy (i.e.
      levodopa). Adaptation of responses to these perturbations will be tracked. Participants will
      also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation to capture cortical excitability of the brain
      (in particular the motor cortex). Cortical excitability will be correlated to adaptation of
      stepping (i.e. postural motor learning) ON and OFF levodopa. Investigators will also capture
      postural motor learning and cortical excitability in age-matched healthy adults.

      Investigators hypothesize that dopamine will have a negative effect on postural motor
      learning, and the cortical excitability will be correlated to postural motor learning.

    <measure>Cortical Excitability</measure>
    <time_frame>TMS data was collected ON and OFF medication during one visit. This visit occurred within 3 weeks of the initial postural control assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess the cortical excitability of the primary motor cortex in a subset of participants both ON and OFF levodopa. Specifically, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to stimulate the motor cortex, where we measure muscular activity of the arm (i.e. motor evoked potentials; MEPs). The primary outcome variable noted below is the lowest stimulation setting (measured as a percentage) which results in an MEP in 5 of 10 trials.</description>

        <title>Cortical Excitability</title>
        <description>Investigators will assess the cortical excitability of the primary motor cortex in a subset of participants both ON and OFF levodopa. Specifically, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to stimulate the motor cortex, where we measure muscular activity of the arm (i.e. motor evoked potentials; MEPs). The primary outcome variable noted below is the lowest stimulation setting (measured as a percentage) which results in an MEP in 5 of 10 trials.</description>
        <time_frame>TMS data was collected ON and OFF medication during one visit. This visit occurred within 3 weeks of the initial postural control assessments.</time_frame>
        <population>As noted in our protocol, TMS was assessed in a subgroup of participants with PD. Seven of the 28 PD participants and 0 of the &quot;control&quot; group (healthy adults) were assessed. PD participants were assessed ON and OFF levodopa. We chose this approach because 1) this aim was exploratory in nature, and 2) MEPs of healthy adults are well characterized.</population>
