  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase II study of BBI503 administered to adult patients
      with advanced hepatobiliary cancer who have exhausted all currently approved standard
      anti-cancer treatment options. BBI503 will be administered orally, daily, in continuous
      28-day cycles at a dose of 300 mg once daily. Cycles will be repeated until patients are no
      longer clinically benefiting from therapy.

      Safety, efficacy and tolerability of BBI503 will be assessed for the duration of study
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             have received standard of care treatment prior to enrollment.

          -  ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Must have received prior treatment with sorafenib; and have had either disease
             progression during treatment or have had documented intolerance to sorafenib such that
             further treatment with sorafenib is not possible.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled massive ascites or presence of hepatic encephalopathy
             within four (4) weeks of first dose are excluded

          -  A patient with confirmed cholangiocarcinoma of any type must also meet the following

             7 days since last receiving anti-cancer treatment, and that all prior
             treatment-related adverse events (AEs) have resolved or have been deemed irreversible.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose (requiring general anesthesia and/or
             inpatient hospitalization for recovery).

             pulmonary disease (shortness of breath at rest or mild exertion), uncontrolled
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with

          -  Abnormal ECGs which are clinically significant such as QT prolongation - QTc &gt; 480
             msec, clinically significant cardiac enlargement or hypertrophy, new bundle branch
