  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life limiting illness. Median predicted UK survival is 41.4 years
      (UK CF Registry 2011). The commonest cause of death is respiratory failure.

      Non invasive ventilation (NIV) is a system which delivers a preset pressure to supplement the
      size and depth of each breath. It is introduced in CF to manage established respiratory
      failure. A nose or a mask which covers both the nose and mouth allows flexible ventilation,
      is used just at night, or for part of the day in addition or for 24 hours as clinical status
      indicates. It is introduced within a normal ward environment and then continued longterm at
      home.Once respiratory failure is established longterm noninvasive ventilation is introduced
      throughout 24 hours and multidisciplinary assessment concludes that the timing is appropriate
      for the individual.

      This study aims to evaluate a potential development of current practice: the use of non
      invasive ventilation during hospital admission only to enhance recovery from an acute
      exacerbation which has caused respiratory failure in those individuals where long term non
      invasive ventilation is not yet indicated. A mixed methods design will allow description of
      the experience of noninvasive ventilation during a semistructured interview to add to
      understanding of the results from an experiment designed to measure the differences between
      noninvasive ventilation and standard care.

      Aim: To compare the clinical efficacy with the patient experience of NIV on recovery from an
      acute respiratory exacerbation complicated by respiratory failure in adult Cystic Fibrosis.

      Design: The study will use a mixed methodology and it will be in 2 phases. Phase I A group
      randomised controlled trial

      The following measurements will be performed on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14 and twice weekly until
      discharge:

      The exact timing of measurements will be planned by the participant and the researcher.

      All of the outcome measures form part of routine clinical practice except the symptom scoreÍ¾
      the Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptoms Diary (CFRSD V2.0) (Goss et al., 2009)

        1. Early morning and day time carbon dioxide (CO2) level.

        2. Day time oxygen levels

        3. Lung function Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity
           (FVC)

        4. Day time resting Respiratory Rate (RR), Heart Rate (HR)

        5. Symptom score CFRSD

      Phase II A qualitative exploration of the experience of using NIV for adults with Cystic
      Fibrosis during an acute exacerbation

      Methods: Prior to discharge a semistructured interview designed to explore the experience of
      using noninvasive ventilation will be undertaken by a clinical psychologist from the Cystic
      Fibrosis multidisciplinary team. The interviews will be undertaken purely for the research
      project, recorded and transcribed verbatim by the lead investigator. Thematic analysis will
      be undertaken to interpret and explore the individual's experience. Credibility checking of
      interpretation will be undertaken by the clinical psychologists and within academic
      supervision sessions.
