      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that more than 50% of the patients receiving
      enteric contrast material (ECM) &lt; 2 hours of anesthesia/sedation would have residual gastric
      fluid volume (GFV) &gt; 0.4 ml/kg. The investigators also hypothesize that measuring GFV by
      using region of interest in the CT technique is accurate compared to blind aspiration of the
      gastric contents with a syringe and a multi-orificed orogastric tube.

      The purpose of our study is to examine the residual gastric fluid volume when oral contrast
      is administered within 2 hours of anesthesia /sedation and to validate the accuracy of
      measuring the residual gastric volume by using region of interest in the CT image by using
      blind aspiration of the gastric contents with a syringe and a multi-orificed orogastric tube.
