  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ideally, the postoperative inflammatory response is part of a well-orchestrated mechanism
      that contributes to tissue healing and rapid recovery. An exaggerated uncontrolled
      inflammatory response, however may lead to catabolism, tissue damage and organ failure.
      Omega-3 fatty acids may provide a means to alter cellular immune responses to the benefit of
      the patient. When omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated into membranes of inflammatory cells,
      they trigger intracellular signalling pathways that result in a less pro-inflammatory
      response. They modify gene and protein expression, modulate membrane protein activity and act
      as a reservoir for bioactive molecules. They also have a strong anti-inflammatory effect by
      mediating resolution of the inflammation. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids improve
      erythrocyte function, which is vital for an adequate microcirculation, tissue oxygenation and
      wound healing.

      The investigators hypothesize that the perioperative administration of intravenous omega-3
      fatty acids results in a rapid incorporation in immune cells and erythrocytes, thereby
      reducing the postoperative inflammatory response and improving erythrocyte function in
      patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
