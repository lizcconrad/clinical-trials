  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As in the general population, there is a gradual and steady increase in life expectancy of
      patients with schizophrenia. But this increase is at a smaller scale, with a rate of
      premature death that is still 2 to 3 times higher than that found in the general population.
      This excessive early mortality is explained by an overrepresentation of suicide deaths, but
      also a higher prevalence of somatic diseases, mainly cardiovascular. But today there are only
      very few epidemiological data on the mortality of patients with schizophrenia, including
      those aged over 60 years. What are the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics
      (psychiatric and somatic) of these schizophrenic elderly patients? Do they benefit from a
      somatic follow-up adequate and systematic? What are their levels of social independence and
      of quality of life? the answers these questions and the description of the offer of geriatric
      care and of psychiatric care currently provided by different sectors of psychiatry in France
      is an indispensable prerequisite for any project to improve the quality of life, state of
      health and mortality of older patients with schizophrenia.

      Evaluate prospectively over 5 years, the rates and causes of mortality in a cohort of
      schizophrenic patients older than 60 years, followed by adult psychiatry sectors, compared to
      those patients matched for sex and age and monitored by the same sectors for a chronic
      psychiatric disorder other than schizophrenia
