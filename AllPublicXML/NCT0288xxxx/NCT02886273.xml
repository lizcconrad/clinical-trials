      Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for approximately 15 percent of the total mortality in
      industrialized countries, and most commonly results from cardiac arrest due to ventricular
      fibrillation (VF). VF can appear both with identifiable heart disease and as an idiopathic
      arrhythmia. The most commonly underlying heart disease associated with out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) is coronary artery disease (CAD).

      In this study the investigators intend to give a thorough description of the study population
      based on demographic data, clinical information, medical history and biochemical parameters.
      The investigators plan to assess the total number of OHCA cases among patients reported to
      the ambulance service in the local region during the study period, and determine the
      proportion with documented VF. Next the investigators need to evaluate the clinical baseline
      profile of those included in the study as compared to that of the total VF population. High
      sensitivity cardiac Troponin T cTnT) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) will be added to the
      baseline data for further classification of the included SCA patients.

      The main aim of the study will be to evaluate the diagnostic value of copeptin in the setting
      of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).

      As a second aim the investigators intend to evaluate the association between VF and the
      content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in red blood cells.

      Furthermore, as vitamin D is associated with n-3 fatty polyunsaturated acids (n-3 PUFAs) in
      the diet, the third aim will be to assess the association between 25-hydroxy (OH)-vitamin D
      and VF. Matched MI patients will be selected for comparison.

      Background:

      Sudden cardiac death (SCD), also termed sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), accounts for
      approximately 15 percent of the total mortality in industrialized countries, and most
      commonly results from cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). VF can appear both
      with identifiable heart disease and as an idiopathic arrhythmia. The most commonly underlying
      heart disease associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is coronary artery
      disease (CAD). The proportion of OHCA-patients with CAD varies with age. Autopsy studies of
      subjects under the age of 45 with a presumed diagnosis of SCD have revealed 10-15 percent
      without any demonstrable cardiac abnormality (1-3). A lower value of about 5 percent is
      obtained when older patients are included (4). SCD is the initial presentation of CAD in 15
      percent of CAD-patients (5). Furthermore it is also the most frequent mechanism of death in
      patients with known CAD, accounting for 40-50 percent of CAD-mortality (6). Compared to
      healthy subjects the incidence of SCD is six- to tenfold higher in the presence of clinically
      recognized heart disease, increases with age and is two to three times as common in men as in
      women (7).

      SCD due to VF may appear as the initial presentation of an episode of myocardial ischemia for
      both patients with and without known CAD. High-sensitivity cardiac Troponin T (hs-cTnT) is
      the most commonly used marker of myocardial necrosis. Despite increased sensitivity of
      cardiac troponins (cTn) at an early diagnostic stage with the introduction of hs-cTNT assays,
      there remains a troponin-blind period very early after symptom onset. Cardiac pulmonary
      resuscitation itself may also lead to a slight elevation of cardiac markers, including cTn
      (8). This makes it difficult to use hs-cTNT alone for the diagnosis of acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI) among patients with OHCA.

      Copeptin, the C-terminal moiety of provasopressin, is co-secreted with vasopressin. Lately,
      circulating copeptin levels have been demonstrated to be significantly elevated during the
      initial acute phase in patients with AMI (9). Its concentration seems to rise immediately
      after symptom onset and decreases rapidly thereafter. Copeptin may therefore improve early
      diagnosis of AMI (10-13) and help to differentiate the underlying cause of SCD.

      When emergency care systems provide early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation,
      approximately 50 percent of out-of-hospital VF patients survive to hospital admission and 25
      percent survive to leave the hospital (2, 14). These dramatic consequences make it most
      important to identify risk factors and also form the rationale for primary prevention.

      Most interventions to date do not directly affect the transient pathophysiologic event
      initializing potentially fatal arrhythmias. Instead, they attempt to alter and prevent
      underlying disease like CAD. Animal studies have shown that fish oils are protective against
      ischemia-induced VF (15). Support for these data comes from the Physicians`Health Study (16),
      which is a prospective study of 20 551 men aged 40 to 84, free of cardiovascular disease at
      baseline, with a follow-up period of 11 years. As compared to consumption of fish less than
      once a month, fish intake at least once per week was associated with a reduced risk of SCD
      (RR 0.48). In the same study there was no reduction in the risk of total myocardial
      infarction, non-sudden cardiac death or total cardiovascular mortality, and the protective
      effect of fish was suggested to be due to a reduction in fatal ventricular arrhythmias. It
      has been hypothesized that the lower risk of SCD with higher fish intake may be related to
      the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) EPA and DHA found in fish. Consistent
      with this hypothesis are the observations from the Physicians`Health Study that the risk of
      SCD was significantly lower in subjects with blood n-3 FA levels in the highest as compared
      to the lowest quartile. The same potential effect of fish oils to protect against SCD was
      illustrated in the randomized, open-controlled GISSI-prevention study of 11 324 patients with
      a recent myocardial infarction (17). Patients receiving n-3 FAs supplements had a significant
      lower incidence in the combined endpoint of death plus nonfatal infarction and nonfatal
      stroke at 42 months (12.6 versus 13.9%). After adjustment for risk factors, all of the
      observed benefit was due to a 20 % reduction in the risk of death, mostly due to reduction in
      SCD. However, a study of 200 patients secured with an ICD (implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator) following an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or VF, has not shown a
      reduction in the recurrence of these arrhythmias after supplementation with EPA/DHA. In that
      study there was actually a trend toward a higher incidence of VT/VF in patients randomized to
      EPA/ DHA substitution (18). In that setting the underlying mechanism for the generation of VF
      might, however, not be ischemic.

      The exact mechanism by which FAs might protect against serious cardiac arrhythmias is not
      known. The investigators do know that they are important constituents of cell membranes and
      may affect several electrophysiologic properties, such as resting potential, action
      potential, repolarization and refractory period. Alterations in cellular calcium
      concentration can contribute significantly to changes in both impulse generation and impulse
      conduction in myocardial cells. Incorporation of n-3 fatty acids in the cellular membrane is
      shown to affect membrane fluidity which in turn may have an influence on calcium entry or
      removal. An alternative mechanism may be changes effected by n-3 FAs on myocardial production
      of eicosanoids. In particular the inhibition of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production is likely to
      be of significant pathophysiological benefit, since TXA2 is shown to be implicated in
      myocardial ischemia and arrhythmogenesis (19).

      Over the last years vitamin D is another dietary supplement found to be associated with
      cardiovascular disease. This fat-soluble vitamin, primarily derived from sun-exposure and
      fatty fish, has been demonstrated to influence cardiac contractility and myocardial calcium
      homeostasis (20), and insufficiency of this vitamin may have deleterious effects on cardiac
      autonomic functions as evaluated by heart rate turbulence and heart rate variability (21). In
      prospective studies, severe vitamin D deficiency has been strongly associated with total
      mortality, cardiovascular events and SCD (22 - 26). In one study of 3299 Caucasian patients
      who were routinely referred to coronary angiography, the authors could demonstrate hazard
      ratios for death due to heart failure and for SCD of 2.84 (1.20-6.74) and 5.05 (2.13-11.97),
      respectively, when comparing patients with severe vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D &lt;25
      nmol/liter)] with persons in the optimal range [25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/liter] (27). Demonstrated
      effects on electrophysiology, contractility, and cardiac structure suggest that vitamin D
      deficiency might actually be a causal factor for development of cardiac diseases. The
      pronounced effect on SCD found in several studies might be an indication of a possible
      protective effect of high vitamin D-levels against ventricular arrhythmias. This is, however,
      not well studied and the optimal cut-off-value for protection is not well defined.

      A recent study by William S. Harris et al (28) has shown that levels of EPA/ DHA in cell
      membranes of red blood cells (RBC EPA/ DHA) highly correlate with the cardiac EPA/ DHA level.
      The RBC response to supplementation was also very similar to that observed in the heart.
      Therefore RBC EPA+ DHA may serve as a useful surrogate of cardiac omega-3 fatty acid status.
      The investigators expect n-3 FAs to exert a membrane stabilizing effect during an ischemic
      episode, and hypothesize that patients suffering VF during the initial phase of their first
      AMI presentation have lower levels of RBC EPA/ DHA than matched controls.

      As compared to the suggested pro-arrhythmic effects of n-3 FAs during ischemia, vitamin D
      deficiency may act differently in this respect. This is supported by the finding of an
      increased risk of SCA in patients with low vitamin D levels; including those with both
      established cardiac disease (25, 27) and in those with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (21), but
      also in an otherwise healthy population (23). Therefore, a comparison of the 25-OH-vitamin D
      levels between different OHCA categories of patients, with and without an acute coronary
      event, may be appropriate.

      Aims of the study

      In this study the investigators intend to give a thorough description of the study population
      based on demographic data, clinical information, medical history and biochemical parameters.
      The investigators plan to assess the total number of regional OHCA cases among patients
      reported to the ambulance service during the study period, and determine the proportion of
      cardiac subjects with documented VF. Next the clinical baseline profile of subjects included
      in the study will be compared to the total cardiac VF population. Hs-cTNT and BNP will be
      added to the baseline data for further classification of the included SCA patients.

        1. The main aim of the study will be to evaluate the diagnostic value of copeptin in the
           setting of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).

        2. As a second aim the investigators intend to evaluate the association between VF and the
           content of EPA and DHA in red blood cells.

        3. Furthermore, as vitamin D is associated with n-3 PUFAs in the diet, the third aim will
           be to assess the association between 25-hydroxy (OH)-vitamin D and VF.

        4. Finally the investigators intend to analyse the survival rate in cardiac patients with
           OHCA and documented ventricular fibrillation..

      Inclusion/exclusion/classification/controls

      Eligibility for this study is based on 1) age &gt; 18 years, 2) SCD with VF, 3) signed informed
      consent from the patient (if conscious at admission) or by his/her family.

      Exclusion criteria consist of 1) SCD with primary asystole, 2) evidence of non-cardiac death
      (including cerebral haemorrhage/ infarction and pulmonary embolism) and 3) sudden death due
      to cardiac tamponade.

      All blood samples taken at inclusion will be immediately centrifuged and stored in aliquots
      at - 70 o C until the measurements can be performed. Laboratory technicians will be blinded
      with respect to clinical data.

      Patient groups will be defined according to:

        1. SCA with MI

             1. First MI

             2. Recurrent MI

                2. SCA without MI

             1. No former heart disease

             2. Known heart disease

      Copeptin, EPA/ DHA and vitamin D in the different clinical patient categories will be
      compared to controls collected from the RACS (Risk markers in the Acute Coronary Syndromes)
      database (NCT00521976).

      Statistical methods

      Statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical package SPSS (Statistical
      Package for the Social Sciences). A statistically significant level of p &lt; 0.05 will be
      applied for all tests.

      Ethics and confidentiality

      The present study is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and later
      revisions and accepted by the Regional Board of Research Ethics as well as the Norwegian
      Health Authorities. Analytic data will be related to patient number and not to patient
      identity. According to Norwegian regulations, the family of non-survivors will be informed by
      the attending physician and the inclusion of patients needs to be documented in the hospital
      records. The family of the deceased is entitled to object to the use of any biological
      samples for research purposes. Patients regaining consciousness and mental capability during
      their hospital stay will be asked personally for a written informed consent. For the
      remaining survivors the next of kin will be asked for permission on behalf of the patient. If
      either the patient or the family refuses participation, blood samples already collected at
      resuscitation and admission will be destroyed.
