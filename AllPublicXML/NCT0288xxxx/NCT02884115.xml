  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A continuing challenge to determining the response to treatment of early syphilis (primary,
      secondary, early latent syphilis) is exemplified by the substantial proportion of patients
      who fail to achieve serological cure and remain serofast. Although retreatment is often done
      in clinical practice, optimal management remains uncertain due to the paucity of data
      regarding serological response to retreatment and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, the
      investigators cannot rule out that the gradually increasing seroreversion/serological cure
      rates may have been due to the natural decline in rapid plasma regain (RPR) titers after
      initial therapy, rather than due to the additional dose of benzathine penicillin. Thus, the
      investigators would like to conduct a clinical trial to compare the serological response
      rates of serofast early syphilis cases retreated with three doses benzathine penicillin and
      absence of any retreatment (control group).
