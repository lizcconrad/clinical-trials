  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCTe) is the most frequent cause of shoulder pain,
      resulting in considerable losses to society and public resources. Muscle imbalance and
      inadequate sensorimotor control are deficits often associated with RCTe. Kinesiotaping (KT)
      is widely used by clinicians for rehabilitation of RCTe. While previous studies have examined
      the immediate effects of KT on shoulder injuries or the effects of KT as an isolated method
      of treatment, no published study has addressed its mid- and long-term effects when combined
      to a rehabilitation program for patients with RCTe. The primary objective of this randomised
      controlled trial (RCT) will be to assess the efficacy of therapeutic KT, added to a
      rehabilitation program, in reducing pain and disabilities in individuals with RCTe. Secondary
      objectives will look at the effects of KT on the underlying factors involved in shoulder
      control, such as muscular activity, acromiohumeral distance (AHD), and range of motion (ROM).

      Methods and analysis: A single-blind RCT will be conducted. Fifty-two participants, randomly
      allocated to one of two groups (KT or no-KT), will take part in a 6-week rehabilitation
      program. The KT-group will receive KT added to the rehabilitation program, whereas the no-KT
      group will receive only the rehabilitation program. Measurements will be taken at baseline,
      week-3, week-6, week-12 and 6-month. Primary outcomes will be symptoms and functional
      limitations assessed by the DASH questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will include shoulder ROM,
      AHD at rest and at 60º of abduction, and muscle activation during arm elevation. The added
      effects of KT will be assessed through a 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures.

      Discussion: Investigations with a high level of evidence are needed to determine scientific
      evidence-based concerning the efficacy of KT for the rehabilitation of individuals with RCTe.
      This RCT will be the first to assess the effectiveness of KT added into a conventional RP for
      patients with RCTe, addressing underlying factors that could explain the possible benefits of
      this method, in a mid- and long-term. Results may contribute to build solid evidence on the
      addition of KT in a physiotherapy intervention for this population.

      Ethics and Dissemination: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Quebec
      Rehabilitation Institute (IRDPQ) of the CIUSS-CN. Results of this protocol will be
      disseminated through international publications in peer-reviewed journals, in addition to
      international conference presentations.

    <description>Functional limitations will be measured throughout treatment using &quot;The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH)&quot;.
The DASH is a 30-item self-report questionnaire, designed to measure physical disability and symptoms of upper limbs disorders. A validated Canadian-French version will be used (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.93; standardized response mean (SRM)=1.35; minimal detectable change (MDC)=11.4 points; clinically important difference (CID)=10 points)</description>

    <description>Since DASH has few questions related to pain, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), which is specific for assessing clinical pain, will also be added to assess changes during treatment.
The BPI measures pain intensity on an 11-point numerical rating scale (0-10), according to it interference with sleep, mood, etc., during the last 24 hours (ICC &gt;0.80). Only the 4 first questions, related to clinical pain, will be used.</description>

    <description>Because DASH is non-specific for shoulder, the &quot;Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC)&quot; index will be added to assess changes at shoulder disabilities throughout treatment.
The WORC is a reliable and responsive (ICC=0.96; SRM=1.54; MDC=12 points; CID=13 points) questionnaire designed to measure health-related-quality-of-life of patients affected by RC injuries.</description>
