      This study aims to:

        1. describe the monitoring of patients treated for spinal disorders.

        2. create a comprehensive database of reliable and readily exploitable quickly to produce a
           library of cross publications between orthopedic surgery and neurosurgical services.
           This database will include clinical, functional , radiographic , educational, social and
           professional data.

        3. obtain a cohort of patients in the comprehensive range of spinal pathologies.

        4. standardize data collection in this cohort with similar national projects.
