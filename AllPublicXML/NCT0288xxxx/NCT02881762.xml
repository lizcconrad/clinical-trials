    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, longitudinal, open-label, interventional study for evaluating the
      effect of maraviroc on hepatitis C viral levels in patients infected with both hepatitis C
      and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and taking antiretroviral therapy for HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, in-vitro studies (experiments performed in a laboratory, not on a person) have
      demonstrated that maraviroc, a medication that is used in human immunodeficiency (HIV)
      therapy, appears to have significant hepatitis C antiviral effect, comparable to sofosbuvir-a
      potent anti-hepatitis C medication. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the
      antiviral effect of maraviroc on hepatitis C virus in people infected with both hepatitis C
      and HIV, and whom have never been treated for hepatitis with direct antiviral agents.
      Participants will take maraviroc for 4 weeks in addition to their regular HIV antiretrovirals
      (ART). The investigators will measure the hepatitis C viral load before, during, and after
      the 4-week maraviroc time.

    <measure>The change in hepatitis C viral load from baseline to end of maraviroc treatment, and end of study (weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16) in people infected with both human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C with addition of maraviroc</measure>
    <time_frame>12 to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maraviroc will be added to existing human immunodeficiency virus anti-retroviral regimens among participants infected with both hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus. Hepatitis C viral loads will be measured at the above time points. For participants randomized to immediate start of maraviroc, maraviroc treatment will occur from day 0 to week 4, and the last viral load will be on week 12 (no week 16 tests). Participants randomized to the delayed start group will receive maraviroc treatment from week 8 to week 12, and therefore hepatitis C viral load will be measured at baseline and week 4 of study participation (prior to maraviroc treatment) and the last hepatitis C viral load test will occur at week 16 of the study (4 weeks after completing maraviroc treatment).</description>

    <description>Maraviroc will be added to existing human immunodeficiency virus anti-retroviral regimens among participants infected with both hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus.
