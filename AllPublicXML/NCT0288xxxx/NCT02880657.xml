  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of a 10 weeks SODB® supplementation
      in physical condition improvements of healthy subjects, in comparison to a placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beneficial experimental results have already been obtained with SODB®. That is why, the
      investigators expect several effects of SODB® here. Indeed, this clinical study could show
      that SODB® is able to improve physical conditions, and particularly at muscular and cardiac
      levels, by inducing a decrease in oxidative stress.
