  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers are defined as wounds lasting for more than a month. They would receive 0.2% of
      the population of Western countries. In Europe, the cost per episode of leg ulcers is
      estimated at 6650 euros (10 000 euros for a foot ulcer). The cost of treatment of wounds
      would be 2 to 4% of the health budget. Infection is the most common complication of chronic
      wounds: in most cases, it results in delayed healing, at most, it can result in amputation or
      serious general complications Bacterial contamination of ulcers is constant. Over time for
      over 25 years, various studies have shown about relatively identical results. The bacteria
      are present in over 90% of the etiology of venous leg ulcers. These bacteria are divided into
      four most common classes: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas.
      The bacterial ecology changes over time. Indeed Staphylococcus aureus appears first, while
      the Pseudomonas is associated with ulcers lasting for several months. Anaerobic more
      difficult to find, are found in 30% of cases Cohabitation between leg ulcers and bacteria
      often without clinical consequence: These are the stages of infection and colonization.

      The infection is related to the proliferation of bacteria and their invasion into the skin,
      by increasing their virulence (virulence genes acquisition). The increase in the number of
      bacteria and the multiplicity of bacterial genera are one reason for the increased virulence
      of bacteria. When bacteria proliferate, because the host defenses are inadequate, or because
      there is a vascular disease which promotes the proliferation, clinical signs appear

      RESEARCH PROJECT Vascular medicine at St Joseph, the management of chronic wounds concerns
      80% of hospitalized patients, more than 1,000 patients per year. The reason for
      hospitalization of these patients outside of revascularization gestures, often performing a
      skin graft. The existence of an infection of the ulcer on arrival in the service is not a
      cons-indication for transplant, but will delay it until the signs of infection are brought
      under control. This scenario is common. The Medical Information department on six months,
      noted over 100 patients coded &quot;leg ulcers&quot; principal diagnosis and &quot;soft tissue infections&quot;
      secondary diagnosis.

      The importance of this recruitment and the lack of recommendations for the management of
      these patients justifies the completion of a clinical and microbiological work Until recent
      months, at the request of Microbiology, bacteriological referred to biopsy was performed
      first line when suspected of being infected ulcer. After reading the literature, and because
      of the invasive nature of this gesture, the evaluation of biopsy compared to the swab in a
      large patient population seems to necessary to the investigators

      The proposed work is randomized blinded for microbiological and observational part for the
      clinical part, on a prospective series of consecutive carriers of infected leg ulcer
      patients, regardless of the etiology of leg ulcers, excluding dermohypodermitis complicating
      acute bacterial leg ulcers, with several objectives:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE Demonstrate the non-inferiority of the swab compared to biopsy in the
      management of patients hospitalized for infected leg ulcer

      two situations

        1. If graft Primary endpoint: time in days between the beginning of hospitalization and the
           day the transplant can be performed. Indeed, the transplants are performed when the
           doctor determines that the infection is under control

        2. If the patient is not grafted:

      Primary endpoint: time between the beginning of hospitalization and the end of the ideal
      hospitalization (when the clinician believes that the patient can get out)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES and CRITERIA healing rate of patients at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
      bacteriological agreement: between the swab and biopsy Comparing the interest of biopsy
      compared to the swab: percentage of patients for whom the unblinding was necessary and where
      the biopsy was more informative than the swab (different bacteria require special treatment)
      .

      levies failure rate when the sample is sterile while the ulcer is infected clinically. The
      collection of demographic, etiological, nutritional profile, and the collection of various
      local signs can provide indicators of response to the proposed strategy. This type of study
      has never been done in the population of leg ulcers.
