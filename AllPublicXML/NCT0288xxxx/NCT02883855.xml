  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to determinate if there is a correlation between visual acuity gain in
      patients who underwent a Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK)
      corneal keratoplasty and the central thickness of the graft.

      Were included in this study eyes who underwent a DSAEK for endothelial dysfunctions
      indication (mainly acquired after phacoemulsification or for Fuchs dystrophy) between early
      2012 and mid 2015 at CHR Metz-Thionville (Mercy Hospital) Were excluded eyes presenting
      pathologies (e.g. Age-Related Macular Degeneration, or diabetic macular edema) which are
      known to induce visual acuity decrease, non-related to the success of the graft and graft
      failure cases. Central graft thickness was measured in Anterior Segment Optical Coherence
      Topography (AS-OCT RS-3000 Nidek). Visual acuity gain was defined by the differential between
      pre-operative visual acuity (VA) and post operative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
      obtained during post-operative visits.
