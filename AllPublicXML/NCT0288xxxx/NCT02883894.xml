  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid is the most common subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease of the skin
      in European countries, including France.

      Immunologically, BP is characterized by the production of autoantibodies directed against two
      major components of the hemidesmosome, BP180 and BP230.

      The anti-BP180 autoantibody is detected in 79-93% of cases of bullous pemphigoid and its
      serum level at diagnosis have been correlated with disease activity. The anti-BP230
      autoantibody is detected in 57%-63% of bullous pemphigoid cases and its score at diagnosis
      did not correlate with disease activity.

      Up to now, no clinical or immunologic factors have been identified to predict outcome of
      patients with good or poor prognosis bullous pemphigoid as defined by long complete remission
      off therapy and recurrent disease requiring maintenance therapy for years. The usefulness of
      BP180 or BP230 ELISA scores for monitoring BP patients during treatment also remains unclear.

      Aim of the study were :

      To study association between the serum level of cytokines (IL-17 and IL-23) and of the
      protease MMP-9 and the relapse of bullous pemphigoid.
