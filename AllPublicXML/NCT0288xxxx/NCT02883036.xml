    <textblock>
      Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm companies with the BCR-ABL
      fusion gene encoded by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The BCR-ABL fusion protein(the
      formation of the chimeric gene BCR/ABL on chromosome 22 and a reciprocal ABL/BCR on
      chromosome 9,it has no expanded name) plays key role on CML leukemogenesis by activating its
      downstream signaling pathway of survival and proliferation. Imatinib, a targeted competitive
      inhibitor of a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, changed the clinical treatment and prognosis of CML.
      As its optimized generation, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib and nilotinib
      have more potent anti-leukemic activity and less side-effect. However, acquired resistance to
      TKIs is one of the main obstacles to effective CML treatment and is involved in gene
      amplication of ABL tyrosine kinase point mutations. The outcomes of patients with these ABL
      tyrosine kinase point mutations have linked to worse prognosis and higher mortality
      generally. Metabolic adaptations are common in cancer cells, and cancer cells become more
      dependent on mitochondrial biogenesis. Tigecycline, as a broad-spectrum antibiotics, inhibits
      mitochondrial biogenesis as its an interesting &quot;side-effect&quot;.In recent study,researchers
      indicated that tigecycline can eradicate cancer stem cells by targeting mitochondrial.Here,
      the investigators test tigecycline's anti-leukemic activity to chronic myeloid leukemia in
      vitro.

      In this study, the investigators collected bone marrow(BM) or/and peripheral blood(PB)
      mononuclear cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.Patients could be in different
      stages of chronic myeloid leukemia pre-treatment.Additionally, the investigators also
      selected some healthy volunteers as comparison.Firstly, the investigators analyzed
      mitochondrial biogenesis and basal metabolic characteristic of mononuclear cells from
      patients and healthy volunteers.Secondly, the investigators tested the cell viability and
      apoptosis after tigecycline treatment.Thirdly,the investigators detected the changes of cell
      mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic characteristic in the same study sample after
      tigecycline stimulation. Finally,the investigators analyzed the correlation between
      sensitivities of mononuclear cells to tigecycline and patients' clinical parameters and
      survival outcome.
