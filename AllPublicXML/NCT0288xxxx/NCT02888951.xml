      This study evaluates the amount of fluid remaining in the stomach of diabetic patients after
      a standard fasting period, and compare it with non-diabetic patients coming for elective
      surgical procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any surgical procedure carries an inherent risk of pulmonary aspiration. Food or liquid from
      the stomach might be forced back up the throat from where it could enter the lungs
      (aspiration) resulting in serious complications prolonging the hospital stay or in extreme
      circumstances death.

      The risk of this is slightly higher in diabetics when compared to non-diabetics as the
      emptying of contents from the stomach is slightly delayed. This is why people going for
      surgery are asked not to eat for a specific time before their surgery. Anesthesiologists have
      recently developed an ultrasound test to determine if there is content in a patient's stomach
      and how much. This test involves an ultrasound examination of the abdomen and taking some
      measurements on the ultrasound screen.

      This study aims to evaluate the amount of fluid remaining in the stomach of diabetic patients
      after a standard fasting period, and compare it with non-diabetic patients coming for
      elective surgical procedures. The investigators also aim to find an association between the
      type and duration of diabetes mellitus with residual gastric volume. Episodes of
      intra-operative regurgitation, vomiting or aspiration will also be documented.

    <description>A &quot;full stomach&quot; is defined as one containing a) solid or thick fluid content or b) &gt; 1.5 mL/kg of clear fluid.
There are 4 categories regarding gastric contents:
Empty Stomach
Grade 1 Clear Fluid (fluid only observed in supine or right lateral decubitus position)
Grade 2 Clear Fluid (fluid only observed in both supine and right lateral decubitus position)
Solid</description>

        Study participants will be patients whom are scheduled to undergo elective surgical
        procedures requiring preoperative fasting period of at least 8 hours. 260 patients will be
        recruited in total. One cohort consisting 130 patients will be diabetic (type 1 or 2). The
        other cohort consisting of 130 patients will be non-diabetic.
