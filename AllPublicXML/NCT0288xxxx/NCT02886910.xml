  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the non-inferiority of a protocol of limited evaluation (complete blood
      count, blood culture) and clinical observation by standardized physical examination versus
      the algorithm suggested in the CDC's 2010 guidelines (limited evaluation, clinical
      observation and antibiotic therapy) in the management of asymptomatic infants born at term to
      mothers with suspected chorioamnionitis. The primary outcome of the study is the difference
      in the prevalence of sepsis-related symptoms between the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chorioamnionitis complicates 1-3% of pregnancies at term. The current international
      guidelines of the Center for Disease Control (CDC 2010) recommend that all asymptomatic
      newborns born to mothers with suspected chorioamnionitis undergo limited evaluation (i.e.
      blood culture at birth and complete blood count) and antibiotic therapy until the blood
      culture result is available.

      However, the prevalence of positive blood cultures in infants born to mothers with suspected
      chorioamnionitis is low, approximately 1%, including also infants requiring intensive care.
      This prevalence is even lower in asymptomatic infants. Moreover, the efficacy of antibiotic
      prophylaxis in preventing early sepsis, death or long-term sequelae in asymptomatic infants
      born to mothers with suspected chorioamnionitis has not been demonstrated.

      Early antibiotic use has been related to obesity and to the modification of microbiota.
      Limiting antibiotic use may prevent the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

      Clinical observation is a reliable method to recognize infants with sepsis.

The following signs and symptoms are checked: skin colour (pink/pale/cyanotic/mottled), respiratory rate (lower or higher than 60 breaths/minute) and presence or absence of respiratory distress.</description>
