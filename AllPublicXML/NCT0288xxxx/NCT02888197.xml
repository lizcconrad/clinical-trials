      Non-interventional extension study to investigate VVC recurrence and candida colonization
      following the P2 acute VVC study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following completion of the Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled study of the
      safety and tolerability of two formulations of CD101 compared to fluconazole for the
      treatment of moderate to severe episodes of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (NCT07299432),
      subjects without a recurrence of VVC will be followed up to an additional 90 days +/- 14 days
      to assess candida colonization and recurrence of VVC.
