    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a clinical database of patients presenting with vulvar complaints
      in order to comprehensively assess the presentation and current trends in management of
      vulvar disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvar disorders are common, but their frequency and importance are often under-recognized.
      The spectrum of vulvar disease is vast and includes congenital malformations, inflammatory
      mucocutaneous diseases, blistering and erosive diseases, benign and malignant tumors,
      autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and various idiopathic conditions. Evaluation and
      management of genital complaints and dermatoses are complicated by the frequent
      multifactorial nature of vulvar symptoms and variable clinical expressions of disease on the
      vulva. In many cases, empiric treatment is instituted in the absence of a definitive
      diagnosis. Of note, expertise in the diagnosis and management of vulvar disorders is often
      lacking on the parts of gynecology, dermatology and primary care physicians.

      The investigators seek to analyze the data on this patient population at Northwestern
      Memorial Hospital (NMH) and the outpatient clinics of the Northwestern Memorial Faculty
      Foundation (NMFF) to better define the clinical spectrum of vulvar disease. The investigators
      will also assess approaches to the diagnosis and management of patients with vulvar disease
      with attention given to clinical outcome and the impact on quality of life. This information
      with help the investigators to better understand the scope of care these patients currently
      receive, to identify deficits in current practice, and to advance potential new standards of
      care.
