  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study investigating whether identification, ligation, and burial of
      superficial branches of the saphenous nerve crossing the surgical field during total knee
      arthroplasty reduces the rate of post-operative anterior knee pain and neuralgia compared to
      standard total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior knee pain is common after total knee arthroplasty. The incision necessarily travels
      through the path of a cutaneous nerve - branches of the saphenous nerve. Historically, no
      effort has been made to separate these branches and bury them away from the surgical scar. It
      has been noted that some patients develop a painful neuroma, that once resected results in a
      pain free knee. Investigators are trying to study if identification, ligation, and proper
      burial of the nerve can prevent the development of neuralgia compared to the typical surgical
      approach which ignores the nerve branches completely.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have symptomatic knee osteoarthritis under consideration for total knee
             arthroplasty

          -  Must be willing to undergo randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt;18 or &gt;80 years

          -  Known pre-operative diagnosis of neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, or
             neuropathy, about the operative lower extremity

          -  Known pre-operative psychiatric disorder requiring medication

          -  Previous surgery about the operative knee

          -  BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 (potential increased risk of soft tissue dissection through adipose)

          -  Ongoing pre-operative narcotic use in excess of 20 mg morphine equivalents per day for
             at least one month or pre-operative intravenous drug use (increased potential for
             complex regional pain syndrome and neuralgia, increased likelihood to require greater
             post-operative analgesia)

          -  Ongoing pre-operative use of neuropathic pain medications (gabapentin, pregabalin,
             amitriptyline, etc.)

          -  Medical comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade &gt; 3 or deemed unfit
             by consulting internist) precluding elective TKA

          -  Significant language barrier (reading comprehension less than 8th grade reading level)
             or mental condition precluding accurate self-assessment of knee pain or function.

          -  Severe medication allergies to permissible post-operative analgesics (acetaminophen,
             tramadol, oxycodone, oxycontin, dilaudid)
