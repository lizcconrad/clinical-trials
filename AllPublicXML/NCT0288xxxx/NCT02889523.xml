      Phase I of the study is designed to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for
      tazemetostat in patients treated with R-CHOP 21.

      Phase II of the study is designed to determine the safety of tazemetostat in patients treated
      with 8 cycles of R-CHOP 21 and to determine the complete response rate according to Cheson
      International Working Group (IWG) 2014: Lugano Classification (i.e. Deauville scale 1-3)
      after 8 cycles of Epi-RCHOP 21.

      Phase I:

      Up to 18 patients will be recruited, using a conventional dose-escalation algorithm (3+3
      patients per dose level) to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which will be deemed
      the RP2D. Patients will receive 8 cycles of RCHOP every 21 days and tazemetostat every day,
      starting on day 2 of cycle 1.

      4 cohorts are defined, according to dose levels of tazemetostat: 400mg Twice a day (BID)
      (cohort 1, starting level), 600mg BID (cohort 2), 800mg BID (cohort 3), 200mg BID (cohort
      -1), depending on the observed toxicities.

      Phase II:

      Up to 115 patients will be recruited and treated with tazemetostat at the MTD and RCHOP.
      Patients will receive 8 cycles of RCHOP every 21 days and tazemetostat at the MTD every day,
      starting on day 2 of cyle 1.
