  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organized ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia (VT), torsades de pointes (TdP)
      and ventricular fibrillation (VF)) represent a major event in the clinical history of a
      patient and they can lead to hemodynamic instability and sudden cardiac death (SCD).
      Recurrences of ventricular arrhythmias and electrical instability have exponentially
      increased in the last decades and a new clinical entity called &quot;electrical storm&quot; (ES) has
      emerged as major morbidity and mortality factor. The ES is defined as a cluster of 3 or more
      sustained ventricular arrhythmias within 24 hours, or a sustained ventricular tachycardia
      lasting 12 hours or more and that does not respond to treatments.

      Most of the patients presenting ES are already implanted with an ICD. This is due to 3
      factors: first, patients with ICD implant are at higher risk to develop ventricular
      arrhythmias for the cardiac disease that led to the ICD implant. Second, the device records
      and treats also asymptomatic or poor symptomatic arrhythmic episodes that otherwise would not
      be detected. Third, and more important, the device gives the possibility to survive to an
      arrhythmic episode, making it possible for the patient to experience an ES. The incidence of
      ES is debated in different studies and ranges from 10 to 60% in patients with ICD for
      secondary prevention and from 4 to 7% in patients with ICD for primary prevention.

      The aim of the ELECTRA registry is twofold:

        1. To create an international registry on clinical features, optimal therapy, ablation
           strategy, prognosis and the effect of ICD programming on patients with ES.

        2. To use the data derived from the registry for a prospective, observational study on
           mortality and rehospitalization rate in patients with ES.

        All patients will be enrolled for a minimum of three years from the protocol approval.
        There is no pre-specified date for the end of enrollment, which will be decided by the
        study responsible according to the enrollment rate.

        A minimum of 500 patients will be included in the present registry. The exploratory nature
        intrinsic to the registry characteristics does not allow a sample size calculation by
        statistical means. However, the sample presented is based on the estimated enrolment rates
        of the participating centers during a 3-year enrolment period. Moreover, the sample size is
        large enough to postulate specific subgroup analyses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of ES (documentation of 3 or more episodes of sustained ventricular
             arrhythmia within 24h or documentation of sustained ventricular tachycardia lasted at
             least 12h).In order to fulfill this criterion, a patient with a previous episode of ES
             could also be enrolled during routine screening.

          -  Age ≥18

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient without ICD

          -  Confirmed or suspected use of drugs or narcotics with known direct pro-arrhythmic
             effect
