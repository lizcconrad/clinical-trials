  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is more frequent in patients receiving telaprevir with pegylated-interferon/ribavirin
      than in those receiving pegylated-interferon/ribavirin alone. The objective was to measure
      the impact of telaprevir on ribavirin bioavailability and to assess the concomitant renal
      function.
