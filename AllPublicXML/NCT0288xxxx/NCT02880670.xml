      This is an open-label, single-dose, study in healthy males. The primary objective is to
      assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, and routes of elimination of a single oral dose
      of radiolabeled BMS-986142 in healthy male subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed Informed Consent

          -  Target population: Healthy males with no clinically significant deviations from normal
             in medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs),
             physical measurements, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Body weight of at least 50 kilograms (110 pounds); body mass index (BMI) between 18 to
             32 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any chronic or acute illness including active TB in the last 3 years,
             recent infection, gastrointestinal disease, smoking within less than 6 months prior to
             dosing, alcohol abuse, inability to tolerate oral medication, or inability to be
             venipunctured.

          -  Vaccination or plans for vaccination with any live vaccine 12 weeks prior to first
             dose of study drug, during the course of the study, or 30 days after the last dose of
             study drug.

          -  Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in
             physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or clinical laboratory
             determinations beyond what is consistent with the target population.

          -  History of allergies and adverse drug reaction to any oral contraceptive compounds or
             Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.

          -  Participated in a radiolabeled drug study within the previous 12 months; clinically
             significant diagnostic or therapeutic radiation exposure within the previous 12
             months; or current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure monitoring.
