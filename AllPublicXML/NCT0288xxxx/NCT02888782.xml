  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are discharged from hospital can be overwhelmed when they suddenly have to
      manage new conditions or medications. These changes can be particularly difficult for people
      on many medications or with multiple health conditions. There is a real risk that this will
      lead to emergency room visits, hospital readmission, and even death. In addition to
      endangering patients, these adverse events are very costly to the healthcare system. The good
      news is that these events can be preventable if patients receive care that is better
      coordinated.

      Patient-oriented research will be conducted to determine if a pharmacist-led medication
      therapy management service can improve health outcomes of 'medically complex' patients
      transitioning from acute to primary care in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). This a more
      comprehensive service than their community pharmacist would normally provide. The program
      will use a new Pharmacist Clinic service to provide care and support which does not currently
      exist for patients in NL after they leave hospital. After discharge, patients will be
      randomly divided into two groups: one group will receive care as usual from their doctor; the
      other group will have their medications assessed by a clinic pharmacist within one week of
      hospital discharge along with their usual care from their doctor. The two groups will be
      compared to determine whether specialized pharmacist services after hospital discharge is
      satisfactory to patients/providers, improves patient health, and reduces emergency room
      visits, hospital readmissions, and repeat trips to the doctor. If successful, this project
      will help ensure that patients are taking the right medications in the right way, improving
      individual health and making better use of healthcare system resources.
