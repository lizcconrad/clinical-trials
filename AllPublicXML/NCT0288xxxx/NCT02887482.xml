    <textblock>
      The clinical trial will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of GLS-5700.
      GLS-5700 is a synthetic DNA plasmid vaccine against the Zika virus. This is a Phase 1
      clinical trial of this vaccine which encodes for the premembrane-membrane and envelope
      regions of Zika virus.

      Zika virus, first discovered in the Zika forest in 1947, has caused a large epidemic in South
      America, Central America, and the Caribbean islands commencing in late 2014 or early 2015.
      Zika virus can cause significant neurologic disease to include Guillain Barre Syndrome in
      adults and microcephaly and other birth defects among children born to mothers who are
      infected during pregnancy. At present no vaccines or treatments have been approved for Zika
      virus infection.

      GLS-5700 contains a single plasmid containing DNA encoding for pre-membrane and envelope
      (prME) proteins of the Zika virus.
