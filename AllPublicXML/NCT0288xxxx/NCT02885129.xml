      The main objective is to assess the measurement characteristics (validity, reproducibility)
      and the invariance of EGOMAC scale in a population of consultants in diabetology, cardiology
      and rheumatology hospital and liberal and hospital oncology and Infectious disease, by
      following the evolution of patient compliance at D0 and D15.

      The second objective is to assess the sensitivity to change of scale EGOMAC following
      developments compliance 3 months.

      During a routine appointment (D0), the patient filled a newsletter and a questionnaire to
      complete.

      The doctor collects medical informations for the case report form.

      At the end of the first consultation (D0), an additional EGOMAC scale and a stamped envelope
      is delivered to the patient by asking him to fill that scale to 15 days and return it by Post
      Office (reproducibility study).

      Finally, a new scale will be addressed to the patient at the end of 3 months, which will
      return by Post Office too (stability study).
