    <description>This is a sub-study testing how the adhesion of two adhesives is influenced by exposure to real output.
There are two kinds of visits:
Visit 1:
Two adhesive strips (standard adhesive strip) are applied on the peristomal skin; one strip is exposed to real output (contained in a sleeve) and the other strip is not.
Visit 2:
Two adhesive strips (new adhesive strip) are applied on the peristomal skin; one strip is exposed to real output (contained in a sleeve) and the other strip is not.
