    <textblock>
      This pilot study evaluates the safety and tolerability of a single injection of collagenase
      enzyme directly into a uterine fibroid in subjects already selected for hysterectomy or
      myomectomy.

      Fibroids contain excessive amounts of collagen and it is possible that digestion of collagen
      may be beneficial in reducing pain and bleeding associated with fibroids.

      Three subjects will be injected with saline only to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the injection method. Additional subjects will then be injected with increasing doses of
      study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collagenase enzyme breaks down collagen and has shown efficacy in clinical trials for a
      number of diseases for which there is an accumulation of collagen.

      It is possible that lysis of collagen may reduce the collagen content of fibroids thus
      decreasing the size of fibroids, and possibly reducing the stiffness of fibroids. This may
      result in reducing the symptoms of pain and bleeding associated with fibroids.

      In this study three subjects will be injected with saline only followed immediately by
      hysterectomy in order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the injection method.

      Twelve subjects will receive a single injection of study drug as follows: three subjects will
      receive a set dose of collagenase enzyme followed by hysterectomy or myomectomy 24-96 hours
      later (Group 1) to evaluate safety of the injection of study drug. Nine subjects will then
      receive increasing doses of collagenase enzyme followed by hysterectomy or myomectomy 60-90
      days later (Group 2).
