      110 patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones and had one or more anther preoperative
      predictors for high risk for difficult cholecystectomy admitted to departement of surgery of
      Minia university hospital for ERCP then laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). the patient
      divided into 2 equal group. in group 1, nasobiliary (NB) catheter was inserted during ERCP
      after CBD clearance. In group 2, only CBD clearance was done. In all patients LC was done
      within the same week of ERCP. Tans-nasobiliary Intraoperative cholangiography was done and
      methylene blue injected at the end of the procedure to detected any leak in NB group

      110 patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones and had one or more anther preoperative
      predictors for high risk for difficult cholecystectomy as , age &gt; 65 , male sex, obesity,
      acute cholecystitis, previous upper abdominal surgery, and certain ultrasonographic findings
      i.e. distended gall bladder (GB), thickened GB wall, pericholecystic fluid collection and
      impacted stone etc. these patients admitted to department of surgery of Minia university
      hospital for ERCP followed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). the patient divided into 2
      equal group. in group 1, nasobiliary (NB) catheter was inserted during ERCP to settle high up
      in the intrahepatic biliary tree after complete CBD clearance. In group 2, only CBD clearance
      was done. In all patients LC was done within the same week of ERCP. sequential, multiple,
      step after step, tans-nasobiliary Intraoperative cholangiography was done during every step
      in cholecystectomy especially during dissection of calot's triangle and just before clipping
      of supposed cystic duct (CD) to make sure that the structure supposed to be CD was not the
      CBD. after the end of procedure methylene blue is injected from the the NB to detected any
      leak and if present
