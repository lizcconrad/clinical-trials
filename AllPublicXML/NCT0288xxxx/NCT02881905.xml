  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant difference between CM LOC and ball attachment, when considering the
      peri-implant soft tissue health and marginal bone loss. The primary and secondary objectives
      are to determine if CM LOC attachment improves the peri-implant soft tissue response and
      decreases the marginal bone loss around implant when compared to conventional ball attachment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ball attachments are very commonly used because they are solitary, simple, easier to use and
      less technique sensitive if compared to bar attachments. However, ball attachment require a
      prosthetic space of 12 mm and could show tremendous wear if implants were mal-aligned. CM LOC
      attachment is newly introduced into market with very good expectations regarding its
      properties and effect on the periimplant soft tissue. CM LOC attachment, which combes
      titanium patrix and resin matrix made from polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), is a very promising
      material regarding the wear and the prosthesis retention it provides, even with mal-aligned
      implants. However, the clinical performance of this attachment was not tested yet. Therefore,
      in this randomized controlled trial it was decided to compare between CM LOC and the commonly
      used ball attachment regarding the soft tissue health and marginal bone loss.

    <description>0 = absence of inflammation
= mild inflammation or with slight changes in color and texture but not in all portions of gingival marginal or papillary
= mild inflammation, such as the preceding criteria, in all portions of gingival marginal or papillary
= moderate, bright surface inflammation, erythema, edema and/or hypertrophy of gingival marginal or papillary
= severe inflammation: erythema, edema and/or marginal gingival hypertrophy of the unit or spontaneous bleeding, papillary, congestion or ulceration. Gingival units as well as the calculation of the index follow the same criteria described in GI</description>

    <time_frame>from baseline upto 1 year. score measurement from 0-3 where 0 denotes no plaque present and 3 denotes abundant plaque</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Plaque Index (mPI) is a dental plaque scale done by Mombelli etal.[13] as follows:
0 = No plaque
= Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin
= Plaque can be seen by naked eye
= Abundance of soft matter. The lower the number the less plaque is present on the tooth</description>

    <measure>Modified Bleeding Index</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline upto 1 year. score from 0-3 where 0 denotes no bleeding and 3 denotes profound bleeding</time_frame>
    <description>Periodontal probe will be passed all around implant cervical margin and bleeding will be scored as follows:
Score 0: No bleeding when a periodontal probe is passed along the gingival margin adjacent to the implant.
Score 1: Isolated bleeding spots visible.
Score 2: Blood forms a confluent red line on margin.
Score 3: Heavy or profuse bleeding.</description>

    <description>Standardized periapical long cone paralleling technique will be necessary so radiographic template customized for each patient with a holder. Then two reference points will be marked on the implant platform surface and will be joined with a line representing the height zero. then two vertical lines mesial and distal will be drawn to the first bone contact point.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Completely edentulous male or female patients between the ages of 50 to 69.

          -  No contraindications for implantation.

          -  Each patient has to perform both a random blood sugar and Glycosylated Hemoglobin
             analysis. Patients with a Glycosylated hemoglobin test HbA1c up to 8% and a normal
             blood sugar level (79 to 110) or controlled diabetic patients (90-130 fasting
             according to American Association of Diabetes) will be included.

          -  Sufficient bone width (â‰¥ 6 mm) in the anterior region to place an implant. It could be
             either normally present or achieved by bone plateauing. This will be confirmed by cone
             beam computed tomographic (CBCT) scans.

          -  Residual bone height ranging from 11-20 mm with the lowest vertical height in the
             midline of the mandible not less than 13 mm (Class II or III according to McGarry et
             al[16] 1999). This will be confirmed by the CBCT.

          -  Patients seeking to install a single symphyseal implant and for whom new dentures will
             be constructed.

          -  Patients, who are dissatisfied with the retention and stability of their technically
             satisfactory dentures.

          -  Patients, who already have existing maxillary and mandibular complete dentures, and
             after examination of the mandibular dentures, it is found that there are technical
             problems with regard to denture design and/or occlusion; then new maxillary and
             mandibular dentures will be fabricated

          -  All patients should have adapted to their dentures for at least six weeks before being
             included in the trial.

          -  Patients providing written informed consents to participate in the trial and this will
             be done before the scheduled date for implant installation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a systemic or local contra-indication for implant placement.

          -  Satisfied patients with the retention of their mandibular denture as well as
             unsatisfied patients with their maxillary denture.

          -  Patient with a mandibular denture height less than 6 mm between the base of the
             denture and the incisal edge of the central incisors (as measured by a caliper) or
             with 12 mm crown height space as measured by a ruler from the incisal edge till the
             crest of the ridge. This will be done from a putty index of the diagnostic set up.
