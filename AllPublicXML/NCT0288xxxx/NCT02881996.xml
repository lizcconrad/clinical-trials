  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate two standard post-operative pain regimens
      routinely used after laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. The investigators
      hypothesize that the use of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen in addition to IV ketorolac with
      narcotic pain pump will decrease time to transition off patient/nurse controlled analgesia
      (PCA) to oral pain medications.

      To assess pain control, patient and family perception of pain control, time to return of
      bowel function defined as passage of first flatus (in days), doses of anti-emetic
      medications, doses of narcotic pain medications, time to toleration of regular diet (in
      days), narcotic associated adverse effects (nausea, emesis, respiratory depression,
      constipation), length of stay, and overall hospital cost in admission.

      Post-hospitalization the investigators will assess complications including number and reasons
      for emergency visits and abscess formation, length of post-hospitalization analgesic use,
      length of post-hospitalization narcotic use, and time to return to school.

    <description>Post-operatively, all patients will be placed on a standard patient/nurse controlled analgesia (PCA) according to our pain service protocol which included ketorolac. A 3 hours after first dose of ketorolac, patients in the acetaminophen arm will then receive scheduled 10mg/kg of IV acetaminophen every 6hrs for a total of 3 days in between doses of ketorolac. PCA Pumps will be discontinued with the return of bowel function and transition to oral intake in all patients as per the current protocol. If a patient in the acetaminophen arm is transitioned off of PCA prior to 3 days, IV acetaminophen will be stopped at that time as well. Patients in the control group only may receive oral/rectal acetaminophen as needed for treatment of fevers.</description>
