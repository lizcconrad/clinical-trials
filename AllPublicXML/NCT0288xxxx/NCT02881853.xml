    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, combined multiple dose subcutaneous (SC) bioavailability (BA) and
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) study evaluating safety, tolerability and BA of SC XmAb7195 in
      healthy subjects and in subjects with atopic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided into 2 parts. Part A will be an open-label, parallel group, BA
      study evaluating 4 once-weekly doses of IV XmAb7195 or SC XmAb7195 in healthy subjects. Each
      of 5 treatment groups will consist of 6 subjects. Part B will commence following the
      completion of Part A and will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD study
      evaluating 4 once weekly doses of SC XmAb7195 in healthy subjects and/or subjects with atopic
      disease. Each treatment group will consist of 8 subjects randomized 3:1 to XmAb7195:placebo
      Subjects in both parts of the study will be followed for at least 28 days after their last
      dose.

             (inclusive, at screening).

          -  Women can be of either childbearing or non-childbearing potential.

          -  Must be healthy with no clinically significant abnormality identified on medical or
             laboratory evaluation and no history of any clinically significant disorder,
             condition, or disease that would pose a risk to subject or interfere with the study
             evaluation, procedures, or completion as assessed by the Investigator.

        Subjects with Atopic Disease Only (Part B):

               2. Inhaled short acting beta agonist (SABA) therapy for bronchospasm if dosing has
                  been stable for 14 days prior to randomization.

               3. No other prescription drugs are allowed unless agreed as not clinically relevant
                  by the Investigator and Sponsor.

          -  Subjects who have had an asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization within the 1
             year prior to randomization or having required oral corticosteroids within the 6
             months prior to randomization.

          -  Subjects with poorly controlled asthma defined as SABA &gt; 6 times/day on any day within
             the 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Subjects who have used any of the following medications within the 3 months prior to
             randomization: oral or inhaled corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists (LABAs),
             leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), or any other asthma controller medication
             (occasional SABA use is allowed).
