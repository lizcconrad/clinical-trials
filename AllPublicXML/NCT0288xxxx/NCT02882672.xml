    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine if eight-weeks of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation could
      improve adiponectin and cardiovascular disease risk factors in overweight coronary heart
      disease patients. Patients were included in the study if: they were approved to do so
      following a physical, physiological and psychological test; did not take part in regular
      physical activity; had stable heart failure for at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria
      included: a history of surgery within the preceding 4 months; had an unstable angina, acute
      phase of myocardial infarction, and/or unstable arrhythmia; had obstructive cardiomyopathy,
      exercise-induced ischemia or arrhythmias, uncontrolled arrhythmias, resting blood pressure
      more than 200/120 millimeters mercury, aortic stenosis, and/or peripheral artery disease;
      exercise limitations due to neuromuscular and/or musculoskeletal disease; had any health
      problems that prevented maximum effort on the treadmill test. Target population included of
      all patients with a history of myocardial infarction and diagnosis of congestive heart
      failure who were referred to Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Centre. 60overweight coronary
      heart disease patients were randomly assigned to either an eight-week, three times weekly
      exercise group (n=30), or a non-exercising control group (n=30). Exercise sessions took place
      at 60-85% of maximal heart rate, lasted 45-60 minutes and included a 10-minute warm-up, 40
      minutes of aerobic exercises, consisting of stationary cycling, walking and/or jogging,
      flexibility, balance exercises, and weight-bearing activity and a 10-minute cool-down.
