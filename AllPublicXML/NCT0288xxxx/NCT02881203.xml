    <textblock>
      This study investigates the Breathe Well device to test whether it is superior to the
      existing treatment standard of the Varian Realtime Position Management (RPM) system in
      assisting patients with deep inspiration breath hold.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated an increased risks of cardiac disease in breast cancer
      radiotherapy patients. For patients diagnosed &lt;50 years old, the risks for cardiovascular
      diseases/events were increased by 24‐82% comparing left and right breast radiotherapy. The
      deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) technique addresses this problem by reducing the heart
      dose by up to half, thus potentially reducing the increased rate of major coronary events by
      20%. Providing patients with visual feedback in addition to audio guidance has been
      demonstrated to improve the reproducibility of the DIBH technique by 95% and stability by
      80%.

      Breathe Well is a new audiovisual feedback device that may increase the accuracy and workflow
      of implementing DIBH for breast cancer patients.
