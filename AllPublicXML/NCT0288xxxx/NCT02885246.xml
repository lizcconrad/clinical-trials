      The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence, strain circulation and disease burden
      of seasonal Influenza A and B in Panama, selected countries of Central America and the
      Caribbean from the Year 2010 to 2015.

    <textblock>
      The Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies (ICGES) is a public health institution
      established in Panama dedicated to health research and disease prevention. It has been
      performing virological isolations of influenza and is a part of the World Health Organisation
      (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and a direct collaborator of
      the CDC.

      From 2010 a sentinel surveillance program is being conducted in Panama within the ICGES to
      collect data on influenza and other respiratory viruses using CDC guidance for Respiratory
      Disease Surveillance. This study aims to utilize this data source for analyzing the burden of
      influenza within the region.
