  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of neurological and psychiatric complaints for participants taking rilpivirine,
      elvitegravir, or dolutegravir reaches on average 20â€”30% during clinical trials. The inclusion
      and exclusion criteria for enrolling people living with HIV are at times so selective and the
      subsequent descriptions of minor or severe adverse events (AE's) so often imprecise and
      ambiguous that one cannot extrapolate these particular research results to practicing
      medicine. These adverse events negatively affect the patient's quality of life and ultimately
      his or her good adherence to treatments.

      This study aims at assessing the prevalence and at describing the neurological and
      psychiatric adverse events related to these drugs.
