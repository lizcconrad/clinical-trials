      The purpose of this study is to determine whether remote limb ischemic conditioning(RIC)
      increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage for the acute ischemic stroke patients who
      received r-tPA thrombolytic therapy.

    <description>The upper limb ischemic conditioning is composed of five cycles of bilateral upper limb ischemia intervened by reperfusion, which is induced by two cuff placed around the upper arms respectively and inflated to 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion by cuff deflation. This therapy started within 2 hours after r-tPA thrombolytic therapy. In addition, all participants receive a standard clinical therapy.</description>
