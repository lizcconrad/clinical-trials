  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, Belimumab (GSK1550188) will be developed for a dosing regimen of once-monthly
      intravenous (IV) infusion for the treatment of SLE. This open-label, single dose study will
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      belimumab in Chinese SLE subjects. A total of approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled to
      receive IV infusion of 10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) GSK1550188 on Day 0 for the
      treatment of SLE. Subjects will be followed for 84 days after the administration of drug.
