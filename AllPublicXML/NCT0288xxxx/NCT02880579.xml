    <textblock>
      The Ischemic Brain Vascular Accident (CVA) is a major public health issue. An Early and
      appropriate charging anyone with stroke is essential to reduce mortality, reduce dependency
      and promote recovery of autonomy. Intravenous fibrinolysis in patients with cerebral
      infarction (NINDS 1995), is reserved for a small proportion of highly selected patients. It
      therefore remains a significant therapeutic challenge, especially for patients with
      against-indications to fibrinolysis or in whom there is no immediate benefit. For twenty
      years of mechanical devices have been developed to remove, as quickly as possible, the cause
      of intracranial arterial occlusion and allow restoration of blood flow before brain damage is
      irreversible.

      NTF The protocol is part of the evaluation process of our clinical practices recommended by
      the National Health Authority (HAS), in the specific context of mechanical thrombectomy
      performed in French centers of interventional neuroradiology working with neurovascular units
      (A V).
