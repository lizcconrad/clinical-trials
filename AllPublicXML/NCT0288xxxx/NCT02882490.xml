      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a parent training program to
      control disruptive behaviors in children with Tourette Syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disruptive behaviors occur in 80% of children with Tourette Syndrome, and can be more
      disabling than the tics themselves.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a parent training program to control
      disruptive behaviors in children with Tourette Syndrome. In addition, social cognition will
      be examined in all the participants to analyze its relationship with the severity of
      disruptive behavior and the treatment response.

      42 children with Tourette Syndrome and moderate disruptive behaviors will be randomly
      assigned to a 10-week Parent Training Program or a 10-week Supportive Therapy. Clinical
      response will be evaluated after the intervention period, and three and six months later.

After an initial inventory of current and lifetime motor and phonic tic types, current tic number, frequency, intensity, complexity and interference are rated on a 6-point scale. Maximum score is 100, resulting from three subscales: motor tic severity (maximum score 25), phonic tic severity (maximum score 25) and general impairment due to tics (maximum score 50).</description>

    <description>The PT arm receives a 10-week therapist-guided behavioral group treatment. The treatment is based on existing literature for training parents in child behavior management skills (Barkley 1999). Parents attend weekly sessions, which last 90 minutes and are held at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. Parents are given homework assignments to complete between sessions.</description>

    <description>The ST arm receives a 10-week supportive group treatment. Parents are invited to discuss relevant problems that have occurred during the previous week. A therapist moderate the discussion but does not provide information about the behavioral techniques included in the PT group. Parents attend weekly sessions, which last 90 minutes and are held at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. Parents are given homework assignments to complete between sessions.</description>
