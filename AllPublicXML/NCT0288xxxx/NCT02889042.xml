    <textblock>
      France is one of the European countries with the highest rate of death by suicide, more than
      10 400 deaths each year, about 16 people out of 100 000. Although suicide mortality rate
      tends to fall between 1987 and 2008 the number of suicide attempts (TS) against observed by
      an upward trend between 2005 and 2010. However, the most important predictor of death by
      suicide remains the TS. Now these are primarily TS Poisoning Drug-Volunteer (IMV), especially
      benzodiazepines. These IMV, there have been 16% recurrence in the past year and 21% at 4
      years among hospitalized patients. Or a Health Barometer 2005 survey showed that 58% of
      respondents with a TS over the last 12 months had not been hospitalized. This type of acting
      out, especially the repeated IMV (IMVr) is underestimated epidemiologically because it is an
      unknown phenomenon and too little screened by health professionals.

      The IMVr constitute severe behavior disorder, chronic and costly given the multiple
      prescriptions, hospital admissions, including emergencies, and repeated treatment failures,
      in the absence of specific treatment of psychopathological problematic background. Indeed
      many arguments lead to evoke the existence of a functioning underlying addictive type, rather
      than a problem of suicide, especially from the second recurrence (often characterized by low
      lethality and suicidal intentionality). This impulsive behavior and / or compulsive
      repeatedly would not simply the consequence of a pharmacological benzodiazepine dependence
      (it is also not systematic), but would demonstrate a similar operation to that of behavioral
      addictions. Furthermore, a preliminary study has shown that this type of behavior was not
      limited to a BPD personality type, since it is mainly found pathological personalities
      depressive and avoidant types.

      In this context it is urgent to make an accurate characterization of these patients IMVr
      because the integration of the addictive dimension in their care will adapt strategies
      psychotherapeutic, pharmacological, and the terms of issue of psychotropic and especially
      benzodiazepines .
