    <textblock>
      The surgical management of spinal deformities especially in adults is complex. The
      conventional surgical treatment of these deformations is a scope arthrodesis of the spine.
      The quality of the result depends on many variables such as the choice of the vertebrae to
      fuse, location and the number of implants, the type of material used or the type of
      correction maneuver used.

      All these variables affect the surgical outcome and may be involved as a modifiable risk
      factor for possible postoperative complications. The study proposes to focus on the
      junctional kyphosis postoperative proximal (CJP or Proximal Junctional Kyphosis: PJK) 1.
      Their prevalence in adults ranges from 20% to 43% depending on the series (Yang and Cheng,
      2003; Yagi, King and al.2012).

      The radiographic definition of CJP's kyphosis with an angle&gt; 10 Â° measured from the lower
      plate of the proximal instrumented vertebra to the upper plate of the adjacent vertebra
      proximal not instrumented (Glattes and al.2005) 4; this measure is being compared to the pre
      operative data.

      Either the CJP are asymptomatic and do not require revision surgery (Yagi King and al.2011) 5
      either they are and thereby generate a revision surgery (Kim Bridwell and al.2008; Watanabe
      Lenke and al.2010) .

      Several factors may potentially influence the development of the CJP. Among them, age,
      preoperative comorbidities, obesity, osteoporosis, lesions of the posterior elements, hybrid
      instrumentation, correction forces applied during surgery, sagittal balance pre and post
      operative degeneration joint capsules, etc. There are few studies on the identification and
      analysis of these risk factors; literature gives only single-center studies on small samples
      10 with a single surgical procedure. Review articles describe the incidence and risk factors
      of the CJP. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of the CJP are still controversial to
      this day.

      The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of occurrence of postoperative kyphosis
      proximal junctional and identify risk factors for developing this major complication of a
      multicenter population of scoliosis operated an extensive fusion.

      objectives:

      Determine on a homogenous population of scoliosis operated for an extended fusion of 4 or
      more vertebrae:

        -  the incidence of proximal junctional kyphosis

        -  Modifiable risk factors and non modifiable of occurrence of CJP.

        -  the rate of CJP leading to revision surgery and the surgical recovery factors.

      Methodology :

      This is a multicenter retrospective cohort enrolling in Chapter X of the Data Protection Act
      and provides, as part of this research, the collection of individual data for evaluation of
      care and prevention practices with authorization request to the CNIL; the opinion of CCTIRS
      is not required in this case.

      This study concerns the data of patients operated with the techniques mentioned in addition
      with more than 6 months back.

      Patients are aware of the potential use of their data in their files for medical research
      through oral information provided by the doctor at the signing by the patient's consent
      related to the surgery and most recently contained in the Home booklet setting for patients.

      Time study: 8 months Acquisition of data: KEOPS Database (declared to CNIL)

      List of data to collect:

        -  Epidemiological data and conventional clinics.

        -  Background

        -  Questionnaires and functional scores when available. (Some patients filled out
           questionnaires in the prospective follow-up of results and signed an agreement on their
           inclusion in the Keops database.)

        -  Operating data

        -  X-rays of the entire spine from the front and side: pre-operative, post-operative and at
           last follow.
