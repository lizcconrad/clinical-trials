    <textblock>
      This study is to determine early and more chronic changes in concentrations of biomarkers
      related to mechanisms of action (MOA) and effects of sacubitril/valsartan therapyover a
      period of 12 months, and correlate these biomarker changes with cardiac remodeling
      parameters, patient-reported outcomes and cardiovascular outcomes.

Subjects with Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and &quot;low&quot; NT-proBNP (&lt;600 if not hospitalized or &lt;400 if hospitalized) or &quot;low&quot; BNP (&lt;150 if not hospitalized, &lt;100 if hospitalized) at baseline.

    <description>The KCCQ-23 is a self-administered questionnaire and requires, on average, 4-6 minutes to complete. It contains 23 items, covering physical function, clinical symptoms, social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and Quality of Life (QoL). A change of 5 points on the scale scores, either as a group mean difference or an intra-individual change appears to be clinically significant, based on comparisons of changes in the scale scores to clinical indicators and subject global reports of change. The analysis will be done for groups of subjects with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide&lt;1000 pg/mL and N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide&gt;=1000 pg/mL at Month 12.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Based on the USPI for sacubitril/valsartan, subjects eligible for inclusion in this study
        must fulfill all of the following criteria at screening and baseline:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          2. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. LVEF ≤ 40% subjects who are candidates for on-label sacubitril/valsartan treatment per
             standard of care.

             multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA), CT scanning, MRI or ventricular angiography
             provided no subsequent study documenting an EF of &gt;40%. If the EF measurement is

         11. Concomitant use of nesiritide.

         12. Bile acid sequestering agents such as cholestyramine or colestipol are prohibited to
