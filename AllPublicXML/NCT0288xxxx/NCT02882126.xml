  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety of continued therapy with
      subcutaneous Remodulin® in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who complete
      the CVT-CV-003 study. The study will include about 50 subjects at up to 10 clinical trial
      centers in China who completed all required assessments in the CVT-CV-003 study. Study visits
      for data collection will occur at month 6 and 12 with yearly visits beyond 12 months until
      the study is discontinued by the sponsor.

    <time_frame>Study Completion, an Average of 3 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events among participants will be recorded throughout participation in the study. The incidence of adverse events among subjects through study completion, an average of 3 years, will be described by the number of subjects analyzed and the percentage of those subjects who experienced an adverse event until study completion.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 6-minute Walk Distance (6MWD) From Baseline to Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The intent of the 6MWD test is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of daily living. Change in 6MWD from Baseline to Month 12, correlates with the current clinical standard for assessing patient functional status in the treatment of PAH and is considered an objective measure of patient functional status. Subjects will be instructed to walk down a corridor at a comfortable speed as far as they can manage for six minutes. Distance &lt;500 meters suggests considerable exercise limitation; Distance 500-800 meters suggests moderate limitation; Distance &gt;800 meters (with no rests) suggests mild or no limitation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Borg Dyspnea Score (following 6MWT) from Baseline to Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg dyspnea score is a 10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea (difficulty in breathing) experienced during the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The Borg dyspnea score will be assessed immediately following the 6MWT. Scores range from 0 (for no shortness of breath) to 10 (for the greatest shortness of breath ever experienced). Changes from Baseline to Month 12 will be summarized and compared between treatment groups using descriptive statistics. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with a Change from Baseline World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Classification at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO Functional Class of pulmonary hypertension is a physical activity rating scale as follows: Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV: Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. Changes from Baseline to Month 12 will be summarized and compared between treatment groups using descriptive statistics. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject is eligible for inclusion in this study if all of the following criteria apply:

          1. The subject voluntarily gives written informed consent to participate in the study.

          2. The subject participated in and completed study CVT-CV-003.

          3. Sexually active women of childbearing potential must practice true abstinence from
             intercourse when it is in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle, or use two
             different forms of highly effective contraception. Medically acceptable forms of
             effective contraception include: (1) approved hormonal contraceptive (such as birth
             control pills), (2) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a
             spermicide, (3) an intrauterine device (IUD), or (4) partner vasectomy. Women of child
             bearing potential include any females who have experienced menarche and who have not
             undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for at least
             12 consecutive months).

             Males participating in the study must use a condom during the length of the study, and
             for at least 48 hours after discontinuing study medication.

          4. The subject has not developed a concurrent illness or condition during the conduct of
             the previous study (including but not restricted to, sleep apnea, chronic renal
             insufficiency, anemia, uncontrolled systemic hypertension or left sided heart disease)
             that would make participation in this study detrimental to the subject's health in the
             opinion of the Investigator.

          5. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the subject is able to communicate
             effectively with study personnel, is considered reliable, willing and likely to be
             cooperative with protocol requirements, including attending all study visits, and is
             mentally and physically capable of administering Remodulin by continuous SC infusion
             using a micro infusion pump.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject is not eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. The subject permanently discontinued Remodulin during study CVT-CV-003.

          2. The subject is pregnant or lactating.
