      Objective: Because many people with type 1 diabetes drink ethanol and because glucagon is
      used to treat mild hypoglycaemia, it is essential to determine whether ethanol will impair
      the effectiveness of glucagon to increase glucose, which may impair the effectiveness of the
      dual hormone treatment in preventing hypoglycaemia.

      The purpose of this study is to determine, whether ethanol influences the glucose response to
      subcutaneous glucagon during mild hypoglycaemia.

      The investigators hypothesize that prior evening ethanol consumption does not reduce the
      effect of a glucagon bolus to raise plasma glucose compared with no prior ethanol
      consumption.

      The study aims:

        1. To determine the late effects of ethanol on the efficacy of subcutaneous glucagon to
           restore plasma glucose after an episode of mild hypoglycemia.

        2. To determine the late effects of ethanol on the counter-regulatory hormones and
           hypoglycaemia awareness during mild hypoglycaemia

      A double-blinded placebo-controlled study will be conducted. Participants will serve as their
      own controls. Eligible participants will after an informed consent complete two study visits,
      one with and one without ethanol consumption, in a random order. On each study visit,
      participants are induced a insulin induced hypoglycemia, seven-eight hours after a meal with
      or without ethanol. Once plasma glucose is below 3.9 mmol/l, a subcutaneous injection of 100
      mcg glucagon is administered. Two hours later a second bolus is administered.
