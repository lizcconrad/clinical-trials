  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to employ a pragmatic, multidimensional assessment of
      hypersomnolence that &quot;piggybacks&quot; on routine clinical care in patients with suspected
      disorders of central nervous system (CNS) hypersomnia, to determine whether these additional
      objective and subjective assessments are useful in the diagnosis and management of these
      patients.

    <description>Multiple measurements will be aggregated to arrive at the primary outcome of proportion of patients categorized as having hypersomnolence using either standard assessments or standard assessments plus additional novel hypersomnolence measures of pupillometry, psychomotor vigilance task, and auditory evoked potentials. Proportion of patients with hypersomnolence using standard measures will be calculated as number of patients with mean sleep latency (MSL) on multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) &lt;8 minutes divided by total number of patients. Proportion of patients categorized as having hypersomnolence with additional novel hypersomnolence measures will be calculated as the number of patients with MSL&lt;8 minutes, and/or pupillary unrest index (PUI) &gt;8.9 on pupillometry, and/or PVT lapses &gt;3, and/or P300 delay/sleep negativity during auditory evoked potentials divided by total number of patients.</description>
