  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to identify things that influence the ability to &quot;turn on&quot; the
      thigh muscle (quadriceps). The thigh muscle tends to be under active with knee
      osteoarthritis, which may make it difficult to strengthen the muscle. The investigators are
      also testing a new technology called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to
      determine whether it may help &quot;turn up&quot; activity in the under active thigh muscle immediately
      after its application. rTMS uses a targeted pulsed magnetic field, similar to what is used in
      an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine to send an electrical signal from the brain to
      the thigh muscle.

      The investigators will recruit up to 20 people with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. The 20
      eligible participants will attend 3 sessions in the laboratory. Session 1 is to collect data
      for Aim 1. Sessions 2 and 3 will include the rTMS interventions and data collection for Aim
      2.

      Aim 1 is a descriptive study to compare the neural (cortical and corticospinal) excitability
      of the quadriceps in the symptomatic knee to the asymptomatic knee in participants with knee
      osteoarthritis. The investigators will examine the associations between neural excitability
      and clinical measures of pain, strength, function, and coping styles.

      Aim 2 is a double blind, crossover study design. Each participant will partake in two testing
      sessions, spaced 1 week apart. The investigators will evaluate outcome measures prior to and
      following the &quot;true&quot; intervention versus the &quot;sham&quot; intervention. The true intervention is
      rTMS + exercise. The sham is sham rTMS + exercise. The primary outcome measures are
      quadriceps strength, as measured from a maximal isometric voluntary contraction, and
      quadriceps activation percent, as calculated from the torque values from the voluntary
      strength measurement and a brief, intense electrical stimulus. Secondary measures evaluate
      effects of the intervention on 1) clinical measures of pain and functional performance, 2)
      corticospinal excitability, and 3) intracortical inhibition and facilitation.
