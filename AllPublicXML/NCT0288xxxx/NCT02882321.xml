      This clinical research study has 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

      The goal of dose escalation in this clinical research study is to find the best dose of
      IACS-010759 that can be given to patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

      The goal of dose expansion in this clinical research study is to learn if the dose of
      IACS-010759 found in the dose escalation part of the study is the best dose to use in future
      studies using IACS-010759 in patients with AML.

      The safety and tolerability of this drug will also be studied.

      This is the first study using IACS-010759 in humans.

      This is an investigational study. IACS-010759 is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 48 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you joined the study. Up to 6 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled
      in the dose escalation part of the study. Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in dose
      expansion.

      If you are enrolled in dose escalation, the dose of IACS-010759 you receive will depend on
      when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level
      of IACS-010759. Each new group will receive a higher dose of IACS-010759 than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. A new group at a higher dose level may
      be started at the same time as an ongoing group receiving a lower dose. If this happens,
      participants will be assigned in an alternating manner between the lower dose and higher dose
      groups. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of IACS-010759 is found.

      If you are enrolled in the dose expansion part of the study, you will receive the dose level
      of IACS-010759 that was found to be the best dose in the escalation part of the study.

      In the dose expansion part of the study, 6 participants will also be enrolled in a
      food-effect group (described in more detail below) to help researchers understand the effects
      of taking the study drug with food.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 21 days.

      You will take the drug in 2 phases: Induction Phase and Maintenance Phase.

      In the Induction Phase, you will take IACS-010759 by mouth one (1) time every day on Days 1-7
      of Cycle 1.

      At the end of the Induction Phase, you will move on to the Maintenance Phase.

      During the Maintenance Phase, you will take IACS-010759 by mouth 3 times each week. The study
      doctor will tell you when to take your dose.

      You should take each dose with a glass of water and at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a
      meal. If you miss a dose, you should not take another dose until the next scheduled time. If
      you are enrolled in the food-effect group, you will take your first dose of IACS-010759
      within 30 minutes after eating a high fat meal.

      You will be admitted to the hospital on Day 7 of Cycle 1 for 24 hours. This is done so that
      you can be checked on for any side effects.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue to take IACS-010759 for up to 12 cycles. If the doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest, you may be able to continue receiving the study drug beyond 12 cycles. You
      will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after long-term follow-up (described below).

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1 and 7 of Cycle 1:

           for routine, PK, and acid/base level testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Every 2-3 cycles while you are on study, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a
      bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy.

      If the study doctor increases your dose of study drug, the following will be performed weekly
      during the first cycle of the higher dose:

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and acid/base level and PK
           testing. This blood draw will also be used to check how well your pancreas functions.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      If the study doctor stops and re-starts your dose of study drug, the following will be
      performed:

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for acid/base level testing and to check how
           well your pancreas functions.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing before the dose and 6
           hours after the dose.

      If the study doctor lowers your dose of study drug, the following will be performed when you
      start taking the lower dose:

      Â°Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing before the dose.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected to check how well your pancreas
           functions and for routine and acid/base level testing.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy.

      If you are unable to return to the clinic for the visit, this testing can be performed by a
      local doctor and the results will be sent to the study doctor. The research nurse will call
      you to ask about your health. These calls should last about 5 minutes.

      Long-Term Follow-up:

      If the disease appears to be responding to the study drug, a member of the study staff will
      call you every 3-6 months for up to 5 years to ask how you are doing and about any side
      effects you may be having. Each call should last about 5 minutes.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may be asked to come into the clinic for a physical
      exam.

             include: 1) Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception; 2) Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with
             or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study
             treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment;

         11. #10 continued: 3) Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For
             female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
             for that subject;4) Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c): a.
             Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of
             hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example
             hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception;b. Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); c. Barrier methods of
             contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository. In case of use of oral
             contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study
             treatment.

         12. #11 continued: Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction
             with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral

             the treatment of AML within 2 weeks prior to day 1 of the study or at least 5
             half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is shorter.

          8. Lactate levels &gt; 2 mmol/L and or and serum pH &lt;7.35 at screening.

          9. Subject currently being treated with biguanides or other agents known to increase risk
             of lactic acidosis.

         10. Subject has significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, including ulcerative colitis,
             chronic diarrhea associated with intestinal malabsorption, Crohn's disease, and/or
             prior surgical procedures affecting absorption or requirement for intravenous (IV)
             alimentation.
