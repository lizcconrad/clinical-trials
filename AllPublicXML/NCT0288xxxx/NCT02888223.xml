    <textblock>
      Participants will be assigned to A or B groups with a scale of 1:1 based on a prospectively
      randomized treatment-sequence assignment, i.e. infuse SCT800 followed by Xyntha (group A), or
      the alternate sequence (group B). All participants who completed the SCT800HA1 study will
      enter the efficacy and safety study (Protocol No.: SCT800HA3).
