      The aim of this project is to investigate whether it is possible to improve the functioning
      and activity level for individuals more than 6 months after stroke by partaking in a
      rehabilitation program consisting of high-intensity task-specific, goal-directed training in
      an enriched environment.

      Background The brain has a limited ability for repair. However, in recent years it became
      evident that a remarkable, yet restricted ability for regeneration of neuronal connections
      exists, with positive implications for the rehabilitation of individuals with stroke. Several
      studies have shown that stroke-lesioned animals, which are exposed to a so called enriched
      environment (large cages, group housing of animals, equipped with toys and with possibilities
      for physical activity and social interactions) show signs of tissue regeneration/plasticity
      in the brain. Research has shown that rats exposed to this enriched environment are
      recovering significantly faster from stroke than rats in standard cages, despite the fact
      that the total tissue loss between the rats did not differ.

      Recovery and improvement of motor functions and skills after stroke depend on spontaneous
      repair processes but also on the reorganization of neural mechanisms by stimuli and demands
      that are placed on the motor control system. In spite of numerous research studies showing
      that functional recovery after stroke is possible even many years after the stroke onset, it
      is unusual for stroke victims to be offered any kind of rehabilitation during later stages.
      High quality randomized controlled trials in this field are needed as well as pre-clinical
      studies of the exercise-induced mechanisms in order to establish alternative therapeutic
      approach for individuals with a history of stroke.

      No previous study has evaluated the effect of high-intensity, task-specific, goal-directed
      training combined with enriched environment, for individuals in a late phase of stroke. The
      aim of this project is to investigate whether it is possible to improve the functioning and
      activity level for individuals more than 6 months after stroke by partaking in a
      rehabilitation program consisting of high-intensity task-specific, goal-directed training in
      an enriched environment. The specific research questions are:

      A. What is the impact of high intensity task specific goal-directed training combined with
      environmental enrichment for individuals in a late phase of stroke? B. What are the subjects'
      experiences of the rehabilitation program? C. What are the biomarkers of successful stroke
      recovery? D. How does the intervention effect the subjects' walking ability on a detailed
      level?

      The study is a single blinded randomized controlled trial with cross-over design, in which
      approximately 36 individuals in the late phase of stroke will be included. Participants will
      be randomized to either the intervention or control group. The intervention will take place
      at a rehabilitation facility in the south of Spain. The main reason for choosing this
      location over a rehab facility in Sweden is to provide an environment with stable condition
      for outdoor activities and sensory stimulation.

      The control group (being in their home environment) will not be not offered any kind of
      organized intervention but will be allowed to continue with conventional treatment, if
      engaged in for example physiotherapeutic training, occupational or speech therapy for a
      maximum of 3 hours/week. After the control period, the control group will partake in the
      rehabilitation program.

      The physical evaluation is performed in Sweden prior to and after the intervention and 6
      months after completion of the intervention / control period. In addition, a three-month
      follow-up in form of questionnaires will be performed.

      The primary outcome measure is:

      Modified Motor Assessment Scale according to Uppsala University Hospital (M-MAS UAS)
      (measuring motor function) Secondary outcome measures are measuring walking ability, speed
      and endurance, dynamic and static balance, fine motor speed and dexterity in the upper limb,
      motor speed and gross manual dexterity, hand strength, satisfaction with life as a whole,
      perceived confidence in task performance, health-related quality of life and degree of
      depression.

      Focus group interviews and individual interviews will be conducted with a subgroup of the
      participants (non aphasic participants) and the statements will be analyzed qualitative using
      content analyses as the method. Blood samples will be taken for the analysis of biomarkers,
      growth factors and inflammatory markers. Advanced analyses of gait patterns and components
      will be performed in a motor laboratory, including a subgroup of the participants.

      In rehabilitation medicine, the general belief has been that treatment of individuals in the
      late phase of stroke has no functional impact. The present research program will test against
      this hypothesis into a controlled clinical trial for patients at more than 6 months after
      stroke. The biochemical analysis of blood samples and additional preclinical studies will
      directly to the knowledge about possibilities to enhance brain plasticity also in later
      phases of stroke. The research will contribute to strengthening the evidence for a promising
      rehabilitation approach combining elements of focused high-intensity training with
      environmental enrichment for which there are strong empirical support.
