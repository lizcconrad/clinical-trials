  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to establish the effectiveness of plasma PlGF measurement in reducing
      maternal morbidity (with assessment of perinatal safety in parallel) in women presenting with
      suspected pre-eclampsia prior to 37 weeks' gestation.

      The long term aim is to demonstrate that knowledge of PlGF measurement enables appropriate
      stratification of the antenatal management of women presenting with suspected pre-eclampsia,
      such that those at highest risk receive greater surveillance with a decrease in maternal
      adverse outcomes, and those at lower risk can be managed without unnecessary admission and
      other interventions, such that the results would influence international clinical practice in
      antenatal patient healthcare

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia (PET), a disease of late pregnancy characterised by hypertension and
      proteinuria, complicates 2-8% of pregnancies and is associated with significant maternal and
      neonatal morbidity and mortality. Many reports have highlighted the frequent substandard
      care, often attributed to clinicians not identifying the seriousness of clinical signs
      suggestive of the disease. Consequently, improvements in prediction of development of PET
      have the potential to vastly improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs.

      Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) belongs to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      family and represents a key regulator of angiogenic events in pathological conditions. PlGF
      exerts its biological function through the binding and activation of the receptor Flt-1. In
      PET, it is thought that endothelial dysfunction leads to an increased level of a circulating
      decoy receptor, known as soluble Flt-1, (sFlt-1), a soluble receptor for both VEGF-A and
      PlGF.

      In 2013, the INFANT team were part of an international group that published the first
      multicentre prospective study (PELICAN) evaluating the use of PlGF in women presenting with
      suspected PET, which reported high sensitivity (95-96%) and negative predictive value
      (95-98%) for low PlGF in determining need for delivery for confirmed PET within 14 days. This
      study suggests that PlGF testing presents a realistic and innovative adjunct to the
      management of women with suspected PET, especially those presenting preterm.
