  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase 0 trial studies how well enzalutamide works before surgery in treating
      patients with kidney cancer. Androgens are a type of hormone produced by the body that may
      cause kidney tumors to grow. Anti-hormone therapy, such as enzalutamide, may lessen the
      amount of androgens produced by the body and keep kidney tumors from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effects of neoadjuvant enzalutamide on clear cell renal cell carcinoma
      (ccRCC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) daily for 90 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo partial or radical nephrectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
