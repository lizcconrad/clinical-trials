    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate long term benefits in speech reception in noise, after daily 10
      week use of an assisting listening device (personal frequency-modulates systems) , in
      non-aphasic stroke patients with auditory processing deficits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke can affect all levels of the auditory pathway. Approximately one in five stroke
      survivors report severe difficulties when listening to speech-in-noise, despite normal
      hearing, attributed to abnormal processing of sounds within the brain, and these individuals
      are more likely to experience communication difficulties in poor acoustic environments, The
      patient with significant auditory deficits and functional limitations may require a range of
      rehabilitation and remediation approaches. Several studies conclusively demonstrate
      substantial improvements in speech recognition in noise when using personal
      frequency-modulated (FM) systems. These devices are used to improve speech perception in
      noise in adults with neurological disorders including stroke with good immediate benefits.
      However, the long-term benefits of FM systems in stroke patients has not been studies. In
      this research study the investigators aimed to investigate the long term benefits in speech
      reception in noise in non-aphasic stroke patients and measure the potential improvement in
      unaided speech in background noise performance after 10 weeks.

    <measure>The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) benefit for speech in noise (reported in decibel, dB)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are tested in a sound attenuated booth (the crescent of sound) with nine audio stands, an equipment cabinet, and a testing station for the assessment of spatial-listening skills. A 'Speech in noise' test was used. In this test, recorded spoken sentences are presented from straight ahead (0째) while noise is also coming from 90째 to the left or right from the participant, who is asked to repeat the sentence. The number of keywords successfully repeated is recorded and repetition of at least three keywords per sentence is required to judge correct performance. The level of the sentences and the background noise are adaptively varied to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for 50% correct performance. The test was conducted with the participant using the frequency modulated systems (aided condition) or not using the frequency modulated systems (unaided condition). The level of SNR is reported in dB.</description>
