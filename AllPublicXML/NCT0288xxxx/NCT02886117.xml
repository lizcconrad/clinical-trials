      The main objective of this study is to determine the capacity of a questionnaire to predict a
      normal balance sheet of haemostasis.

    <textblock>
      Recent recommendations formalized by experts of the French society of anaesthesiology on
      systematic pre-interventional examinations recommend assessing the risk of bleeding from
      personal and family history of bleeding diathesis and after physical examination . They
      recommend not to prescribe a systematic hemostasis laboratory tests in patients with a
      history and physical examination do not suspect a disorder of hemostasis.

      However, there is currently no validated questionnaire in the general population to assess
      the preoperative bleeding risk allowing a reliable assessment of the personal and family
      bleeding diathesis.

      The establishment of a structured questionnaire, the patient could filled before surgery
      consultation to guide the possible prescription of a balance sheet, could meet the new
      recommendations.

      It seems therefore important to establish this type of questionnaire in order to optimize the
      operation of the structure, and to limit the requirements of routine hemostasis balance
      sheets. To do this, the investigator wants to carry out a preliminary study to ensure the
      interest of the established questionnaire.

      The questionnaire assessed in this study is drawn from existing specialized questionnaires,
      the description of hemostasis disorders described factor for deficits from the doctor in
      charge of hemophilia expertise center and expertise of a psychologist, to refine best.
