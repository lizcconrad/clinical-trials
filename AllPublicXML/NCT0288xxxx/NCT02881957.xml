  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D has been shown to impact prognosis in a variety of retrospective and randomized
      clinical trials within an intensive care unit (ICU) environment. Despite these findings,
      there have been no studies examining the impact of hypovitaminosis D in specialized
      neurocritical care units (NCCU). Given the often significant differences in the management of
      patients in NCCU and more generalized intensive care units there is a need for further
      inquiries into the impact of low vitamin D levels in this specific environment. This study
      proposes a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single center evaluation of
      vitamin D supplementation in the emergent NCCU patient population. The primary outcome will
      involve length-of-stay for emergent neurocritical care patients. Various secondary outcomes,
      including in-hospital mortality, ICU length-of-stay, Glasgow Outcome Score on discharge,
      complications and quality-of-life metrics. Patients will be followed for 6 months
      post-discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D has been shown as an important marker of prognosis in a variety of clinical
      settings, including overall mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
      infection/sepsis, asthma, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and pediatric/medical/surgical
      intensive care unit outcomes. Vitamin D not only plays a role in bone maintenance, but also a
      variety of extra-axial functions including immune-dysregulation and systemic inflammation. In
      addition, a number of randomized clinical trials support the supplementation of vitamin D as
      improving outcome in critical care patients. While the evaluation of vitamin D levels remains
      a standard-of-care at our institution, the widespread use of vitamin D monitoring and impact
      on neurocritical care patients remains limited. The investigators' recent prospective
      observational study of vitamin D levels in neurocritical patients showed that deficiency
      (&lt;20ng/dL) was highly associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased in-hospital
      mortality for emergent patients. Moreover, a number of limitations arise from this study due
      to its observational nature. This study proposes a randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, single center evaluation of vitamin D supplementation in the
      neurocritical care patient population. Patients admitted to the neurocritical care unit for
      emergent cases and with vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20ng/dL) will undergo vitamin D serum draw on
      admission and be randomized to receive cholecalciferol/vitamin D3 supplementation (540,000 IU
      once orally) or placebo. The primary outcome measured will be hospital length-of-stay.
      Secondary outcomes will include length of ICU course, complications, medication adverse
      events, discharge Glasgow Outcome Score, in-hospital and 30-day mortality, as well as
      quality-of-life. Power analysis estimates 198 patients will be needed for each subgroup to
      determine a 2 day difference in length-of-stay, and the study plans to recruit 218 patients
      per treatment arm to account for dropout, which will take approximately 6-9 months to
      recruit. Interim analysis and safety monitoring will be performed. The investigators
      hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation may make a significant impact on reducing
      morbidity and mortality in the neurocritical care population. The possibility of reducing
      hospital length of stay and mortality from a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention
      such as vitamin D supplementation may be a useful adjuvant treatment in the neurocritical
      care population.
