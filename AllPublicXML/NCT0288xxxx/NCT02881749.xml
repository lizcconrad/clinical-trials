  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical efficacy of mechlorethamine gel (Valchlor) as a maintenance therapy after low
      dose total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) for the treatment mycosis fungoides cutaneous
      T-cell lymphoma will be evaluated in this study. Subjects will be treated with low dose TSEBT
      (12 Gy total) over a period of two weeks. After a 30 day observation period and confirmation
      that their disease stage has been downgraded to IA or IB, subjects will use Valchlor as a
      maintenance therapy over the course of one year. The efficacy of Valchlor as a maintenance
      drug will be followed clinically through Modified Severity Weight Assessment Tool (mSWAT) and
      percent body surface area measurements (%BSA). Furthermore, subjects will be followed
      histopathologically through skin biopsies performed at the screening visit, immediately after
      observation period, one month after the start of the maintenance period, and twelve months
      after the start of the maintenance period (4 biopsies total).

    <description>All subjects enrolled in the study will receive two weeks of low dose total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) (12 Gy total divided into 6 fractions delivered over two weeks) followed by a weekly maintenance mechlorethamine gel 0.016% regimen for one year. The initiation of the mechlorethamine gel regimen is dependent on their disease stage downgrading to IA and IB following low dose TSEBT.</description>

    <description>TSEBT will be given in 6 fractions at 2 Gy per fraction every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday over the course of 2 weeks (total TSEBT dosage is 12 Gy). Supplements up to 8 Gy will routinely be applied to the perineum and soles as well as any other &quot;shadowed&quot; sites involved by disease, such as the inframammary regions, scalp, etc. Discrete tumors may receive additional &quot;boost&quot; up to 8 Gy.</description>

    <description>The maintenance period for this study includes one year of weekly mechlorethamine gel 0.016%. This period will not begin until the observation period (30 days) has been completed. During the first week of the maintenance period, patients will apply mechlorethamine gel to the entire body surface daily. After the first week, patients will apply mechlorethamine gel to entire body surface one time per week for the rest of the maintenance period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Male or Female

          -  â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Documentation of diagnosis as evidenced by one or more clinical features consistent
             with Mycosis Fungoides cutaneous T-Cell lymphoma

          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject or subject's legal representative and
             ability for subject to comply with requirements of the study

          -  Skin biopsy specimen of representative lesion obtained at screening of study and
             deemed diagnostic of Mycosis Fungoides by principal investigator

          -  Eligible, in the opinion of the investigator, for low dose TSEBT over the course of
             two weeks.

          -  Availability of subject to be observed for up to 18 months post-screening evaluation.

          -  Life Expectancy greater than 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding females

          -  Presence of a condition or abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator would
             compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data

          -  Patients diagnosed with Sezary Syndrome. Sezary Syndrome is equivalent to mycosis
             fungoides that develops to Stage IVA/B with B2 (high blood tumor burden) involvement,
             and as such requires a more aggressive treatment regimen than Valchlor or TSEBT.

          -  Patients who do not have their disease downgrade to stage IA or IB 30 days following
             low dose TSEBT.

          -  Underlying medical condition including unstable cardiac disease, or other serious
             illness that would impair the ability of the patient to undergo treatment

          -  Minimum 3 weeks since prior systematic treatment or phototherapy

          -  Decisionally-impaired individuals, prisoners, and vulnerable populations
