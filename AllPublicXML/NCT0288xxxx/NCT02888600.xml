  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing two 8-week stress management
      programs for reducing inflammation and improving well-being among older adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of literature has demonstrated how stress can affect social relationships,
      health, and well-being during the aging process. Here, the investigators will test how two
      different programs can be used to facilitate healthy aging by helping individuals manage
      stress. One program will teach participants mindfulness meditation techniques while the other
      will educate participants about how to manage their health.

      N=188 older adults will visit the study's central laboratory for a baseline visit and
      complete several days of daily experience sampling before being randomized into one of the
      two 8-week stress management programs. Participants will complete several days of daily
      experience sampling at the midpoint and conclusion of the intervention before returning to a
      study site to complete a follow-up assessment at both 1-week and 3-months after the end of
      the program.

      This project will provide important information about how each training program can be used
      to promote well-being, health, and better social functioning in older adults. This work will
      ultimately inform the design of more efficacious and efficient stress-management
      interventions to facilitate healthy aging.
