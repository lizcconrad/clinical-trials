  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients ≥ 3 years of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma will be
      enrolled in this study. However, the primary objectives of this study are to 1) compare
      overall survival, the time from randomization to death from any cause, for study subjects
      3-21 years of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma who receive
      Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) + radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy
      alone and 2) describe the toxicity profile (all subjects) for Antineoplaston therapy +
      radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy alone.

      A secondary objective is to compare progression-free survival for study subjects 3-21 years
      of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma treated with Antineoplaston
      therapy + radiation therapy vs. radiation therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase 3 protocol study of Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy vs.
      radiation therapy alone in subjects ≥ 3 years of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic
      pontine glioma. In those subjects randomized to Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy,
      Antineoplaston therapy is administered for 104 weeks while radiation therapy commences on day
      one of Antineoplaston therapy and continues for 6 weeks. Subjects continue on Antineoplaston
      therapy if an objective response or stable disease is achieved during therapy and are
      maintained on Antineoplaston therapy to the end of the protocol study unless they develop
      progressive disease. Subjects randomized to radiation therapy alone receive 6 weeks of
      radiation therapy.

      Exploratory objectives are to compare the following in the two treatment arms: 1) overall
      survival for study subjects ≥ 21 years of age; 2) progression-free survival for subjects ≥ 21
      years of age; 3) objective response, complete response, partial response, and progressive
      disease rates, based on the enhancing portion of the tumor, for all subjects, using
      bidimentional measurement of tumor; 4) objective response, complete response, partial
      response, and progressive disease rates, for all subjects with non-enhancing tumors, using
      unidimentional measurement of tumor; and 5) objective response, complete response, partial
      response, and progressive disease rates, based on the enhancing + non-enhancing portions of
      the tumor, for all subjects, using unidimentional measurement of tumor.

    <description>The Kaplan-Meier nonparametric method is used to evaluate overall survival in the two therapy groups. Survival difference is evaluated using a log-rank test, which compares the two therapy groups. A Cox proportional hazards model is used as a supportive analysis to assess the magnitude of difference between the two therapy groups. The median survival rate in the two therapy groups (and 95% confidence intervals) is evaluated. Hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval are estimated.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with Diffuse, Intrinsic Pontine Glioma as defined by the following criteria
             are eligible:

               -  A characteristic MRI appearance, including variable contrast enhancement after
                  gadolinium administration, diffuse T2/FLAIR signal, and involvement of more than
                  50% of the pons.

               -  Confirmation of anaplastic glioma (i.e., oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma,
                  oligoastrocytoma) or GBM histology if there is less than 50% involvement of the
                  pons.

          -  Screening evaluation requires a MRI performed within 14 days prior to the start of ANP
             therapy. Study subjects must be on a fixed dose of steroids for at least five days
             prior to the screening MRI. If the steroid dose is changed between the date of imaging
             and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI is required. All MRIs must be performed
             at an accredited radiology center. All MRIs should include at a minimum: T1-weighted
             images pre/post gadolinium administration, fluid attenuated inversion recovery
             (FLAIR), and T-2 weighted images.

          -  Subjects 3-21 years of age must have a clinical history of disease of less than 6
             months and at least two of the following clinical findings: cranial nerve deficit,
             long tract signs (i.e. hemiparesis) and ataxia are eligible. Subjects &gt; 21 years of
             age do not need to meet these criteria.

          -  Subjects must be ≥ 3 years of age. RT is not recommended for subjects less than 3
             years of age.

          -  Subjects ≤ 16 years of age with a Lansky performance status of &gt; 40 are eligible.
             Subjects &gt; 16 years of age with a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 40 are eligible.

          -  Subjects with organ and marrow function (as defined below) are eligible.

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

               -  Leukocytes &gt; 2000/mm3

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,000/ mm3

               -  Serum Na+ ≤ 150 mmol/L

               -  Serum K+ ≤ 5.5 mmol/L

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times institutional upper limit

               -  Platelets &gt;50,000/ mm3

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dL

               -  AST (SGOT) / ALT (SGPT) &lt;5 times institutional upper limit

          -  At the recommended therapeutic dose, the effects of ANP therapy on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential who agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to protocol study entry and for the duration of the protocol study
             are eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this protocol study, she will inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Subjects, parents, and/or guardians who are able to understand a written informed
             consent document, and are willing to sign it, are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No type of prior therapy, including other investigational agents, is allowable. A
             prior diagnostic biopsy or surgical shunt for hydrocephalus is permitted.

          -  Subjects with disseminated disease, multicentric tumors, leptomeningeal disease, or
             the history of retrotumoral bleeding are not eligible. The screening / baseline MRI
             includes the spinal cord to rule out leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Subjects with a known history of ganglioglioma are not eligible.

          -  Subjects with a current diagnosis or family history of neurofibromatosis I or II are
             not eligible. - Subjects with a current diagnosis or family history of
             neurofibromatosis are not eligible.

          -  Subjects with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension despite maximal medical
             management (three supine blood pressure measurements ≥ 150/99 taken at least one hour
             apart) or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             protocol study requirements are not eligible.

          -  Subjects with a history of New York Heart Association Class II congestive heart
             failure are not eligible.

          -  Pregnant women are not eligible because the teratogenic and abortifacient effects of
             ANP therapy in humans are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to the mother receiving ANP therapy,
             breastfeeding is discontinued if the mother receives ANP therapy.
