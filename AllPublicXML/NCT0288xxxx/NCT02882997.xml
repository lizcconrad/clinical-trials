  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility of using an interactive computer game to elicit
      repetitive practice of paretic arm movements in the homes of community dwelling stroke
      survivors and during non-therapy hours at an inpatient stroke rehabilitation hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 75% of the 800,000 people who annually suffer stroke exhibit persistent arm/hand
      hemiparesis restricting independence thus burdening caregivers. Arm motor skill can recover
      if the rehabilitation program provides an adequate &quot;dose&quot; of repetitive movement practice.
      However, the vast majority of stroke survivors lack the proper practice-dose because the
      duration of inpatient stroke rehabilitation is limited by cost, or residence in medically
      underserved rural settings. To meet the pressing need for innovative cost-effective
      rehabilitation options, the investigators developed, tested and licensed a prototype virtual
      environment (VE) for post-stroke arm rehabilitation. Its custom built design motivates
      extended practice of specific arm motor skills known to improve quality of life. Excitingly,
      practice sessions do not require direct therapist supervision. Published pilot data
      demonstrated improved real-world arm movement after VE training. These promising initial
      results led to software upgrades that will now enable installation and testing in the primary
      markets for this technology; stroke rehabilitation hospitals, and patients' homes. The
      overall goal for this small pilot study is to test the feasibility of self-directed VE
      practice in these settings measured by movement repetitions and motor skill improvement. To
      that end, this project will address the following Specific Aims (1) Determine the number of
      daily movement repetitions and treatment effect achieved by inpatients in a stroke
      rehabilitation hospital who self-direct VE practice sessions during non-therapy hours
      (evenings, weekends) compared to standard evening activities; and (2) Determine the number of
      daily movement repetitions and treatment effect achieved by in-home stroke survivors who
      self-direct daily VE practice sessions compared to a group of in-home survivors with a
      standard self-directed exercise program.

    <measure>Paretic arm use</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of paretic arm use will be measured by wrist worn accelerometers. Subjects will be shown how to don/doff wristwatch sized triaxial Actigraph accelerometers (GT3X+ Activity Monitor; ActiGraph LLC) by securing a Velcro band on the dorsal aspect of each wrist proximal to the wrist joint. Subjects will be instructed to don the accelerometers each time they engaged in either the computer game or standard activity and wear them only for the duration of the activity. The accelerometers will be stored in a box during other times. Accelerometry data will be recorded in 1 minute epochs as the number of arm activity counts. At the final study evaluation session, data will be used to create a ratio of paretic to non-paretic arm activity counts. A value of 1 will indicate bilateral arm use, a value higher than 1 will indicate that the paretic arm was used more than the non-paretic arm, and a value less than 1 will indicate that the paretic arm was used less than the non-paretic arm.</description>

Subjects will be instructed to play the computer game &quot;as much as you want to every day for 7 days.&quot; Inpatient stroke patients: The interactive computer game will be installed at a local inpatient stroke rehabilitation hospital. Subjects will be instructed to &quot;play this game as much as you want to during non-therapy hours (evenings and weekends) over the next 7 days.&quot;</description>
