  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a collaboration between investigators and two community partners: a youth
      employment program and an urban farm. The community partners hire 300+ adolescents for summer
      jobs at various organizations. Approximately 120 adolescents will be employed with the urban
      farm site. As one component of their program evaluation plan, investigators will evaluate
      change in BMI of participants. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a reduction
      in BMI of those participants working at the urban farm site.

      The investigators will measure height/weight/BMI of all participants located at the urban
      farm site. Investigators will also collect demographic data as well as other social data
      (example: food security).

    <description>The intervention consists of diabetes prevention education sessions focusing on increasing physical activity and decreasing the intake of sugared drinks while increasing intake of fruits and vegetables. The 2-hr sessions occur weekly for 6 weeks. Height and weight is measured for each consenting participant at baseline and after 6 weeks. Participants are also asked to complete a short questionnaire to collect demographic and knowledge data. Outcome measures include: BMI, knowledge of physical activity and dietary habits conducive to diabetes prevention, and feelings of food insecurity.</description>
