      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous immunotherapy
      (SCIT) with House Dust Mite (HDM) extract in patients with rhinoconjunctivitis with or
      without associated mild asthma and sensitized to HDM. In addition,surrogate efficacy
      parameters will be evaluated: immunoglobulin level changes and skin reactivity.

      It will be recruited 50 patients susceptible to receive SCIT with HDM extract along 5
      participating spanish sites.

      Primary endpoint of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous
      immunotherapy in depot presentation and quick pattern in patients with rhinoconjunctivitis
      with or without mild asthma sensitized to house dust mites

      Secondary objective is to evaluate the indirect immunotherapy efficacy through the
      measurement of immunoglobulin level changes and cutaneous reactivity

      The aim of present clinical trial is to go deeper into the safety of the vaccine of mixture
      of DPT and DF (50:50). Although this is the first clinical trial to date to be performed with
      this vaccine, there have been two clinical trials with the same formulation and DPT 100% as
      active ingredient( NºEudraCT: 2009-016277-15 and NºEudraCT: 2011-004583-30). Given that there
      is a remarkable cross-reactivity between the DPT and DF mites, the results of the two
      clinical trials conducted to date with subcutaneous depot vaccine with Dermatophagoides
      pteronyssinus 100% extract mite, are very significant

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must sign the informed consent form

          2. Patients must be between 18 and 60 years of age

          3. Patients with perennial allergic rhinoconjunctivitis against HDM during a minimum of 1
             year prior to study participation. Although allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is the
             pathology under study, the inclusion of patients with mild concomitant asthma is
             allowed (GINA 2015)

          4. Patients who obtained a prick test result ≥ 3 mm diameter to HDM. Positive and
             negative control of the test should give consistent results

          5. Patients with specific immunoglobulin E ≥ class 2 (CAP/PHADIA) to HDM

          6. Patients sensitized to HDM with clinically relevant symptoms in which treatment with
             HDM (50:50) vaccine is indicated
