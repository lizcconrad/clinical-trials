      Introduction: With population ageing and increasing Westernization breast cancer continues to
      be important health conditions among women in Hong Kong. Greater collaborative research
      efforts are needed to examine the questions about population screening for breast cancer, the
      aetiology of such lesions and outcomes of breast cancer during survivorship period. There is
      a lack of locally-relevant models for assessing breast cancer risk. Contribution of novel
      genetic factors to breast cancer, identification of the key and functional alleles in gene
      regions associated with risk of breast cancer as well as gene-environment interaction,
      requires further investigation in Chinese population. Prognostic research studies in the West
      may not be readily applicable to the Chinese population.

      Objectives: We aim to investigate the aetiology and outcomes of breast cancer in local
      Chinese by using case-control and cohort study design in the health care setting in Hong
      Kong. We aim to examine potential risk factors/biomarkers (both traditional and novel), and
      to build infrastructure and biobank for breast cancer surveillance. We will follow up cases
      prospectively as a survivor cohort.

      Methods: A hospital-based case-control study and a prospective survivor cohort study will be
      conducted. Consecutive incident breast cancer and DCIS cases (n=3,500) within a 24-month
      period in Hong Kong will be recruited from public hospitals, private hospitals and private
      practices; and controls will be selected by frequency-matching on factors such as age and
      hospital/clinic setting. Cases will be prospectively followed up over a 2-year period, and
      data collection will occur at baseline (within 24 weeks of diagnosis), 6 months, 1 and 2
      years following baseline assessment. Biologic samples (including both blood, and tumour and
      normal breast tissue samples from the cases, and blood samples from the controls) will be
      collected for later genetic and molecular study including WGS, GWAS, gene-environment
      interaction and molecular functional studies. Depending on availability of pathology samples
      and resources, additional studies such as tissue microarray block production will be
      considered and performed in future. Data will be analysed by traditional regression, EWAS and
      genetic association methods, whenever relevant.

      Public Health Implications: The repository of clinical, radiological and biological materials
      assembled through this case-control study will serve as a common, publicly accessible
      platform for subsequent functional analysis and scientific interrogation. The case-control
      findings would offer an improved understanding to the state of the science on aetiology of
      breast cancer in Chinese women. In the genomics analysis, potential refined classification of
      breast tumours may enhance our understanding, detection and follow-up of such lesions, as
      well as enable us to have more informed targeted and personalized treatment selection for our
      women population. The cohort study findings are important for developing an effective
      strategy for the improvement of overall survival and quality of life for the cancer survivors
      in Chinese population.

    <description>We will estimate individualized breast cancer probabilities based on information on relative risks and the baseline hazard rate in Hong Kong Chinese women population. Risk factors will include age, age at menarche, age at first birth, family history of breast cancer, prior breast benign disease diagnosis, menopausal status, dietary pattern. Structured interviews will be provided by our trained interviewers to collect these data by using our survey questionnaire.</description>
