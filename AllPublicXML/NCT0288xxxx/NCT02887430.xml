    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common health complaint in most societies. Many treatments for low back
      pain aim to reduce suffering quicken recovery and minimize recurrence or development of
      chronic disability. However, low back pain continues as a societal enigma. The aim of this
      study was to investigate whether the eight therapy session with foot reflexology can reduce
      pain intensity when applied as an addition to standards care of low back pain according to
      the Malaysian low back pain management guidelines. Analysis of health-related quality of life
      will also be carried out.
