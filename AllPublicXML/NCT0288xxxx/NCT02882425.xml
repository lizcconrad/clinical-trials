  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this phase 1 study is to investigate the absolute bio-availability of
      a single oral dose of selexipag, i.e., to assess the amount of selexipag which reaches the
      blood when administered as an oral tablet (ACT-293987) compared to an intravenous
      administration in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot phase was conducted in 3 male subjects before the main phase for assessment of
      absolute bio-availability conducted in 16 other male subjects. The pilot phase aimed to
      determine the intravenous dose to be used in the main phase based on safety data and
      pharmacokinetics data.

    <measure>Absolute bioavailability (F) of selexipag</measure>
    <time_frame>From pre-dose to 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>F was calculated using the areas under the plasma concentrations curves extrapolated to infinity [AUC(0-inf)] after oral (po) and intravenous (iv) doses, obtained during the main phase, and using the following formula: AUC(0-inf)po * iv dose / AUC(0-inf)iv * oral dose</description>

    <time_frame>From pre-dose to 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-inf) was calculated from the concentration-time profile of selexipag after both oral and intravenous administration during the main phase</description>

    <description>AUC from time 0 to time t of the last measured concentration above the limit of quantification [AUC(0-t)] were calculated for selexipag and its active metabolite, from their respective concentration-time profiles, after both intravenous (pilot phase and main phase) and oral administration (main phase) of selexipag</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of selexipag and its active metabolite</measure>
    <time_frame>From pre-dose to 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
