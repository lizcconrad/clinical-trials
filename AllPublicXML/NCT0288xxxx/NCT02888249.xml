  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the abuse liability of cigarettes with
      altered composition (cigarettes differing in composition; e.g., tar levels, amount of sugar,
      casings) is reduced relative to standard composition cigarettes.

      The proposed study will determine the abuse liability of altered composition cigarettes
      compared to standard cigarettes using a behavioral economics abuse-liability approach.
      Behavioral economic demand analysis constitutes a comprehensive examination of drug
      reinforcement and abuse liability. Laboratory determination of cigarette consumption under
      various response requirements will occur before and after 3 weeks of at-home exposure, with
      participants randomized to cigarettes varying in composition to determine the role of
      experience on the abuse-liability of various cigarettes. Abuse liability will be assessed by
      2 essential demand metrics: lower demand intensity and increased demand elasticity, as well
      as other demand metrics and subjective ratings of &quot;liking&quot;. The study will also determine the
      degree to which altered composition cigarettes may substitute for standard composition
      cigarettes - testing whether an altered composition policy would achieve the goal of reducing
      standard cigarette consumption.

    <description>This double-blind study will systematically determine the abuse liability of altered composition cigarettes using a behavioral economics abuse-liability approach. Altered composition cigarettes (e.g., cigarettes differing in casings, sugars, tar levels, moisture) may result in decreased intake and decreased dependence, although critical questions remain regarding the abuse-liability of altered composition cigarettes, whether exposure to these cigarettes reduces use, and whether altered composition cigarettes will substitute for standard cigarettes. The addictive effects and abuse liability of altered composition cigarettes, therefore, are not well understood, and will be tested in this study.</description>
