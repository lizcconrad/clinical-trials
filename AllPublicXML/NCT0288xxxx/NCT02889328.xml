  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III study of regorafenib 160 mg once daily on
      intermittent dosing schedule of 3 weeks on treatment followed by 1 weeks off demonstrated the
      significant benefit of regorafenib in terms of PFS in patients with GISTs who had failed to
      both imatinib and sunitinib. However, there are concerns that tumors and tumor-related
      symptoms may be progressed during off treatment period. Investigators hypothesize that
      continuous dosing schedule of regorafenib might be feasible and effective to prevent disease
      flare on off-treatment period. Based on the results of previous dose escalation study for
      continuous regorafenib dosing, we investigate the 100 mg daily dose of regorafenib in
      patients with TKI-refractory GISTs.
