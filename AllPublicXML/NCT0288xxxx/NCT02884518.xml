  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dopamine synthesis capacity by using [18
      fluorine(F)]-DOPA PET for patients with schizophrenia in the maintenance phase can predict
      treatment discontinuation.

      There are two groups: the healthy control group (n=12) and the patient group (n=26). The
      patient group recruits subjects diagnosed with first episode psychosis which occurred within
      2 years and having been treated with antipsychotics for 1 year. Participants will complete
      clinical scales and undergo PET scans. Subjects in the patient group will receive a reduced
      intake of antipsychotics by 25% after each week of the four-week period in which they will
      also undergo PET imaging at the baseline, 7 week, and 8 week marks to detect the correlation
      between the capacity of presynaptic dopamine and relapse in the patients discontinuing
      treatment.
