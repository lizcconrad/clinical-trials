  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cohort including more than 100 maintenance hemodialysis patients will be followed up
      according to a certain Following-up System of Native Arteriovenous Fistulae (AVF)
      prospectively. The assessment results of the Following-up System of AVF help the physicians
      make decisions of AVF surgery and puncture methods. The results of this study would identify
      the effect of the system on survival of AVF. Other 100 hemodialysis patients from other
      centers will be treated by routine protocol and compared to the experiment goup.

      The Following-up System of AVF includes 3 stages. In the 1st stage, before AVF surgery
      operation, the contents of Following-up System of AVF include history, physical exam,
      ultrasonography detection. The assesment results will guide the methods of the AVF surgery
      operation. In the 2nd stage, before AVF puncture firstly and 3 months after AVF operation,
      the contents of Following-up System of AVF include physical exam and ultrasonography
      detection. The results will help the nurses and doctors make a decision of the method of AVF
      puncture. In the 3rd stage, during the following 2 years after AVF puncture successfully, the
      contents include physical exam and ultrasonography detection regularly. The adequacy of
      hemodialysis by using AVF will be assessed by urea clearance index (Kt/V).

      The data of patients in other hemodialysis centers will be recorded and compared to the
      patients in experiment group.

    <description>The AVF can not be used for hemodialysis treatment 3 months after surgery, which it is defined as Primary Failure of AVF. The primary failure of AVF is regarded as the primary outcome of the patients who were followed up. The ratio of primary failure will be compared between two groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life time of AVF</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The life time of an available AVF since the AVF is functionable. The life time of an AVF is a period time from the AVF used for hemodialysis treatment at first time to the last time when the AVF can not be used for hemodialysis therapy. Since the AVF will be punctured in every hemodialysis session, the function of AVF were detected during every treatment session (3 times per week).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Urea clearance index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>As a parameter of hemodialysis adequacy, urea clearance index (Kt/V) will be detected very month. The Kt/V should be larger than 1.2 , which were regarded as being adequate in the hemodialysis session. This parameter will be tested every month.</description>

    <description>Patients with AVF will be followed up by a preset following-up system. Interventions would be administered according to the assessment for AVF, which including the surgery and puncture of AVF. For AVF surgery, a certain vein would be used in the operation according to the assessment results. For AVF puncture, the methods, such as 'button hole', 'rope ladder', dwelling needle, would be selected prospectively according to the assessment results.</description>
