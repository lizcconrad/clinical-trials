  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only 24 cases of Campylobacter bone and joint infection (BJI) have been reported worldwide
      between 1955 and 2008. Between 2010 and 2012, 7 cases were observed in two University
      hospitals in France. This increasing number of cases raises several issues. Are they the
      consequences of better detections and reporting, or are they reflecting any epidemiologic
      changes? For answering these questions, we performed a 10 year (2002-2012) retrospective
      multicenter (6 centers) study on BJI (native and implanted joints) due to Campylobacter
      species.

      Methods: By browsing the microbiological database of 6 BJI French reference centers, we
      collected all cases due to Campylobacter species between 2002 and 2012, including first and
      relapse cases. Clinical, microbiological and treatment features were analyzed using
      descriptive statistics.

      Results: 14 episodes of BJI due to Campylobacter spp were identified in 10 patients. Mean age
      was 76.8 y.o. (63-96). Sex ratio M/F was 1.5. Nine patient had hip (n=6), knee (n=2), and
      shoulder (n=2) implants. Immunosuppression was observed in 6 patients (3 cancers, 1
      cirrhosis, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, 1 corticosteroid treatment). During the 10 primary cases:
      all patients had fever and 2 presented digestive symptoms. Campylobacter spp were isolated on
      per operative samples in 5 patients. One of them presented positive blood culture. 5 patients
      had joint punctures: all of them were positives. Campylobacter species were C. fetus (n=7),
      C. coli (n=2) and C. spp (1). Strains were resistant to nalidixic acid (=10), ciprofloxacin
      (n=4), erythromycin (n=3) or cefotaxime (n=2). Only one C. fetus was susceptible to all
      antibiotics tested. Surgical treatment was performed in 8 patients (2 two-stage procedure, 6
      irrigation). The mean duration of adapted antibiotherapy was 77 days (26-237). 3 out of 4
      relapse cases were due to C. fetus. All were resistant to more than one antibiotic classes.
