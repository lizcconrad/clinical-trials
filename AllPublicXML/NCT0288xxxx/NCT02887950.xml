  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For women aged between 55 and 65 years weight gain is a major health concern. Obesity is an
      important risk factor for multiple diseases (e.g. metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus,
      hypertension and cardiovascular disease), and several studies have shown that the transition
      to menopause is associated with adverse changes in body composition. In particular, it is
      common to observe the accumulation of adipose tissue in the abdominal region which is
      believed to be an important determinant of the increase in cardiovascular risk.

      The first-line strategy for weight management in overweight / obese subjects is the
      modification of dietary habits and lifestyle in terms of physical activity. However,
      nowadays, there is also a growing interest in complementary therapies (i.e. herbal
      supplements, acupuncture, etc ...) that can be used alone or in combination to achieve more
      consistent results. In this context, preliminary evidence supports the potential role of some
      compounds of vegetal origin such as resistant starch, epigallocatechin gallate and
      chlorogenic acid as adjuvants of dietary therapy for overweight.

      These nutrients may be an important therapeutic aid for overweight subjects. However, in
      support of their use, the evidence from good quality trials is limited.
