      Dental treatment for children should be done in a calm atmosphere and without pain. Oral

      in the dental setting which compare analgesic effect when administered before Vs after the

      Dental treatment for children should be done in a calm atmosphere and without pain in purpose
      to achieve a positive feelings and response towards dental treatment.Postoperative pain is
      the main issue which may cause a negative attitude of the child to dental treatment in future
      appointment. One of the affective options to deal with this pain is to give analgesic drug
      before the initiative of treatment which should continue its effect during and may also after
      treatment which is known as &quot;preemptive analgesia. Oral Propacetamol has been shown to be
      effective in a variety of postsurgical pain models. In double blind clinical trials single or
      multiple dose of intravenous paracetamol, generally provided significantly better analgesic
      effect than placebo treatment in adults' patients who had undergone dental, orthopedic or
      gynecological surgery. There is considerable evidence that the analgesic effect of
      paracetamol is central and is due to activation of descending serotonergic pathways, but its
      primary site of action may still be inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by its selective
      inhibition of Cox-2 isoenzyme.

      At the best of the investigators knowledge, there are no studies on paracetamol preemptive
      analgesia effect on the pediatric population in the dental setting which compare analgesic
      effect when administered before Vs after the dental treatment.

      The investigators hypothesis is that preoperative intravenous paracetamol are helpful in the
      prevention or modification of postoperative pain in children undergoing dental treatment.

      The primary outcome of this study is to investigate the post dental treatment analgesic
      effect of intravenous paracetamol in children when administered before compared to after
      dental treatment.
