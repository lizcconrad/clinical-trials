      Program： Clinical Study of Relationship Between Granulocyte Activation, HDAC2 and Severe
      Asthma Aim：The early prediction of severe asthma, early intervention on the disease, reduce
      the family and the national finance.

      design:This study is a single center randomized controlled trial designed by the Department
      of respiratory medicine, Xijing Hospital, as the main research unit.Compare the case
      group(severe asthma group and mild-and-moderate asthma group) and control group(healthy
      control group) by detecting the activity of MPO、NE、MMP-9 and ECP in the peripheral blood and
      the activity of HDAC2 in PBMCs of patients.

      case:60

      Case selection:

      Inclusion criteria: age 18-75 years old; diagnosis of asthma was clear; informed consent was
      signed.

      Exclusion criteria: poor compliance; cognitive ability is low; psychiatric disorders need to
      be combined with psychotropic medication.

      Application of SPSS 19 statistical software. Measurement data were expressed as mean ±
      standard deviation.

      First the data is normality tested and homogeneity of variance tested, according to the
      measurement data of normal distribution by SNK single factor analysis of variance; does not
      conform to the normal distribution of measurement data, using the Kruskal Wallis non
      parametric test. P &lt; 0.05 for the difference was statistically significant.
