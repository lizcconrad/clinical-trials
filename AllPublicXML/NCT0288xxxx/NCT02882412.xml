  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term use of opioids for chronic pain is a growing health and social problem, mainly
      because of the risk of dependence. Buprenorphine/naloxone is used as substitution therapy for
      opioid dependence. This substitution therapy in patients with opioid dependence lessens
      withdrawal symptoms and craving. There is limited research on the effectiveness of
      buprenorphine/naloxone in patients with chronic pain and iatrogenic opioid dependence. The
      primary aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone in
      patients suffering from chronic pain and an iatrogenic induced dependence on opioids. This
      study will investigate the effects of opioid substitution by buprenorphine/naloxone in
      patients suffering from chronic pain using long-term opioids, with pain and withdrawal
      symptoms as primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures will be craving, substance
      use, psychiatric comorbidity and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open-label observational cohort study (exploratory pilot).
      Investigators will include 20 patients between 18 and 65 years with chronic pain and
      dependence on opioids, who were referred by their physician for replacement of opioids to
      buprenorphine/naloxone. Exclusion criteria are contraindications for buprenorphine/naloxone
      and patients with psychiatric disorders requiring acute treatment. The degree of pain and
      withdrawal symptoms will be assessed by the Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) measurement
      and the following questionnaires: Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Objective Withdrawal Scale (OWS)
      and Subjective Withdrawal Scale (SWS). Secondary, craving and substance use/degree of opioid
      dependence will be studied using the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) and Obsessive
      Compulsive Drug using Scale (OCDS). Psychiatric comorbidity will be assessed using the
      following questionnaires: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Personality Inventory
      for DSM-5 (PID 5-BF), The 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Inventory of Depressive
      Symptomatology (IDS), the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) and Mini International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). These questionnaires are part of the standard assessment
      at the department of psychiatry at the Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen. The
      EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ5D) will be used to assess the quality of life.
      During the replacement of opioids to buprenorphine/naloxone, the buprenorphine/naloxone
      protocol will be used.
