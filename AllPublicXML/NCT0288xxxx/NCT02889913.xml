  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers are frequent. There are no epidemiological studies available in France, but
      international studies estimate the prevalence between 0.045 and 0.63% of the total
      population, prevalence increases with age, reaching 5% of patients over 80 years.
      Extrapolating these prevalences in the French population between 28 000 and 395 000 people
      are affected in France a leg ulcer.

      It is a costly disease. In 2001, a French study conducted among 800 physicians, including
      85.7% of general practitioners, involving more than 1000 patients with venous ulcers, it was
      estimated that the total cost of treatment per patient average was 888 32 euros. This is
      truly a public health problem.

      Leg ulcers are in 80% of cases of vascular causes (venous, arterial or arteriovenous mixed).
      However, there are rare causes of ulcers: skin carcinoma, infectious ulcers and vasculitis.
      These ulcers rare causes require specific treatments that can often heal. To diagnose, to
      perform a skin biopsy. Thus, the general practitioner must know when to put the indication
      for biopsy of a leg ulcer.

      Goal :

      Analyzing the last 100 consecutive skin biopsies performed in patients carriers of chronic
      leg ulcers, followed in the vascular medicine department of the Hospital Saint Joseph Paris,
      to determine:

        -  The reasons which motivated the doctor make the indication of biopsy:

        -  Disease duration of ulcer

        -  Unusual clinical features

        -  Other signs associated with ulcer

        -  Absence of a satisfactory explanation vascular

        -  The pathological results Purpose: To clear a typical profile ulcers biopsy

      Methodology :

        -  Retrospective, single-center,

        -  Acquisition of data: via the pathology laboratory of the hospital will be collected the
           last 100 consecutive biopsies performed with leg ulcers in vascular medicine department
           of the hospital Saint Joseph Paris, between 1 January 2013 and the October 1, 2013. Then
           be analyzed all paper and electronic records of these patients.

        -  Grid and Analysis:

             -  Patient histories,

             -  vascular profile of patients,

             -  clinical and chronological criteria of the ulcer,

             -  Other signs associated with ulcer

             -  Results of histological biopsies.

        -  The data will be made anonymous on the grid for collection by a numbering system 1 100.
