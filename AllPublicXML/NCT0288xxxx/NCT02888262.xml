    <textblock>
      This longitudinal study aims to identify 1) a composite blood-based biomarker, 2) a composite
      electronic Smartphone-based biomarker and 3) a neurocognitive signature for bipolar disorder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      The study will include 300 patients with newly diagnosed/first episode bipolar disorder, 200
      healthy siblings or child family members and 100 healthy individuals without a family history
      of affective disorder. All individuals will be investigated with repeated blood tests,
      Smartphone recordings, neuropsychological tests and brain imaging during a five to ten year
      study period.

             first-generation family history of affective disorders recruited among blood donors
             from the Blood Bank at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, as in prior studies.
