  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether high dose of radiation therapy (RT) are
      effective over standard 6-week radiation treatment in patients with breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypo-fractionation (several large fractions as the only radiation treatment) for breast
      cancer irradiation was common in the forties and 50s and, while very successful in achieving
      tumor control, was found to leave significantly inferior cosmetic results due to severe
      fibrosis and telangiectasia compared to those obtained with multiple fraction regimens
      (38-40). These complications were due to the use of very large fields, with the inclusion of
      a large proportion of uninvolved skin and tissue surrounding the tumor.

      Based on these assumptions, a few large fractions can be safely delivered to breast cancers
      provided that 1) the target volume is sufficiently small and 2) the radiation technique
      assures maximum sparing of the surrounding normal tissue. Conformal RT to the tumor bed of T1
      breast cancers satisfies both requirements.

    <description>Ultrasound is ideal for imaging soft tissues unobstructed by bone and has been used successfully in conjunction with the treatment of prostate cancer to verify compliance between the daily location of the prostate and the planned location with respect to the treatment linear accelerator. By using ultrasound to image the post-operative tumor bed of the breast in &quot;real-time&quot;, the operator may automatically align the tumor bed with treatment machine on each day of treatment</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Post-menopausal women (at least 2 years without menstrual period):

        hysterectomized patients need follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) confirmation of
        post-menopausal status.

          -  Original tumor non-palpable (mammographically detected).

          -  Small primary tumor (pT1) breast cancer, excised with negative margins (defined as at
             least a 5 mm margin).

          -  N0 or sentinel node negative or N0 clinically if the tumor is &lt;1 cm in size.

          -  Patient offered six weeks of post-segmental mastectomy conventional radiation therapy
             and declined.

          -  Prescribed antihormonal therapy as part of their management.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast.

          -  Presence of a proportion of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the pathology specimen
             which is compatible with extensive intraductal component (EIC).

          -  Women incapable of providing their own consent. Mental status will be assessed by the
             Principal Investigator using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Mini-Mental
             Status Examination.

          -  Women with a diagnosis of multifocal breast cancer.
