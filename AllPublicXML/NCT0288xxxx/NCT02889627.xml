    <textblock>
      Increasing evidences showed the microbiota effects on neuropsychiatric disorders. This
      clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation
      for epilepsy.

    <textblock>
      Very few literatures reported the clinical use of microbiota or bacteria for brain diseases.
      The most effective strategy for reconstruction of gut microbiota should be fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMT for
      epilepsy. Patients were diagnosed as epilepsy by electroencephalogram (EEG) and MRI and
      clinical data when the study began and then were randomly assigned to groups that received
      single FMT with fecal from healthy donors or placebo with equal water. Patients (blinded)
      were required to stop antiepileptic drugs after FMT and the follow up last for 6 months.The
      primary outcome measure was the frequency of the seizures. Secondary outcome measure were the
      examination of EEG and MRI.
