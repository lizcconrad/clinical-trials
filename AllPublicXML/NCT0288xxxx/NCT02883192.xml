      Cesarean section is a frequent procedure in the obstetric surgery. The most widely used
      anesthesia technique for cesarean delivery is the spinal anesthesia, in our Institute over
      than 90% of the elective cesarean sections are under spinal anesthesia, however this kind of
      anesthesia frequently associated with, side effects that affect primarily the parturient and
      the fetal health. The incidence of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension and bradycardia is
      high as 60% in the obstetric population . Most authors agree that hypotension presents when
      the systolic blood pressure decrease under 90 mmHg, or when there is a reduction from
      baseline of more than 20-30 %. Augmentation of the intravascular volume with crystalloids and
      vasopressors is the cornerstone of the treatment of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension,
      the vasopressors usually used are the α and β receptors agonist ephedrine and the selective α
      agonist phenylephrine that, gain popularity in the last years, because it's more efficacy in
      maintaining the umbilical cord blood PH and the Apgar score of the neonates. However many
      studies showed that it was inefficient and no intervention reliably prevents hypotension
      after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section and, bradycardia can occur from shift in cardiac
      autonomic balance toward the parasympathetic system from activation of left ventricular
      mechanoreceptors after sudden decrease in left ventricle volume causing the Bezold Jarish
      Reflex (BJR). Animal studies suggest that 5-HT( serotonin) may play an important factor
      associated inducing the BJR and this effect can be blocked at the 5-HT3 receptor using the
      serotonin inhibitor Ondansetron, commonly used antiemetic . Despite the fact that Ondansetron
      was evaluated in the management of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension in large
      heterogeneity and small samples , the need for more investigation in big number of cesarean
      sections still needed.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the preventive use of Ondansetron on the
      prevention of hypotension and the amount of vasopressor phenylephrine needed to control the
      hypotension after spinal anesthesia and the possible effect on the umbilical cord blood PH
      and the Apgar score in one minute after delivery.
