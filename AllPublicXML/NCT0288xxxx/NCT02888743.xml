    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab and to
      see how well they work with or without high or low-dose radiation therapy in treating
      patients with colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the
      body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving durvalumab and tremelimumab with radiation therapy may
      work better in treating patients with colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and tolerability of combined checkpoint blockade with MEDI4736
      (durvalumab) and tremelimumab alone or with high or low-dose radiation in non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). (NSCLC Cohort) II. To compare the overall response (excluding the irradiated
      lesion[s]) between combined checkpoint blockade with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab alone or
      combined checkpoint blockade with low or high dose radiation. (NSCLC Cohort) III. To assess
      safety and tolerability of combined checkpoint blockade with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab with
      high or low-dose radiation. (Colorectal Cohort) IV. To determine the overall response rate
      (excluding the irradiated lesion[s]) with combined checkpoint blockade with MEDI4736 and
      tremelimumab with either low or high dose radiation. (Colorectal Cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate median progression-free survival and overall survival. (NSCLC Cohort) II. To
      determine local control within the irradiated field(s) and abscopal response rates. (NSCLC
      Cohort) III. To evaluate associations between PD-L1 expression as well as levels of
      infiltrating CD3+, CD8+ T-cells and overall response. (NSCLC Cohort) IV. To explore changes
      in PD-L1 expression, circulating T-cell populations, T-cell infiltration, ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) expression, spatial relationship of immune markers, and mutational burden as a result
      of low or high dose radiation. (NSCLC Cohort) V. To estimate median progression-free survival
      and overall survival. (Colorectal Cohort) VI. To determine local control within the
      irradiated field and abscopal response rates. (Colorectal Cohort) VII. To evaluate
      associations between PD-L1 expression as well as levels of infiltrating CD3+ CD8+ T-cells and
      overall response. (Colorectal Cohort) VIII. To evaluate changes between PD-L1 expression as
      well as levels of infiltrating CD3+, CD8+ T-cells induced by targeted low or high dose
      radiation. (Colorectal Cohort) IX. To explore changes in circulating T-cell populations,
      T-cell infiltration, RNA expression, spatial relationship of immune markers, and mutational
      burden as a result of low or high dose radiation.

      OUTLINE: Patients with NSCLC are randomized to Arm A, B, or C. Patients with colorectal
      cancer are randomized to Arm B or C.

      COHORT 1: Patients with NSCLC are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes
      every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients then receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes 4 weeks after last combination
      dose for up to 9 additional doses.

      ARM B: Patients receive tremelimumab and durvalumab and as in Arm A. Beginning at week 2,
      patients receive high dose radiation therapy once per day (QD) over 10 days for up to 3
      fractions.

      ARM C: Patients receive tremelimumab and durvalumab and as in Arm A. Beginning at week 2,
      patients receive low dose radiation therapy every 6 hours twice per day (BID) on weeks 2, 6,
      10 and 14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 12 weeks.

             potentially indicated and could be safely delivered at the radiation doses specified
             in this protocol; this lesion must not be the only measurable lesion so that it is
             still possible to determine the response rate outside of the radiation treatment
             field; this lesion must not be within the central nervous system (CNS) (brain or
             spinal cord) or requiring urgent or emergent palliative radiation given the timing of
             radiation specified on this protocol; furthermore, this lesion:

                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)

               -  Women &gt;= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt; 1 year ago, had

             last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last
             dose of durvalumab monotherapy; non-sterilised male partners of a female patient must
             use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period; cessation of birth control
             after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician; not engaging in
             sexual activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout
             period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and
             the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control; female patients
             should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period

          -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing
             potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after
             receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days
             after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy; not engaging in sexual
             activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method,
             and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception; male patients
             should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period

             effective method of contraception throughout this period

          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is

                  prior to study enrollment (and not obtained prior to progression on a PD-1/PD-L1
                  inhibitor) if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical
                  risk; tumor lesions used for fresh biopsies should be the same lesions to be
                  irradiated when possible and should not be the same lesions used as Response
                  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) target lesions, unless there are no
                  other lesions accessible; additional, optional archival tumor tissue is also
                  requested from before the prior PD-1 directed therapy
