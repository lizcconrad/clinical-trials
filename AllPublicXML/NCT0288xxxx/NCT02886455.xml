    <description>This is a sub-study testing the effect of real output applied under two adhesive strips on the skin at two different time points (4 and 24 hours).
There are two visits:
Visit 1:
Two adhesive strips (standard adhesive strip and new adhesive strip)contaminated with the subjects own output are applied on the peristomal skin and allowed to sit for 4 hours before being removed
Visit 2: Two adhesive strips (standard adhesive strip and new adhesive strip)contaminated with the subjects own output are applied on the peristomal skin and allowed to sit for 24 hours before being removed</description>
