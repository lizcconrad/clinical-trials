  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minnesota Healthy Brain Initiative will be an ongoing project that aims to increase awareness
      regarding brain health and its maintenance as well as increasing awareness of the impact of
      alcohol on brain function. In the immediate future, we hope to obtain data from a non-injured
      normative, diverse population represented by the state fair patrons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that a non-invasive 30-minute test, requiring a subject to complete
      questionnaires and watch images on a TV screen, will yield information relevant to both
      diagnosis and prognosis of neurological state. To clarify, these tests will not produce
      information that would involve a diagnostic finding for the participants. We will measure eye
      movements under a range of visual conditions, including saccades, fixations, smooth pursuit,
      scan paths and optico-kinetic nystagmus

      After receiving proper introduction and signing the proper consent forms, the subject will
      receive instructions to carry out cognitive assessments and answer verbal questionnaires. The
      subject will also undergo eye tracking. In order to validate the data collected by our
      eye-trackers, we may ask the subject to complete a non-invasive vision assessment and a
      breathalyzer assessment. Due to the nature of the breathalyzer assessment, we have decided
      not to administer the breathalyzer assessment to subjects who are under the age of 21 and/or
      pregnant. We also refuse to disclose the results of the breathalyzer assessment to the
      subject since the data will be collected only for research purposes. Subjects' eye movements
      will be tracked binocularly at a fixed distance from a computer monitor over a brief time
      period. The visual stimuli will be video clips appropriate for a general or pediatric
      audience. If at any point the subject becomes uncomfortable, the procedure will be aborted
      and can be resumed at a later time.
