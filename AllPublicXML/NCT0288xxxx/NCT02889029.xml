      Management of complex airway stenoses with dedicated tailored stents wrought by 3D
      computer-assisted conception

      Dedicated Airway Stents for Central Airway Stenoses

      DASCAS

      Toulouse University Hospital is the sponsor of this research.

      This research will be conducted with the support of AnatomikModeling and ADERSPOT

        -  Background: Tracheobronchial stent are devices designed to manage central airway
           stenoses of various origins. Their shape and sizes are however not suitable for stenosis
           of complex anatomy.

        -  Purpose: The investigators propose to test the feasibility and safety of treating
           complex airway stenoses with dedicated tailored stents wrought by 3D computer-assisted
           conception

      Abstract: Central airway obstruction is currently managed with non-personalized stents, which
      are usually efficient but lead to severe and potentially lethal complications in 10% of cases
      (stent migration, obstructive granuloma, perforation, hemoptysis). These stents seem
      particularly unsuited for anatomically complex stenosis.

      Dedicated airway stents (wrought and tailored by 3D computer-assisted conception based on 3D
      chest CT-scan), by fitting perfectly tracheal or bronchial anatomy, should dramatically
      improve the tolerance and safety of such prostheses.

      This first feasibility study, dedicated to patients suffering from anatomically complex
      stenosis will test the safety of treating patients with these new approach. It should lead to
      larger studies evaluating these new types of stents in larger indications.

      After 3D computer-assisted modelization of airways, a virtual prosthesis and its shape are
      designed and the shape of the stent is wrought by 3D-machining by AnatomikModeling®. The
      stent is then build and sterilized by Sebbin® and inserted during rigid bronchoscopy on the
      same terms as pre-existing models.

      Close follow up is then conducted, including clinical evaluation after one week, three and
      six months; spirometry at one week and 6 months and chest CT-scan at one week.

      Study design: Prospective monocentric feasibility study

      Arm number or label and arm type: Only one experimental arm

      Interventions:

      After signature of a informed consent

      Collection of clinical data (age, sex, etiology, site and mechanism of the stenosis, previous
      treatments dyspnea, quality of life (VQ11 questionnaire))

      Chest CT-scan without contrast under continuous positive pressure

      Spirometry (peak flow, FEV1)

      Computer-assisted modelization of the shape of the prosthesis using 3D reconstruction of
      CT-scan

      Machining of the shape in Ertacetal® (AnatomikModeling®)

      Fabrication and sterilization of the stent in silicon (Sebbin®)

      Insertion of the stent under rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia

      Clinical follow-up at one week, 3 months and 6 months

      Chest CT-scan without contrast at 1 week, spirometry at 1 week and 6 months

      Number of subjects : 10 patients

      Statistical analysis:

      For the primary outcome, percentages of procedures conducted without complication at 1 week,
      3 months, and 6 months and their confidence interval at 95% and incidences at 1 week, 3
      months and 6 months for each complication will be calculated.

      For secondary outcomes:

        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of dyspnea (improvement of at least
           one point of NYHA score) at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months and their confidence interval
           at 95% will be calculated.

        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of quality of life (improvement of
           at least 10% of VQ11 score) at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months and their confidence
           interval at 95% will be calculated.

        -  Percentages of procedures conducted with improvement of functional parameters
           (improvement of at least 20% of DEP or FEV1) at 1 week and 6 months and their confidence
           interval at 95% will be calculated.

        -  Percentage of procedures conducted with radiologic congruence of the stent at 1 week and
           its confidence interval at 95% will be calculated.
