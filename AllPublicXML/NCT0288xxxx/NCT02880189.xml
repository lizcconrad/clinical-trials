    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the impact of weight loss achieved with the IGB on NASH
      with early fibrosis in a select cohort of patients with obesity preselected to have a high
      pre-test probability of having NASH with early fibrosis based on MRE-Hepatogram. In addition,
      this study will explore potential non-invasive imaging criteria for NASH and early fibrosis
      using EUS-Elastography.

    <description>Patients with suspicion for Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) at the center undergo MRE-Hepatogram sequence to classify their disease as grade 0 (simple steatosis), grade 1 (Steatohepatitis with no fibrosis), grade 2 (Steatohepatitis with early fibrosis), grade 3 (Steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis). Those with evidence of early fibrosis will be referred for IGB placement and during the same endoscopy session will undergo EUS guided core liver biopsy. At the time of endoscopic removal of the IGB (after 6 months), a second EUS guided liver biopsy will be performed. NAS, Steatohepatitis resolution, and fibrosis status (regression, stabilization, or progression) compared to the index biopsy will be assessed and compared to the paired MRE-Hepatogram results.</description>
