  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to examine the effects of a functional resistance exercise
      programme that closely replicates daily activities and their effects on quality of life, body
      composition and functional fitness in cancer survivors. This study will also use a supervised
      and group based exercise setting to help with socialisation and confidence with an aim to
      improve the exercise experience. Eligible participants should be 18-90 years old, been
      treated for colorectal cancer (stages I-IV) in the previous 3 months to five years and with
      no limitations to exercise. The study will include a 12-week exercise period where
      participants will be randomly allocated to the control group or to take part in 32 supervised
      one-hour group exercise sessions involving exercises to target the whole body at a moderate
      intensity which will take place in the Mountbatten Centre, Pyramids Centre, Fareham Leisure
      Centre or Horizons Leisure Centres. Depending on participants' membership status those in the
      control group could use the centre's exercise referral programme, which has a cost attached,
      or they will be encouraged to meet national physical activity recommendations by walking 30
      minutes per day on most days of the week. The only difference between the two groups will be
      the supervised group functional resistance training. At the beginning and end of the 12-week
      study period a number of health-related fitness tests will be performed to assess health
      outcomes, such as resting blood pressure &amp; heart rate, respiratory function, body fat
      measures (body mass index, waist circumference and body fat %), functional performance
      measurements, handgrip strength, a 6 minute walk test and self-efficacy to regulate exercise
      and measures of quality of life questionnaires. Participants will be provided with their own
      results and an overview of the whole study data.

      Potential volunteers will be identified by the clinical care team and asked to contact the
      research team if they are interested in participating. The participants will be randomly
      allocated to either a control group or an exercise group and participate in the study. The
      control group will be asked to perform 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, such as 30
      minutes of brisk walking on 5 days a week. The exercise group will be asked to participate in
      the FRT exercise sessions over 12-weeks. The exercise sessions will be performed with a
      frequency of 2 times a week (for weeks 1-4) and three times a week (for weeks 5-12). The
      exercise programme will include 10 muscle-strengthening exercises and 5 recovery exercises
      (for example walking for one minute). All the exercises will be performed in a circuit
      fashion and the circuit will be performed 1 time (for weeks 1-2), for 2 times (for weeks 3-6)
      and finally for 3 times during the last six weeks of the study (for weeks 7-12). During the
      main part of the workout participants will have to perform 10 repetitions at a moderate to
      vigorous intensity (for weeks 1-12) for each resistance exercise and they will alternate
      every two resistance exercises with one active recovery exercise (e.g. walking). They will
      continue this pattern until they complete the circuit. Each circuit will last approximately
      15 minutes (1 minute for each of the 10 resistance exercise stations and 1 minute for each of
      the 5 active recovery stations)

      Both before and after their participation in the study, the researcher will take
      anthropometric (body weight, height, waist and hip circumference, body fat % and lean body
      mass) measurements and the participants will perform four physical fitness tests (6 minutes
      walking test, hand grip strength, lift and carry test, chair stand test) in order to assess
      the effects of exercise on their physical fitness and to answer the quality of life
      questionnaire. At least 12 hours before it is important for them to abstain from
      participating in any strenuous physical activity and alcohol/caffeine consumption. In
      addition, their last meal should be consumed 4 hours before testing. In addition, they will
      be given a physical activity diary and during the 12-week study period they will have to
      record their daily activity. Participants of the exercise group will also receive a
      weight-training diary, where they will record their progress in the FRT stations (i.e. the
      increase in resistance load for each FRT exercise).
