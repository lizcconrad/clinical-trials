      (CBT) is tested among help-seekers at one outpatient clinic within the Stockholm Center for
      Dependency Disorders: Riddargatan 1.The design is a two-armed randomized controlled
      non-inferiority study, and outcomes are measured in terms of changes in alcohol consumption,
      problematic alcohol use, alcohol dependence alcohol use disorder, anxiety, as well as
      depression and quality of life. 600 participants are recruited online from the clinic's
      website. Consenting participants will complete baseline questionnaires online and participate
      in face-to-face assessment by a physician at the clinic. Eligible individuals will then be
      randomized into one of two groups: 1.Internet-based treatment program with online counselor
      support. 2. Face-to-face treatment with 5 individual counselor sessions at the clinic.
      Follow-up will be conducted online after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months in both groups.
