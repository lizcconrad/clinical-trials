  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and platelets could be interesting ex vivo models
      to study brain diseases. Indeed, there is no access to neurons from patients. However, PBMC
      can exhibit different physiopathological mechanisms that are ubiquitous (i.e. oxidative
      stress, mitochondriopathy with energy metabolism, inflammation, protein folding, iron
      metabolism and programmed cell death ...). The platelets are pivotal in the healing system
      with large range of growth factors. A new therapeutic concept of conservative iron chelation
      with deferiprone for neuroprotection is under development.

      The action of deferiprone on the different mechanisms and notably the oxidative stress are to
      obtain from a collection of PBMC and platelets from patient having Parkinson's disease and
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and healthy controls to study ex vivo.

      PBMC and platelets will be stored for future analyses.

      The study collection of PBMC and platelets from 30 patient having Parkinson's disease 30
      patients having Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 30 healthy controls.

      The collection will be performed either by cytapheresis for half of the patient and by
      collecting the whole blood for the other half.

      PBMC and platelets will be stored at minus 80°C. PBMC of patients and controls are exposed ex
      vivo to different pathological condition (mainly Hydrogen peroxide, menadione, hypoxia...)
      with and without deferiprone to analyse whether the level of oxidative stress (Reactive
      Oxygen Species and notably hydroxyl radical with hydroxypethidine probe with flow cytometry)
      is reduced under deferiprone (primary criterion. Secondary analyses will concern the level of
      iron, the energy metabolism (aerobic versus anaerobic and the level of Adenosine triphosphate
      production), the type of cell death (apoptosis, autophagy and new programmed cell death:
      Ferroptosis) and inflammation. Finally, the level of growth factors and their effectiveness
      will be studied from platelets.
