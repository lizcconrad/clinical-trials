      This open-label, four group, fixed-sequence study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetic interaction of AL-794 on oseltamivir, JNJ-63623872 (formerly VX-787) and

      This open-label, four group, fixed-sequence study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetic interaction of AL-794 on oseltamivir, JNJ-63623872 (formerly VX-787) and
      probes for P-glycoprotein, CYP3A and OATP1B1 in healthy volunteers.

      For each group, the study consists of an eligibility screening period, study period, and 1
      follow-up visit. Groups may enroll in parallel but subjects enrolled in one group may not
      participate in another group.
