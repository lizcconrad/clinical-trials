      This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-participants crossover investigation
      of the effect of intranasal oxytocin on pain and function among women with chronic pelvic
      pain.

      1. Rationale: Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide produced in the supraoptic and
           paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. There exists at least three plausible
           mechanisms through which OT may decrease pain sensitivity. In brief, the first mechanism
           involves spinal signaling. A direct hypothalamo-spinal projection originating from the
           paraventricular nucleus transports OT, to the dorsal horn (Lamina-I, II, and IV), an
           area containing OT receptors that influence glutamate and GABA cellular signaling. The
           second mechanism involves an indirect pathway via the endogenous opioids. Evidence
           suggests that OT binds to opioid receptors and may also stimulate endogenous opioid
           release in the brain. Finally, OT may decrease pain by improving mood, decreasing
           anxiety, and mitigating the stress response.

           Thirty-three animal investigations have assessed OT-pain relationships with 29 reporting
           that exogenous administration and higher endogenous levels decreased pain. There is a
           lack of clarity of an OT-pain association in the human literature due to a paucity of
           methodologically rigorous trials. Thus far, OT administration has been reported to lower
           pain sensitivity among patients experiencing chronic back pain, headache, constipation,
           and colon pain. To date, no research has evaluated the association between intranasal OT
           and chronic pelvic pain. The association between OT and pain may be different in women
           with pelvic pain relative to other chronic pain conditions because of a potential
           peripheral OT-pain pathway. There is an abundance of OT receptors in the uterus, and OT
           is a potent uterogenic agent that is clinically used in large doses to stimulate uterine
           contractions and induce labor. While OT does not cross the blood-brain-barrier, the
           central administration of intranasal OT increases central and blood-plasma OT
           concentrations. Thus, intranasal OT administration may be associated with pain through
           central and peripheral pathways; however uterine contractions with 24IU doses of
           intranasal OT occur in only 1 in every 100-1000 people.

        2. Research questions and objectives: This research is a pilot study of the efficacy of
           intranasal OT at improving pain and function among women with chronic pelvic pain of
           primarily musculoskeletal origin

        3. Design: This study will utilize a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects
           crossover design. Participants will complete 6-weeks of testing consisting of two 2-week
           intranasal administrations separated by a 2-week washout period

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-menopausal women with chronic pelvic musculoskeletal pain (i.e., pain exceeding
             6-months in duration that is located primarily in the pelvic region and reproducible
             on palpation to the muscles spanning the pelvic floor) will be eligible to participate
             if they: 1) have regular menstrual periods (monthly within a 21-35 day range); 2)
             using a permanent or barrier form of contraception; 3) can commit not to change their
             medication during the 6-weeks of this study; and 4) have a moderate amount of pain at
             baseline (i.e., a pain score of 4-7 out of 10 on a numeric rating scale). A baseline
             pain score of 4-7 out of 10 was selected to prevent floor and ceiling effects and
             ensure that participants have room to change throughout the course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Muscle pain as a result of systemic disease, scoring positive on a urine pregnancy
             test, concurrent use of another nasal spray, nasal pathology (e.g., ears, nose, and
             throat diagnosis), diabetes insipidus, previous or concurrent use of narcotics
             delivered intranasally (e.g., cocaine), are contemplating pregnancy, or who have
             sacroiliac instability as defined by the European Guidelines. Women will also be
             excluded with they have a primary diagnosis of endometriosis, dysmenorrhea,
             interstitial cystitis, functional bowel disorder, fibromyalgia or neuropathic pain.
