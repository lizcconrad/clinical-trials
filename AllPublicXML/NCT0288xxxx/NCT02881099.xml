      Prospective observational study of Parkinson's disease with repeat clinical assessment and
      biobanking of blood samples.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To identify genetic and biomarker factors which affect the expression of Parkinson's Disease.

      Primary objective: To define the severity and rates of progression of clinical features of
      Parkinson's Disease.

      Secondary objective: To relate clinical phenomenology of Parkinson's disease to genetic and
      biomarker changes.

    <description>Clustering of motor and non-motor features measured using Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS), Montréal cognitive assessment (MoCA), Non-motor symptom Scale (NMSS), Scale for outcomes in Parkinson's autonomic (SCOPA-AUT), Olfaction testing using University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) or Sniffin' sticks, and Leeds anxiety and depression scale (LADS).
This will use sequential factor analysis of the results of the above assessments, followed established methods, firstly exploratory factor analysis and secondly confirmatory factor analysis. Factor scores and other clinically important variables will then be combined to construct a single dataset for carrying out the cluster analysis. Hierarchical clustering will then be applied, and models with between 2 and 5 clusters will be described and compared.</description>

        A. Parkinson's Disease patients

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, based on UK Brain Bank criteria and made within the
             preceding 3 years ('recent onset cases') or diagnosed at under 50 years ('under 50
             years cases')

          2. Age ≥18 to &lt;90years

          3. Subject is able and willing to provided informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Patient has severe comorbid illness that would prevent full study participation

          2. Patient has features indicating another type of degenerative parkinsonism, e.g.
             progressive supranuclear palsy

          3. Drug-induced parkinsonism (Drug-unmasked PD is allowed)

          4. Symmetrical lower body parkinsonism attributable to significant cortical and/or
             subcortical cerebrovascular disease (patients with 'incidental' small vessel disease
             on brain imaging are allowed).

          5. Negative or normal functional imaging of the presynaptic dopamine system

          6. The presence of UK Brain Bank exclusion criteria will be recorded at baseline,
             allowing for the presence of 1 or 2 exclusion criteria (e.g. dopamine antagonist Drug
             used; more than one affected relative) (if justified e.g. by abnormal SPECT).

        B. First degree relatives Inclusion criteria

          1. Age ≥18 to &lt; 90years

          2. Resident in the United Kingdom and able to access one of the PRoBaND study centres.

          3. Subject is able and willing to provided informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Subject has severe comorbid illness that would prevent study participation

          2. Subject already has a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease
