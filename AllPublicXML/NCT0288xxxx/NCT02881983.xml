    <textblock>
      Background:

      Difficulties in assigning and identifying emotional states, or to regulate the emotional
      costs are recognized as one of the major factors of relapse. This study aimed to evaluate the
      emotion regulation processes, in short term (STA, after 1month of withdrawal) and long-term
      alcohol abstinent individuals (LTA, at least six months of abstinence), compared to healthy
      control participants (C) in a positive and negative emotion induction protocol.

      Main aim:

      Evaluating the emotional regulation deficits assessed with physiological indicators (heart
      rate variability, electrodermal response, pupil diameter) and clinically in presentations of
      visual stimuli to emotional value (positive, negative, neutral) in alcohol use disorder's
      (AUD) patients with short and long term abstinent compared to a control group of healthy
      subjects. The investigators are particularly interested in the evolution of heart rate
      variability considered as a good marker of vulnerability to AUD.

      Secondary objectives:

      Studying the relationships between physiological measures and clinical variables such as
      behavioral indicators and self-reported assessment of cognitive and emotional skills among
      the three groups (STA, LTA and C).

      The recording was performed for all participants during presentation of high emotional
      inducing stimuli presenting human interactions (pictures and video sequences). For each
      participant physiological responses (pupil diameter, heart rate, and skin conductance) were
      recorded before, during and after induction.

      Participants were asked to evaluate the intensity and the valence of emotional stimuli.

      In addition, a neurological evaluation, a clinical and cognitive assessment were performed.

      Neurological, clinical and cognitive evaluation - Each participant had a clinical structured
      interview, a neurological evaluation, self-administered assessment (Hospital Anxiety &amp;
      Depression Scale, Emotional Skills Profile, Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale, and
      cognitive assessment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).

      Physiological assessment - The recording was performed for all participants during the
      presentation of pictures (static stimuli) or videos (dynamic stimuli) selected according to
      their high emotional intensity (positive, neutral and negative valence), representing human
      interactions. For each participant heart rate, electrodermal activity, and pupil diameter
      were recorded during three experimental conditions: rest, induction (presentation of stimuli)
      and after induction (recovery). Participants were asked to evaluate the intensity and valence
      of the pictures and videos using the Self-Assessment Manikin.
