      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficiency and safety of Chidamide in advanced
      cephalic and cervical adenoid cystic carcinoma. Chidamide is given to patients with advanced
      cephalic and cervical adenoid cystic carcinoma with the dosage of 30mg,twice a week, then
      overall survival, event-free survival are accessed for efficiency, and laboratory tests about
      the function of vital organs are accessed for safety.
