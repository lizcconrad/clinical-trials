  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although hemodialysis is life-saving, unfortunately, people on dialysis often have declining
      health, quality of life as well as poor nutritional status. Hemodialysis patients must follow
      a very restrictive diet, and many patients do not eat well and usually report poor appetites.
      A new approach to dialysis is being used in some hospitals in Alberta and elsewhere, called
      in-centre nocturnal hemodialysis. This in-centre nocturnal dialysis allows people to receive
      their dialysis at a hospital or clinic while they sleep. Since this in-centre nocturnal
      dialysis gives people 8-hour hemodialysis treatment 3 times per week (24 hours of dialysis
      per week) the patients have better removal of the waste products from their bodies than
      conventional hemodialysis (an average of 12 hours per week). Also of importance, when using
      in-centre nocturnal dialysis, people will have more time during the day to work, spend with
      family, as well as have time to shop for food, to cook and even to eat, which in turn will
      likely result in improvement in the quality of their lives. This study will follow 10
      patients on conventional dialysis and 10 patients on in-centre nocturnal dialysis for 6
      months and compare their food intake, muscle mass, weight, body mass index (BMI) and
      nutrition-related lab tests. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is an
      improvement in the nutritional status of the in-centre nocturnal hemodialysis patients
      compared to the nutritional status of conventional hemodialysis patients.
