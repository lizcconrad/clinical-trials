    <textblock>
      The purpose is the description of anti-tumor immune responses in general and according to
      clinical stage and disease free survival (DFS: survival without recurrence (local or
      distant)) in patients with Head &amp; Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma

      Secondary purposes are:

        -  Study of relationship between anti-tumor immune response and qualitative (yes/no) and
           quantitative (number) presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs);

        -  Study of relationship between qualitative (yes/no) and quantitative (number) presence of
           CTCs and clinical stage as well as DFS

        -  Study of relationship between anti-tumor immune response and clinical stage as well as
           DFS.
