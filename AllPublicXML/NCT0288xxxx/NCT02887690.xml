  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to optimize the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's
      (DARPA) advanced upper limb prosthesis, the Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL), by evaluating the
      performance, usability, and patient acceptance of the MPL in a clinical setting. This study
      will be a non-randomized limited clinical optimization study. The study will consist of two
      phases. Up to twenty-four upper extremity amputees will be recruited in order to ensure
      twelve subjects for participation in the study: 6 trans-humeral amputees and 6 trans-radial
      amputees. During Phase 1, subjects will be evaluated for their potential to operate the MPL
      using a virtual limb controlled by signals from surface electromyograms (sEMG). The first six
      trans-humeral amputee subjects and the first six trans-radial amputee subjects with a
      demonstrated proficiency controlling the MPL based on analytical performance metrics will
      enter Phase 2. During Phase 2, each subject will be fitted for the prosthesis with a custom
      socket. The user will then evaluate the prosthesis during twelve 1- hour or 1 and one
      half-hour sessions, working with an occupational therapist and research associates and
      completing both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

    <description>The overall objective of the study is to determine the functionality of the MPL during clinical use in training scenarios simulating activities of daily living, and to assess patient satisfaction of the MPL by individuals with upper extremity amputations. The results will be used to optimize control and features of the MPL based on qualitative and quantitative user driven feedback in a clinical setting.</description>

    <description>We will functionally assess the number of optimally controlled degrees of freedom by having users perform comparative assessments using their existing prosthesis as a baseline, followed the MPL configured with increasing number of controllable degrees of freedom to accomplish functional activities of daily living.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female subjects, 18 to 65 years of age with a unilateral or bilateral
             upper-limb amputation at any time prior to enrollment

          -  Active duty military, beneficiary, retiree, and civilian non-beneficiaries are all
             eligible to participate in this minimal risk study.

          -  If non active duty military, proof of verified, current health insurance in the form
             of a health insurance card must be provided in person and health plan expiration date
             not prior to the end of the projected study participation period will be verified.

          -  No prior history of vertebral disk disease/condition, sciatica or radiculopathy.

          -  Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits for
             both phases of the study.

          -  Normal neurological examination with the exception of limb amputation.

          -  Medically cleared to use a prosthetic device based on residual limb condition and
             overall health, including participants both with and without prior prosthetic
             experience.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Age less than 18 or greater than 65.

          -  Presence of mild to severe traumatic brain injury - permanent or temporary impairments
             of cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functions with an associated diminished or
             altered state of consciousness - as indicated by neuropsychological screening that is
             currently performed routinely on patients by the TBI program at WRNMMCB and noted in
             the subject's medical record.

          -  Current, known uncontrolled systemic disease.

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at
             significant risk, confound the study results, or interfere significantly with the
             subject's participation in the study.

          -  Subjects with lack of effort as determined by the research team. Subjects will be
             screened for effort using the Test of Malingering Memory (TOMM), with a score lower
             than 42/50 serving as exclusionary.

          -  Significant Axis I or II diagnosis determined by a neurologist or psychiatrist in the
             6 months prior to entry into the study.

          -  Use of a pacemaker, so as to minimize the risk of surface electromyography
             interference.

          -  Lack of health insurance.
