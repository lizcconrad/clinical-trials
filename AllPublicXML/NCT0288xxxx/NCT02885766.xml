      A multicenter, open label cohort Phase 1 dose finding study to evaluate tolerability, safety,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of PF-114 for oral administration in adult patients
      with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is
      resistant to the 2-nd generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors or has T315I mutation in the BCR-ABL
      gene.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PF-114 is a low molecular inhibitor of a Bcr-Abl kinase activity, which is active with
      respect to native and mutated forms of this enzyme with mutations in Abl kinase domain.
      Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the ability of PF-114 to inhibit
      wild Bcr-Abl type and with T315I mutation, as well as other kinds of Bcr-Abl with mutations
      in kinase domain, including combined mutations.

      In contrast to ponatinib, PF-114 is being developed to increase the action selectivity with
      respect to Bcr-Abl, which potentially should increase safety of drug application in people.
      The results of performed preclinical studies confirmed improved selectivity of PF-114 action
      with respect to Bcr-Abl kinases as compared to ponatinib.

      Indication:

      Adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase (CP) or accelerated phase (AP) resistant to
      previous treatment with at least one 2-nd generation inhibitor of Bcr-Abl (dasatinib,
      nilotinib, bosutinib) or intolerant of approved Bcr-Abl inhibitors or with T315I mutation in
      the BCR-ABL gene

    <description>PF-114 From 50 mg up to the MTD. Dose escalation for each next cohort is conducted by increasing the dose by 20 % (or the closest lower level, which is a multiple of 25 mg) if there are Grade 3 ADRs according to NCI CTC AE v.4 without reaching а MTD. An increase of the dose by 40 % is applied if there were Grade 2 ADRs. In the absence of Grade 2 or 3 ADRs an increase of 100 % is applied.
When the dose reaches 400 mg/day, the following increase in dose can be made after discussing results of safety findings of PF-114 between the Investigators and the Sponsor.
