  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the cough reflex induced by capsaicin is inhibited during exercise.
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a short muscular exercise inhibits the cough
      reflex induced by capsaicin inhalation.

      Cough is an important reflex of defense of airways. It is also one of the more frequent
      symptoms during respiratory diseases. Chronic cough can be a disabling condition, apparently
      idiopathic or associated to pathology such as asthma, sinusitis with posterior discharge or
      gastroesophageal reflux.

      Factors susceptible to provoke or increase cough are well known, but inhibiting factors are
      much less known. Muscular exercise is thought to influence respiratory reflexes in a
      considerable and complicated way. For example, a bronchodilation is observed in healthy or
      asthmatic individuals, but recovery period frequently triggers asthma attacks. Effects of
      exercise on cough reflex are much less known.

      This study aims to determine the influence of muscular exercise on cough reflex in children
      and healthy adults.

      Highlighting the inhibition of cough reflex by exercise can have a significant effect on
      chronic cough patient care. There is actually no symptomatic treatment really effective
      without side effects.

    <description>6 min running on a motor-driven tredmill in a climate room (18-20°C, humidity &lt;10 mg/l). Tredmill speed and slope are adjusted to increase heart rate to about 80 % of maximum value predicted for age (= 210 - age in years) during the first 2-3 min and pursued until the end of exercise (3-4 min). Heart rate is measured during the whole exercise.</description>
