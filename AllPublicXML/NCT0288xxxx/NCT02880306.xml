  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is a disorder with altered immunologic function and increased risk
      of developing malignancies, while studies examining the association between hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) and RA remain lacking. The investigators aimed to investigate the risk of HCC
      between participants with and without RA.

    <textblock>
      The investigators did a retrospective, observational, nested case-control study in a cohort
      that was previously recruited from a population-based RA survey. All participants were
      enrolled prospectively in Taiwan's national health insurance between Jan 1, 1999, and June
      30, 2009, and had follow-up data until Dec 31, 2009. RA was diagnosed based on the 1987
      American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria. The investigators matched RA and non-RA
      subjects by propensity score in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the risk of developing
      HCC. Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and
      95% confidence interval (CI) of HCC for RA and non-RA cohort.

    <ipd_description>The Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) between Jan 1, 1999, and June 30, 2009, and had follow-up data until Dec 31, 2009. The Taiwan's NHIRD contains health-care data gathered prospectively for 99% of Taiwan's population and approximately 22,600,000 individuals in 2007. The Taiwan's National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) maintained the NHIRD and provided it to the investigators for research purposes. De-identified data were further scrambled before being released to public access for research. The accuracy of diagnosis of major diseases in the NHIRD, such as stroke and acute coronary syndrome, has been validated previously.</ipd_description>
