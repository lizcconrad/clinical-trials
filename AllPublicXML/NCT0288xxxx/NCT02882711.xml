  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of serial infusions of
      intravenous (IV) ketamine in adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thus, in the current study we want to naturalistically explore the antidepressant effects of
      serial slow IV infusions (40 minutes) of ketamine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, over a treatment
      period of 8 weeks in an academic psychiatric hospital. This is a minimal sedation treatment.
      The primary outcome measure of this study will be remission estimated based on the severity
      of depressive scores. After the 8 weeks of treatment, there will be a four week observational
      period. During the observational period, participants will receive treatment as usual and
      will be contacted over the phone for follow-up questions regarding their overall health
      status, mood and clinical state. They will also complete a neurocognitive task at the end of
      the 4 week observational period
