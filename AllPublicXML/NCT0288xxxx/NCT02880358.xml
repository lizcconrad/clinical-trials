      EPICAL 2 (Epidemiology and prognostic of the Acute Heart Failure) is an epidemiological,
      observational, prospective and multicenter study. This study includes at first an exhaustive
      recording of the cases on a geographic area at East of France, then the recorded patients are
      followed up in a cohort at least 3 years. This study follows the experiences of the EPICAL
      study led by our team.

      Main objective: To describe the characteristics of the patients affected by acute heart
      failure and to identify prognostic factors, in particular related to care. More exactly :

        -  To describe the sociodemographic, clinical, biological and therapeutic characteristics
           of the patients presenting an acute heart failure during hospitalisation and living at
           East of France ;

        -  To study the short and medium-term morbi-mortality of these patients, and identify the
           main factors determining the prognosis for survival ;

        -  To evaluate the prognostic impact of the intra and extra-hospital care ;

        -  To identify the evolution of the care's practices of the decompensated heart failure
           since the EPICAL study (15 years) and their influence on the prognosis of the disease.

      Secondary objective: to constitute a biological collection of serum, plasma and urine of
      patients' sample presenting an acute heart failure.

      Criteria of inclusion:

        -  Patients hospitalized for acute heart failure or developing an acute heart failure
           during the hospitalisation in the intensive care, cardiology or geriatrics departments
           of the hospitals of Northeast of France during one year

        -  Patients died in emergencies or during the transfer, with a diagnosis of acute heart
           failure.

      Acute heart failure includes decompensation of chronic heart failure, advanced stage of the
      heart failure, acute oedema of the lung and cardiogenic shock. According to the data of
      registers, the incidence of the acute heart failure in approximately 2,5 cases per 1000
      adults per year, the expected sample size amounts to 2500 eligible patients over 1 year.

      Data collection: the doctors declare the Acute Heart Failure of their departments. The
      technicians of clinical research collect the data concerning the sociodemographic, clinical,
      biological and therapeutic characteristics of the inclusive patients on arrival at the
      hospital, during the hospitalisation and at the exit. The biological takings are made for the
      patients having given their consent before the exit of the hospitalization. The patients are
      followed up during 3 years.
