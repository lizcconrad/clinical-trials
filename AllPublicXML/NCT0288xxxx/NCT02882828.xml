  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tools have been developed in our unit to calculate the inter-dose AUC (Area Under Curve) of
      immunosuppressive drugs (ISD) based on a limited number of blood concentrations (i.e., blood
      samples) using Bayesian methods. Since 2005, we have implemented these tools in an expert
      system and made them available to the transplant community through our very successful ISBA
      (Immunosuppressive drugs Bayesian dose Adjustment) website.

      Briefly, we first need to develop a population pharmacokinetic model using rich
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles (about 10 samples per patient over the dosing interval). The
      model developed can then be used for inference of ISD PK parameters in new patients using
      Bayesian estimation. Bayes' theorem is based on conditional probability: individual PK
      parameters are estimated based on the known PK parameters in the population (mean and
      distribution), given the dose and concentrations observed in a patient. Our previous studies
      have shown that a limited sampling strategy (LSS) based on 3 samples collected within the
      first 3 hours after drug intake can estimate adequately the interdose AUC of ISD. In the
      present study, the AUC0-24h and the recommended dose will be calculated using Bayesian
      estimators previously developed using PK data from the clinical trials run by Veloxis, and
      proposed to the clinicians via a dedicated website comparable with ISBA.

    <description>In this study, we make a switch from Prograf® to Envarsus®. Patients will be trained to collect their blood from a finger prick on filter paper. DBS will be done at home, collected on filter paper and mailed by the patients to a centralized laboratory (Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmacovigilance at Limoges University Hospital), where tacrolimus concentration will be determined by HPLC-MS/MS</description>
