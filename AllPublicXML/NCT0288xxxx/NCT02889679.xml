  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of underwater resection (polypectomy) versus
      conventional polypectomy techniques for small and large colorectal lesions identified during
      colonoscopy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional endoscopic resection of small and large (≥1cm) colorectal lesions is well
      established and performed with the colon fully distended with gas. Conventional polypectomy
      is effective, but the rate of incomplete resection is approximately 10%. Incomplete
      eradication of precancerous lesions contributes to interval colorectal cancer; therefore,
      alternative techniques for resection that safely and effectively increase the rate of
      complete resection are important. Underwater resection (UR) of benign colorectal lesions is a
      novel technique that utilizes the advantages of water aided endoscopic methods and may
      decrease the incomplete resection rate of small and large non-pedunculated lesions.

      The investigators propose the hypothesis that small (6-9mm) and large (≥1cm) non-pedunculated
      neoplastic colorectal lesions resected by UR (partially distended, water filled lumen without
      submucosal fluid injection), will significantly decrease the incomplete resection rate (IRR)
      compared to conventional polypectomy performed in a gas distended lumen.

      Small (6-9mm) and large (≥1cm) non-pedunculated benign neoplastic colorectal lesions
      identified during screening, surveillance, diagnostic or therapeutic colonoscopy will be
      randomized to conventional polypectomy (in a gas distended lumen with or without submucosal
      fluid injection) versus UR (partially distended, water filled lumen without submucosal
      injection) at the patient level. Small (6-9mm) lesions will be removed with a 9mm firm, thin
      wire cold snare and large (≥1cm) lesions will be removed by snare electrocautery. Efforts to
      remove lesions en bloc with a small rim of normal mucosa will be made, although some larger
      lesions (≥2cm) may require piecemeal resection. Submucosal fluid injection with a solution
      may be used with conventional techniques for large and/or flat lesions. Post-polypectomy
      incomplete resection rates will be assessed from 4 quadrant biopsies obtained around the
      resection site immediately post-resection.

    <description>Underwater resection of eligible lesions will be performed with air exclusion (air will be suctioned and completely removed) without submucosal injection in a partially collapsed colon lumen filled with water. Water will be infused with the foot pedal to facilitate visualization during UR and there will be no limit to the amount of water infused. Hot and cold resection techniques will be utilized.</description>
