                  7 days of the first investigational product administration), are not breast
                  feeding, and use adequate contraception before study entry and throughout the
                  study until 180 days after the last investigational product administration.
                  Adequate contraception, when used consistently and in accordance with both the
                  product label and the instructions of the physician, are defined as follows:

               -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is
                  the sole sexual partner for that female.

          6. Male subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they are
             vasectomized or agree to use of contraception during the study treatment period and
             for at least 180 days after the last dose of the study drug.

          7. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and comply with the requirements
             of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  to a prior Pt-containing agent which, in the judgment of the Principal

                  &gt;25 % of bone marrow volume.

                  pulmonary embolism.

              16. Unstable cardiac dysrhythmias or persistent prolongation of the QTc (Fridericia)
                  interval to &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females.

                  skin or carcinoma-in-situ of the uterine cervix, unless the tumor was
