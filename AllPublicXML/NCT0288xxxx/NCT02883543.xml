      Eligible patients are administered with oral icotinib 125mg three times daily for two months,
      in which responsive patients (partial response and stable disease) are randomized (1: 1: 1)
      and receive icotinib plus concurrent radiotherapy, or chemotherapy plus concurrent
      radiotherapy, or icotinib monotherapy.

      in which responsive patients (partial response and stable disease) are randomized (1: 1: 1)
      and receive icotinib plus concurrent radiotherapy, or chemotherapy plus concurrent
      radiotherapy, or icotinib monotherapy. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, and
      the incidence of radiation-induced lung injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 to 75 years

          -  Pathologically documented NSCLC

          -  Unresectable stage III or oligometastasis (less than three metastasis lesions, brain
             metastasis is not permitted) stage IV confirmed by CT and/or MRI

          -  Positive EGFR mutation confirmed by ARMS

          -  At least 3-month life expectancy

          -  KPS ≥ 70

          -  Adequate hematological values: hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L, absolute neutrophils count ≥ 1.5
             x 109/L, platelets count ≥ 100 x 109/L

          -  Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, AST/ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  Written informed consent before patient registration and any protocol-related
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous radiotherapy

          -  Received other investigational systemic drugs within 4 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Severe or uncontrolled systemic disease

          -  Active autoimmune disease, or a documented history of autoimmune/acquired immune
             disease, or a history of organ transplant

          -  Pregnant or lactating, women of childbearing potential, unless using effective
             contraception as determined by the investigator

          -  Any other serious underlying medical (e.g. active uncontrolled infection, active
             gastric ulcer, uncontrolled seizures), psychological and other condition that, in the
             judgment of the investigator, may interfere with the planned staging, treatment and
             follow-up, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from
             treatment-related complications.
