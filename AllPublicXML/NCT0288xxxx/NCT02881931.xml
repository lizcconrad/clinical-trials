  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FuRST 2.0 scale is being developed as a Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) with information
      coming directly from the Huntington's Disease Gene Expansion Carrier (HDGEC) and companion
      through self-report. The purpose of this study is to identify real or potential comprehension
      or usage problems with questionnaire items or response options. Through a process of
      structured cognitive de-briefing with HDGEC participants and companions, independently,
      followed by qualitative analysis, the final phrasing of the individual items and response
      options for the scale will be generated. Depending on the results of the first round of
      cognitive pre-testing, additional rounds of cognitive pre-testing may be required.

        Participants: Individuals of either gender, equal to or greater than 18 years of age. HDGEC
        Pre-Manifest and Early-Manifest participants (see inclusion criteria) will be recruited
        from English speaking Enroll-HD sites.

        Companions: Available companions for HDGEC Pre-Manifest participants will be encouraged to
        participate (at least five Pre-Manifest's companions are required). Companions will be
        identified for HDGEC Early-Manifest participants and asked to participate. Companion's
        participation for HDGEC Early-Manifest participant is mandatory as specified in the
        inclusion criteria.

        Criteria 1-4, and:

          1. CAG length greater than or equal to 36

          2. DCL=4

             scale independently

        Main criteria for exclusion:

          1. Significant cognitive or any other impairment sufficient to interfere with study
             associated tasks as judged by the study Investigator or the Investigator's designee
