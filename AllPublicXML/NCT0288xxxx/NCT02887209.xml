  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a problem for approximately 75% of people living with HIV, which is much higher
      than the 6% to 10% of people with insomnia in the general population. It is currently unknown
      why the rate of insomnia is so high among people living with HIV, and because of this, they
      are often excluded from clinical trials examining the usefulness of cognitive behavioural
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia.
      Insomnia is also associated with poorer immune functioning and lower medication adherence.
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether CBT-I is useful at reducing insomnia among
      people living with HIV, and to examine whether this counselling is safe to provide to this
      population. Other purposes are to explore whether reducing insomnia will lead to improved
      immune functioning and medication adherence, to collect feedback about people's experiences
      receiving CBT-I, to examine which psychological and behavioural factors are associated with
      insomnia severity among people living with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of insomnia in the general population ranges from 6% to 10% (American
      Psychiatric Association, 2013), whereas its estimated prevalence among people living with HIV
      (PWH) is 73% (Rubinstein &amp; Selwyn, 1998). Cognitive, behavioural, physiological, and
      psychosocial explanations for this elevated prevalence have been proposed (Taibi, 2013),
      however, there is a lack of consensus in the literature. Sleep disturbance is associated with
      disrupted immune functioning at the cellular level (Taylor, Lichstein, &amp; Durrence, 2003), as
      well as increased risk of contracting infectious diseases (Patel et al., 2012); therefore,
      insomnia may be particularly problematic for PWH. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia
      (CBT-I; Edinger &amp; Carney, 2008) is the first-line treatment for insomnia (Qaseem et al.,
      2016; Schutte-Rodin et al., 2008), and medium to large effect sizes have been reported
      (Okajima et al., 2011). CBT-I is effective at treating insomnia among individuals with
      comorbid medical disorders such as chronic pain (Jungquist et al., 2012), fibromyalgia
      (Mart√≠nez et al., 2014), and cancer (Garland et al., 2014). Surprisingly, no study to date
      has examined the efficacy of CBT-I among PWH. The current study will evaluate the safety,
      feasibility, acceptability, and effects of CBT-I among 20 PWH using a pragmatic pilot study
      design. An exit interview will be conducted to elicit participant feedback about the
      treatment and methods used. Additional cross-sectional analyses will examine predictors of
      insomnia symptom severity and other sleep-related outcomes among a larger sample (n = 60).
      This will be the first study to examine the impact of CBT-I among PWH.

    <description>Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I; Edinger &amp; Carney, 2008) is a standard 4-session cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia administered biweekly in individual format. The first session involves presenting treatment rationale and introducing a behavioural treatment regimen consisting of a series of sleep habit parameters to follow, and determining a personalized &quot;time in bed&quot; prescription. The second session involves reviewing past-week sleep diary, discussing the role of cognitions in insomnia, and discussing constructive worrying techniques and the use of thought records. The third and fourth sessions are used to assist in adjusting &quot;time in bed&quot; prescriptions, to positively reinforce efforts, and to help problem-solve any problems they might have encountered.</description>
