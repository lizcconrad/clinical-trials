    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the short and long outcomes of Neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with postoperative chemotherapy in patients with resectable locally advanced
      colon cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For resectable locally advanced colon cancer, the preferred treatment is colectomy with en
      bloc removal of the regional lymph nodes followed by chemotherapy of about 6 months. However,
      surgery may postpone the administration of chemotherapy due to postoperative complications
      such as anastomosis leakage, abdominal infection, thus leads to a poor survival. Some
      scholars suggested that for patients with locally advanced colon cancer, chemotherapy given
      before surgery might shrink or downstage tumor, facilitate surgery and promote a better
      oncological outcome. Whether adjuvant chemotherapy benefits these patients with better
      outcome still remains controversial.

      In this study, eligible patients will be randomly allocated to receive either adjuvant
      chemotherapy or not. For patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, surgery will be performed
      3-4 weeks later. Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy will be given for a total of
      about 6 months. For patients receiving no preoperative chemotherapy, chemotherapy will be
      given for about 6 months postoperatively. The recommended chemotherapy regimes includes
      FOLFOX, CapeOX, FOLFIRI, Capecitabine monotherapy. Patients will be followed up every 3
      months for 2 year, every 6 months for 3 years postoperatively.
