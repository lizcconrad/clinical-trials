      This investigation will provide safety and effectiveness information on the use of the
      FLXfit™ Cage. Data will be used for Post Market follow-up of the FLXfit™ system by
      evaluating:

        -  Safety as measured by the rate of serious operative and post-operative complications.

        -  Patients' quality of life, measured by health-related quality of life questionnaires up
           to 24 months following the procedure, as compared to patient's baseline.

      Interbody fusion in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) at one or two contiguous
      levels from L2 to S1. Patients may also have up to Grade I spondylolisthesis or
      retrolisthesis at the involved level(s). Patients should be skeletally mature and have
      completed six months of non-operative treatment

        -  Up to 50 subjects participating in this post market study will be consecutively
             recruited from the Clinical Investigators standard patient populations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (age 18 - 70 years) patient (male or female) with the following conditions of
             the lumbar spine as confirmed by advanced imaging (CT or MRI), who is a candidate for
             primary spinal fusion procedure according to acceptable criteria for such medical
             conditions:

               -  Degenerative disc disease

               -  With up to Grade I spondylolisthesis

          -  Failure of at least 6 month conservative treatment BMI &lt; 40.

          -  Patient to approve no pregnancy during the 24 months of study and no participation in
             other studies in parallel to this one.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  This device is not intended for cervical spine use. PI may exclude patient from study

        Contraindications include, but are not limited to:

          -  Infection, local to the operative site

          -  Signs of local inflammation,

          -  Fever or leukocytosis,

          -  Morbid obesity,

          -  Pregnancy,

          -  Mental illness,

          -  Any other condition which would preclude the potential benefit of spinal implant
             surgery, such as the presence of tumors or congenital abnormalities, fracture local to
             the operating site, elevation of segmentation rate unexplained by other diseases,
             elevation of white blood count (WBC), or a marked left shift in the WBC differential
             count,

          -  Suspected or documented allergy or intolerance to implant's materials,

          -  Any case not described in the indications,

          -  Any patient unwilling to cooperate with postoperative instructions.

          -  These devices must not be used for pediatric cases, nor where the patient still has
             general skeletal growth.

          -  Any case where the implant components selected for use would be too large or too small
             to achieve a successful result.

          -  Any patient having inadequate tissue coverage over the operative site or inadequate
             bone stock or quality.

          -  Any patient in which implant utilization would interfere with anatomical structures or
             expected physiological performance.

          -  Prior fusion at the level to be treated.
