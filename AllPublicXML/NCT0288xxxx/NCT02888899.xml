    <textblock>
      Background: Fecal incontinence (FI) affects 2-13% of an adult general population. The
      prevalence increases with age, and after 50 years of age prevalence rates up to 26% in women
      have been reported. Quality of life in patients with FI is decreased considerably, in a
      similar extent as in patients with ulcerative colitis in relapse.

      Management of FI usually involves a stepwise approach; beginning with more conservative
      strategies and moving on to more appropriately tailored medications, bowel-retraining,
      biofeedback and psychosocial support. Although a combination of these treatment alternatives
      often improves symptoms they are not always successfully. Neuromodulation is a relatively new
      treatment modality for FI that is based on recruitment of residual anorectal neuromuscular
      function pertinent to continence by electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve supply.
      Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) is one type of neuromodulation and it employs direct
      electrical stimulation of the sacral nerves. Recently an alternative neuromodulation
      technique to SNS has been developed in treating FI i.e. tibial nerve stimulation. The tibial
      nerve contains afferent and efferent fibers originating from the forth and the fifth lumbar
      nerves and the first, second and third sacral nerves. Thus, stimulation of the tibial nerve
      may lead to changes in anorectal neuromuscular function similar to those observed with SNS
      but without the need of a permanent surgically implanted device. Tibial nerve stimulation is
      therefore an attractive treatment alternative for FI patients since the treatment is
      well-tolerated and treatment results have been very promising.

      Aim: The overall aim is to measure the effect of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)
      in combination with biofeedback on symptoms in consecutive FI patients compared with
      biofeedback alone. The investigators also aim to study which FI patients have most profit of
      the addition of PTNS.

      Methods: The study will take place at the Pelvic Floor Unit, department of Gastroenterology,
      University Hospital Linköping. Prior to the first visit to the hospital a symptom diary will
      be mailed to the FI patients and they are instructed to record their FI symptoms, bowel
      habits and gastrointestinal symptoms prospectively on a 24-hour diary during 2 weeks. Before
      consideration of enrolment into the study, gastroenterologists assess all the patients'
      medical history and perform a physical examination. Subjects will also have an endoanal
      ultrasonography and the investigators will measure rectal volumes, sensational thresholds and
      anal sphincter function.

      FI patients who fulfil inclusion criteria will then be randomly assigned to either PTNS in
      combination with biofeedback or biofeedback alone. The treatment will be performed by
      physiotherapists.
