  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pubic and abdominal pathology is common among athletes. It leads to a shutdown of
      physical activity for several months, and requires rehabilitative care, or surgery for a
      permanent cure. Shortystrap is designed to avoid surgery and allow the continuation of
      sports.
