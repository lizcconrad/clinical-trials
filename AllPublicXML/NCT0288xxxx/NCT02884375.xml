  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of older patients with cancer has become a major public health concern in
      Western countries because of the aging of the population and steady increase in cancer
      incidence with advancing age. Cancer treatment of aged patients is complex due to
      comorbidities, polypharmacy and functional status. The heterogeneity of the older population
      in terms of comorbidities and functional status may explain the difficulty in establishing
      management recommendations.

      Study hypothesis is that a geriatric consultation using Geriatric Assessment (GA) can
      evaluate patient's resource and strengths, in order to help oncologist to define the most
      effective treatment. The GA developed by geriatricians and recommended by the International
      Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG), is a multidimensional assessment of general health
      status; comorbidities; functional status; nutritional, cognitive, psychological, and social
      parameters; and medications. The GA uses validated geriatric scales to produce an inventory
      of problems, which can then serve to develop an individualized geriatric intervention plan;
      it may be an important step in selecting elderly patients for cancer screening and treatment.

      The objectives are:

        -  To assess the role of GA for decision making process for older patients with cancer

        -  To identify geriatric and oncologic factors associated with overall survival, treatment
           feasibility, toxicities, morbidities

        -  To develop and/or validate screening tests for frailty in geriatric oncology

        -  To develop and validate frailty classifications

      Method: The ELCAPA (ELderly CAncer PAtient) survey is a French multicentric prospective study
      that includes all patients age 70 years or older who has a diagnosis of solid cancer or
      hematologic malignancies in French hospitals
