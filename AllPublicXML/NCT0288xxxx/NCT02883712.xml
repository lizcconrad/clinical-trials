    <textblock>
      Pharmacoresistant epilepsy remains around 30% despite the development of 25 anti epileptic
      drugs. Of course, this can be explained by pharmacoresistant epileptic brain diseases, as
      exemplified by some genetic diseases. However, the lack of specific guidelines for the choice
      of the anti epileptic drugs (apart from generalized and partial epilepsy) and the very large
      number of drugs with different and sometimes complex metabolism are challenges for
      neurologists. Among the 30 % of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, there is a part related to
      pharmacokinetic drawbacks that could be overcome with a more rigorous approach (i.e. dosage
      and pharmacogenetics tools). Moreover, the new anti epileptic drugs have metabolism more
      unrelated with the cytochrome P450 and less generalised adverse events. However, their
      metabolism could be more complexe (i.e. the less known Uridine
      5'-diphospho-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) pathway) and bring more insidious neurological
      adverse events (i.e. depression, anxiety exacerbation, cognitive disorders worsening) which
      could largely impede the observance and the quality of life even if the number of seizure is
      reduced or not. The goal is to determine the predictive and the modulating factors of
      pharmacoresistance with a global analysis (i.e. whatever the anti epileptic drugs) and with a
      specific analysis (drug by drug) from a cohort of 1000 patients.

      The goal is to determine the predictive and the modulating factors of pharmacoresistance with
      a global analysis (i.e. whatever the anti epileptic drugs) and with a specific analysis (drug
      by drug with their specific metabolism pathways) from a cohort of 1000 patients. The response
      to the antiepileptic drugs modification will be analyse 3 months after the modification, with
      the analysis of the number of seizures, the quality of life, the Clinical Global Impression,
      the adverse events, the systematic dosage of all the molecules (residual concentration just
      before the taken) and the pharmacogenetic analysis of the main metabolism pathways and the
      main pharmacodynamic targets.
