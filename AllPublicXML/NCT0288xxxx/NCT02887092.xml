  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) is an important health problem with a high prevalence and
      significant consequences on functional ability, perceived health, restriction of autonomy and
      handicap. The weight of multimorbidities and their interaction on functional ability and
      perceived health are left unexplored. This project will rely on the cohort KHOALA,
      representative, multiregional, of 881 prevalent cases (symptomatic hip and knee OA).

      Main objective:

        -  to describe the evolution over time of pain, functional ability, social participation
           and quality of life in subjects with hip and knee OA

        -  to identify prognosis factors of disease evolution (socio-demographic, clinical, and
           other health parameters)

        -  to determine interactions with comorbidities, other personal and environmental factors
           (ICF model).

      Concurrent objective: to improve measurement of perceived health specific to hip and knee OA
      by the OAKHQOL by improving its metrologic performances based on item response theory.

      Task 1: To prepare an improved measurement scale, available as a judgment criteria for the
      3rd year of cohort follow up, over the april 2010-march 2012 period, the mini-OAKHQOL Task 2:
      Evaluation of the cohort in 2010-2012 (year 3 of follow up) in a repeated measure design to
      best assess the evolution of perceived health and functional ability over time, and to
      identify stability of deterioration of autonomy. Perspectives: This project targets to
      provide public health deciders with information of good quality to help them manage
      determinants of perceived health in OA subjects, as essential factors to health care resource
      utilization in their various modalities.
