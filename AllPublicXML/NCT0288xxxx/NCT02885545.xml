  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) who develop atrial fibrillation are at high
      risk for stroke. The use of blood thinking medication in dialysis patients is controversial
      and warfarin carries a serious risk for major bleeding.

      The Watchman device may be an ideal therapy for this population as after implantation it
      allows for the discontinuation of blood thinners, thereby reducing the risk of bleeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 25 million North American's have chronic kidney disease (CKD) including 600,000
      that require dialysis for end-stage renal disease.The importance of CKD is underscored by the
      poor survival, frequent hospitalizations and impaired health related quality of life of
      patients with CKD.

      Stroke is an important cause of morbidity, mortality and suffering for patients with CKD.
      Stroke is approximately 5 to 10 times more common in patients with advanced CKD compared to
      non-CKD patients. Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most important risk factor for stroke, occurs
      in up to 20.4% of patients with advanced CKD. Observational studies suggest anywhere from an
      approximate 56% relative risk reduction to a 2-fold increase in the risk of stroke with
      warfarin. Furthermore, the risk of bleeding in patients with advanced CKD is roughly 5-fold
      higher than patients without CKD. Although OAC may not prevent strokes in patients with
      advanced CKD, it still increases the risk of major bleeding by 1.4 fold.

      New stroke prevention strategies in patients with CKD and AF are urgently needed. An
      effective strategy must reduce the risk of thromboembolic events while not increasing the
      risk of bleeding substantially. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) with devices such as
      the Watchman, represent a unique opportunity to accomplish effective stroke prevention while
      mitigating the risk of bleeding in this patient population.
