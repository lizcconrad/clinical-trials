      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the measurement of the placental
      perfusion during the first trimester of pregnancy by 3D Doppler ultrasound angiography with a
      contrast agent: SonoVue®.

    <textblock>
      The quality of the utero-placental vascularization is a major point for the foetal healthy
      development and for the healthy pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia (PE) and the Intra-Uterine Growth
      Retardation (IUGR) are currently two of the major pregnancy complications in the West. Those
      placental pathologies cause more than 30 per cent of the foetal and maternal
      morbidity-mortality. The relationship between these pathologies, affecting 4 to 7 per cent of
      pregnancies, and a chronic utero-placental hypoperfusion, which is caused by a failure of
      implantation during the first trimester of pregnancy, has been confirmed.

      A hypoxic environment surrounds the embryonic implantation and the first steps of the
      placental development into uterus. Moreover, the maternal-foetal exchanges space (the
      Inter-Villi Space or IVS) is so maternal-bloodless. At the pregnancy first period are
      released there uterine secretions and a plasmatic ultra-filtrate. Indeed, the ends of the
      uterine arteries are plugged by trophoblastic plugs. The accurate time of the plugging
      disappearance is still undetermined, even if it is a major step for setting up the
      maternal-foetal interface. It would be average 10 weeks of amenorrhea (10 SA).

      An over-earlier plug disappearance and so a loss of the hypoxic environment could entail
      phenomena of some chronic placental hypoperfusion noticed in case of PE and IUGR.

      Since 2004, the quantification of the placental and uterine vascularization is possible by
      Doppler 3D ultrasound angiography using a signal high-correlated with a perfusion level of
      the interest organ. However, this Doppler signal represents the movement of reflective
      particles, and so it is not specific from a blood flow. A signal which does not due to
      movement of red blood cells could be detected in the IVS by this method. Because of the high
      sensibility of movement and the lack of specificity for blood flows, le Doppler 3D signal
      measured in the IVS cannot be affirmed to represent a perfusion by maternal blood.

      Only the injection of a vascular contrast agent could allow defining the specific appearance
      of maternal blood, and not only of ultra-filtrate, in the IVS. The use of contrast agent may
      allow studying firstly in vivo the earlier steps of the development of the uterine-placental
      vascularization and of the IVS perfusion by maternal blood.

      SonoVue® contains microbubbles of hexafluoride sulphur which performs as reflectors of the
      ultrasonic beam with an average 6 µm diameter like the one of a red blood cell. By improving
      the blood echogenicity and the signal/noise rate, this contrast agent will be detected in the
      IVS only if this space is well perfused by maternal blood.

      No Marketing Authorization (MA) for pregnant patients exists. It cannot be currently used for
      wanted pregnancy, and we purpose to lead this study in a population of women who had
      expressed twice her wish for a voluntary termination of pregnancy.

      Currently, no technique allows studying the appearance kinetic for the maternal blood in the
      IVS by a describing way. This kinetic would have a major impact on the progression of
      pregnancy and it analysis may permit a screening test and an early diagnosis for PE- or
      IUGR-risky pregnancies.
