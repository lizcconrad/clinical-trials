    <textblock>
      The problem of rehospitalizations in the US is well documented but poorly understood.
      Although Medicare compares the rates of rehospitalization across the country, we have found
      no comparison of different countries. This is a first attempt to compare rehospitalization in
      the US with France where national health insurance (NHI) provides easy access to primary care
      but, like the US, policymakers struggle to improve coordination between hospitals and
      community-based health care providers.Although France's NHI system with central state
      intervention differs from the United States' tradition of federalism, private health
      insurance and pluralism, policymakers seek to achieve cost savings and to reform the health
      care system. A recent literature review on avoidable rehospitalization of older persons in
      France cited studies on the topic and relied largely on ones from the US. Starting in 2013,
      the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) 'Hospitals Readmissions Reductions
      Program' withheld up to 1% of regular reimbursements for hospitals with higher than expected
      (by CMS) rates of rehospitalization, within 30 days of discharge, due to heart attacks, heart
      failure and pneumonia. CMS increased this to 2% in 2014, will raise it to 3% in 2015 and may
      subsequently expand the list of conditions for which it will penalize early
      rehospitalizations. Policymakers in France have been reluctant to implement a hospital pay
      for performance system based on a rehospitalization indicator whose validity is a subject of
      considerable controversy. Despite the controversy and differences in approach, a comparison
      of rehospitalizations between the US and France provides a cross-national perspective on a
      timely policy issue facing both countries.

      Data sources :

      The hospital administrative data for this study are from the SNIIRAM (Syste`me National
      d'Informations Inter Regimes de l'Assurance Maladie) which also includes the national
      hospital reporting system (PMSI - Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Information. The
      SNIIRAM is a centralized administrative database of all health services reimbursed under
      France's NHI program. The PMSI, based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), is a centralized
      administrative database of hospital discharge records by diagnosis, procedure, age and
      residence of patients from all hospitals in France. It is managed by a national agency
      (ATIH).

      To calculate the proportion of rehospitalized patients (65Ã¾) who received outpatient visits
      (all physician consultations in community-based practice, as well as hospital outpatient
      visits) between the time of discharge and rehospitalization, we collaborated with analysts at
      the French NHI fund (CNAMTS). We linked the individual identifying variable for
      rehospitalized patients and extracted the outpatient visits from the SNIIRAM database for all
      medical and surgical admissions. Of the total number of hospitalized French patients aged 18
      years and over (5,804,677) with identifiers in 2010, only 299,364 (5%) were unidentified
      after linking these datasets. These patients are most likely to have been foreigners and
      newborns who had not yet received an identifier. Outpatient visits include all physician
      consultations in community-based practice, as well as hospital outpatient visits.
