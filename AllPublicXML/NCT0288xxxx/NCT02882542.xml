    <textblock>
      NOTE: This is the third of in total 7 sub-studies related to the Ethics Committee of the
      Canton of Bern Ref. No. KEK-BE 2016-00674. This sub-study includes 50 participants and 6
      arms, in total 350 participants will be assessed in all 7 sub-studies.

      General study information: This is a randomized, cross-over, quantitative study, which
      investigates physiological variables, mood, and affect of healthy participants in response to
      colored light exposure. The Participants take part in 5-8 arms and are exposed to colored
      light only, or are additionally asked to solve cognitive tasks during the colored light
      exposure. Primary aim is to measure the change in several physiological variables, mood, and
      affect during colored light exposure of 15 or 45 minutes. The risk for the participants is
      negligible and comparable to the risk during daily life.
