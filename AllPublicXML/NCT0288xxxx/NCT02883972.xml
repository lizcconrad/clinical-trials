      This study will investigate whether influenza vaccine uptake by school-age children (in
      school-based clinics) can be increased by making behavioural-insight informed changes to the
      invitation process which encourage parents to return consent forms.

    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that small changes to the invitation phrasing and/or process
      informed by understanding and insights into behaviour can be used to increase a desired
      behaviour (e.g. uptake of health checks, reducing primary care antibiotic prescribing).

      This trial will determine whether a behaviour-insight informed invitation letter and/or
      reminder Short Message Service (SMS)/email message can increase return of consent forms and
      thereby increase uptake of childhood flu vaccine in schools.

      The trial will take place within the existing national childhood immunisation programme in
      participating areas in England. Randomisation will be at the school-level (stratified by
      local authority). All eligible children within a school will therefore be in the same arm of
      the trial and be subject to the same invitation process. Outcome data will be routinely
      collected, school-level influenza vaccine uptake data. Data will also be collected on the
      implementation of email/SMS reminders in all schools.

      The analysis will investigate the main effects of the interventions and their interactions,
      take into account provider, local authority and school effects and explore the impact of
      other factors such as deprivation indicators.

      An analysis of letters used by providers of childhood influenza immunisation in schools not
      involved in the trial will also be conducted. All providers will be asked to submit a copy of
      their invitation letter for the 2016/17 programme and these will be analysed using the
      Theoretical Domains Framework.
