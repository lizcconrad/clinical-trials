  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hairy-cell leukemia is a rare and indolent lymphoid disorder, representing 2% of all cases of
      lymphoid leukemias. Treatment of hairy-cell leukemia relies mainly on the purine analogs,
      cladribine and pentostatin, which have shown similar efficacy and constitute the gold
      standard of care either as front-line therapy or for relapsed patients.

      However, despite the remarkable response rates obtained with purine analogs therapy, some
      patients will eventually relapse and the efficacy of these agents seems to decrease at each
      line of treatment. The addition of new molecules to purine analogs may improve the response
      rates and prevent relapse.

      Rituximab is a chimeric IgG1 kappa-type monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20
      molecule. It was first used in relapsed patients with hairy-cell leukemia more than 10 years
      ago and several series of patients treated with rituximab as monotherapy were published in
      the following decade, reporting response rates ranging from 25% to 80%.

      Aims of the study were :

        -  to assess the overall efficacy of rituximab in a cohort of unselected patients with
           hairy-cell leukemia

        -  to identify factors associated to treatment response, to duration of treatment response
           and to patient survival in a cohort of unselected patients with hairy-cell leukemia
