      Background: Combinations of dendritic and cytokine-induced killer cell (D-CIK) based adoptive
      immunotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody may enhance the immune response and stop cancer cells
      from growing.

      Objective: Phase II clinical trial to investigate the safety, clinical activity and toxicity
      of combinations of D-CIK and anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with treatment-refractory solid
      tumors.

      Methodology: Phase II clinical trial in patients with advanced metastatic hepatocellular
      carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma,bladder cancer,colorectal cancer,non-small-cell lung
      cancer,breast cancer and other solid cancers. The D-CIK was isolated from peripheral blood of
      participants,then activated,expanded and incubated with anti-PD-1 antibody before infusion.
      The enough number (1.0-1.5 *10^10 cells) of D-CIK were infused back into participants.

      Heparinized peripheral blood was obtained from participants over a 2-week period. PBMCs were
      separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, suspended in X-VIVO 15 serum-free
      medium, and culture with 1000 U/ml rhIFN-γfor the first 24 h, followed by stimulation with
      100 ng/ml OKT3 , 1000 U/ml rhIL-2 and 100 U/ml IL-1α to activate the CIK.Dendritic cells were
      incubated with CIK. Fresh medium containing 1000 U/ml rhIL-2 was added every 2 days and the
      cell density was maintained at 2×10^6 cells/mL.D-CIK were harvested, washed, and resuspended
      after culture for 14 days. Before cell transfer,D-CIK were incubated with anti-PD-1
      antibody,and a fraction of the D-CIK were collected to assess their number, phenotype, and
      viability of cells, and to test for possible contamination by bacteria, fungi, or endotoxins.
      Then, autologous D-CIK (1.0-1.5*10^10 cells) were transferred to patients via intravenous
      infusion. Generally, participants received at least 4 cycles of treatment at 2-week intervals
      or received doses until disease progression occurred. If the participants were
      disease-stable, additional cycles of maintenance treatment were eligible.

      Participants will be evaluated for the safety, clinical activity and toxicity. The primary
      end point was the objective response for each participant at the time of D-CIK and anti-PD-1
      infusion as assessed by RECIST. Peripheral blood of patients were also assessed for related
      cytokine using ELISPOT assays. Additional,the investigators will evaluate tumor markers in
      participants with clinical response/non-response by immunohistochemical staining of tumor
      sections from previous diagnostic or therapeutic biopsy samples to determine the predictive
      biomarker that may be used in future studies.
