    <textblock>
      This is a single centre open label study measuring lower limb physiology in patients with
      venous leg ulcers at the University Hospital of South Manchester.

      Ambulatory venous pressure, venous transit times, wound bed tissue oxygenation and changes in
      microcirculation will be measured at baseline after the gekoTM device is activated.
      Ambulatory venous pressure and venous transit times will be performed whilst the participant
      is standing, sitting and supine
