  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the use of fresh
      hypothermically stored human amniotic membrane (Affinity; fHSAM) to determine if addition of
      fHSAM to standard of care (SOC) results in faster healing of Wagner grade 1 and 2 DFUs
      compared to SOC alone.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, controlled open-label study designed to evaluate
      the safety and effectiveness of Affinity fresh amniotic membrane plus standard of care
      therapy (SOC) versus SOC in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

      The standard of care therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU, appropriate sharp or
      surgical debridement, and aggressive infection management. A number of offloading systems are
      commercially available. The choice of offloading will be at the discretion of the Principal
      Investigator but should be total contact casting, fixed ankle walker boot, or equivalent
      device to the fixed ankle walker boot.

      The study will have two phases: Screening and Treatment.

      The Screening Phase (1 -14 days) is designed to determine whether subjects are eligible to
      proceed to the Treatment Phase of the study and consists of a series of screening assessments
      designed to determine eligibility. At the first Screening Phase Visit, the Investigator will
      select the study (target) ulcer. Each subject will have only one DFU selected as the study
      (target) ulcer. In the situation in which a subject has more than one DFU at the S1 visit,
      the Investigator will select the largest DFU that meets the eligibility criteria of the
      protocol as the study (target) ulcer. Subjects whose target ulcer has been treated with SOC
      for 2 weeks are eligible to enter the treatment phase immediately once all of the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria are met. If the ulcer has not received SOC, the subject should be
      placed into SOC and enrolled in the study after 14 days of offloading.

      The Treatment Phase (12 weeks) begins with a series of assessments designed to confirm the
      subjects' continued eligibility. Investigators will debride the ulcer, if required. Subjects
      whose ulcers continue to meet eligibility criteria will then be randomized to 1 of 2 groups:
      (1) standard of care plus weekly application of fHSAM for up to 4 weeks and thereafter per
      treatment guidelines (2) standard of care. During the Treatment Phase, subjects will be
      evaluated on a weekly basis. Efficacy evaluations each week will include Investigator
      assessment of ulcer healing and measurements of ulcer size using digital photos. Safety
      evaluations during the Treatment Phase will consist of adverse event assessments at each
      visit. Subject will be seen weekly (± 3 days) until the ulcer is healed or study exit if the
      study ulcer area has not been reduced by at least 40% within 6 weeks, or 1 week after last
      application treatment week 12.

             the dermis or subcutaneous tissue and may involve the tendon or muscle, on any aspect
             of the foot provided it is below the medial aspect of the malleolus.

          3. The index ulcer will be the largest ulcer if 2 or more DFUs are present with the same
             Wagner grade and will be the only one in the study. If other ulcerations are present
             on the same foot they have to be more than 2 cm apart from the index ulcer.

          4. Index ulcer (i.e. current episode of ulceration) has been present for greater than 4
             weeks prior to the initial screening visit and less than 1 year.

          5. Study ulcer is a minimum of 0.75 cm2 and a maximum of 25 cm2 at first treatment visit.

          6. Adequate circulation to the affected foot as demonstrated by a dorsum transcutaneous
             oxygen measurement (TCOM) or a skin perfusion pressure (SPP) measurement of ≥ 30 mmHg,
             or an ABI between 0.7 and 1.3 within 3 months of the first Screening Visit,or TBI of &gt;

             than diabetes.

          2. Index ulcer, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer and should
             undergo an ulcer biopsy to rule out a carcinoma of the ulcer.

          3. Subjects with a history of more than two weeks treatment with immunosuppressants
             (including systemic corticosteroids &gt;10 mg daily), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or

             Screening Visit, or who receive such medications during the screening period, or who
             are anticipated to require such medications during the course of the study.

          4. Subjects on any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days
             preceding the first Screening Visit.

          5. History of radiation at the ulcer site.

          6. Index ulcer has been previously treated with tissue engineered materials (e.g.
             Apligraf® or Dermagraft®) or other scaffold materials (e.g. Oasis, Matristem) within
             the last 30 days preceding the first Screening Visit or will need to be treated with
             any prohibited therapies.

          7. Affected extremity requiring negative pressure wound therapy or subject requiring
             hyperbaric oxygen during the course of the trial.

          8. Presence of any condition(s) which seriously compromises the subject's ability to
             complete this study, or has a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.

          9. Osteomyelitis or bone infection of the affected foot as verified by X-ray within 30
             days prior to Randomization.

         10. Subject is pregnant or breast feeding.

         11. Presence of diabetes with poor metabolic control as documented with an HgA1c &gt; 12.0
