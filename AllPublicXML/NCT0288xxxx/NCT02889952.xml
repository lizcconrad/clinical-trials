      This Before-and-after Controlled Study study evaluates the clinical impact of parathyroid
      autofluorescence visualization using near infrared light (NIR) during total thyroidectomy
      (TT).

      It compares two groups of consecutive patients who underwent TT associated or not to lymph
      node dissection (LND) with and without intraoperative use of NIR, by the same surgeon.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total thyroidectomy (TT) is responsible for postoperative hypocalcemia in 20-30% of patients,
      which is definitive in 1-4% of operated patients (1).

      This complication is mainly due to surgery-induced parathyroid dysfunction, which could be
      improved by a better intraoperative identification of the parathyroids.

      Intraoperative parathyroid auto-fluorescence visualization (without any dye injection) using
      near infrared light (NIR) is an emerging technique, which allows correct identification of
      normal parathyroids in almost all cases (2), but the clinical impact of NIR is unknown.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of intraoperative use of NIR camera
      on postoperative hypocalcemia. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of NIR on the
      visualization, autotransplantation and inadvertent resection rates during TT.

      The investigators compare 2 groups of patients operated by one surgeon during 2 consecutive
      but distinct periods (before and after the use of NIR) with control groups operated by
      another surgeon during the same periods. This study is observational since there was no
      predefined protocol nor sample size calculation of study groups prior to data collection.

    <description>Surgical field was examined with NIR, during a few minutes (&lt;5') with room lights switched off, to avoid parasite lights, then conventional open thyroidectomy was resumed conventionally. Real-time images, evocative of autofluorescent parathyroids, were checked visually.
NIR consisted of a 750 nm class 1 laser excitation, with a power &lt;20mW/cm2 (5 times less than the limit of 100mw/cm2, fixed by the international norm IEC 60601-2-41). It was provided by the Fluobeam® camera, which was inserted into a sterile cover and hold at a 15-20 cm distance from the patient. The system has an FDA 510(k) authorization for clinical use in parathyroid surgery and a European Community certification (Class 1 device).</description>
