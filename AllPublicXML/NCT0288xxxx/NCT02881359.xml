  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of commercially available LifeSeal® Kit as measured
      by the incidence of post-operative clinical anastomotic leak rates in subjects undergoing low
      and ultralow anterior resection with an anastomosis. All patients treated with LifeSeal® will
      be offered to participate

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LifeSeal® Kit is a novel surgical sealant intended to be used as an adjunct to suture or
      staple line during standard surgical repair of the GI tract (anastomosis or linear) to
      provide re-inforcement and help reduce leaks. The LifeSeal™ Kit has recently been CE
      certified on March 2016 for marketing in the European Union.
