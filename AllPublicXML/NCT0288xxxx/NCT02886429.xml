  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is the most undesired consequence of surgery, and if not managed
      adequately, can lead to delayed recovery and increased hospital stay. Surveys continue to
      reveal that postoperative pain is insufficiently managed throughout the first world, let
      alone in the Third World. An American survey over 20 years showed that only one in four
      patients had adequate relief of postoperative pain. This has led recovery room protocols to
      include pain as a fifth vital sign that needs to be addressed before patients are discharged
      to the ward

      This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, parallel assignment clinical trial will be done
      after receiving approval from the local ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Assiut
      University. A written informed consent will be taken after discussing a detailed description
      of the study with the patients.

      Patients will be allocated randomly into two equal groups by computer programs and will be
      contained in sealed opaque envelopes.

      Patients will be premedicated with midazolam (0.1mg/kg), 30 min before the operation.
      Patients will be monitored with ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, temperature,
      oxygen saturation, exhaled CO2 (end tidal capnography), and train of four. In both groups,
      general anesthesia will be induced with propofol (2mg/kg) and fentanyl (1 mcg/kg). Tracheal
      intubation will be facilitated with cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia will be maintained
      with isoflurane (1-2 %) and cisatracurium (0.05 mg/kg per dose). Fentanyl (0.5mcg/kg) will be
      repeated if heart rate (HR) and/or mean arterial pressure (MAP) rise 20 % above baseline
      values. After the end of anesthesia induction and before surgical procedure Technique of
      ultrasound guided paravertebral block will be done in both groups.

The quality of effective analgesia will be expressed as VAS values derived from the VAS pain score, at rest and during coughing during each assessment period (2 h, at 4, 8 and 24 h).</description>
