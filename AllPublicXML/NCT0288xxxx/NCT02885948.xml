    <textblock>
      Delayed respiratory depression is a well-documented side effect associated with the use of
      intrathecal morphine. This respiratory depression has implications for patient safety and
      necessitates either the observation of the patient in a high dependency setting for at least
      24 hours or the use of an alternative analgesic technique. Other associated side effects
      include pruritus, nausea and vomiting and sedation. Naloxone is the most effective treatment
      for these side effects. However, it is usually given as a reactive treatment when the side
      effect presents.

      The hypothesis is that patients who are commenced on a naloxone infusion at low dose early
      after injection of intrathecal morphine will have a clinically significant reduction in
      incidence of these side effects. The primary endpoint is a reduction in respiratory
      depression.

    <description>The naloxone arm of the study will receive naloxone at a rate of 5mcg/kg/hr which equates to 0.25ml/kg/hr. Each 1 ml ampoule of solution contains 400 micrograms (0.4mg) naloxone hydrochloride present as naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate.
Excipients: each 1ml contains 3.55mg sodium. This will be diluted to a concentration of 20mcg/ml with 0.9% NaCl. Presented as solution for injection or infusion. Clear colourless sterile solution.</description>
