  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, evaluate and translate highly accelerated imaging sequences (each
      protocol under 5 minutes) for in-vivo knee Osteoarthritis applications on a standard clinical
      3T scanner using novel compression sensing and parallel imaging strategies.The overarching
      objective of the study is to establish a non-invasive imaging biomarker based on the
      development of rapid relaxation mapping with compressed sensing (CS) that will be clinically
      useful for assessment of early Osteoarthritis. A total of 90 subjects including 30 patients
      with high risk of developing knee OA, 30 patients with mild OA and 30 healthy controls will
      be accrued.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current noninvasive imaging methods to evaluate knee joints include plain radiographs,
      computed tomography (CT), and clinical morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
      joint structures. These techniques can only detect later-stage, macroscopic joint structural
      abnormalities that are irreversible and not amenable to early therapy. This study aims to
      develop highly accelerated imaging sequences for ex-vivo knee OA applications on a standard
      clinical 3T scanner using novel CS and parallel imaging (PI) strategies.

    <measure>Knee Injury and OA Outcomes Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Knee-specific instrument, developed to assess the patients' opinion about their knee and associated problems. The KOOS evaluates both short-term and long-term consequences of knee injury. It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster University OA Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS similar to the WOMAC uses a 5 point scale (0-4) but with the scales reversed; sub scores are calculated and transformed to a 0-100 scale, with 0 representing poor outcomes and 100 representing improved function and better quality of life</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Instrument for assessing multiple domains of activity in older adults but that has been validated for use in persons with knee OA. The questions will evaluate both occupational and non-occupational knee bending, squatting and stair climbing, will be adapted from a widely used instrument that has shown associations of these activities with knee OA in multiple studies. These are routine questionnaires used by OA clinicians.</description>
