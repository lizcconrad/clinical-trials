  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify if a protocol of early and progressive mobility which
      includes the use of technology is able to increase the level of physical activity and improve
      functionality and respiratory and muscular function of Intensive Care Unit patients compared
      with conventional Physical Therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evolution of treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has increased the survival and
      morbidity post hospital. Functional disability in these patients has its main factor in the
      weakness and loss of muscle mass, which is the major complications reported by these
      patients. The most negative result in long-term post ICU is the impact on quality of life and
      functional decline due to muscle disorders and fitness. This is achieved by the period of
      inactivity and prolonged rest, leading to losses and changes in various body systems. Given
      these facts, interventions for greater mobility in bed and out of it are very important.
      Early mobility programs has proved beneficial, however, as in other types of rehabilitation,
      the exercises should be prescribed with its specific characteristics, including the
      intensity. However, little has been described in the researches abut the activity level in
      the ICU, and using a quantitative measure. The use of technology seems to facilitate the
      offering of this type of therapy, supplying the limitations. Therefore, there are little
      evidences about these topics and randomized controlled studies to investigate these factors.

    <description>Control group will receive respiratory therapy according to the service routine and conventional physical therapy. Conventional physical therapy will be offered by the hospital physical therapists, according to their own criteria. Consists of passive, assisted and resisted mobilization, positioning in bed, transferring to bedside or chair, orthostatism and deambulation, however without a definition of a protocol. The physical therapist will be responsible for the choice of the techniques employed in each session. There will be no previous definition of the next sessions. No technology equipment will be used in this group, since they are not available in the routine care.</description>
