    <textblock>
      This study involves the treatment of cognitive impairment secondary to moderate to severe
      brain injury using central thalamic deep brain stimulation. Although all patients will
      receive stimulation continuously through a surgically implanted pacemaker-like device, half
      of the patients will have the device deactivated during a blinded assessment phase. The
      device will be reactivated following this assessment and patients will have the option to
      continue stimulation in an open-label continuation.

      This preliminary safety study evaluates the use of the Medtronic Activa PC+S system and
      Medtronic Nexus-E system for central thalamic deep brain stimulation (CT-DBS) in the
      treatment of cognitive impairment secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). It involves a
      neurosurgical procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain, connected to an
      implanted pacemaker-like device in the chest. The proposed study, if successful, will provide
      supporting evidence for the development of a novel therapeutic approach utilizing CT-DBS to
      improve these enduring cognitive impairments arising in persons with multi-focal structural
      brain injuries. This research will address the critical gap of the lack of any available
      treatments. CT-DBS targets well-defined neuronal populations within the central thalamus that
      have known anatomical and physiological specializations, which not only provide a key role in
      arousal regulation during cognitively-mediated behaviors, but also exhibit a particular
      vulnerability to dysfunction in the setting of multi-focal, non-selective brain injuries.

      Our proposed study aims to support development of CT-DBS as a novel therapeutic avenue for
      accessing cognitive reserve in patients with acquired brain injuries. In the proposed
      feasibility study of 6 subjects at a single investigational site, we will test the safety of
      CT-DBS in the severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) population with GOSE 6-7 level recovery
      and collect data to establish the translation of preclinical studies into human application
      of CT-DBS.
