      This is a pilot study to evaluate the impact of massage therapy in hospice patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As an integrative therapy, there is growing evidence that massage therapy can be an effective
      therapeutic tool for relief of pain and non-pain symptoms in hospice and palliative care
      patients. Massage therapy can provide comfort, relaxation, and improve quality of life for
      patients. The primary aim of the study is to gather data on the effects of complementary
      massage therapy on patient's symptoms and quality of life. The study goal is to improve
      patient symptoms of pain, anxiety, depression, and quality of life through the use of massage
      therapy provided to hospice patients. Questionnaires would be utilized before and after each
      massage intervention and would quantify symptom and quality of life levels.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Edmonton Symptom Assessment System - Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoints are patient pain, depression, anxiety and wellbeing as measured by ESAS-r. Pro-rated area under the curve (AUC) statistics will be calculated for all individual items and total scores. The pro-rated AUC for ESAS-r measured pain, depression, anxiety, and wellbeing will all be utilized individually to assess the primary endpoint. The pro-rated AUC will be compared to the assessment score prior to any massage therapy. If there is any improvement, the massage therapy will be considered a success since any improvement will be seen as beneficial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Edmonton Symptom Assessment System - Revised (Other symptoms)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints include all other symptoms (tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, shortness of breath) as measured by the ESAS-r. Similar analysis will be conducted for all other endpoints as was conducted for the primary outcome. Pro-rated area under the curve (AUC) statistics will be calculated for all individual items and total scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Linear Analogue Self Assessment (LASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints include symptoms as measured by the LASA (overall quality of life [QOL], mental well-being, physical well-being, emotional well-being, social activity, spiritual well-being, pain frequency, pain severity, fatigue, and social support). LASA items are stand alone, thus no scoring is necessary, but individual LASA items may be transposed so lower scores mean worse symptoms and higher scores mean less symptoms. This will allow consistency and thus easier data interpretation. Pro-rated area under the curve (AUC) statistics will be calculated for all individual items and total scores. Similar analysis will be conducted for all other endpoints as was conducted for the primary outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints include depression and anxiety symptoms as measured by the PHQ-4. Similar analysis will be conducted for all other endpoints as was conducted for the primary outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pearlin role overload measure (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints include caregiver stress as measured by the ROM. Pro-rated area under the curve (AUC) statistics will be calculated for all individual items and total scores. Similar analysis will be conducted for all other endpoints as was conducted for the primary outcome.</description>

    <description>The massage therapy is provided by certified massage therapists and delivered in the home setting. Techniques and duration of massage therapy is customized based on input from the patient and/or caregiver at the start of the session regarding nature and location of discomfort and other symptoms, and based on other factors such as contra-indications/complicating factors, medical issues, and additional diagnoses. The number of massage therapy interventions range from 2-3, 1 week apart, with each session lasting between 20-45 minutes in duration.</description>
