    <textblock>
      The level of knowledge about the consequences of oropharyngeal cancer treatment on sleep
      quality remains poor. Because of a high level of risk of developing an Obstructive Sleep
      Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), an accurate evaluation of the prevalence, of the risk factors and of
      the impact on quality of life is important in order to propose preventive and therapeutic
      solutions to these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) remains poorly documented in head and neck cancer
      cancer population, who have a higher risk than the general population. OSAS is a risk factor
      for quality of life impairment and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      This study proposes to carry out an OSAS prevalence study among a locally advanced head and
      neck cancer population, already treated and to compare the consequences of current
      therapeutic options in sleep quality.The primary research objective will be a prevalence
      determination in a locally advanced stages treated population of oropharyngeal cancer.
      Secondary objectives will be the comparison of the prevalence between the surgical group and
      the radio-chemotherapy group, the research of predictive factors of presenting an OSAS and
      the precision of the impact on quality of life.
