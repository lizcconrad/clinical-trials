  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee joint osteoarthritis (OA) reduces functional mobility and performance of daily tasks
      such as rising from a chair. Therefore interventions aimed at improving muscle strength and
      sit-to-stand task performance are very important for these patients. The effect of exercise
      programs, including home exercise programs (HEP), on muscle strength, joint pain and function
      is well known and widely researched, yet not many studies have investigated the effect of an
      HEP on electromyographic activity (EMG) of muscles when performing everyday tasks, such as
      rising from and sitting on a chair. The aim of this study was to investigate effect of
      prehabilitation in women with severe knee joint OA scheduled for knee joint arthroplasty
      (TKA).
