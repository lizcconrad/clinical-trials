      Local excision for early rectal cancer has proven its feasibility and oncological safety.
      Indeed, lymph node invasion does not exceed 1% and 10% in pT1sm1 and pT1sm2 rectal carcinomas
      respectively. Two procedures are currently performed in these early cancers as well as in
      preneoplastic lesions. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), which has proven its
      superiority over traditional transanal excision, is a surgical approach associated with a 92%
      R0 excision rate, a survival comparable to radical anterior resection and a low morbidity. It
      consists of a full-thickness excision. The second procedure is a recently introduced
      technique: the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), which encompasses only the mucosa and
      submucosa. ESD enables endoscopists to achieve higher en bloc resection rates than standard
      mucosectomy and is associated with a 88% R0 resection rate, which decreases to 65% in the
      subgroup of European series. Though very promising, the role of ESD remains controversial in
      malignant lesions with few published reports. There are therefore 2 different techniques with
      2 different dissections (full-thickness vs. submucosal) to achieve the same oncological
      treatment. So far, only one retrospective single-center study including 63 patients has
      compared TEM and ESD in early rectal cancer without finding any difference between the 2
      procedures, and there are no other available studies comparing TEM and ESD for any type of
      colorectal tumor. The aim of the present research is to compare ESD with TEM for early rectal
      cancer and rectal adenomas for short- and long-term outcomes.
