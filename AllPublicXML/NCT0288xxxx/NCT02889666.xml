    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the commonly administered chemotherapeutic
      agents including cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel and gemcitabine for solid
      tumors in clinical oncology, either a single format or given as combinations followed by
      surgery are effective in the treatment of relapsed and refractory non-small cell lung cancer
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung carcinoma is a malignant disease characterized by uncontrolled alveolar type II
      epithelial cell growth in lung tissues. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8
      million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths, making it the most common cause of
      cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most
      common age at diagnosis is 70 years, and less than 20% of people diagnosed with lung cancer
      can survive five years post diagnosis. The two main types of lung carcinomas are small cell
      lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). NSCLC represents the most
      common type of lung cancers, and approximately 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. Squamous cell
      carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma are all subtypes of NSCLC, the latter
      associated with high mortality in overall cancer populations with limited treatment options.

      In this study, the investigators performed a Phase I, open label, agent-combination
      exploration, multicenter clinical trial to establish the treatment efficacy of several
      chemotherapeutic agents in patients with recurrent NSCLC who have undergone prior surgery for
      the primary disease. Up to four cohorts have been enrolled to determine the effectiveness and
      safety of single or combinational therapeutic strategy. Besides the five-year disease-free
      survival, overall survival and five-year metastasis-free survival post treatment, the
      investigators also take into account the anticancer agent-induced tumor stroma damage extent,
      which may provide further evidence to support the treatment efficacy and assess the potential
      influence of a damaged tumor microenvironment on disease progression or regression in
      clinical settings.
