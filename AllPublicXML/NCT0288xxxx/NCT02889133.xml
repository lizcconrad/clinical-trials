      Primary Hypothesis

        -  The 24-hour post-transfusion RBC recovery of units obtained from donors exhibiting
           iron-deficient erythropoiesis will not meet FDA standards for clinical use.

        -  The 24-hour post-transfusion RBC recovery of units obtained after intravenous iron
           repletion will improve significantly and will meet FDA standards for clinical use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is common among regular blood donors, but the recovery and quality of red
      blood cell (RBC) units from iron-deficient donors has not been rigorously examined. Evidence
      from both animal and human studies indicate that when the iron supply for erythropoiesis is
      inadequate, the RBCs produced have multiple metabolic defects that impair their ability to
      tolerate refrigerated storage. Studies in a mouse model demonstrated decreased
      post-transfusion recovery of refrigerator-stored RBCs obtained from iron-deficient donors.
      The planned studies will identify human donors at greatest risk of providing RBCs with poor
      post-transfusion recovery by using a combination of a decreased serum ferritin concentration
      and increased RBC zinc protoporphyrin, as described below. To evaluate unequivocally the role
      of iron deficiency in poor posttransfusion RBC recovery, intravenous iron will be used for
      iron repletion.

    <description>The way the FDA determines how good blood is for transfusion is called a &quot;radioactive 51-Chromium 24-hour post-transfusion red cell recovery study.&quot; The purpose is to measure how many of the transfused red cells are still in circulation (being pumped by the heart through blood vessels) 24 hours after transfusion. In order to measure the percent of red cells that are still in circulation, a small amount of the donated blood will be radioactively labeled. This will be infused in one arm and then blood will be collected from the other arm at different time points to measure how much of the transfused red cells are still in circulation.</description>
