  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non tumor salivary gland diseases are common and include sialadenitis, sialadenosis, stones,
      stricture and ductal dilatation, anatomical abnormalities. A radiological examination is
      required in order to sign the diagnosis, locate precisely the lesions and define the
      therapeutic strategy. Cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT), because of its accessibility
      and the possibilities it offers in terms of image processing, is a potential alternative to
      the conventional sialography and to the MRI sialography, considered as a gold standard
      procedure. Our comparative study, aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the 3D-CBCT
      sialography compared to MRI sialography, in patients with non tumor ductal salivary diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study focuses on patients over 18 years, with unilateral or bilateral parotid or
      submandibular salivary symptoms. Each patient included is given a MRI sialography and a
      3D-CBCT sialography at a later stage when the acute episode has subsided. Images are archived
      on the Carestream Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS). Interpretation is achieved
      after Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR), Maximal Intensity Projection (MIP) and
      three-dimensional rendering. A primary radiological analysis of the two procedures is
      systematically done by a specialist radiologist for the diagnostic and therapeutic care of
      the patient. A second radiological data analysis is carried out at the end of the study, by a
      specialized radiologist, different from the first one, to asses the two radiological
      examinations.

      The primary outcome measure is the capability of the radiological technique to detect a
      ductal salivary feature. Secondary outcomes include the clinical characteristics of the
      patients, the diagnostic capabilities in identifying the salivary lesions, their number,
      their precise location and measurements. A primary side effect in catheterization and
      dosimetric parameters for the CBCT technique will be systematically recorded.

    <description>MRI sialography: Achieved on a 3 Tesla MRI (INGENA 3T Philips Medical Systems). Patient supine positioned. Sialo-MR sequences (3D T2 DRIVE, TSE, SENSE and SPIR) and conventional sequences (T2 turbo spin echo).
3D CBCT sialography: Achieved same day as the MRI sialography, after acute episode subsided. 0.5ml of high concentration, water-soluble, iodinated contrast product (HEXABRIX 320Â®, 320g /L, Guerbet, France) is injected in the symptomatic salivary gland and maintained in the gland. Image acquisition performed on a wide-field CBCT device (NewTom VGi, QR, Verona, Italy). Front and profile scout views achieved. mA and exposure time modulated according to scout views. Reconstruction in Maximal Intensity Projection, 3-dimensional and MultiPlanar Reconstructions sections</description>
