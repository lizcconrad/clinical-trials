    <textblock>
      Clinical assessment of motor and sensory deficits is still today largely based on tests that
      do not permit any precise quantification. However, robotic technologies, coupled with
      neuroimaging techniques constitute new tools to assess sensorimotor functions that could
      allow to conceive neurorehabilitation protocols better adapted to the neurological impairment
      of each patient and to her/his specific recovery profile.

      The goal of this project is to contribute identifying the factors that determine functional
      recovery in stroke patients presenting upper-limb motor deficits. Here, we will focus our
      research on two factors that contribute in a complementary way to motor control: 1) the
      processing of proprioceptive informations, and 2) the processing of movement-execution
      errors. In this purpose, we will combine psychophysical methods that allow to precisely
      quantify sensorimotor deficits with functional and anatomical neuroimaging techniques. More
      specifically, we will exploit experimental protocols that have been developed in basic
      research, that use a robotic exoskeleton coupled with a virtual reality device, to precisely
      quantify motor and proprioceptive deficits in stroke patients. Then, we will link these
      behavioral data to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded during a motor adaptation
      task, as well as to anatomical data, namely conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      completed by diffusion tensor images (DTI) in order to achieve a finer description of the
      cerebral lesions.

      The present study will include two experimental parts, respectively centered on the
      proprioceptive deficits (Part 1) and the anomalies in the processing of movement-execution
      errors (Part 2).

      Proprioceptive deficits in stroke patients : We will test the hypothesis that, when present,
      deficits in kinaesthesia and troubles in unconscious proprioception contribute substantially
      to motor deficits in stroke patients ; with as a corollary hypothesis, that deficits in &quot;
      proprioception for action &quot; are more determinant than deficits in the conscious sense of
      position (classically tested in clinics). In this purpose, we will collect three sets of
      behavioral data, in chronic stroke patients and healthy control participants, respectively
      intended to assess a) motor deficits, b) troubles in conscious sense of position, and c)
      deficits in &quot;proprioception for action&quot;. To better document the neuronatomical substrates of
      these different types of deficits. In this purpose, we will link the obtained behavioral data
      with the results of detailed analyses of the lesions of the tested stroke patients.

      Anomalies in the processing of movement-execution errors in stroke patients : We will assess
      movement-execution error processing in stroke patients, in order to test the idea that
      anomalies in error processing might contribute to motor deficits in stroke patients. In this
      purpose, we will record an electrophysiological correlate (ERP) of movement-error processing
      during a motor adaptation task. We will analyse the relation between the modulation of this
      ERP and motor performance. We will also examine the relation between these two sets of data
      (behavioral and electrophysiological) and the behavioral data collected during the first part
      of the study (Proprioceptive deficits). This will provide us with insight into the
      relationship between proprioceptive deficits and cinematic error processing. As in the first
      part of the study, we will link the observed electrophysiological and behavioral anomalies
      with the results of a detailed analysis of the anatomical lesions of the tested patients.
