    <textblock>
      Health risk screening in adolescent primary care is infrequently performed and results are
      rarely followed by targeted intervention. In response to the need for screening-linked
      interventions, the study team has developed and optimized a web-based, electronic
      Personalized Motivational Feedback tool referred to as &quot;Check Yourself v2.0&quot; Based on
      motivational interviewing, a technique to mobilize personal change, Check Yourself is
      designed to promote healthy choices for the multiple behaviors relevant to adolescents.

      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of Check
      Yourself v2.0 to usual care. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of Check
      Yourself on reducing health risk behaviors and improving quality of care among adolescents
      receiving primary health care services relative to usual care.
