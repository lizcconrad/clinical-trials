  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare pembrolizumab to standard of care
      observation (no treatment) in controlling oral pre-malignant lesions and IENs. The safety and
      tolerability of pembrolizumab will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of certain types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is
      currently being used for research purposes in head and neck cancer. The study doctor can
      explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 250 people will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. If you are assigned to Arm A (the control
      group), you will not receive treatment and will only be observed. If you are in Arm B, you
      will receive pembrolizumab. This is called randomization.

      Both you and the study doctor will know to which group you have been assigned. If you are in
      Arm A, you will not be able to crossover into Arm B and you will not have any study visits
      until the end-of-treatment/follow-up visits (described below).

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 3 weeks (21 days).

      If you are in Arm B, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over 30 minutes on Day 1 (+/- 7
      days) of Cycles 1-4.

      Study Visits (Arm B Only):

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2-4:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 2, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  During Cycle 2, you will have 2 oral swabs for biomarker testing.

      Any blood, tissue, and oral swabs left over after study testing (including the follow-up
      visits described below) will be stored at MD Anderson for use in future biomarker testing,
      including genetic biomarkers, as described in this consent form.

      If at anytime during the study or during follow-up you are diagnosed with oral cancer, or if
      you previously had oral cancer and it returns:

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will have oral swabs for biomarker testing.

      Length of Study Participation:

      If you are in Arm B, you may receive pembrolizumab for up to 4 cycles. You will no longer be
      able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or
      if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Please speak to your study doctor if you would like to stop receiving the study drug so this
      can be done safely.

      All participants will take part in the end-of-treatment and follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 3 months after your first dose of study drug or randomization:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your tobacco and alcohol history will be collected.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  Oral lesions will be measured and biopsied to check the status of the disease. If you
           had a lesion and it went away, the area where the lesion was located previously will be
           biopsied.

        -  You will have 2 oral swabs collected for biomarker testing.

        -  If you are in Arm B, urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  If you are in Arm B and can become pregnant, blood (about 2 teaspoons) or part of the
           above urine sample will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      About 6, 9, 18, 24, and 30 months after your first dose of study drug or randomization:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your tobacco and alcohol history will be collected.

        -  At 6 months only and if you are in Arm B, blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for
           routine tests.

      About 12 and 36 months after your first dose of study drug or randomization:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your tobacco and alcohol history will be collected.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will have oral swabs collected for biomarker testing.

        -  At 12 months only, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  At 12 months only, if you have a lesion, it will be measured and biopsied. If you had a
           lesion and it went away, the area where the lesion was located previously will be
           biopsied.

      Long-Term Follow Up:

      You will be contacted (either called, mailed, or e-mailed) to check on how you are doing and
      your cancer status. This information may also be collected from your medical record, if
      needed. The study doctor will tell you how often you may be contacted. Each phone call should
      last about 10 minutes. This contact will continue unless you withdraw from the study.

      If you cannot be contacted for any reason, your family members may also be contacted to learn
      how you are doing. The study staff will ask you for their contact information (such as a
      phone number or email address). If you do not want to have your family members contacted, you
      do not have to give the researchers this information.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological evidence of oral intra-epithelial neoplasia within 12 months prior to
             enrollment. Subjects with a history or clinical diagnosis suggestive of oral
             intra-epithelial neoplasia, or patients with a history of invasive oral cancer are
             eligible, but must have a confirmed histological diagnosis of oral intra-epithelial
             neoplasia before randomization. Histological evidence of oral intraepithelial
             neoplasia on an invasive oral cancer resection specimen is acceptable. A visible,
             measurable, clinical lesion (such as leukoplakia and/or erythroplakia) is not
             required. Only individuals with high risk profiles will be considered eligible for
             randomization. High risk profiles are defined as patients without a prior oral cancer
             and have LOH at 3p14 and/or 9p21 plus at least at one additional chromosomal site
             (4q,8p,11p,13q, or 17p) or patients with a prior oral cancer history and have LOH at
             3p14 and/or 9p21. All high risk patients must also meet the additional eligibility
             criteria (2-9).

          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent.

             AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;/=2.5 X ULN

          7. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test &lt; 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses &gt; 1 year.
