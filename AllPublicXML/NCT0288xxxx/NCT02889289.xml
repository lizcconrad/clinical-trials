  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential for improving balance for a single individual with a
      history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The participant will engage in supervised therapy
      using commercial games on the Xbox Kinect. This study will also evaluate the viability of
      improving cardiovascular fitness using this intervention as well. The investigators
      hypothesize that balance improvements will occur and that using the Xbox Kinect is a viable
      way of improving cardiovascular fitness.

      Various forms of virtual reality (VR) training have been recently used for rehabilitation of
      neurological impairments including postural stability and coordination. Virtual reality
      training has also been shown to increase motivation and attention through its use of novel
      goal-directed challenges. The Xbox Kinect gaming system allows the Veteran to perform
      challenging full-body and goal-oriented activities. Balance improvements using laboratory
      developed games have been demonstrated in those with a history of TBI. However, the
      investigators are specifically interested if improvements can be made using commercial games
      which can be utilized in physical therapy clinics more readily. Exercise gaming has been
      shown to provide adequate intensity exercise to improve heart health in the healthy
      population. However, such benefits have not yet been investigated using the Xbox Kinect for
      individuals with a history of TBI.

    <description>The DGI is a common clinical measure used to evaluate dynamic balance and coordination during a person's daily activities. This test was developed by Shumway-Cook and features 8-items which assess a person's ability to walk while turning their head, changing speed, and navigating obstacles. The DGI is scored from 0 to 24 where higher scores indicate higher dynamic balance function.</description>

    <description>The LOS is performed on the NeuroCom Balance Manager. The LOS test is a goal-directed weight shifting task. The LOS-directional control measures the accuracy of an individual's movement of center of gravity during the task compared to a straight line. This is reported as a percentage without units.</description>

    <description>The Veteran completed 15 sessions of supervised VR training. Each session lasted between 50 and 60 minutes in total. The intervention utilized 2 commercially available Xbox One Kinect games called &quot;Shape Up&quot; and &quot;Kinect Sports: Rivals&quot; to challenge both cardiovascular and balance systems. Each game is composed of mini-games (MG). Each MG lasted between 1:30 minutes to 4:00 minutes. Both games were played for approximately 25 minutes during each session. Rest breaks were allowed as the participant required them. Guarding by a therapist was provided dependent on the challenge of the game and the participant's abilities.</description>

        <description>The LOS is performed on the NeuroCom Balance Manager. The LOS test is a goal-directed weight shifting task. The LOS-directional control measures the accuracy of an individual's movement of center of gravity during the task compared to a straight line.

Xbox One Kinect Gaming: The Veteran completed 15 sessions of supervised VR training. Each session lasted between 50 and 60 minutes in total. The intervention utilized 2 commercially available Xbox One Kinect games called “Shape Up” and “Kinect Sports: Rivals” to challenge both cardiovascular and balance systems. Each game is composed of mini-games (MG). Each MG lasted between 1:30 minutes to 4:00 minutes. Both games were played for approximately 25 minutes during each session. Rest breaks were allowed as the participant required them. Guarding by a therapist was provided dependent on the challenge of the game and the participant’s abilities.</description>
