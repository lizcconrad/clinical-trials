  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady-state concentrations of
      odalasvir (ODV), AL-335 and the combination of the 3-direct-acting anti-viral agents (3-DAA)
      ODV, AL-335, and simeprevir (SMV) on the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) of drospirenone and
      ethinylestradiol in healthy female participants.
