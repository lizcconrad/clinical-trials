    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the
      population worldwide. Although pathophysiology of this disease remains unclear, a growing
      interest is emerging for low-level sensory function, acknowledging that deficits in early
      stages of sensory processing are related to higher-order cognitive disturbances in
      schizophrenia. In the field of auditory processing, symptoms as auditory-hallucinations were
      found correlated with disabilities to discriminate psychoacoustic parameters of sounds.

      Outcomes: Our main hypothesis is that Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS) scores are
      correlated with the percentage of wrong answers in a Tone-Matching Task test. The main
      objective is to assess this correlation. Our other objectives are to assess correlation
      between AHRS as well as other symptoms scales and psychoacoustic tests assessing intensity,
      length discrimination of non-verbal tones and self-monitoring abilities. Impact of
      therapeutic procedures (neuromodulation, psychotherapy) conducted independently of our study
      on these psychoacoustic tests will also be assessed.

      Methods: 30 subjects with schizophrenia will be included. Clinical and psychoacoustic
      measures will be carried out at J-0. In the case of patients receiving therapeutic procedures
      independently of our study, new clinical and psychoacoustic measures will be carried out at
      J+7 and J+30.

    <description>Our study focuses on psychoacoustic tests, specialist care protocols (psychotherapy, neuromodulation ...) being made independently of our study, as part of medical activity of Cerletti care unit or differentiated protocols. Thus, our study shows no individual benefit for the patient. However, a better understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying auditory hallucinatory phenomenon could allow a better management of these patients in the near future</description>
