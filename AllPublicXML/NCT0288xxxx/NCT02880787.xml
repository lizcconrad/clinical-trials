  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the reproducibility of neuromuscular monitoring data of recovery
      from neuromuscular blockade, obtained with TOFScan® and TOF-Watch SX®, in adult and pediatric
      population.

      Secondary purposes are to evaluate the reproducibility of data obtained with 2 monitors for:

        -  the onset of clinical action of curare: suppression of the first response of train of
           four monitoring (T1) of 95% initial value

        -  the duration of clinical action of curare: recovery of the first response of train of
           four monitoring (T1) to 25% initial value

        -  recovery of first (T1), second (T2), third (T3) and fourth response (T4) of train of
           four monitoring, and recovery of T4/T1 to 40% and 60% initial value (T4/T1 0.4 and 0.6)

        -  complete recovery from curarisation, at T4/T1=90% and T4/T1=100%.
