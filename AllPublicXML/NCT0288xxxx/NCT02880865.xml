    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide evidence that co-administration of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine
      (MMR) and live attenuated SA 14-14-2 Japanese encephalitis vaccine (CD-JEV) does not
      adversely affect immunogenicity or safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When incorporating a new vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), it is
      important to provide evidence that it can be introduced concurrently with other routine
      pediatric vaccines without significantly impairing the immune response to any vaccine while
      maximizing coverage and minimizing cost. This non-inferiority study aims to compare CD-JEV
      and MMR responses in a population of children in a country where MMR introduction is ongoing
      or planned. This information will help the ministries of health evaluate the addition of
      CD-JEV into routine EPI.

    <ipd_description>The study team agrees that the practice of offering study results to participants in human research is fundamental to the ethical principle of respect for persons. However, the sponsor prefers to report at the aggregate level to maintain participant confidentiality and ensure results are community-based. Thus, the sponsor plans to report results at the aggregate level. The sponsor will produce a poster of the results to be placed at each health center. A community meeting may also be held to communicate the results. Aggregate results will also be posted on clinicaltrials.gov.</ipd_description>
