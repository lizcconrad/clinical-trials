      The purpose is to evaluate feasibility of medical supervision of professionally active
      asymptomatic wood workers with questionnaires and nasofibroscopy.

      Secondary purposes are:

        -  Feasibility evaluation of identification of former and actual professional expositions
           to wood dust and to various naso-sinusal carcinogenics in case of co-expositions
           (formaldehyde, chrome, nickel, leather)

        -  Description of abnormal symptoms identified by occupational doctor and needing an
           otorhinolaryngology test

        -  Description of results and examinations induced by nasofibroscopy in symptomatic or
           asymptomatic individuals: counting of naso-sinusal adenocarcinoma cases

        -  Evaluation of participation of workers retiring in 2 years after inclusion to medical
           supervision program

        -  Evaluation of information flow among different players

        -  Assessment of costs induced by this targeted screening: direct medical costs (screened
           pathologies, induced additional examinations…) and indirect costs for company (duration
           of worker absence for transfer, medical and additional examinations).
