  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an investigation of the neurologic, immunologic, and rheumatologic markers of
      Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). PANS is a condition characterized by
      the abrupt, dramatic onset of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or eating restriction
      accompanied by equally abrupt and severe co-morbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, which include
      anxiety, emotional lability, depression, irritability, aggression, oppositionality,
      deterioration in school performance, behavioral (developmental) regression, sensory
      amplification, movement abnormalities, sleep disturbance, and urinary frequency. PANS is
      thought to be caused by infection, inflammation, or alternate triggers that is associated
      with a brain response that leads to these symptoms. The purpose of this study is to examine
      specific neurologic, immunologic, rheumatologic, and genomic, components in children with the
      acute-onset of psychiatric symptoms. This research may begin to uncover a much larger story
      of autoimmune processes that are involved in psychiatric disorders of childhood. By better
      understanding the etiologic components of psychiatric phenomenon, future treatments may be
      better targeted to underlying causes.

      The investigators will recruit 500 children, 1-18 years old at onset with PANS/PANDAS. They
      will be treatment naive and within one month of onset/exacerbation. The 500 children with
      PANS will be gender- and age-matched to 100 healthy children, to allow examination of
      immunologic, neurologic, genomic, and behavioral differences between these two groups of
      children.

        The investigators to enroll 500 children with PANS/PANDAS and 100 healthy controls.
        Children's parents will also be enrolled to report information about their children as well
        as their own caregiver burden. The 500 patients with PANS will meet diagnostic criteria.
        These patients are targeted because this study is seeking to specifically assess the
        immunologic and neurological markers of PANS.
