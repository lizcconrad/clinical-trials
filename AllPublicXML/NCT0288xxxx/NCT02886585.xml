      This research study is studying Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for this diagnosis for
      metastases in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      Pembrolizumab may help the immune system fight cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved pembrolizumab FDA for some
      diseases that are being treated on this study, but not for central nervous system metastases.
      Researchers hope to study the effects of pembrolizumab. Many cancers use specific pathways
      (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune system. Pembrolizumab works by
      blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways and thus releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can
      stop or slow cancer.

      Researchers hope to study the effects of pembrolizumab in cancer that has metastasized to the
      brain. These drugs work by stimulating the immune system to fight cancer.

                         -  Patients who have had prior WBRT and/or SRS and then whose lesions have
                            progressed are eligible. Lesions treated with SRS may be eligible if
                            there is unequivocal evidence of progression

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy or study
             therapy within 14 days of protocol treatment, or those who have not recovered (i.e., ≤
             Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2
             weeks earlier. Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion
             and may qualify for the study. If subject received major surgery, they must have
             recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention
             prior to starting therapy.

             study requirements.

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab. In addition,
             these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Unable to undergo brain MRI.

          -  Participants who are receiving other concurrent chemotherapies or immunotherapies for
             their cancer (except for patients who will receive trastuzumab, bisphosphonates,
