    <textblock>
      Controlling of cancer induced anorexia is highly demanded by advanced cancer patients. It
      plays an important role in improving the quality of life among advanced cancer patients.
      Through a randomized controlled single blinded clinical research, we will observe the
      differences of appetite, food intake amount, weight and KPS between the auricular needling
      treating group and control group before and after the treatment. Based on the results of the
      research, we can prove the clinical effectiveness of auricular needling in treating cancer
      induced anorexia and possible mechanism of the method.

      Patients will be recruited from Xiyuan Hospital. In this study, eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to two groups. In the auricular needling treating group, patients will
      receive needling treating for 4 weeks(auricular needles are given to one ear every time for
      2-3days,then switch to the other). Conventional nutrition support and symptomatic treatment
      are given at the same time. In the control group, patient just receive conventional nutrition
      support and symptomatic treatment.

      The simple appetite questionnaire, a symptom based Anorexia assessment questionnaire and
      fatigue symptom inventory questionnaire are used to assess the condition of patients. Other
      observation index include weight, KPS, appetite and the expectation of patients.

    <description>Patients will be treated with auricular needling for 4 weeks. 4-8 specific auricular acupoints are selected unilaterally at a time, and alternate to another side every 2-3 days, treatment will last for 4 consecutive weeks. The following 4 ear acupoints points will be selected for every patient: Ear Shenmen, Stoma, Spleen, and Subcortex. Other ear acupoints including Triple Energizer, Liver, Sympathetic Nerve and Smallintestine will be selected based on the condition of patients. Treatment will be performed by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner.</description>
