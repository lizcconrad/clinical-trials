  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a symptom based disorder with a prevalence of 15% in the adult population and
      its management remains challenging. Although not life threatening, constipation is associated
      with impaired quality of life, increased healthcare costs and excess work absenteeism.
      Constipation represents a heterogeneous disorder with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Several
      risk factors have been suggested to lead to the condition and are divided in 3 main
      categories: a) physiological, b) environmental and c) demographic. To date, there is lack of
      large epidemiological studies on proposed aetiological factors of constipation, especially
      studies assessing all proposed risk factors of constipation together.

      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the multidimensional (physiological,
      environmental and demographic) predictors of constipation with the use of a multivariate
      analysis statistical model.

      This is a large single centre case control study comparing constipated adults with healthy
      individuals matched for age, gender and ethnicity.

      The duration of the study is 2 weeks in total and includes a screening visit, a 2 week run-in
      period and a baseline visit at the end of the run-in period. Transit time between constipated
      and healthy individuals is assessed at baseline visit. Differences in gastrointestinal
      symptoms, dietary intake as well as differences in stool output (e.g. stool frequency and
      consistency) between constipated and healthy individuals are assessed over the baseline
      period (the week before the baseline visit). Differences in female sex hormone levels as well
      as stool markers and markers of fermentation (e.g. fecal water, stool pH, short chain fatty
      acids) between constipated and healthy individuals are assessed at baseline visit.
      Furthermore, differences in environmental measures (physical activity, anxiety, smoking) and
      differences in demographic measures (age, gender, body mass index) between patients suffering
      from constipation and healthy individuals are also assessed at baseline visit.
