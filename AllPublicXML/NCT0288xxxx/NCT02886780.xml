  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) often becomes chronic if not treated. Exposure and
      response prevention (ERP) is recommended psychological treatment. The OCD-team at Haukeland
      University hospital has developed a concentrated 4-day treatment format which has been
      evaluated as part of standard care. Next step in the methodological development is to conduct
      a randomized controlled trial where the 4-day format is compared to self-help and waiting
      list. The study will be conducted at Solvang DPS, Sørlandet Hospital. Participants (16 in
      each group) are ordinary patients (&gt;18 yrs) entitled to care in the specialist health care.
