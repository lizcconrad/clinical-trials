      Multicenter, open-label, prospective designed study to characterize the performance of brain
      laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) ablation using the Monteris NeuroBlate System in
      combination with standard of care radiation therapy and temozolomide for the treatment of
      newly diagnosed glioblastomas (GBM).

          1. Biopsy proven supratentorial GBM that has not undergone previous surgical resection,
             radiation and/or chemotherapy

          2. Single enhancing lesion that is &gt;1 cm, but &lt; 4 cm in cross-sectional dimension,

          4. Serious infection, immunosuppression or concurrent medical condition (chronic or acute
             in nature) that may prevent safe participation or ability to meet follow-up
             requirements

          5. Pregnancy, or planning to become pregnant

          6. Patients whose physical dimensions cannot be accommodated in the MRI scanner or
