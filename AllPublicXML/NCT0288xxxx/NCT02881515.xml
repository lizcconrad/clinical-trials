      Excess dietary salt increases the risk for cardiovascular events, even in people that are not
      hypertensive. There is some evidence that excess dietary salt exaggerates blood pressure and
      sympathetic nervous system responses to various perturbations and increases blood pressure
      variability. This proposal will examine the effects of low, medium, and high salt diets on
      cardiovascular reactivity and blood pressure variability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess dietary salt causes target organ damage and increases the risk for adverse
      cardiovascular (CV) events independent of blood pressure (BP). Recent data in salt-resistant,
      normotensive rodents suggest that high dietary salt enhances the excitability or gain of
      sympathetic circuits, exaggerates sympathetic and CV responses to various stimuli, and
      increases BP variability (BPV). There are limited data regarding the impact of dietary salt
      intake on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and CV function in salt-resistant humans as well
      as the underlying mechanisms contributing to these adverse effects. The long-term goal is to
      determine how dietary salt adversely affects BP regulation and CV health. The objective of
      this proposal is to comprehensively evaluate the impact of dietary salt intake on SNA and CV
      reactivity and BPV in normotensive humans. The investigators have 2 specific aims: 1) Aim 1
      will test the hypothesis that high dietary salt increases SNA and CV reactivity in
      normotensive adults, 2) Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that high dietary salt increases BPV
      in normotensive adults. The expected outcome is to demonstrate that dietary salt loading
      increases CV reactivity and BPV through a sympathetic nervous system mechanism that
      originates in the brain. The proposed research is significant, as these studies will provide
      empirical evidence that dietary salt intake impacts neurohumoral control of the circulation
      in salt-resistant humans. The proposed research is innovative because it will identify a
      novel neurogenic action of dietary salt in human CV regulation.
