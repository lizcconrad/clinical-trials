  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the prevalence of anxiety / depression in post- hospital for parents (mothers and
      fathers) of children with tracheotomy before the age of 1 year between 2000 and 2012.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the level of anxiety / depression of families and to
      correlate to the lived parental of tracheotomy and indirectly that of the child (hetero -
      evaluation).

      The information from this study should allow staff to refine and adjust their practices in
      terms of information and support for families with tracheotomised children. The information
      given to families before the establishment of a tracheotomy for their child may also be
      adapted.
