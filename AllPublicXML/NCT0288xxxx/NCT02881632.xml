    <textblock>
      Viral illness, particularly chest infection causing breathing difficulty in infants and
      children is the commonest reason for admission to hospital. At present, there are no
      objective measurements of the degree of breathing difficulty.

      This is because current objective tests of breathing difficulty requires the patient to
      cooperate and actively perform the tests. This is not possible in babies and very challenging
      in young children. SLP is a noncontact, effort independent technique for measuring the rate
      of breathing, the amount of chest expansion and the relative contribution of chest and
      abdomen to the work of breathing. Measuring these parameters which are known to vary with
      increasing breathing difficulty will allow us to make objective assessments of breathing
      difficulty. This study proposes to validate this technique in babies aged 02 years who are
      healthy and in babies with clinical viral bronchiolitis. The Investigators intend to
      demonstrate that the technique is feasible in this young age group and that the investigators
      will be able to demonstrate clinically valid differences between normal and ill babies and
      also demonstrate measurable differences with the evolution of the clinical illness.

    <description>Difference in SLP measurements between infants. SLP provides a measure of the chest and abdominal movement (Respiratory effort) of the subjects, the movement signal will be used to quantify clinically relevant tidal breathing parameters such as timing indices: Ti (Time of inspiration), Te ( Time of expiration) and Ttot (Ti+Te). Parameters will be quantified for each recorded SLP signal (averaged) from each infant, and then used to compare between infants with bronchiolitis and healthy babies.</description>

    <description>Healthy infants aged 0-2 year with no respiratory diseases to provide a reference values. A structured light pattern (Structured Light Plethysmography (SLP) - Pneumscan) will be projected onto the chest and abdominal wall and the movement of this pattern as the patient breathes will be recorded for 2 min. The total period of testing per session should take approximately 30 minutes per person.</description>

A structured light pattern (Structured Light Plethysmography (SLP) - Pneumscan) will be projected onto the chest and abdominal wall and the movement of this pattern as the patient breathes will be recorded for 2 min.

    <description>Both healthy infants and bronchiolitis infants will have their chest movements monitored using Structured Light Plethysmography (SLP) performed by a device (Thora-3 Di) using a projector and two cameras. A light pattern of black and white squares is projected on the child's chest and the cameras record how the shape of this pattern changes with breathing. A computer converts this information to show how the child's chest moves during breathing.</description>
