    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works in treating
      young patients with newly diagnosed B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is likely to come
      back or spread, and in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) sensitive mutations. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and
      giving the drugs in different doses and in different combinations may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the administration of post-Induction age-adjusted intrathecal triple
      therapy (ITT) on a Modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (MBFM) interim maintenance high-dose
      methotrexate (IMHDM) backbone will improve 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of children
      with high-risk (HR) B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to age-adjusted intrathecal
      (IT) methotrexate (MTX).

      II. To determine, in a randomized fashion, if the cyclophosphamide + etoposide containing
      regimen (Experimental Arm 1) will improve the 4-year DFS of children, adolescents, and young
      adults with very high-risk (VHR) B-ALL compared to a modified MBFM-IMHDM regimen that
      contains a second IM (Control Arm).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of post-Induction age-adjusted ITT compared to
      age-adjusted IT MTX in children with HR B-ALL.

      II. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of Experimental Arm 1 compared to the Control
      Arm in children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR B-ALL.

      III. To determine whether a single-arm, modified Induction with limited anthracycline
      exposure and post-Induction therapy regimen with MBFM-IMIDM and reduced vincristine
      (vincristine sulfate)/steroid pulse frequency and enhanced supportive care in children with
      Down syndrome (DS) and HR B-ALL will result in a &gt;= 65% 5-year DFS and &lt; 10% Induction
      mortality.

      IV. To describe the outcomes for children and young adults with Ph-like B-ALL and a predicted
      TKI-sensitive mutation treated with dasatinib plus MBFM-IMHDM.

      V. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of MBFM-IMIDM in children with DS and HR B-ALL.

      VI. To estimate overall survival (OS) rates both overall and by regimen a) for HR B-ALL and
      b) VHR B-ALL patients.

      VII. To determine the incidence of osteonecrosis (ON), defined by magnetic resonance (MR)
      imaging, and to characterize the natural history of clinically silent ON in children,
      adolescents, and young adults 10 years of age and greater and to assess the role of drugs
      (i.e., asparaginase and methotrexate) in addition to corticosteroids, in the risk for
      development of ON.

      VIII. To determine if the prevalence of cognitive deficits measured by CogState, in children
      (ages 6 to =&lt; 13 years) with HR- and VHR B-ALL at 1 year off therapy, is significantly higher
      than the normative population (&gt; 14%) in the following domains: working memory, executive
      function, visual motor, processing speed, and visual attention.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the reduction of minimal residual disease (MRD) from end-Induction to
      end-Consolidation is greater for children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR B-ALL
      receiving Experimental Arm 1 compared to the Control Arm.
