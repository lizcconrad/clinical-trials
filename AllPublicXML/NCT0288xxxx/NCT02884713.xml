  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication is achieved in 60-80% with first-line therapy.
      Different second-line therapeutic options are available. However, the success of second-line
      therapy has not been addressed or reported from Saudi Arabia.

      Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the 10-day course of
      levofloxacin, doxycycline and esomeprazole in non-responders to first-line therapies for H.
      pylori eradication in Saudi Arabia. Secondary objectives included; symptoms response to
      treatment, factors associated with eradication of H. pylori and adverse events associated
      with the treatment.

      A prospective, open-label, single arm study was conducted. Patients were recruited from a
      tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia from June 2013 to April 2014. A total of 55 patients
      had previously received standard triple therapy and/or sequential therapy in the period from
      2011 to 2014 and failed to eradicate the infection. The rescue treatment was given for ten
      days consisting of levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, and
      esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Urea-breath-test (UBT) was done at a minimum of 6 weeks after
      completion of the treatment to confirm the H. pylori eradication. Compliance and tolerability
      of the regimen were also assessed.
