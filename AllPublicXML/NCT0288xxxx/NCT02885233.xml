      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a web-based fall prevention program called Free
      From Falls Online (FFFO) on people with multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of an online
      self-management program for preventing falls among people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). To
      accomplish this objective, the investigators have designed a web-based fall prevention
      program called Free From Falls Online (FFFO), based on the traditionally in-person program
      developed by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The specific aims of this study are
      three-fold: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of an online fall prevention self-education
      program by comparing fall frequency between participants and controls; (2) evaluate the
      impact of FFFO by comparing patient reported measures of physical function, fatigue,
      self-efficacy, psychosocial illness impact, social participation and satisfaction, and
      perception of global health between participants and controls; (3) and to determine usability
      of and satisfaction with FFFO.

    <description>To determine if participation in FFFO is associated with decreased frequency of falls, subjects will be randomly assigned to either the active intervention group or the waitlist control group. All subjects will prospectively document the number and circumstances of their falls for 5 months through the use of an electronic survey, to include the 8 weeks of the active or control intervention and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be the difference in fall frequency between active and control subjects.</description>

    <description>To determine if participation in FFFO is associated with improvement in patient reported outcomes, subjects will be randomly assigned to either the active intervention group or the waitlist control group. Outcomes will be measured through the use of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) which has been validated in people with multiple sclerosis. All subjects will complete the questionnaires at baseline, at 8 weeks and at 3 month follow-up. Scores will be compared between active and control subjects.</description>
