    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
      (CTEPH) are serious diseases with poor prognosis despite recent advances. Currently,
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered a cell proliferative disorder, which has not been
      adequately characterized due to the lack of markers. A better understanding of the mechanisms
      that regulate this proliferative disorder will allow the identification of new therapeutic
      targets for HP.

      The objective of the project is to identify cell proliferative processes in severe forms of
      PH. Patients with PAH (n=20), CTEPH (n=20) and healthy controls (n=20) will undergo
      characterization of microRNAs (miRNAs) contained within circulating microparticles (MPs)
      analysis and mitochondrial functionality and FDG-PET to compare cell metabolism in the lungs
      and the right ventricle between patients and controls.
