  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of iFIT Prosthetics, LLCÂ® was to create and commercialize a modular, immediate fit,
      fully adjustable, transtibial prosthesis system suitable for mass production using high
      strength injection molded polymer materials. This goal was achieved and the aim of this
      project is now to conduct a feasibility and effectiveness study and to assess the design of
      the device. The investigators will be fitting up to 50 transtibial amputees that are current
      prosthesis users with the iFIT device. Patients will wear the device for 1 month and evaluate
      for comfort, stability and ease of use as compared to their conventional device.
