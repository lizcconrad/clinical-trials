      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety, effectiveness and benefit‐risk profile of
      ResQFoam for the inhospital treatment of exsanguinating, intraabdominal haemorrhage due to
      trauma in patients where emergent laparotomy is required.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Estimated age of 15 years or older (or subject weight estimated at greater than 50 kg
             if age is unknown)

          2. Emergent, exsanguinating hemorrhage, from abdominal source as defined by:

               -  Class III or IV hemorrhagic shock or

               -  Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score ≥ 2

          3. Confirmation of abdominal hemorrhage by:

               -  Direct visualization or

               -  Positive Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) or

               -  Diagnostic Peritoneal Aspiration (DPA)

          4. No other known, uncontrolled active sources of hemorrhage

          5. Subject is intubated and sedated per local guidelines

          6. Decision to administer foam is made within 30 minutes of admission to the emergency
             department.

          7. Decision made to proceed to emergent laparotomy made within 30 minutes of admission to
             the emergency department.

          8. Definitive surgical care is expected to occur within three hours of foam deployment

          9. Subject must also be receiving concurrent transfusion of fluids or blood products.

             Exclusion Criteria:

         10. Known or suspected major diaphragm injury

         11. Known or suspected untreated pneumothorax

         12. Known or suspected untreated hemothorax

         13. Known or suspected blunt or penetrating cardiac or thoracic aortic trauma

         14. Traumatic brain injury resulting in decapitation, visible brain matter or considered
             non- survivable based on initial physical exam

         15. Received greater than five consecutive minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the
             pre-emergency department setting

         16. Patients with Pulseless Electrical Activity

         17. Known allergy to isocyanate

         18. Known or suspected pregnancy

         19. History of prior abdominal surgery or evidence of abdominal surgery (scars)

         20. Disrupted abdominal wall that, in the opinion of the investigator would preclude
             ResQFoam from being adequately contained within the abdominal cavity

         21. Subject in whom the abdominal aortic junctional tourniquet (AAJT) or Resuscitative
             Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) techniques have been used

         22. Known Prisoners

         23. Subjects with burns &gt; 20% of total body surface area

         24. Subject/legally authorized representative/subject family member purposefully opted out
             of participation in the study

         25. Known Do Not Resuscitate order (DNR) or Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment
             (POLST)

         26. Known enrollment in another randomized, interventional study
