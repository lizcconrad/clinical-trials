  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a local, single-center, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial that examines the LDL-C-lowering effect of the consumption of a soya beverage
      enriched with plant sterol for 3 weeks. This study also examines if there is other
      health-benefits by consuming the plant sterols fortified soya beverage in terms of serum
      total triglyceride, total and HDL cholesterol, other cardiometabolic risk factors and
      musculoskeletal-related traits including handgrip strength, gait speed, peak expiratory flow
      rate, bio-impedance and body balance.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the third commonest cause of deaths in Hong Kong and
      accounting for 14.4% of all deaths in 2012. Robust data attest the causal role of low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the development and progression of CVD. Reduction of LDL-C
      levels achieved by pharmacological agents in conjunction with diet change has been
      demonstrated to significantly reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. Moreover, it has been
      frequently reported that dietary incorporation of plant sterols/stanols could reduce blood
      LDL-C level in both healthy and dyslipidaemic individuals with great inter-individual
      variability of LDL-C response. Therefore, functional food enriched with plant sterols/stanols
      not only may provide additional LDL-C lowering benefit in dyslipidaemic patients as an
      adjunct to traditional pharmacologic therapy, but also play a role in primary prevention of
      CVD in the general population.
