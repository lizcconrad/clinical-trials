  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work related asthma and rhinitis are frequent diseases with a significant morbidity and a
      social and economic impact. Farmers are highly exposed to various inhaled agents such as
      organic or inorganic dust, endotoxin, micro-organisms, pollen, mites, moulds, animal danders
      and pesticides, inducing rhinitis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis
      and organic dust toxic syndrome. Work related respiratory symptoms are frequent in crop
      farmers. Allergic rhinitis and respiratory symptoms in fruit farmers are mainly related to
      pollen allergy, especially gramineae pollen. They can also be related to the use of
      pesticides or exposure to mites .
