    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without
      atezolizumab before surgery works in treating patients with newly diagnosed, stage II-III
      triple negative breast cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may block tumor
      growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without atezolizumab before surgery may make the
      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that the combination of chemotherapy and atezolizumab will increase
      tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage compared to chemotherapy alone in patients
      with newly diagnosed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) being treated with neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      II. To test the hypothesis that the combination of chemotherapy and atezolizumab will
      increase the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate compared to chemotherapy alone in
      patients with newly diagnosed TNBC being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the treatment combination of atezolizumab + carboplatin +
      paclitaxel.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers of response to chemotherapy in combination with
      atezolizumab in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC.

      II. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on the immune
      response in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC.

      III. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on
      neoantigen-specific T cell responses in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC.

      IV. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on long-term
      clinical endpoints such as overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients
      with newly diagnosed TNBC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both arms, within 3-6 weeks, patients undergo mastectomy or lumpectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and 1 year.

    <description>The TIL percentage after initiation of therapy will be compared between patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (Arm A), and patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab (Arm B). The post-treatment TIL percentages between two arms will be summarized using descriptive statistics at each time point and compared by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurement data.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of potential biomarkers of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to the time of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Potential biomarkers include baseline TIL percentage, baseline PD-L1 expression in the tumor and tumor infiltrating immune cells, baseline immune signature, and baseline neoantigen load. Multivariate logistic regression models will be used to evaluate predictive ability of these baseline biomarkers on the response to carboplatin-based chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab therapy. To take full advantage of such a randomized design, each model will also include the interaction term between treatment assignment and the baseline biomarker. This allows not only to answer the question whether the biomarker is predictive of pCR, but also whether the predictive ability is the same across two arms. The predictive ability will also be summarized using the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), and the 95% confidence intervals of AUC will be obtained using bootstrap resampling methods.</description>

    <description>The immune signature and PD-L1 expression in the tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune cells will be evaluated at baseline and after initiation of therapy. Two-way ANOVA for repeated measurement data will be used to compare the changes of PD-L1 expression over time as well as the between-group differences (treatment arms, pCR vs. non-pCR, and their interactions), while a generalized linear mixed model will be used to assess the impact of treatment on immune signatures.</description>
