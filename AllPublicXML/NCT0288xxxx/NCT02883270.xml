      This study investigates the effects of Robotic-assisted gait training in non-ambulatory
      patients after Guillain-Barré syndrome.The participants are randomly divided into two
      groups.Patients of the treatment group receive robotic-assisted gait training,while the
      contorls receive conventional rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous
      system, which may lead to rapidly developing motor deficits, sensory deficits, autonomic
      dysfunction and respiratory failure. Approximately, 20.3% of patients cannot walk unaided at
      4 weeks of symptom onset and 18.0% at 6 months. So, restoration and improvement of
      independent walk are one of major goals of GBS rehabilitation. For severely affected
      neurological patients, gait training using conventional therapy is technically difficult due
      to their motor weakness and balance problems. Robotic-assisted gait training （RAGT）is an
      effective alternative to treadmill therapy with partial body weight in intense gait
      rehabilitation after some neuropathy. And the proven reliability and safety of RAGT suggest
      that it may be effective for treating non-ambulatory patients after some neuropathy. In our
      study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of RAGT in non-ambulatory patients of
      GBS.

    <description>Robotic-assisted gait training （RAGT）is an effective alternative to treadmill therapy with partial body weight in intense gait rehabilitation after some neuropathy. The investigators use LokoHelp for training, which is provided to the feet and the patient actively controls the knee and hip joints. The participants of RAGT treatment group receive 30 min conventional rehabilitation and 30 min robotic-assisted gait training daily for 8 weeks.</description>
