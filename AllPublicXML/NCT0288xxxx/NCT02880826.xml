  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tools to measure safety culture (CS) have recently become available. No study has focused
      on the measure in France, apart from pilot studies. intensive services are particularly at
      risk of serious adverse events occurred (SAEs). Patients who are hospitalized are in fact
      fragile and precarious clinical condition requires rapid decision taken often. Diagnostic or
      therapeutic strategies have report &quot;risk-benefit&quot; narrow. They may well be complicated by
      EIG.Safety of care is a priority in the field of health in general, and especially in
      intensive care. CS measure in this context seems particularly relevant.

      The main objective is to describe the CS intensive care units in France. The study will
      explore the development of the CS level for the units investigated.

      This study will also describe the main features of RMM practiced in intensive care units in
      France.

        60 intensive care units in France. Each unit is estimated that an average of 80
        professionals will be subject to the evaluation of the CS (doctors, IDE, assistant nurses,
        physiotherapists...) and thus nearly 4800 people will be included for the CS measurement.

        Includes: all professionals providing care to patients and working full-time or part-time
        work in the respondent unit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  practicing resuscitation activity (this practice is medical or surgical, pediatric or
             adult, in public or private sector)

          -  volunteer to participate in the study (agreement of the head of the unit)

          -  for which at least 2 matching / references for the study were identified:

               -  a medical officer,

               -  caregiver responsible (Health Framework).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  measurement safety culture done in a period of significant change during a period
             where the staff and activities of the respondent unit of work is relatively stable.

          -  the responses of professionals to the questionnaire can be influenced by internal
             factors in their work unit (recent accident occurred, change of close supervision,
             personnel changes ...) and by factors external to their unit work (establishment
             certification period, arrival of a new director, recent media coverage of medical
             accidents ...).
