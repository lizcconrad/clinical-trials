  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) but the physiology remains poorly
      understood. Recent work suggests that subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS)
      could make a profit on the pain in PD.

      The investigator would drive a study with a follow up of PD patients before and after
      STN-DBS. The pain will be clinically explored by targeted questionnaires and
      electrophysiological through laser evoked potentials.

      The questionnaires are designed to quantify and characterize the pain in these patients.
      Laser evoked potentials will, through repetitive stimulation, study both the functional
      status of the afferent nociceptive pathways, their habituation to repetitive nociceptive
      stimuli, and so better understand any abnormalities of the central processing of nociceptive
      information.

    <description>Laser-Evoked potential can document lesions of spinothalamic tract and lateral brainstem and of thalamo-cortical projections conducting nociceptive signals. The rapid heating of skin by infrared laser pulses stimulate small fibers sensory pathways. The main cortical laser evoked potential is a complex of components N2-P2. Evaluation of the registered potentials includes shape, latency and amplitude.</description>
