      A single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial was done to assess the periodontal
      status of the individuals and the presence of red complex microorganisms (RCM) such as
      Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas.gingivalis and Tannerella.forsythia in the subgingival
      tissues of periodontal pockets at baseline followed by the application of mangostana gel as
      an adjunct to scaling and root planing. The periodontal parameters and RCM were again
      assessed at 3rd month and compared with the placebo group.

      Background: The study aim to assess the periodontal status of individuals and the presence of
      red complex microorganisms (RCM) such as Treponema denticola (T.d), Porphyromonas gingivalis
      (P.g) and Tannerella forsythia (T.f) in the subgingival tissues of periodontitis subjects
      before and after the application of 4% mangostana gel (MGA) as an adjunct to scaling and root
      planing.

      Methods: 25 sextants (MGA group) were treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) and
      subgingival application of mangostana gel used as local drug delivery (LDD). 25 sextants
      (Placebo group) were treated with SRP and placebo gel. Clinical parameters were recorded and
      the presence of RCM were assessed at baseline and at 3rd month.

      Statistical Analysis: The mean probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding
      index, plaque index were assessed at 0th day and 3rd month and compared between the groups
      using one way analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA). Intra-group comparison (MGA) for the presence
      of T.d, from baseline to 3rd month and inter-group comparison (MGA &amp; Placebo) at 3rd month
      was done using Fischer exact test. In both MGA and placebo group, the presence of T.d in
      subgingival tissues was compared with the clinical parameters at 3rd month using student's
      t-test. The p â‰¤ 0.05 was chosen as a level of significance.

    <description>probing pocket depth was measured using Williams periodontal probe with the measurement of 0 to 9 mm and the criteria is as follows - 2 to 4 mm for gingivitis, 4 to 5 mm for slight periodontitis, 6 to 7 mm for moderate periodontitis and &gt; 7 mm for advanced periodontal disease.
Clinical attachment level was measured from cemento-enamel junction to the base of the pocket using Williams periodontal probe with the criteria of 1 to 2 mm for slight periodontitis, 3 to 4 mm for moderate periodontits and greater or equal to 5 mm for severe periodontitis.</description>
