  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even with the advances in clinical therapy and percutaneous interventions, coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) is still widely used in the treatment of patients with coronary artery
      disease (CAD). However, it is a complex procedure that triggers important organic
      implications especially on pulmonary function. In relation to the treatment of patients
      undergoing CABG, the recovery is linked to the cardiac rehabilitation programs. These
      programs can also be associated with other muscle training measures, among these there is
      inspiratory muscle training (IMT). Most studies has been implemented moderate-intensity IMT
      daily, but there are few studies about the effects of high intensity training loads performed
      on alternate days. In this context, is justified the use of a device such as the recent
      Powerbreathe, which uses higher training loads that would provide greatest benefits, whereas
      the magnitude of the response to training tends to increase with load.

      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficiency of high intensity IMT associated with combined
      aerobic and resistance training on maximal exercise capacity, submaximal exercise capacity,
      respiratory muscle strenght, pulmonary function, oxidative stress, quality of life and
      endothelial function in patients who underwent CABG in phase II cardiac rehabilitation
      program.

      METHODOLOGY: This is a clinical trials, controlled, randomized,double-blind being developed
      in partnership with Cardiology Clinic of Hospital Universitário de Santa Maria (HUSM), Santa
      Maria, RS, Brazil. Patients will undergo the evaluation of pulmonary function and respiratory
      muscle strength (spirometry and digital manovacuometry), as well on the maximal exercise
      capacity (Ergospirometry), submaximal functional capacity (6MWT and 6MST), of quality of live
      (MLHFQ) of Oxidative stress and endothelial function (blood biomarkers). After the evaluation
      will be randomly allocated into two groups: the control group will perform cardiac
      rehabilitation associated with the Sham of IMT, and the experimental group cardiac
      rehabilitation associated with the IMT High-intensity. The intervention will last twelve
      weeks for both groups and after this phase patients will be submitted again to the assessment
      tools.

      EXPECTED RESULTS: The high intensity IMT potentiates the effects of cardiac rehabilitation
      (phase II) after coronary artery bypass surgery patients.

    <description>The MLHFQ is a questionnaire validated for the Brazilian population, consisting of 21 questions regarding limitations frequently associated with the extent to which heart failure has affected patient's lives in the previous month. Each question is attributed a value from 0 (zero) to 5 (five), with the highest score indicating worse quality of life. The total score is calculated by adding the 21 items, with a possible interval between 0 and 105.</description>
