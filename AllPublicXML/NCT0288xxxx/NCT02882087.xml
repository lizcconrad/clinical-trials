    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28)at week 12 and week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 was calculated from the tender joint count (TJC) of 28 joints, swollen joint count (SJC) of 28 joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (in millimeters [mm]/hour), and the participant's global assessment of disease activity (100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]: 0 mm=no disease activity to 100 mm=maximum disease activity). The formula for calculating DAS28 score using ESR value is: 0.56*square root (√) of TJC + 0.28*√(SJC) + 0.70*log natural (ESR) + 0.014*global assessment of disease activity (100 mm VAS). The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>
