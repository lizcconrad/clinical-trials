  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of inhaled furosemide on different types of breathlessness
      relief in healthy volunteers. Each volunteer inhaled mists of either furosemide or a control
      substance on 3 occasions per day on 2 separate days. On one day they performed one
      breathlessness test which creates an 'urge to breathe' known as air hunger (AH) and the other
      day they performed a breathlessness test which increases the sense of work/effort (WE) of
      breathing. The study is double blinded so neither the volunteer or the research knows which
      mist is being inhaled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 16 healthy volunteers will attend 4
      sessions. After 2 practice sessions subjects will undergo 2 test days where they will be made
      to feel 'air hunger' (hypercapnia with constrained ventilation) before and after mist
      inhalations on one day and sense of breathing 'effort' (raised ventilation with external
      resistive load) before and after mist inhalations on the second test day. The mist will
      either be furosemide or a placebo (saline) mist.

      The urge to urinate from systemic absorption from the lungs will be accounted for by a
      concomitant administration of intravenous furosemide when saline is inhaled.

      Furosemide is a prescription drug which makes kidneys produce more urine. When administered
      by inhalation as an aerosol it has direct action in the lungs which sensitises slowly
      adapting stretch receptors which is believed to account for the relief of dyspnoea previously
      reported with inhaled furosemide.

      Vagal afferents from the pulmonary stretch receptors are known to be involved in relief of
      air hunger but it is not known if they will also relieve the sense of breathing effort.
      Relief of breathlessness will be measured and compared between the two trial days to see if
      furosemide specifically relieves the 'air hunger' type of breathlessness and not the 'effort'
      type of breathlessness.

    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is from 0 (no breathlessness) to 100 (maximal breathlessness willing to tolerate). The VAS is measure every 15-20 seconds during each experimentally induced breathing test. Each breathing test is performed before and after each mist inhalation. Total of 6 breathing tests. The final minute of a 4 minute steady state breathing test is analysed.</description>

    <description>Previous studies have shown that inhaled furosemide relieves 'air hunger'.
Each volunteer has 3 mists per visit. The mists are either in the order of Furosemide-Saline-Furosemide or Saline-Furosemide-Saline. The furosemide mist is 40mg (10mg/ml) nebulised and the saline mist is 4ml nebulised.
Induced air hunger (hypercapnia with constrained ventilation) is the active comparator and will be the type of breathlessness induced, before and after each mist inhalation on one day. .</description>
