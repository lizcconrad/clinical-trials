    <textblock>
      The ability to meaningfully consent intoxicated and chemically dependent patients for
      research has inhibited medical advances in this vulnerable population. A recent pilot
      supported use of the University of California, San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to
      Consent tool to assess the capacity of intoxicated emergency department patients to
      participate in research. The objective is to determine the number of intoxicated emergency
      department patients who could correctly complete the questionnaire, and evaluate alcohol
      concentration, sedation and ability to recall participation upon sobriety.

          -  intoxication was due to a substance other than ethanol (negative breath alcohol
             concentration), refusal to participate, excessive agitation, or if the treating
             physician deemed the patient medically or psychologically unstable. Patients were also
