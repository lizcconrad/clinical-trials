      The study is an open-label, non-controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled trial in subjects with various pain etiologies at
      multiple centers in the US. Eligible subjects will include those â‰¥ 22 years of age that have
      been deemed appropriate for treatment with Provant by the study investigator (prescriber).
      Subjects will treat based on the treatment prescribed (location, frequency, duration) by the
      study investigator.

      Data from assessments administered as part of standard of practice will be obtained at
      baseline and, at a minimum, at the end of treatment. If the investigator administers
      additional assessments during the course of treatment, the data will be collected.

      Safety will be assessed during office visits and through review of AE reports and concomitant
      treatments and medications. All concomitant drug or non-drug treatments used during the study
      will be recorded.

      Information collected in the study will be entered into a registry database.
