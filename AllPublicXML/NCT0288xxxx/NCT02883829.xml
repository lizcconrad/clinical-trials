  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence and emerging adulthood are critical periods during which health outcomes may be
      imperiled for youth with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Due to the strong presence of alcohol use in
      the college environment, college students with T1D may be especially vulnerable to these
      risks.

      Our goal is to develop preliminary evidence in support of a scalable intervention targeting
      diabetes health management and alcohol use avoidance for college youth with T1D. For this
      project the investigators will engage at least 120 youth with T1D in college. The study
      sample will be drawn from two national, non-profit, peer support based groups: the College
      Diabetes Network (CDN) and the TuDiabetes Network.

      The study aims to 1) develop and pilot and educational video intervention; 2) determine the
      acceptability and efficiency of various web platforms for engaging college students in
      completing a survey about their health and alcohol use and to; 3) compare effectiveness of
      delivery of a brief intervention delivered by a peer versus a provider. The investigators
      plan to engage 120 college youth with T1D in completing a survey about their health knowledge
      and alcohol use behaviors.

      Baseline survey items will ask participants about knowledge, attitudes, and practices/plans
      for diabetes self-management and alcohol use in college. In response to survey items,
      participants will provide information on topics including general and disease-specific health
      information, as well as attitudes, behavior, beliefs, and knowledge related to alcohol use.
      Participants will also respond to questions relating to social support, mental health, and
      perseverance and commitment to long term goals.

      Following the baseline survey, participants will be presented with a brief educational video
      about diabetes self-management and alcohol use risks. Participants will be randomized to
      receive one of two educational video interventions. One version will be framed and delivered
      from a peer-based source and the other from a provider, content will otherwise be identical.
      Participants will receive 2 follow-up surveys; one immediately following viewing the video
      and the second two weeks later. Both the immediate follow-up and the 2-week follow-up survey
      will test salience, recall, and effects on health knowledge, beliefs and behavioral
      intentions.

      While the main purpose of the pilot is to ascertain preferences in the absence of preliminary
      data, our a priori hypothesis is that peer delivery will have greater impact for this
      population.

    <description>The primary goal of the proposed project is to determine the effectiveness of diabetes-specific alcohol messaging as delivered by a peer versus a provider, for educating youth in college with Type 1 Diabetes. The ultimate goal is to affect alcohol use behavior, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs and intentions, all of which are proximal to alcohol use behavior. The investigators will assess changes in attitudes, knowledge, beliefs, and intentions about alcohol both immediately following intervention delivery with an immediate follow-up questionnaire, as well with a two-week follow-up questionnaire.</description>
