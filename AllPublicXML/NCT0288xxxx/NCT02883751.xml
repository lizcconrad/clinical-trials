  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a major public health problem and it is estimated that 300 million
      individuals will be affected by the year 2030. Non-diabetic ulcers are one of the most
      frequent complications of this disease and, if untreated, can lead to the amputation of lower
      limbs. Thus, there has been growing interest in the use of light emitting diode (LED) devices
      to accelerate the tissue repair process and lower the cost of ulcer treatment in this
      population. The Mandaqui hospital complex is a general, tertiary, teaching hospital that is a
      reference center for revascularization surgery and endovascular treatment in Brazil. The aim
      of the proposed study is to evaluate the action of LED therapy on the complete healing of
      ulcers following minor amputations in patients with Diabetes mellitus. Methods: A
      single-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial with two parallel groups
      will be conducted following the criteria of the CONSORT Statement. The project will be
      registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov. The sample will be composed of 40 patients with a
      diagnosis of Diabetes mellitus in follow up at the vascular clinic of Mandaqui hospital
      complex who meet the inclusion criteria. The control group (n = 20) will receive traditional
      rayon bandages with essential fatty acids and secondary coverage with gauze, which will be
      changed on a weekly basis. The treatment group (n = 20) will be submitted to LED therapy (635
      nm; 4 J/cm2; 10 minutes) with weekly applications and the ulcers will also receive the
      traditional bandage treatment described above. The patients will be followed up until the
      complete closure of the ulcer, which will be the primary outcome. The ulcers will be examined
      on a weekly basis by a researcher with no awareness regarding the allocation of the
      individuals to the different groups and will assess, signs of infection, edema, redness, heat
      and the presence of gangrene. Photographs of the ulcers will also be taken for the subsequent
      determination of the area. Another researcher with no knowledge regarding the allocation of
      the participants will measure the surface of the ulcers with the aid of the ImageJ software
      program. The data will be submitted to appropriate statistical analyses. After closure of the
      ulcers, the patients will be followed up for a period of six months.

      Justification Various studies have demonstrated that phototherapy (laser or LED) is effective
      at enhancing skin wounds. The biological effects of both forms are similar and related to an
      increase in fibroblasts, the stimulation of angiogenesis, an increase in collagen synthesis,
      the formulation of granulation tissue and a reduction in inflammatory cells. Moreover, both
      forms of phototherapy increase the healed area in a shorter period of time, with LED
      demonstrating a late-onset effect on the healing process. In patients with partial foot
      amputation, this time is crucial for the fitting of the prosthetic and, consequently, the
      beginning of physical therapy and early locomotion. Diminishing the treatment time, with the
      patient observing a gradual progression in the healing process and experiencing a consequent
      increase in quality of life, could be a transforming factor to avoid the recurrence of ulcers
      and avoid further amputations.

      Hypothesis

      Alternative hypothesis: LED therapy is effective at potentiating the complete closure of
      ulcers in a shorter time following minor amputations in individuals with Diabetes mellitus.

      Hull hypothesis: LED therapy is not effective at potentiating the complete closure of ulcers
      in a shorter time following minor amputations in individuals with Diabetes mellitus.

      Methods A single-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial with two
      parallel groups will be conducted in accordance with the criteria contained in the
      Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT statement).

      The sample will be composed of patients diagnosed with Diabetes mellitus in medical follow up
      at the vascular outpatient clinic of the Mandaqui Hospital Complex of São Paulo. Twenty
      patients will be analyzed in each group, as this is the estimate of surgical treatment for
      each vascular surgeon in a one-year period at the Mandaqui Hospital Complex.

      Randomization and formation of groups Patient allocation will be performed by a researcher
      with no contact with the patients or main researchers. Randomization will be conducted in
      blocks of four for the balanced distribution of the experimental groups. For such, a lottery
      of 40 numbers will be conducted using a free program available at
      http://www.randomization.com, version from March 29, 2013.

      Opaque envelopes will be identified with sequential numbers. A piece of paper containing
      information on the corresponding group determined through the randomization process (control
      or LED) will be placed into each envelope. The envelopes will remain sealed in numeric order
      in a secure location until the time of the treatments of the post-amputation ulcers. The
      researcher in charge of the randomization process and preparation of the envelopes will not
      be involved in any other aspect of the study.

      Immediately following surgery, the main researcher, who will be in the surgical ward, will
      open an envelope without altering the numeric sequence and will perform the procedure
      indicated (active LED + bandaging or placebo LED + bandaging). The 40 patients will be
      allocated to the experimental and control groups in an equal fashion.
