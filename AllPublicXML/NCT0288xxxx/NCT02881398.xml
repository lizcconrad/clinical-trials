    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this investigation was to assess the impact of new mobile health
      devices on health outcomes among patients with rheumatic and structural heart disease in a
      resource limited area. To achieve this aim the investigators utilized smartphone-connected
      devices such as the smartphone-ECG, activity monitors, connected blood pressure devices and
      pocket-sized and handheld ultrasound. The main question asked in this investigation is if
      mobile health assessments accelerates medical-decision-making and if it shortens the time to
      definitive therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent paradigm-shift in the global burden of cardiovascular diseases has been observed
      with a decreasing prevalence in industrialized nations and an increasing prevalence in
      resource limited areas. This problem is further compounded with resource-limited areas
      receiving a disproportionately low allocation of global resources including diagnostic tests
      and trained healthcare professionals. Such cardiovascular conditions include heart failure,
      coronary artery disease, atrial arrhythmias and hypertensive heart disease. Coupled with a
      rising epidemic of rheumatic and structural heart disease affecting over 15- million
      individuals in these regions creates an urgent need that requires innovative and scalable
      methods to improve population- health, methods that reduce the cost of care, and
      simultaneously improves outcomes.

      The World Health Organization's Millennium Developmental Goals has recently reported a rise
      in cellular phone technologies with 7-Billion devices in active circulation. Parallel
      developments with the globalization of Internet-based communication and the emergence of new
      smartphone-connected mobile health (mHealth) devices are providing new methods for patients
      to remotely monitor their chronic conditions and for providers to improve healthcare
      delivery. These technologies include smartphone 'apps', wearable and wireless devices such as
      the smartphone-ECG, sensor-based technologies, pocket-sized ultrasound and miniaturized
      lab-on-a-chip technologies. Several design features of mHealth are well suited for use in
      resource-limited areas and used as a practitioner-based diagnostic tool including
      portability, lower cost, and simple to use form factors. Although an attractive method for
      new technology utilization, the impact of mHealth used as a practitioner-based
      clinical-decision-support tool on subsequent management and outcomes has not been previously
      evaluated.

      Several barriers to effective healthcare exist in resource-limited areas that requires
      multidisciplinary collaborations between the community, medical centers, health workers and
      patients. Developing new digital programs with healthcare innovations in these regions brings
      together a collaboration of industry, researchers, engineers and information technology
      partners. In the aggregate, a cumulative effort across several disciplines is necessary in
      order to assess the feasibility, utility, and impact of new devices in resource constrained
      areas. The investigators describe a multidisciplinary and global effort across institutions
      in India and the United States. The investigators received support from international medical
      societies and device manufacturers to advance our knowledge for technology utilization and to
      improve healthcare access and outcomes for patients in resource limited areas.

    <description>Each participant randomized to a mHealth assessment were evaluated with: (1) structural abnormalities with handheld-echocardiography (Vscan速, General Electric Healthcare); (2) vital signs with smartphone-connected oxymetry and blood pressure monitors (iHealthLabs速); (3) functional assessments on a 6-minute walk test with a trial-axial activity monitor (Ozeri速); (4) cardiac rhythm abnormalities with smartphone-connected- iECG (AliveCor速) and; (5)point-of-care testing with fingerstick B-type natriuretic peptide (Alere). All study participants then underwent a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiogram for anatomical assessments of the severity of rheumatic and structural heart disease prior to percutaneous valvuloplasty or a surgical valve replacement.</description>

    <description>After randomization and at the time of the initial encounter, study subjects are assessed at the point-of-care with mHealth devices that measure symptoms, functional status, and for structural abnormalities. These devices include activity monitoring for an assessment of a 6-minute walk test, smartphone connected blood pressure, oxymetry and ECG for functional assessments, and structural assessments with handheld-echocardiography and point-of-care BNP. Treatment decisions for an intervention with percutaneous valvuloplasty or valve replacement were performed based on the aggregate of these mHealth findings. Confirmation of the severity of structural heart disease on transthoracic echocardiography was performed on all participants.</description>
