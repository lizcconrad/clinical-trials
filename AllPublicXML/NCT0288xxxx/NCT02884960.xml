      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Embozene
      Microspheres compared with Embosphere Microspheres for the treatment of symptomatic uterine
      fibroids. A total of 118 patents with symptomatic uterine fibroids will be enrolled at 6
      sites. Symptom severity, health-related quality of life, and the appearance of the fibroids
      will be assessed prior to treatment. Patients will then undergo the uterine fibroid
      embolization procedure with either Embosphere Microspheres or Embozene Microspheres, which
      will be randomly assigned. Clinical outcomes will be assessed 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and
      12 months after the procedure, and imaging outcomes will be obtained 3 months after the
      procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) procedure is an accepted, minimally invasive treatment
      option for patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Studies evaluating the outcomes after
      this procedure have established that the use of polyvinyl alcohol particles and Embosphere
      Microspheres is associated with best clinical and imaging outcomes. Embozene Microspheres
      represent a new embolic agent that is being evaluated for use for the treatment of
      symptomatic fibroids. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
      of Embozene Microspheres compared with Embosphere Microspheres for the treatment of
      symptomatic uterine fibroids.

      A total of 118 patents with symptomatic uterine fibroids will be enrolled at 6 sites. A
      questionnaire designed to assess symptom severity and health-related quality of life in
      patients will be administered to patients at the time of enrollment. In addition, a
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination will be performed to confirm
      the diagnosis of fibroids. Patients will then undergo the uterine fibroid embolization
      procedure. The embolic agent used for the procedure (Embosphere Microspheres or Embozene
      Microspheres) will be randomly assigned. Patients will be seen 1 month, 3 months, and 6
      months and contacted 12 months after the procedure so that the same questionnaire can be used
      to assess clinical outcomes. In addition, an MRI will be performed 3 months after the
      procedure to determine the imaging response to treatment.

    <description>This procedure involves the administration of the study device into the uterine arteries to block the flow of blood in these vessels. This deprives fibroid tumors within the uterus of their blood flow, which can cause the tumors to die. This in turn can lead to the relief of symptoms associated with fibroids.</description>
