  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to determine whether the use of an
      accessory device called AmplifEYE can improve colonoscopy quality in patients who are
      undergoing average risk colorectal cancer screening. Primary end point is adenoma detection
      rates.

    <measure>ADR will be differentiated according to final pathology</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>APP (adenomas per positive participant)</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>APC (adenomas per colonoscopy)</measure>
