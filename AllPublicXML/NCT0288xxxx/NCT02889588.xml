  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractive surgery includes interventions to correct refractive errors, using a medical
      device such as a laser or an implant (intraocular lenses) or surgical instruments. The study
      distinguishes corneal interventions, carried on the surface of the eye, and intraocular
      interventions, performed on the lens or in the anterior or posterior chamber of the eye. The
      number of procedures in refractive surgery is growing significantly. They seem to offer
      satisfactory visual results but a number of issues remains unresolved. In order to get
      emmetropia, refractive surgery corrects optical defects by decreasing aberrations of lower
      orders (ie spherical refractive error and astigmatism). This increases high-order aberrations
      (the most common is a bright halo on the edge of the image). The cutting of the flap to the
      surface of the cornea in the case of LASIK increases high-order aberrations, which have the
      effect of reducing post-surgical visual performance (ie visual acuity and contrast
      sensitivity) and can't be corrected by glasses, while the adaptation of contact lenses on a
      post-operative cornea is more complex. It is therefore necessary to limit these post-surgical
      aberrations and to identify their possible sources. Indeed, some authors have provided
      insight into the effects of some high-order aberrations, but the influence of several factors
      characterizing the preoperative eye on refractive surgery are still unknown, such as
      pupillary diameter, depth of the anterior chamber, Intra Ocular Pressure or astigmatism.
