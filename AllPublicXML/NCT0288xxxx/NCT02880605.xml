  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary revascularization (CR) is increasing rapidly in China and varies significantly in
      proportion ( PCI:CABG=15:1). Few studies assess the appropriateness of CR in China. Recently,
      National Center for Cardiovascular Disease organized experts to release Chinese version
      appropriate use criteria(C-AUC) for coronary revascularization by RAND method aimed at
      regulating indications of CR. The criteria is considered to contribute to clinical practices,
      quality assessment and health insurance policy, however, the validation of C-AUC is unknown.

      Thus the investigators study aims at assessing the validation of Chinese AUC by multi-center
      prospective registry. The investigators will recruit 4000 patients undergoing elective
      coronary angiography with positive outcome consecutively and collect baseline information.
      Sequently, one-year follow up will be done to collect the prognose, including death,
      rehospitalization, medicine, medical compliance and life quality etc. One hand, the
      investigators will compare the outcomes between different therapies in the same indications
      according to C-AUC to evaluate the validation of C-AUC. On the other hand, the investigators
      will evaluate the rationality of CAD therapy in Beijing by C-AUC.
