  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the pattern of active and sedentary time in survivors of a
      critical illness, at three time points during their hospital admission (awakening in the ICU
      after ≥ 5 days of mechanical ventilation, discharge to ward and discharge from hospital).

      The specific research objectives are to

        1. Determine the duration of active and sedentary parameters including time and bouts in 24
           hour periods

        2. Examine changes in the active and sedentary parameters including time and bouts between
           time points of awakening and both ICU and hospital discharge.

        3. Conduct a preliminary examination of relationships between activity and sedentary
           behaviour metrics with measures of muscle strength, physical function and hospital
           length of stay.

      This is a prospective observational study that consecutively samples eligible patients with a
      critical illness, requiring intensive care. This study will use two activity monitors
      (accelerometers) to measure physical activity and sedentary variables from patients
      recovering from a critical illness in a single tertiary hospital on three occasions during
      their acute hospital admission. Accelerometer derived measures will be obtained from
      continuous 24 hour monitoring periods once patients are sufficiently awake and attentive
      within the ICU, at ICU discharge and again at acute hospital discharge. Measurements of
      patients muscle strength and physical function will also be made at the time of
      accelerometry.
