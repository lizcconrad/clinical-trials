  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disorder of development of the neural retina and its
      vasculature that may impact vision in vulnerable preterm neonates for a lifetime. This study
      utilizes new technology to determine visual and neurological development of very preterm
      infants in the intensive care nursery, during a period of rapid growth of the retina, optic
      nerve and brain. The long-term goal of this study is to help improve preterm infant health
      care via objective bedside imaging and analysis that characterizes early critical indicators
      of poor vision, neurological development and ROP, which will rapidly translate to better
      early intervention and improved future vision care.

    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disorder of development of the neural retina and its
      vasculature that may impact vision in vulnerable preterm neonates for a lifetime. Clinical
      care of infants with ROP decreases the likelihood of blindness, but abnormal vision is
      common, especially in those with disease severe enough to require treatment. Because it has
      not been possible to distinguish whether disease and/or maldevelopment that affects specific
      retinal cells and/or the central nervous system (CNS) cause the vision loss, especially when
      it is less severe, there has been no strategy to prevent subnormal acuity in the majority of
      infants treated for ROP.

      The interval that a preterm infant at risk for ROP spends in an intensive care nursery (ICN)
      is a time of rapid retinal development. Clinicians and researchers do not know how local, CNS
      and systemic development and disease processes are reflected in the retinal microanatomy.
      Abnormalities in the retina during infancy are likely early predictors of later vision
      problems and developmental delay. From study of preterm retinal substructures, brain anatomy,
      connectivity and functional networks and neuroinflammatory biomarkers this study will
      elucidate the pathway by which local retinal anatomic changes impact and may predict later
      subnormal vision and CNS function. The results of this research will enable the investigator
      to: distinguish ocular from non-ocular contributions to vision loss; guide future treatment
      directed to modify retinal anomalies such as edema; and determine which microanatomic retinal
      biomarkers are best to monitor effects of ROP, and effects of systemic therapies on the eye
      and brain. In contrast to indirect ophthalmoscopy or photography, novel non-contact ocular
      imaging at the bedside would enable direct telemedicine screening for ROP and for neural
      development in multiple nurseries.

      The long-term goal is to help improve preterm infant health care via objective bedside
      imaging and analysis that characterizes early critical indicators of poor vision,
      neurological development and ROP. This will rapidly translate to early intervention and
      improved future vision care. Specific goals of this research are threefold: to implement
      technological innovations to improve optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in
      non-sedated infants in the ICN; to distinguish elements of retinal microanatomy which predict
      maldevelopment of visual pathway and poor neurodevelopment that may impact vision in preterm
      infants; and to delineate which elements and regions (posterior and peripheral) of preterm
      infant OCT-derived retinal microanatomy best inform us about severity of disease and visual
      outcomes in infants with ROP.

      In addition to providing a breakthrough method for bedside analysis of the very preterm (VPT)
      infant posterior and peripheral retina, this study will provide the pediatric ophthalmologic
      and telemedicine community with methods to distinguish microanatomic markers that predict
      infants at risk for abnormal vision, visual pathway injury, poor functional development and
      progression of ROP (and combinations thereof). These biomarkers will be useful for
      determining ophthalmic and CNS therapeutic interventions and monitoring their impact on the
      visual pathway and will thus likely cross over with relevance to other infant eye and brain
      disease.

    <description>The swept source optical coherence tomography device was developed at Duke University as the result of collaboration between the Departments of Ophthalmology and Biomedical Engineering. The SSOCT system has a 100kHz repetition rate, 1050nm-centered swept-source light source (Axsun Technologies). This swept-source system allows near real-time OCT imaging during movement while imaging and it provides better OCT imaging of the choroid. The SSOCT system is a non-contact device and therefore does not touch the eye.</description>

    <description>Non-sedated research brain MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a minimal risk procedure that uses a magnet and radio waves to make diagnostic medical images of the body. There have been no ill effects reported from exposure to the magnetism or radio waves used in this test. However, it is possible that harmful effects could be recognized in the future. A known risk is that the magnet could attract certain kinds of metal. Therefore, we will carefully ask about metal within the body. If there is any question about potentially hazardous metal within the body, MRI imaging will not be performed. We will also keep the examining room locked so that no one carrying metal objects can enter while the child is in the scanner.</description>
