      ARCADIA is a national registry designed to document phenotypic and genetic traits in patients
      with renal and/or cervical artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).

      FMD is a group of arterial diseases that most commonly involve renal and carotid arteries.
      Patients with FMD may present with renovascular hypertension and/or with cerebrovascular
      symptoms. Angiographic classification includes the multifocal type and the focal type. FMD
      may affect one or more vascular beds and progress to more severe stenosis and to renal or
      cerebrovascular complications. FMD may be familial (OMIM #135580).

      Our main objective is to create a FMD registry that will collect standardized information
      from all consenting patients diagnosed with the condition in 16 participating centers. This
      registry, along with a collection of leukocyte DNA, will constitute a resource for further
      clinical research on FMD. The first application will be the assessment of the frequency of
      multi-site FMD, i.e. the frequency of cervical artery FMD in patients presenting with renal
      artery FMD and vice-versa. The second application will be a case-control study to identify
      susceptibility genes for FMD.

      Patients are eligible in the registry if: (a) they have renal or cervical artery FMD with
      either multifocal or focal lesions at CT-angiography, MR-angiography, or intra-arterial
      angiography; (b) they give informed consent to leukocyte DNA analysis and to the collection
      of bioclinical and morphologic information. Phenotypic assessment will be performed in
      accordance with current recommendations and best clinical practice.

      Given the multicenter nature of the study and the recruitment capacity of each centre,
      enrollment of 500 FMD cases is expected over 5 years. This number will 1) allow an accurate
      estimation of the frequency of multi-site FMD: when the sample size is 500, a two-sided 95%
      confidence interval will extend 0.035 from the observed proportion for an expected proportion
      of 0.20 based on a previous report and from our unpublished data. 2) In addition to a
      collection of 400 renal FMD already collected at HEGP, give sufficient power for a
      genome-wide association study seeking for susceptibility genes

      1. Background

             1. Definition

                FMD is a group of nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial diseases that most
                commonly involve the renal, cervical (carotid, and vertebral) arteries.
                Histological classification discriminates three main subtypes, intimal, medial and
                perimedial, which may be associated in a single patient. Angiographic
                classification includes the multifocal type, with multiple stenoses and the
                'string-of-beads' appearance that is related to medial FMD, and tubular and focal
                types, which are not clearly related to specific histological lesions (unclassified
                FMD).

                Aneurysms and dissections are considered to be complications of FMD but frequently
                arise in individuals with no FMD. Therefore, their presence without direct evidence
                of FMD does not suffice to diagnose the condition.

             2. Presentations

                The prevalence of symptomatic renal artery FMD is about 4/1000 and the prevalence
                of cervical FMD is probably half that.

                Renovascular hypertension is the most common manifestation of renal artery FMD.
                Multifocal stenoses with the 'string-of-beads' appearance are observed at
                angiography in more than 80% of cases, mostly in women aged between 30 and 50
                years; they generally involve the middle and distal two-thirds of the main renal
                artery and in some case also renal artery branches. Spontaneous renal artery
                dissections are rare but frequently coexist with FMD.

                Cervical FMD can be complicated by dissection with headache, Horner's syndrome or
                ischemic stroke, or associated with intracranial aneurysms. As intracranial
                aneurysms may rupture and lead to subarachnoid haemorrhage, the American Heart
                Association recommends performing magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of
                intracranial arteries in patients with cervical artery FMD.

                Mesenteric and iliac arteries were examined during renal artery angiography and
                cervical arteries were systematically examined using ultrasonography. In the
                European Georges-Pompidou Hospital (HEGP) cohort (unpublished results), cervical
                arteries were not systematically examined. The prevalence of diagnosed multi-site
                FMD was 28.0% in the Zurich University Hospital study and 16.4% in HEGP patients.
                This is probably a bottom estimate because most cervical artery FMD lesions affect
                the C1-C2 segment of the carotid arteries, a segment difficult to examine using
                ultrasonography. In order to estimate study power and the number of patients
                needed, the prevalence is considered of multi-site FMD at 20-25%.

             3. Diagnosis

                The presence of renal artery FMD can be documented by the following non-invasive
                tests, in increasing order of accuracy: Doppler ultrasound, gadolinium-enhanced
                MRA, and computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Vasbinder et al. (2004)
                prospective multicenter comparative study found that CTA and MRA had reasonably
                good specificities for detecting renal artery stenosis due to FMD (92 and 84%,
                respectively). There is no published comparative study of non-invasive tests for
                detecting cervical artery FMD, although Doppler ultrasound may disclose irregular
                patterns of stenosis that are suggestive. CTA and MRA are probably more effective
                than ultrasonography for detecting lesions of the middle and distal portions of the
                carotid and vertebral arteries and may also document or rule out associated
                intracranial aneurysms.

                The commonly accepted gold standard for diagnosing renal artery FMD is
                intra-arterial angiogram with digital subtraction. However, this invasive test
                should be reserved for patients in whom it is clinically justified to proceed with
                revascularization in the same procedure. Stenosis quantification is, however,
                frequently difficult in medial FMD with the &quot;string-of-beads&quot; appearance because
                multiple web-like defects are often present in patients with FMD, contributing to
                clinically significant stenoses that may not be apparent on angiography.

             4. Management

                The value of treatment has not been established for renal artery FMD without
                hypertension. The management of hypertension associated with renal artery FMD
                involves revascularization and/or antihypertensive medication. Current
                recommendations reflect the knowledge acquired concerning atherosclerotic
                renovascular hypertension, although indications for balloon angioplasty are wider
                in FMD than in atherosclerotic renovascular disease because the BP outcome of
                angioplasty is more favourable in FMD than in atherosclerosis. Revascularization is
                recommended for patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis -
                i.e. with bilateral stenoses or a unilateral stenosis causing more than 60%
                reduction in luminal diameter - and accelerated hypertension, resistant
                hypertension, malignant hypertension, hypertension with an unexplained unilateral
                small kidney, and hypertension with intolerance to medication. It is also useful in
                young patients with recent-onset hypertension and hemodynamically significant renal
                artery stenosis due to FMD: in these cases the goal is to cure hypertension. The
                standard revascularization procedure is balloon angioplasty with bailout stent
                placement if necessary. Surgical reconstruction is indicated for patients with
                complex FMD that extends to segmental arteries and those with macroaneurysms.
                Antihypertensive drug treatment is indicated for patients with long-standing
                hypertension or in those with persistent hypertension following revascularization.

                Data on management of patients with symptomatic carotid or vertebral artery FMD are
                scarce. Carotid or vertebral artery dissections are usually treated with
                anticoagulation. In very rare patients with expanding or symptomatic
                pseudo-aneurysm, percutaneous angioplasty or surgical repair can be considered.

             5. Progression in FMD

                Renal artery FMD may progress to more severe stenosis and to renal atrophy, and/or
                to stenoses affecting more arteries within or outside the renal vasculature. The
                risk of progression as assessed from available studies was probably overestimated
                because documentation of progression was obtained from angiography, a procedure
                which is not routinely undertaken in patients with favourable clinical and
                biological outcomes. The disease is progressive, however, and a Slovut and Olin
                overview (2004) stated that patients with FMD should undergo yearly duplex
                ultrasonography to detect progression of disease, restenosis, or loss of kidney
                volume.

                There are very few data on prognosis of patients with symptomatic carotid or
                vertebral artery FMD. The risk of arterial disease progression over time is
                unknown. The risk of ischemic stroke ranged from 0 to about 3% per year in the few
                studies which assessed that issue.

             6. Best Clinical Practice

                Published recommendations include:

                  -  Screening for any cause of secondary hypertension - including renal artery FMD
                     - in case of juvenile, grade 3, malignant or resistant hypertension

                  -  Irrespective of the severity of hypertension, screening for renal artery
                     stenosis in cases with a clinical clue for the condition, such as the presence
                     of paraombilical bruit or of asymmetrical kidneys

                  -  Screening for cervical and intracranial FMD in case of renal artery FMD

                  -  Renal revascularization in case of hemodynamic stenosis associated with
                     hypertension in a patient aged 30 or less, or associated with accelerated,
                     malignant or resistant hypertension, or associated with a small kidney or
                     treatment intolerance

                  -  In case of documented renal artery FMD, providing follow-up of blood pressure
                     (BP), renal function and kidney height using ultrasonography on a yearly basis
                     or in case of hypertension persistence or recurrence following
                     revascularization, or in case with a poor control of BP.

                In case of renal artery FMD progression, further renal imaging tests and renal
                revascularization may be considered in accordance with the above indications for
                revascularization. The investigators also consider that documented progression of
                renal artery FMD is an indication to screen for new lesions or progression of
                pre-existing lesions in cervical arteries.

             7. Genetic factors

                FMD appears to be a familial disease in 10% of cases (OMIM #135580). The occurrence
                of renal FMD in sib pairs or identical twins first suggested its possible
                inheritability. Our retrospective analysis of 104 patients with renal FMD showed a
                prevalence of 11% for familial cases, i.e. 11% of cases had at least one sibling
                with angiographic evidence of renal artery FMD. Using high-resolution
                echo-tracking, elevated echo-tracking scores of the carotid artery in first-degree
                relatives of index cases are also found. FMD is diagnosed earlier, renal artery
                lesions are more frequently bilateral, and FMD lesions are more frequently found in
                extra-renal arteries in familial than in apparently sporadic cases. The presence of
                an underlying genetic disease could therefore be associated with disease
                progression in FMD.

                The investigators have already collected lymphocyte DNA and assessed baseline
                characteristics, including renal artery morphology, in about 400 patients with
                renal artery FMD who gave informed written consent to a familial study of renal
                artery FMD (Sponsor INSERM, RBM#00-028, CPP Paris-Cochin). Data from patients
                included in this previous study will be used for an extended case-control study.

             8. Justification for an extended genome-wide study

           As indicated above, several arguments exist for the presence of susceptibility genes for
           FMD. Despite this evidence, only limited and negative candidate gene studies have been
           conducted up to now, probably because of the low frequency of the disease, its
           phenotypic heterogeneity and the absence of large national or international collection
           of affected subjects. In the meantime, the knowledge acquired on the structure and
           variations of the human genes by the Human Genome Project and the possibility of rapidly
           genotyping hundreds or thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) through
           high-throughput technologies facilitate large case-control studies. Case control studies
           are indeed powerful methods to investigate the implication of genetic SNPs in complex
           traits. It can be applied either to candidate genes or through the microarray
           technology. With this technique, it can test three to five hundreds of thousands SNPs
           (300 to 500K) along the human genome (genome-wide association (GWA) studies). Compared
           to candidate genes, GW-SNPs typing offers the advantage that new pathways can be
           uncovered. Whereas this strategy usually requires large number of cases and controls in
           complex traits, it has also been used with success for some categorical traits in
           experimental settings investigating a small number of well characterized subjects. To
           our knowledge, GWA studies have never been performed for FMD. The collection of 400 FMD
           at HEGP together with the national prospective study now makes this objective realistic.

        2. Objectives of the ARCADIA registry

             1. To collect standardized clinical, radiological, and biological data in patients
                with FMD through a national registry.

                The prospective collection of clinical, radiological and biological standardized
                records should lead in a short period of time to a unique source of well-phenotyped
                FMD cases that could help to standardize diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at
                the national level. This unique database and collaboration between centres will
                greatly stimulate basic, clinical and therapeutic research and will help in the
                identification of new pathophysiological mechanisms.

                This collection of symptomatic patients will be established from centres dedicated
                to hypertension care (renovascular lesions) or to cerebrovascular diseases care
                (cervical lesions). It is expected to recruit 400 patients presenting with
                renovascular lesions and 100 patients presenting with cervical FMD over three
                years.

             2. To estimate the prevalence of multiple sites disease, i.e. the prevalence of
                cervical artery FMD in patients with renal artery FMD and vice versa.

                As indicated above, screening for cervicocranial FMD is currently recommended in
                patients with renal FMD. Although there is no similar recommendation to screen for
                renal artery FMD in patients with cervical FMD, such screening is required at least
                in patients with high blood pressure, i.e. with a clue for renovascular disease. It
                is also useful in cases without definite hypertension as the presence of renal
                artery FMD lesions would also help to confirm the FMD nature of cervical lesions.
                The investigators therefore consider that a non-invasive investigation of renal
                arteries in patients with probable or suspected cervical FMD reasonably falls
                within best clinical practices.

             3. To identify susceptibility genes for renal artery FMD and polymorphisms that could
                play a role in disease progression and to assess potential phenotype-genotype
                correlations.

             4. To organize a clinical, radiological and biological database and a biobank that
                will constitute a unique resource to initiate further clinical research.

      Our goal is to share a common anonymous standardized database, the items of which have been
      accepted by the participating centres, that will serve as a unique national FMD database
      available for all Hypertension Reference Centres (ESH Hypertension Reference Centres) and
      vascular neurologists involved in the study. The creation and the development of this
      database will be a unique tool for future national studies and will stimulate similar
      initiatives at the European level.
