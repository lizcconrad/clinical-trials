    <textblock>
      This research project will provide insight into the efficacy and safety of aspiration therapy
      in the management of obesity and its comorbidities in the Asian population, and will
      determine if there is a role for this novel endoscopic device in the treatment algorithm of
      obesity in the investigators' local regions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major global health problem and Asians are equally affected. According to the
      latest Behavioural Risk Factor Survey in 2014, 20.8% of adults in Hong Kong have body mass
      index (BMI) belonging to the obese category. Obesity is associated with a multitude of
      medical and psychological comorbidities that could cumulate in increased healthcare costs and
      impaired quality of life. As such, an effective treatment strategy for obesity is imperative.

      Sustainable weight reduction by lifestyle measures alone is often difficult if not
      impossible. Pharmacotherapy can provide additional weight reduction when used as an adjunct
      to lifestyle intervention but the efficacy is modest. The most effective method for weight
      reduction to date is bariatric surgery but this is limited by its invasiveness and
      irreversibility. The limitations of current obesity treatment has led to an increased
      interest in endoscopic treatment, which may be more effective than pharmacotherapy and less
      invasive and more reversible than bariatric surgery.

      The AspireAssist® Aspiration Therapy System is a novel endoscopic therapy developed by Aspire
      Bariatrics Inc. (King of Prussia, United States) for treatment of obesity. The system takes
      advantage of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube technology to induce weight
      reduction by aspirating a portion of ingested meals from the stomach. In a pilot study
      involving 18 Caucasian obese subjects randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to aspiration therapy
      group and lifestyle therapy only group, the weight reduction was 18.6% +/- 2.3% and 5.9% +/-
      5.0% respectively. The present study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of this
      device in Asian subjects.
