      Background: Suicides by jumping from the high buildings of acute hospitals are dramatic
      events which are highly traumatizing to families, staff and fellow pts. In the 10 years
      from1995 to 2010 the investigators have counted 10 suicide cases despite extensive measures
      taken to predict and avoid them.

      The investigators hypothesized that constructive measures at the windows that would render
      access more difficult could discourage spontaneous suicidal behaviour and would reduce the
      suicide rates.

      Intervention: Starting in 6/2004, a 20 mm diameter metal guard-rail (which resists 250kg) was
      installed at each window of a 360 bed acute hospital at a height of 113cm, 18cm above the
      window parapet with the aim to visually, psychologically and physically discourage potential
      suicidal impulses.

    <description>Suicide jumps from the heights of acute hospitals are dramatic events which are highly traumatizing to families, staff, and fellow patients. From 1995 to 2004, 10 suicide jumps occurred at the investigators institution despite extensive measures taken to predict and avoid them. The investigators hypothesized that specific barriers rendering access to windows more difficult could discourage spontaneous suicidal behaviour and reduce the suicide rates. Starting in 6/2004, a 20 mm diameter metal guard-rail with a tension strength of 250kg/in2 was installed at each window of the investigators 360 bed acute hospital at a height of 113cm, 18cm above the window sill with the aim to psychologically and physically deter potential suicidal impulses.</description>
