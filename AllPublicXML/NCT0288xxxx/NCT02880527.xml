  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are characterized by the association to a myopathic
      syndrome, inflammatory infiltrates in the skeletal muscle. They remain, even today, an
      important factor of morbidity and mortality in these patients. At present, studies that
      evaluated the prevalence of polymyositis / dermatomyositis are very few; they were mainly
      recorded in the United States and Japan, the prevalence of polymyositis / dermatomyositis has
      been estimated between 3.5 and 21.5 cases / 100 000 (according to the old diagnostic criteria
      of Bohan and Peter). However, previous works are old and retrospective; above all, they have
      almost always been performed (90% of cases) from cases reported to the hospital, leading to
      selection bias and an underestimate of the true prevalence of polymyositis / dermatomyositis
      in the general population.

      Thus, these data lead to achieve this epidemiological study, descriptive, multicenter, based
      on the population of Normandy.
