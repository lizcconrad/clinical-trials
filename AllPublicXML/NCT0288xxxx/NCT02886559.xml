      Despite advances in understanding the complexities of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the
      treatment of refractory or relapsed AML (rrAML) remains a daunting clinical challenge.The
      investigators designed a new regimen, including chidamide, decitabine, aclarubincin,
      cytarabine and G-CSF, to treat rrAML.
