  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the use of intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IVPCA) versus
      the delivery of pain relief (per oral and intravenous (IV) medications as rescues analgesia)
      on an as needed basis within a well defined fast track protocol that includes multimodal
      analgesia for patients who are undergoing elective primary knee replacement surgery. The
      investigators assumed that with the multimodal analgesia regimen without the use of IVPCA
      will demonstrate decreased consumption of postoperative opioids, reduced incidence of opioids
      related side effects and decreased length of stay in the hospital.
