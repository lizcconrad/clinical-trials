      The purpose of this trial is to determine the benefit of the combination of nab-paclitaxel
      plus gemcitabine given for 6 cycles, followed by maintenance nab-paclitaxel alone, in
      patients with cisplatin-ineligible or cisplatin-incurable advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC).

    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized phase II trial evaluates the efficacy and toxicity of
      first-line treatment with a combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, followed by
      maintenance therapy with nab-paclitaxel alone in patients with metastatic or locally advanced
      unresectable urothelial cancer. Two groups of patients are eligible: (1) patients who are
      poor candidates for treatment with cisplatin, and (2) patients with visceral metastases who
      are incurable and unlikely to derive long-term benefit from treatment with cisplatin-based
      regimens. Eligible patients will receive a minimum of 3 cycles and up to 6 cycles of
      treatment with the gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel combination. Patients having an objective
      response or stable disease will continue maintenance treatment with single-agent
      nab-paclitaxel until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient decision to
      discontinue treatment. Up to 55 patients are planned for enrollment.

      <textblock>
        KEY POINTS:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma (UC) that is either
             metastatic (any N+ M1) or locally advanced and unresectable (T4bN0). A component of
             urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma is required.

          2. Two groups of patients are eligible:

               1. Poor candidates for cisplatin-based chemotherapy based on the presence of ≥ 1 the
                  following:

                    -  Glomerular filtration rate of 30-60 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula)

                    -  ECOG performance status score of 2

                    -  Hearing loss (trouble communicating with hearing aids or hearing loss at ≤ 3
                       KHz)

                    -  Grade ≥3 heart failure

                    -  Age ≥80 years

                    -  Other concurrent illness which may make the patient a poor candidate for
                       receiving cisplatin.

                  Note: Enrollment of patients with 2 or more of these criteria should occur only
                  after careful consideration by the treating physician regarding the patient's
                  ability to tolerate combination chemotherapy.

                  OR

               2. Poor prognosis and defined as cisplatin-incurable due to the presence of
                  metastasis to at least one visceral site (these patients are not required to have
                  any of the cisplatin-ineligibility criteria).

                    -  ECOG performance status score of 0, 1, or 2.

          3. Measurable or evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) version 1.1.

          4. Patients with brain metastases are allowed if treatment was completed at least 4 weeks
             prior to study treatment, neurologic symptoms are minimal and stable during the
             preceding 4 weeks, and maintenance dexamethasone is not required.

          5. Adequate hematologic, liver and kidney function.

          6. Willingness and ability to comply with study requirements and give written informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous systemic chemotherapy for UC with the exception of perioperative (neoadjuvant
             or adjuvant) treatment or treatment with concurrent chemoradiation for locally
             advanced disease. All of these treatments must have been completed more than 1 year
             previously.

          2. Presence of small-cell or sarcomatoid component in tumor histology.

          3. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          4. Major surgical procedures ≤28 days of beginning study drug, or minor surgical
             procedures ≤7 days. No waiting required following port-a-cath placement.

          5. Cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months:

          6. Inadequately controlled hypertension.

          7. Currently receiving treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium. (A maximum
             daily dose of 1 mg will be permitted for port line patency. Low molecular weight
             heparin is allowed.)

          8. Serious active infection at the time of treatment, or another serious underlying
             medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol
             treatment.

          9. Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B or hepatitis C (screening
             for these diseases is not required.).

         10. Presence of other active cancers, or history of treatment for invasive cancer ≤5 years
             previously. Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local treatment
             and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible. All patients with previously
             treated in situ carcinoma (i.e., non-invasive) are eligible, as are patients with
             history of non-melanoma skin cancer.
