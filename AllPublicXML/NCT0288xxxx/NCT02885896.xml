    <textblock>
      In order to show that tailored pediatric counselling by telephone can reduce the number of
      unscheduled and medically unjustified physicians visits in emergency structures, a randomized
      controlled study is conducted. It compares the proportion of cases which used the emergency
      services or unscheduled consultation according to whether they received (or not) nurses'
      telephone advices from the platform. Indeed, our hypothesis is that the presence of nurses
      responding at the Reception and Control Calls Center inside the Emergency Medical Services
      (in french : Service d'Aide MÃ©dicale d'Urgence SAMU) - whose role is to deliver appropriate
      advice to people calling for benign pathologies they see as urgent and to answer questions
      following specific recommendations - will reduce the number of unplanned and medically
      unjustified consultations in medical emergency structures.

      This platform was set-up in order to show it may be a solution in response to the growing
      demand for pediatric care from the population, helping to reduce overcrowding in emergency
      care facilities. Indeed, promoting home care or only if necessary scheduled consultation
      reinforces the conduct to have when facing a pathology from their child. It will also help by
      reducing unjustified use of emergency structures, improving not only the users' reception
      conditions who actually require support in these structures with less waiting time, but also
      the working conditions for employees who perform there.

    <description>The main objective of the study is to compare the number of unscheduled consultations within 7 days following inclusion, i.e. the call at Centre15 (reception and regulation calls center) between the sample with access to telephone advice and the one who received the usual care (control group) . Our assumption is that the number of appeals for emergency medical services will be lower in the group that received advice from the platform than in the control group.</description>

    <description>During the experimental period, the eligible calls will be transferred to the platform by SAMU regulator doctors, and callers will be subject to health advice by specially trained nurses. The nurse conduct the call by holding the conversation guide, giving advice for a home care, answering questions from the circle (caller, family,..) and ensuring the proper understanding of these tips. An information leaflet for the theme of the call will be sent in the days following the call to the caller of the experimental group having given their consent.</description>
