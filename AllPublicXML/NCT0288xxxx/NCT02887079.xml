      EMBOL-EI (Research Interest antiphospholipid antibody for embolic risk prediction in
      infective endocarditis) is a prospective cohort study with a biological collection.

      The main objective is: to re-evaluate the potential value of antiphospholipid (aPL)
      antibodies as predictors of embolic events in IE in the light of the improved current
      knowledge on these aPL.

      The seconds objectives are: Other plasma biomarkers of hemostasis (coagulation activation
      markers: D-dimer fragment 1 + 2 of prothrombin; endothelial biomarkers: plasma levels of von
      Willebrand factor) will be taken into account in the analysis, and interest in predicting
      embolic risk, alone or in combination with aPL will be investigated.

      Criteria of inclusion

        -  Patient hospitalized in the University Hospital of Nancy with an Endocarditis some as
           modified Duke criteria by Li.

      The patient is eligible if it is considered and treated as a case of infective endocarditis
      by physicians ensuring its management. The application of the diagnostic classification Duke
      criteria modified by Li is made after the collection of all the data at the output of the
      patient. Will be retained for the analysis of patients meeting certain infective
      endocarditis.

      Clinical, microbiological data, derived from complementary therapies and scalable
      examinations (including the endpoint) were collected during the hospital stay by doctors that
      support helped a patient technician clinical studies. Each application is reviewed by a
      multidisciplinary panel of two experts for validation.

      Once validated record, the data collection schedule is sent to the CEC Nancy to be entered on
      a database.

      A blood sample is taken from each patient at admission. These samples are packaged and stored
      in a collection. The serum used in search - called AC' anticardiolipin' IgG and IgM isotype
      by ELISA.
