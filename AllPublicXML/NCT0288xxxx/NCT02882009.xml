  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, open-label, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study is to
      assess pain following subcutaneous (SC) administration of gantenerumab as a
      high-concentration liquid formulation (HCLF) at different injection speeds. The total
      duration of the study for each healthy participant will be up to approximately 21 weeks.
