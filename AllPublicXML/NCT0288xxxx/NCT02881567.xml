  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of treatment with daclizumab on
      the proportion of participants relapse-free at 6 months in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis (RRMS) participants, who switched from treatment with natalizumab to daclizumab due
      to safety concerns. The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are to
      evaluate the effects of daclizumab on the following: 1) Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapse
      activity including the annualized relapse rate (ARR) and the proportion of participants
      experiencing relapses requiring hospitalization and/or steroid treatment; 2) MS-related
      outcomes measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 3) Safety and tolerability in
      participants previously treated with natalizumab.

The ARR will be calculated by tabulating the total number of relapses experienced in the group divided by the number of days up to the end of month 12, and the ratio then multiplied by 365.</description>
