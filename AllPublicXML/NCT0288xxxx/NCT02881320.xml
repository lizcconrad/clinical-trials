  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK)
      for bictegravir (GS-9883) and confirm the dose of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir
      alafenamide (Biktarvy®; B/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) in HIV-1 infected,
      virologically suppressed adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years of age) and children (6 to &lt; 12 years
      of age). This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of B/F/TAF FDC through
      Week 24 in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed adolescents and children.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infected adolescents and children who are virologically suppressed for ≥ 6
             months on a stable regimen

          -  Cohort 1 only: 12 to &lt; 18 years old and weight at screening ≥ 35 kg (77 lbs)

          -  Cohort 2 only: 6 to &lt; 12 years old and weight at screening ≥ 25 kg (55 lbs)

          -  Documented plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL on a stable regimen (or undetectable HIV-1
             RNA level according to the local assay being used if the limit of detection is ≥ 50
             copies/mL) for ≥ 6 months preceding the Screening visit. Unconfirmed virologic
             elevations of ≥ 50 copies/mL (transient detectable viremia, or &quot;blip&quot;) prior to
             screening are acceptable. If the lower limit of detection of the local HIV-1 RNA assay
             is &lt; 50 copies/mL (eg, &lt; 20 copies/mL), the plasma HIV-1 RNA level cannot exceed 50
             copies/mL on two consecutive HIV-1 RNA tests.

          -  Stable antiretroviral regimen of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
             in combination with a third agent for a minimum of 6 months prior to the screening
             visit. Individuals undergoing dose modifications to their antiretroviral regimen for
             growth or who are switching medication formulation(s) are considered to be on a stable
             antiretroviral regimen.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 according to the
             Schwartz Formula

          -  No documented or suspected resistance to emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir (TFV), or
             integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) including, but not limited to, the
             reverse transcriptase resistance mutations K65R and M184V/I

        Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
