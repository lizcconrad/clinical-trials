      The objective of this study is to describe the change in the percentage of fat in the lumbar
      spine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study of the distribution of bone marrow adiposity is little known in subjects who did
      not have pathology likely to alter the fat content of the vertebrae. Or that fat content is
      potentially a reflection of brittle bones (osteoporosis, for example), and deserves to be
      known because it can be used to normalize the lipid fraction values with respect to age or
      from the level (L1 , L2, L3, L4 or L5) of the vertebra being studied.
