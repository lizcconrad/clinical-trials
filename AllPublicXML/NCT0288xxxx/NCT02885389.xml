      Infantile Spasms syndrome (ISs) is a characterized by epileptic spasms occurring in clusters
      with an onset in the first year of life. West syndrome represents a subset of ISs that
      associates spasms in clusters, a hypsarrhythmia EEG pattern and a developmental arrest or
      regression. Aetiology of ISs is widely heterogeneous including many genetic causes. Many
      patients, however, remain without etiological diagnosis, which is critical for prognostic
      purpose and genetic counselling. In the present study, the investigators performed genetic
      screening of 73 patients with different types of ISs by array-CGH and molecular analysis of 5
      genes: CDKL5, STXBP1, KCNQ2, and GRIN2A, whose mutations cause different types of epileptic
      encephalopathies, including ISs, as well as MAGI2, which was suggested to be related to a
      subset of ISs.
