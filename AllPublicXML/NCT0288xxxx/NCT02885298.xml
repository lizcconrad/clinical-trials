  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is most commonly taught and performed with the patient supine. Recent
      literature suggests that elevating the patient's head to a more upright position may decrease
      peri-intubation complications. However, there is little data on success rates of upright
      intubation in the emergency department. The goal of this study was to measure the association
      of head positioning with intubation success rates among emergency medicine residents.

      Endotracheal intubation is most commonly taught and performed with the patient supine. Recent
      literature suggests that elevating the patient's head to a more upright position may decrease
      peri-intubation complications. However, there is little data on success rates of upright
      intubation in the emergency department. The goal of this study was to measure the association
      of head positioning with intubation success rates among emergency medicine residents. Study
      design was a prospective observational study. Residents performing intubation recorded the
      angle of the head of the bed, and the number of attempts required for successful intubation
      was recorded by faculty and respiratory therapists. The primary outcome of first past success
      was calculated with respect to three groups: 0-10 degrees (supine), 11-44 degrees (inclined),
      and â‰¥45 degrees (upright); first past success was also analyzed in 5 degree angle increments.
