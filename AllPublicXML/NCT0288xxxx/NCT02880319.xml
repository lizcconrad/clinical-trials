    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a form of radiation therapy called stereotactic body
      radiation therapy or SBRT as a possible treatment for Cancer that has spread to the spine or
      other bone

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating metastases of the bone. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      SBRT is an advanced technique that allows for more precise delivery of radiation than with
      standard radiation therapy. In comparison to standard radiation therapy, it allows us to give
      higher doses of radiation to a tumor while limiting the radiation dose going to the
      surrounding normal tissues. This technology has been made possible by advances in imaging and
      treatment capabilities on the radiation treatment machines. SBRT works just as standard
      radiation therapy works by damaging cancer cells.

      SBRT has been used to deliver radiation to people with cancer in the lung and those with
      metastases in the spine or liver. Studies of those groups have shown low rates of side
      effects with good rates of killing the cancer in that area and preventing it from coming
      back. In the current research study, the investigators are looking to further evaluate how
      well this type of radiation controls disease in bone and whether the toxicity (side effects)
      of SBRT differs from that of standard treatment. The investigators hypothesis is that
      toxicity might be less, as less normal tissue receives radiation with SBRT than with standard
      treatment. It is important to note that SBRT, just like standard radiation therapy for the
      participant disease, is being used to attempt to stop the growth of cancer cells in a bone
      metastasis and relieve or prevent any symptoms (ex. pain) associated with bone metastases.
      The goal of the SBRT is not to cure the participant cancer. The primary goal of the study is
      to see how well SBRT controls the disease in the bone, and the investigators also want to
      analyze its ability to control disease symptoms without added toxicity.

             (BED) calculation [BED (Gy2) = nd x (1+d/α/ß; where n=number of fractions, d=dose per
             fraction, α/ß=2)]

          -  Epidural tumor &lt;2 mm from spinal cord

          -  Requirement of active receipt of systemic therapies concurrent with SBRT (concurrent
             hormonal therapies are allowed)

             pain medications

          -  Non-English speakers are excluded from this study due to use of questionnaires which
             have not been validated in other languages.

          -  Patients lacking the capacity to describe their symptoms are excluded as that
             precludes them (or anyone on their behalf) from filling out the validated
             questionnaires about symptoms/toxicity.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiotherapy has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances: if they have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are
             deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; or if
             diagnosed and treated within the past 2 years for cervical cancer in situ or basal
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
