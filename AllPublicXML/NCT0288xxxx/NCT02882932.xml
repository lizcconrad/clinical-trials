      Super Oxidized Solution (SOS) was used in peritonitis and results were compared by using
      normal saline solution in two groups. Abdominal fluid was taken to check for bacterial load
      after giving lavage with SOS solution and in other group normal saline. SOS is a high level
      disinfectant, non-flammable and no special training is required to handle it.

      Aim - To investigate the efficacy of super-oxidized solution (SOS) over normal saline in
      peritonitis. The investigators objectives are to present the potential clinical impact of
      intraperitoneal lavage with solutions for early recovery of the patient by reducing the
      infection rate.

      Methods - A double-blind random clinical trial was performed in 240 patients diagnosed as
      peritonitis at MMIMSR, Mullana, Ambala, India, from December 2014 - November 2015. Subjects
      were divided into 2 groups, i.e. 120 patients in the study group and 120 cases in the control
      group. Both the groups underwent peritoneal lavage ; the study group received SOS where as
      control group underwent normal saline lavage. The effectiveness of both the solutions were
      compared.
