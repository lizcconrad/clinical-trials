  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase 2 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HLD100 at steady
      state (following up to 5 weeks of treatment) in children using an outpatient, single-center,
      open-label, flexible dose-escalation study design.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This dose-escalation study will examine HLD100 in 24 subjects.

      The subjects (n=24) will be tested with HLD100 in ascending doses from 10mg up to 40mg.

      This study will be divided into several phases: Screening, Active Treatment and Follow-Up.
      All visits have a 2 day window to allow for scheduling.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a diagnosis of ADHD as defined by DSM-5 criteria with confirmation
             using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents
             (MINI-KID).

          -  Subjects must demonstrate mild-to-moderate impairment of ADHD symptoms and function
             per the following at screening (V1) and/or baseline (V2):

               -  ADHD-RS-IV score at or above the 90th percentile normalized for sex and age in
                  total score and ≥24 at Baseline;

               -  CGI-S score ≥4;

          -  Subject body weight must be ≥20 kg.

          -  Subject must be considered clinically appropriate for treatment with amphetamine and
             HLD100, including prior treatment experience with an amphetamine product, and ability
             to swallow treatment capsules.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or current, medical condition or laboratory result which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, unfavorably alters the risk-benefit of study participation, may
             jeopardize subject safety, or may interfere with the satisfactory completion of the
             study and study-related procedures.

          -  Serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
             abnormalities, or other cardiac problems that may place the subject at increased
             vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.

          -  History of seizure disorder (except febrile seizures prior to age 5 and with last
             occurrence at least 1 year prior to study participation), Tourette's disorder, or
             intellectual disability of minor severity or greater (DSM-5 criteria).

          -  History of psychosis, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or suicide attempt.
             Current depression, anxiety, conduct/behavior disorder, substance use disorder, or
             other psychiatric condition which, in the investigator's opinion, may jeopardize
             subject safety or may interfere with the satisfactory completion of the study and
             study-related procedures.

          -  Active suicidal ideation as evidenced by an ideation score of 2 or greater on the
             C-SSRS.

          -  History of severe allergic reaction or intolerance to amphetamine.
