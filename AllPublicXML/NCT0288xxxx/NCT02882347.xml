  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is a serious medical problem could lead to patient
      death, however, definite treatment strategy has not been established. The liver is a
      regenerating organ and the possibility of PHLF could be reduced when the appropriate liver
      regeneration is guaranteed.

      Portal flow has known to be important during liver regeneration. Low portal flow cannot
      induce proper regeneration, contrary, excessive flow increase shear stress in the hepatic
      sinusoid resulting liver failure.

      Various medications has been used in malignant liver cirrhosis to reduce portal pressure.
      Among them, somatostatin has been used modulating portal flow reducing portal and sinusoidal
      pressure.

      In this study, the investigators administrate somatostatin at a rate of 3.5ug/kg/hour to PHLF
      patients (prothrombin time &lt; 50% and serum total bilirubin &gt; 2.9mg/dl after liver resection)
      until recovery from liver failure. For assessment of the recovery of liver failure, the
      investigators evaluate aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), serum total
      bilirubin and prothrombin time periodically after administration of medication.
