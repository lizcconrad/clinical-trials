    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if any difference exists among 3 different
      postoperative splinting regimens- no splint, removable splint, and plaster non-removable
      splint- following mini-open carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We sought to determine if any significant difference in patient-reported or clinical outcomes
      existed among 3 different postoperative splinting regimens- no splint, removable splint, and
      plaster non-removable splint- following mini-open carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery for
      symptomatic, isolated, nerve conduction study positive carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

      A total of 249 patients received a mini-open CTR and were subsequently randomized into 1 of
      the 3 splinting regimens to be removed at the first postoperative visit 10-14 days later.
      Patient-reported outcomes included QuickDASH surveys, Levine-Katz Symptom Severity Scale
      (SSS) and Functional Status Scale (FSS) and Pain at Rest and in Action using a Numerical Pain
      Rating Scale (NPRS). Clinical outcomes included wrist range of motion (ROM), grip and lateral
      pinch strengths. All outcomes were evaluated bilaterally at 10-14 days, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months and 12 months after surgery. Demographic information was obtained preoperatively and
      complications were observed for and recorded throughout the study

    <description>The no splint group received a soft dressing consisting of an occlusive petroleum gauze strip (Xeroform, Mansfield, MA) over the wound, one folded 4x4 gauze, and a single wrap of roll gauze around the hand, and the wrist was placed and secured by a Coban wrap (3M, St. Paul, MN). The dressing permitted wrist and finger motion. Patients were further instructed to remove the dressing at five days and place an adhesive bandage (Band-Aid, Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) over the incision.</description>

    <description>The removable splint group received a V-strap Wrist support (Medical Specialties, Inc., Charlotte, NC) placed over the identical soft dressing that was placed on the no splint group. The cock-up wrist splint was designed to keep the wrist fixed in a 20 degree extended wrist position. Patients were instructed to wear the splint for comfort as needed during day and night. While the patient was wearing the cock-up splint, only finger motion was permitted. Wrist motion was permitted when the cock-up splint was removed.</description>

A 4- inch, 15-layer thick plaster splint was placed across the volar wrist and molded to keep the wrist in approximately 20 degrees of extension allowing full digital range of motion (ROM). The splint was to be kept dry and not removed by the patient.</description>
