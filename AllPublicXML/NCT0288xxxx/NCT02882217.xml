  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study focusses on the evaluation of safety and tolerability of the XC8. The design of the
      study involves sequential dosing of cohorts (group of volunteers), taking increasing doses of
      the product after receiving conclusion and recommendation for further continuation of the
      study from the Dose Escalation Committee.

             or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             hysterectomy), or practice a highly effective method of birth control, i.e. resulting
             in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (e.g.
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intra-uterine devices,
             sexual abstinence, or vasectomized partner). The birth control method must have been

             medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g. condoms, sexual abstinence,
             vasectomy) during the study, and until 3 months after the last intake of study
             medication.

             time zone, etc.);

          6. History or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse; alcohol or drug intake within 4
             days before Screening;

          7. History or current evidence of allergic reactions (including reactions to medications
             and food);

          8. History or current evidence of symptomatic rhinitis within 2 years before Screening
             (allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, excluding short-term viral
             infection - cold or influenza);

          9. Blood or plasma donation, or surgery (in hospital) within 12 weeks of Screening;

         10. Lactating or pregnant females; a positive pregnancy test before the first
             administration of investigational medicinal product or breastfeeding;

         11. Current or previous (within 3 months of enrollment) treatment with another
             investigational drug and/or medical device or participation in another clinical study;

         12. Previous enrollment in this clinical study;

         13. Inability to understand or follow protocol instructions;

         14. Smoking within 3 months before screening or throughout the study;

         15. Lactose intolerance;

         16. History of allergic reactions to XC-8 or any inactive ingredients of the trial
             medication;
