      Conducted in Chinese healthy adult volunteers,the study aims to observe the safety and
      tolerability of single/multiple-dose administration of different doses of Alprostadil
      Liposome for Injection as well as to confirm the safety dose range.

        1. Single dosing tolerability test in humans.There are 7 dose
           (10ug,20ug,50ug,100ug,200ug,300ug,400ug) groups in the single dosing tolerance test in
           healthy adult volunteers.The beginning dose of the study is 10ug,according to the dose
           escalation method,subjects who have successfully completed previous dose group and
           passed the safety assessment will enter the test of next dose group with the same
           method.

        2. Multiple dosing tolerability test in humans.Choose the proper dosage for multiple dosing
           tolerance test based on the single-dose tolerance test result.
