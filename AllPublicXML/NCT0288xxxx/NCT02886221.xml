  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) represents one of the most innovative surgical treatments of
      Hallux Valgus (HV). However, long-term outcomes still remain a matter of discussion within
      the orthopaedic community. The purpose of this longitudinal prospective study was to evaluate
      radiographic and functional outcomes in patients with mild-to-severe HV who underwent
      Reverdin-Isham and Akin percutaneous osteotomy, following exostosectomy and lateral release.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty patients with mild-to-severe symptomatic HV were treated by MIS. Clinical evaluation
      was assessed pre-operatively, as well as at 3 and 12 months after surgery and at final
      follow-up of 48 months, using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hallux
      grading system. Patient satisfaction and complications were recorded. Computer-assisted
      measurement of antero-posterior radiographs was taken pre-operatively, as well as at 3 and 12
      months after surgery and at 48-month follow-up, analysing the intermetatarsal angle (IMA),
      the hallux valgus angle (HVA), the distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA), and the tibial
      sesamoid position. Also, the bridging bone/callus formation was evaluated at the different
      radiographic follow-ups, while the articular surface congruency and the metatarsal index were
      calculated only preoperatively and at last follow-up. Patient satisfaction was assessed using
      the Visual Analogue Score (VAS). Statistical analysis was carried out using the paired
      t-test. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

    <description>Incision on the medial part of the foot, a Shannon Isham burr was introduced at the junction of metaphysis and epiphysis. It was applied to the flat bone surface achieved previously at approximately 45Â°, keeping the articular cartilage surface of the first metatarsal head as reference point on the superior cortex. In this position, under fluoroscopic control, the osteotomy was started following a distal-dorsal and proximal-plantar direction. At this point, the burr was slightly withdrawn in order to preserve a few millimetres of the lateral cortex, and the osteotomy of the plantar cortex was performed completely. Then, a Wedge burr was used to create a wedge with a medially oriented base. At the point of closing the wedge, osteoclasis of the preserved lateral cortex was achieved, modifying the orientation of the articular surface, normalizing the DMAA value, and adding an intrinsic stability to the osteotomy by producing contact of the trabecular bone.</description>
