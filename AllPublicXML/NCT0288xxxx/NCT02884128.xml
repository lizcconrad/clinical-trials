    <textblock>
      This trial is a multi-center, open-label, phase I, dose escalation study of PEP02 (liposomal
      encapsulated irinotecan) in combination with 5-FU and LV in patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

    <textblock>
      In this study, the initial starting dose of PEP02 is 60 mg/m2, and was escalated by
      increments of 20 mg/m2 between dose levels. 5-FU and LV was given as 24-hour infusion via an
      implanted central venous catheter, with dose fixed at 2000 mg/m2 and 200 mg/m2, respectively.
      PEP02 was administered on Day 1; 5-FU/LV was started after the end of PEP02 infusion on Day 1
      and also on Day 8. Treatment repeated every 3 weeks and it was regarded as one cycle of
      treatment.
