    <textblock>
      The utility of conventional imaging in the development of new treatments for osteoarthritis
      (OA) is hindered by:

        1. Difficulty in non-invasively evaluating the initial response to potential new treatment
           options. OA typically develops over a long time period, so evaluating the efficacy of
           new treatment options over a timeframe relevant to experimental medicine studies is
           difficult.

        2. Inadequate methods of disease quantification and stratification. OA is a heterogeneous
           condition and identifying which subgroups of patients are most likely to benefit from
           new treatments is crucial.

      Novel magnetic resonance (MR) imaging acquisition and analysis techniques have the potential
      to solve these problems. However, their reliability needs to be fully established and
      knowledge of likely effect sizes is required to inform sample size considerations for further
      longitudinal/interventional studies.

      This study aims to help address these issues by:

        1. Calculating effect sizes for MR measurements to inform sample size calculations for
           future studies.

        2. Assessing the reliability of a multiparametric MR protocol for assessment of the knee
           joint.

      The investigators will examine a single knee of an initial 15 participants with MR.
      Participants will be drawn from two groups: (1) 10 participants aged 40-60 years old with
      clinical and x-ray features of OA and (2) 5 control subjects (matched to cases for age, sex
      and body mass index in a 1:2 ratio) who do not have clinical features of OA.

      Participants will undergo an initial (baseline) MR examination, followed by repeat MR
      examinations at approximately 1 month and 1 year following the baseline examination.

      This will allow us to assess both the reliability of our MR measurements and the expected
      progression in our MR measurements in OA subjects in the absence of any disease-modifying
      intervention.

        Group 1 will consist of 10 patients aged 40-60 who have presented to the Orthopaedic clinic
        with a painful knee, and have mild/moderate OA on plain radiographs (Kellgren-Lawrence
        grade 2-3).

        Group 2 will consist of 5 healthy volunteer controls, matched (1:2 ratio) to cases for age,
        sex and body mass index who do not have knee pain.
