    <textblock>
      Depression during pregnancy and postpartum is a major public health problem with adverse
      correlates and consequences for women and their children; although efficacious treatments for
      depression during pregnancy exist, few women receive such care. A widely recognized barrier
      to treatment engagement is the lack of effective, available care that is well aligned with
      women's treatment preferences. To close the gap between treatment need and receipt among
      depressed pregnant women, this study aims to develop and test the effectiveness of
      disseminating behavioral activation, an efficacious and acceptable treatment for depression,
      using peer delivery for pregnant women with depression.

      Using a 3-phase structure, the study will: (1) refine the BA intervention for delivery by
      peers in obstetric settings, (2) develop and test web-based peer delivery training and
      fidelity tools, and (3) evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, safety and
      preliminary effectiveness of BA peer delivery within community-based obstetric practice
      settings, and consistent with an experimental therapeutics approach, test the extent to which
      this delivery approach engages putative targets validated in prior studies of BA and explore
      novel targets potentially specific to peer delivery.
