    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label multicentre clinical trial of daily Myrcludex B versus
      entecavir in patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B. Accounting for screen-outs
      about 76 patients will be screened and 48 of them will be randomized into 6 treatment groups:

      Arm A (8 patients): Myrcludex B 0.5 mg / day / sc / 12 weeks Arm B (8 patients): Myrcludex B
      1 mg / day / sc / 12 weeks Arm C (8 patients): Myrcludex B 2 mg / day / sc / 12 weeks Arm D
      (8 patients): Entecavir 0.5 mg / day / orally / 24 weeks Arm E (8 patients): Myrcludex B 5 mg
      / day / sc / 12 weeks Arm F (8 patients): Myrcludex B 10 mg / day / sc / 24 weeks

      The study consists of screening period up to 28 days (Day -28 -1); baseline visit (Day 0),
      treatment period up to 12 weeks for groups A-C, E and 24 weeks for groups D, F; follow-up
      period up to 12 weeks for groups A-C, E, F.
