  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary retention is a common problem, particularly in hospitalized patients. When a Foley
      catheter is removed, a patient must be monitored for urinary retention. The usual method is a
      passive voiding trial where the catheter is removed, the bladder fills with urine and the
      patient is monitored for voiding over approximately 6 hours. Another option is an active
      voiding trial where the bladder is filled with saline before the catheter is removed and the
      patient is immediately assisted to void. This study seeks to determine the effect of active
      vs passive voiding trials on time to hospital discharge, rate of urinary tract infections,
      and rate or urinary retention in the general hospitalized population.

    <description>Patients randomized to receive an active voiding trial will have the bladder filled with 250-400 cc of sterile saline (or until the bladder was full) via the lumen of the urinary catheter before the urinary catheter is removed. The patient will then be immediately assisted to void. Physician teams will follow a standardized algorithm for the management of urinary retention arising during the study.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to receive a passive voiding trial, the urinary catheter will be removed, the bladder will fill with urine naturally, and the patient will be assisted to void when he or she reports the urge. To ensure uniformity in the intervention, all voiding trials in the study will be supervised by an experienced nurse who will ensure that the protocol is followed.</description>

    <description>Nursing protocol:
Instill 250-400 cc of STERILE SALINE via the lumen of the Foley catheter into the bladder via gravity drainage or slow push
Clamp the Foley
Deflate the catheter balloon and remove the catheter from the bladder.
Record the amount of saline that was instilled into the bladder.
Immediately assist the patient to void. Report the amount instilled and the amount voided to the physician within one hour a. Unless the patient reports extreme bladder fullness or pain, give the patient one hour to urinate
7. If the patient fails the voiding trial, the physician will decide to do in and out catheterization or place a new Foley catheter</description>

    <description>Nursing protocol:
Deflate the catheter balloon and remove the catheter from the bladder.
Record the time that the catheter was removed and the time the patient is due to void (approximately 6 hours).
5. If the patient has not voided within 5 hours, assist the patient to try to void.
6. If the patient is unable to void, is only voiding in small amounts, or reports fullness or abdominal pain, perform a bladder scan.
7. If the patient has not voided after 6 hours, report this to the physician along with the results of the bladder scan 8. The physician will decide to do in and out catheterization or place a new Foley catheter</description>
