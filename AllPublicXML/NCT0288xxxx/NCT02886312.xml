  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patient comfort and oxygen delivery efficiency when providing
      supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula to volunteers using an instrumented oxygen
      delivery system. The goals of the study are to evaluate different oxygen flow rates and
      oxygen delivery modes. In addition, the investigators will investigate if the system can
      detect apnea (cessation of breathing) and removal of the nasal cannula. The investigators
      will also investigate how well high flow oxygen delivered only during inspiration is
      tolerated and how much the end-tidal oxygen increases after two minutes of high oxygen flow
      delivered only during the inhalation phase of the breath.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers drawn from the general public and students, staff, and faculty of
             the University of Utah.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers who self report respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress
             syndrome, pneumonia and lung cancer will be excluded. In addition, volunteers who self
             report respiratory conditions such as nasal or bronchial congestion due to a cold or
             allergies will be excluded.
