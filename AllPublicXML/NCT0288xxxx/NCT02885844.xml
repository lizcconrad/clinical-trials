  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parabolic flight is the only ground-based condition in which weightlessness (0G) can be
      created long enough for safely testing changes in human perception and behavior. In addition
      to the 0G period, parabolic flight generates equal duration periods of 1.8G, which present
      another unique opportunity to test the same responses to hypergravity and back to 1G.

      Spatial orientation perception is a critical subsystem that is used by the central nervous
      system in the control of vehicles and other complex systems in a high-level integrative
      function. Evidence from space flight research demonstrates that spatial orientation is
      altered by the transitions in gravito-inertial force levels (Clément 2011; Clément &amp; Reschke
      2008), transitions corresponding to mission phases particularly critical for crew safety and
      mission success. Accurate perception of self-in-space motion and self-motion relative to
      other objects is critical for successful operations that involve motor control e.g. doing an
      extra-vehicule activity or piloting the spacecraft. To date, there is only limited
      operational evidence that these alterations cause functional impacts on mission-critical
      operations and control capabilities. Immediately after space flight, most crewmembers have
      reported some degree of disorientation/perceptual illusion, often accompanied by nausea (or
      other symptoms of motion sickness), and frequently manifested by lack of coordination,
      particularly during locomotion The hypothesis is that alteration in sensorimotor performance
      induced by inverted vision is gravity depend: maximum alteration during hypergravity,
      intermediary alteration during normal gravity, minimal alteration during weightlessness.
