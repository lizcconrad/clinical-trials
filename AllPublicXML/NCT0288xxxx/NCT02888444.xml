    <textblock>
      A placebo-controlled trial to determine whether recent ex-smokers with COPD who successfully
      stop smoking after taking varenicline are less likely to relapse back to smoking if they
      continue using varenicline for a further 12 weeks

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking remains the leading cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a leading
      cause of death and disability in New Zealand. COPD particularly affects indigenous Māori and
      Pacific people, given their higher rates of smoking. COPD patients tend to have a higher
      level of nicotine dependence and, as a result, often find quitting harder and are more likely
      to relapse back to smoking. A clinical trial (N=262) is planned in Auckland, New Zealand to
      determine whether extended varenicline treatment combined with behavioural support can
      prevent relapse back to smoking in recent ex-smokers with COPD. Smoking cessation and relapse
      prevention are the most cost-effective interventions available for COPD patients that smoke,
      irrespective of their disease stage. The trial has the potential to significantly improve the
      outcomes of this common and chronic health condition in New Zealand.
