  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16 subject trial to demonstrate the safety of allogeneic hMSCs administered via
      infusion therapy for diabetic subjects with endothelial dysfunction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen (16) diabetic subject with endothelial dysfunction will be scheduled to undergo a
      peripheral intravenous infusion after meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria at baseline.

      Eight (8) subjects will be treated with 20 million (2 x 10^7) allogeneic hMSC's and eight (8)
      subjects will be treated with 100 million (100 x 10^6) allogeneic hMSC's

      Follow up: Subjects will be followed at 3, 7, 14, 28 days, and 3 month post-infusion to
      complete all safety and efficacy assessments and at 6 and 12 months post-infusion to complete
      safety assessments.
