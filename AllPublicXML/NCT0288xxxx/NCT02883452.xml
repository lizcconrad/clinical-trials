      Phase 1 randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group study designed to evaluate
      efficacy, PK and safety between CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV in patients with active CD or active
      UC.

    <textblock>
      A new subcutaneous infliximab formulation is being developed by Celltrion, Inc. as an
      alternative to the intravenous regimen where subcutaneous infliximab injection typically
      takes less than 2 minutes. The availability of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab would
      increase the treatment options available to patients, particularly those wishing to
      self-administer their therapy. This Phase 1 randomized, open-label, multicenter,
      parallel-group study is designed to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety between
      CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV in patients with active CD or active UC.
