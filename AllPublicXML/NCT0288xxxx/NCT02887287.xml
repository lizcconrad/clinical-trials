      The study aimed to prove EEN is effective for inducing early clinical remission, mucosal
      healing, promoting fistula closure and reducing the size of abscess to adult CD patients.
      They plan to include about 50 patients and observe the effect of EEN.

        The detailed inclusion criteria included: 1. &gt;18 years old 2. Patients with CD was
        diagnosed clinically according to previously established international criteria [9] 3. The
        diagnosis of stricture, fistula and abdominal abscess was confirmed by ultrasound, CT
        enterography (CTE), and endoscopy. The bowel stricture should mainly cause by inflammation
        but not fibrosis. Intolerance or failure to steroids or IFX was judged by medical history
        4. The disease was in an active period.
