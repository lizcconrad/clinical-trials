    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a fixed dose of Pembrolizumab in combination with two different
      regimens of hypofractionated radiation. It is designed to demonstrate the activity and safety
      of the combination treatment in advanced urothelial cancer patients with prior exposure to
      PD-1 inhibitors.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for more than 1 year. 14. Male subjects should agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through

          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of
             treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment. Systemic steroids administered specifically as a premedication for
             chemotherapy infusion or radiotherapy are allowed.

          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not
             recovered (i.e., less than or at Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., less than or at
             Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. -
             Note: Subjects with less than or Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion
             and may qualify for the study. - Note: If subject received major surgery, they must
             have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention
             prior to starting therapy.

          -  A history of prior radiotherapy that precludes delivery of hypofractionated
             radiotherapy

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

        Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
        or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subjects
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

          -  Had progression of disease within 9 weeks of starting prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1
             monotherapy therapy.

          -  Has not had prior cisplatinum-based chemotherapy, unless the subject is considered
             cisplatinum-ineligible based on meeting at least one of the following criteria: a.
             ECOG performance status of 2 (the proportion of ECOG 2 subjects will be limited to
             approximately 50% of the total population) b. Creatinine clearance (calculated or
             measured) less than 60 mL/min but greater than 30 mL/min Note: Subjects with a
             creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) less than 30 mL/min or on dialysis are
             excluded from the trial. c. CTCAE v.4, Greater than Grade 2 audiometric hearing loss
             (25dB in two consecutive wave ranges) d. CTCAE v.4, Greater than Grade 2 peripheral
