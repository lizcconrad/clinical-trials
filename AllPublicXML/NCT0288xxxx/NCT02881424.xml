    <textblock>
      Background:

      Alcohol-dependence is a chronic disease with a high risk of relapse. The main therapeutic
      outcome relies on relapse prevention which seeks to identify high risk situations and
      individual's response to these situations especially the emotional response to social
      environment. Alcohol-dependence also induces cognitive impairments leading to social
      cognition impairments increasing the risk of relapse.

      Familiarity is a key process in social interactions: it induces the feeling of prior
      knowledge of a stimulus without remembering consciously its identity. Followed by a second
      process based on the contribution of contextual information (recollection) familiarity allows
      face recognition.

      Main aim:

      Study of familiarity for faces in alcohol-dependence

      Secondary objectives:

      Highlighting correlations between familiarity impairments and clinical outcomes

      Familiarity will be tested by a specific familiarity task using an original paradigm. This
      paradigm allows the analysis of familiarity as a quantitative process as well as the analysis
      of personal familiarity to each subject. Three familiar and three unfamiliar faces are
      morphed in pairs for each participant. The displayed stimuli for each pair of faces are ten
      morphs with 5 to 95% of familiar face increasing by 10%. Participants are asked to press a
      button if the displayed stimulus seems familiar. At the end of the task each participant is
      asked to name the identity of the familiar faces (true or false recognitions, true or false
      omissions).

      Each participant will undergo 2 visits.

        -  First visit:

             -  Checking the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria

             -  Clinical report and alcohol consumption evaluation

             -  Standardized psychiatric interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview -
                MINI)

             -  Neuropsychological tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment - MoCA, &quot;Batterie Rapide
                d'Efficience Frontale&quot; - BREF, &quot;Rappel Libre et Rappel Indicé à 16 items&quot; - Grober
                &amp; Buschke 's test - RL/RI 16)

        -  Second visit:

             -  Checking the non-consumption of alcohol and other drugs (cannabis, amphetamine,
                cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, opioid)

             -  Task of familiarity with a controlling task

             -  Social cognition test (Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition - MASC)
