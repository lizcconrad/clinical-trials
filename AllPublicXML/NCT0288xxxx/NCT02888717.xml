    <textblock>
      The para-aortic lymph node involvement in the advanced stage of cervical cancer is a poor
      prognostic factor for overall survival. Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy has become the
      standard treatment for advanced cervical cancer. In case of para-aortic lymph node
      involvement, an extension of radiotherapy fields is recommended.

      A prospective multicentre study shown that the survival rate of patients with node ≤ 5 mm and
      which benefited from the expansion of radiotherapy fields was identical to the survival of
      pN0 patients.

      However, due to a specific disease, this technique should not be performed in all patients.
      It is necessary to reliably select patients with retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. For
      this, it is recommended that prior to the concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, nodal staging
      surgery with a definitive histological analysis.

      So we propose to use molecular diagnostic test OSNA (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) to
      improve lymph node metastasis detection sensitivity to achieve ultra-staging compared to
      conventional histology.

      The para-aortic lymph node involvement in the advanced stage of cervical cancer is a poor
      prognostic factor for overall survival. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard
      treatment for advanced cervical cancer. In case of para-aortic lymph node involvement, an
      extension of radiotherapy fields is recommended.

      A prospective multicenter study shown that the survival rate of patients with node ≤ 5 mm and
      which benefited from the expansion of radiotherapy fields was identical to the survival of
      pN0 patients.

      However, due to a specific disease, this technique should not be performed in all patients.
      It is necessary to reliably select patients with retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. For
      this, it is recommended that prior to the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, nodal staging surgery
      with a definitive histological analysis.

      So we suggest using molecular diagnostic test OSNA (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) to
      improve lymph node metastasis detection sensitivity to achieve ultra-staging compared to
      conventional histology.

      We propose to consider a new concordance study to assess the feasibility of the technical
      OSNA in a new indication: cervical cancer.

      The analysis protocol of a concordance study is the same regardless of the location of the
      cancer. We evaluate the use of OSNA in order to ultrastaging of lymph node involvement for
      patients with advanced cancer of the cervix.

      Our hypothesis is that OSNA would be:

        -  better than the usual histological staging method

        -  and equivalence in terms of sensitivity and specificity compared to intensive
           histological method To complete this study we propose to search the initial brain tumor
           expression of cytokeratin 19.

    <description>The main objective is to compare the performance of OSNA to both conventional methods and intensive histological analysis, for the detection of lymph node metastases in advanced cervical cancer.
The evaluation criteria is :
Determination of number of lymph node metastases expressed in a size in mm for conventional and intensive histological analysis.
Determination of the number of lymph node metastases expressed in a number of copies in molecular biology.</description>

    <description>The para-aortic dissection surgery is performed in the usual way. The lymph nodes are isolated from fat tissue during surgery, and cut into 4 slices sterile.
Slices A and C are sent OSNA analysis
Slices B and D are sent ultimately histological analysis (1 cup HES or 5 cup HES + IHC) The nodes of less than 5 mm will be sent in final histological analysis due to the inability to cut into 4.
After the analysis, the report indicates whether the node is:
Free (-): &lt;250 copies
Micrometastatic (+): 250 ≤ - &lt;5,000 copies,
Macrometastatic (++): ≥ 5000 copies.</description>
