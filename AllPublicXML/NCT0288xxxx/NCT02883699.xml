      The TOP Study is a two-stage study on individually tailored endurance and resistance training
      prescriptions for breast and prostate cancer patients after the end of primary therapy in
      order to optimize training effects.

      The TOP Study Part I aims at identifying the most appropriate way of individual intensity
      prescription. In a descriptive cross sectional study, 20 breast and 20 prostate cancer
      patients perform singe endurance and resistance training sessions prescribed by means of
      different methods of intensity prescription. The most appropriate method of intensity
      prescription is identified through considering predictability/homogeneity of physiological
      responses as well as perceived exertion and enjoyment.

      The TOP Study Part II aims at investigating the most effective training method in terms of
      enhancing physical fitness for both endurance and strength training. The design is an
      exploratory four-arm 12-week randomized controlled training intervention trial in 60 breast
      and 60 prostate cancer patients. In two endurance arms, vigorous continuous training is
      compared to a polarized program consisting of moderate training and aerobic high intensity
      interval training (HIIT). Similarly, in two resistance training arms, standard machine based
      hypertrophy training is compared to training following a daily undulating periodization
      design.
