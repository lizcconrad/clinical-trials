      A Phase 2a, Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the
      Safety/Tolerability and Efficacy of TOP1288 200 mg Rectal Solution Once Daily for 4 Weeks in
      Symptomatic Ulcerative Colitis Patients with Moderate to Severe Disease Activity
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TOP1288, the first in a new class of agents called narrow spectrum protein kinase inhibitors
      (NSKIs), is being developed as a novel, non-absorbed treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC).
      UC is a disease of unknown cause characterised by inflammation of the lining of the large
      intestine and manifesting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. TOP1288 given rectally
      has a local anti-inflammatory action in experimental models of UC.

      A Phase I placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD)
      study of TOP1288 conducted in 61 healthy volunteers demonstrated that rectal administration
      of TOP1288 at doses up to 200 mg BID for 4 days was safe and well tolerated, with minimal
      systemic absorption. TOP1288 200 mg, administered once daily, therefore offers the potential
      for a safe and effective novel approach to treating patients with this serious condition.

      This Phase 2a proof-of-concept study will evaluate the 200 mg daily dose of TOP1288, based on
      its favourable tolerability in the Phase 1 study. It will be administered as TOP1288 200 mg
      Rectal Solution compared against Placebo Rectal Solution, which contains all non-active
      excipients present in the active solution. This is a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled multicentre study designed to evaluate the safety/tolerability and
      efficacy of TOP1288 200 mg Rectal Solution following once-daily bedtime treatment for 4
      consecutive weeks. The study will include approximately 40 sites in Europe. Randomization to
      study treatment will be 2:1, with approximately 40 subjects randomised to TOP1288 and
      approximately 20 subjects randomised to placebo.

      The Screening period will be up to 28 days prior to the first day of dosing with double-blind
      study treatment (Visit 1). A central reading facility will be used to determine eligibility
      based upon the Screening flexible sigmoidoscopy.

      Visit 2 is scheduled for Day 7 of dosing, and Visit 3 for Day 29 of dosing. There will be a
      1-week safety follow-up period after Visit 3. The total duration of study participation for a
      given subject will be up to ~65 days or 9 weeks
