    <description>This is a sub-study testing how the adhesion of two adhesives is influenced by exposure to real output.
There are two visits:
The first visit:
Two adhesive strips (standard adhesive strip) are applied to the peristomal skin and one of these strips is exposed to real output (contained in a sleeve) and the other strip is not.
The second visit:
Two adhesive strips (new adhesive strip) are applied to the peristomal skin and one of these strips is exposed to real output (contained in a sleeve) and the other strip is not.</description>
