    <textblock>
      In a recent study, we have demonstrated that the motivational therapy approach to treat
      childhood obesity is highly effective at clinical and metabolic levels. This efficacy has
      been proved in a clinical outpatient setting. However, a standardized collaborative approach
      between the clinic and the primary care services would allow a faster and easier approach to
      childhood obesity treatment. Furthermore, this motivational and educational intervention
      would benefit from the current technologic facilities, the long term effect of the education
      at group level, in terms of food shopping plan, healthy, fast and cheap cooking methods that
      would be useful specially in low income families (with a higher prevalence of childhood
      obesity).

      The aim of this study is assessing the clinical and metabolic efficacy of a family
      intervention, coordinated between the clinical and primary care services from the Tarragona
      health-care region, using a motivational therapy at individual and group levels, which
      involves e-Health tools (wearable), focusing on families with an 8 to 13 years old obese
      child.

      The design will be a clustered randomized control trial, with an intervention group that will
      receive a multicomponent motivational and educational plan which will be compared to a
      control group receiving the usual recommendations performed in primary care centres (n=167
      per group). The treatment of both study groups will last 12 months and will be performed at
      the primary care centres. In parallel, the study team will validate the methodology used to
      assess body composition in obese children as well as the changes produced by the
      intervention.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a motivational intervention for the treatment
      of childhood obesity, coordinated between primary care and specialized services,
      multicomponent, integrating techniques of fast and healthy cooking and eHealth tools
      (wearable), compared to the usual intervention performed in paediatrics.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent motivational intervention compared to
           usual intervention performed in regular paediatrics clinical practice

             1. On BMI control of obese children between 8 and 13 years old

             2. On metabolic control of obese children between 8 and 13 years old,

             3. On increasing physical activity of obese children between 8 and 13 years old,

             4. On acquiring a healthy eating pattern in obese children between 8 and 13 years old.

        2. To establish methodological background for implantation of a motivational intervention
           coordinated between primary care services and specialized services.

        3. To validate the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual X-ray
           absorptiometry (DXA) in the follow up and treatment of childhood obesity compared to
           four-compartment model of body composition.

      5. METHODOLOGY

      5.1 Design Randomized controlled clinical trial cluster, with an intervention group (IG)
      which will receive 12 months of motivational counselling, together with workshops focused on
      family nutrition education and techniques of fast and healthy cooking and physical activity;
      and with eHealth tools (wearable) to support; and a control group (CG) that will follow the
      usual recommendations.

      5.2 STUDY POPULATION The Health Region of Tarragona includes a population of 600,000 people
      (36,000 children from 8 to 13 years). With regard to the 6.6% of childhood obesity prevalence
      in our country (Schroder 2014), we estimate an eligible population of 2376 obese children
      aged 8-13 years old.

      5.3 SAMPLE SIZE The number of individuals of a simple random design, multiplied by the design
      effect has been considered to calculate the sample size of each stratum (Basic Care Unit).
      Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a bilateral contrast, 98 subjects
      were needed in each group to detect a difference equal to or greater than 0.36 units of BMI
      z-score. It is assumed that common standard deviation is 0.75. A 30% lost to follow up rate
      (GRANMO 7.12) has been estimated. To calculate the design effect, estimates of intracluster
      correlation coefficient in cluster randomized trials in primary care are generally lower than
      0.05. The effect of the design corresponds to 1.7. Assuming these values, the final size of
      the study sample would be of 167 subjects in each group (12 individuals for each primary care
      centre, in 15 basic care units (BCUs)).

      5.4 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Basic Care Units (BCU) doctor-nurse are the unit of
      randomization. Randomization will be 1: 1 and will be made with EPIDAT 3.0 statistical
      program. Given the nature of the intervention participants or researchers cannot be blinded.
      Professional in charge of statistical analysis will be blinded as well.

The first and last visits will be performed in consultations of endocrinology unit from referral hospitals; the other visits will be held in paediatric primary care setting. Visits will be scheduled monthly and each one will last between 15 and 20 minutes.
In addition to individualized visits, three group workshops focused in nutrition education for families will be organized. Each workshop will last 45 minutes and will target parents/mothers and obese children, separately.</description>
