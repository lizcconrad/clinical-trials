  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linear hypertrophic scar is a common surgical problem that can be difficult to manage,
      especially for the median sternotomy scar. Despite high demand for the early intervention to
      prevent and treat surgical scars, there is yet no universal consensus on satisfactory
      treatment. Botulinum toxin type A is a neurotoxin that has been widely and safely used in
      medicine for more than 30 years. It induces chemodenervation through acting on the
      presynaptic neuron to prevent release of acetylcholine, which leads to functional denervation
      of striated muscle for about 6 months after injection. The aim of this randomized controlled
      trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Botulinum toxin type A as a prophylactic treatment in
      the early postoperative of median sternotomy for the purpose of preventing excess scar
      formation.

      The goal of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial about using Botulinum
      toxin type A ( BTA) to prevent hypertrophic scar in median sternotomy wound. The entire
      median sternotomy wound was divided into the upper half and the lower half. Both halves of
      the wound were randomized to receive treatment with either BTA or 0.9% normal saline. The
      patient and the surgeon will be blinded to the treatment arm. The primary end point was the
      evaluation of upper and lower half scar using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). At 6 months
      follow-up, two blinded dermatologists examined the patients and took photographs of the scar
      in the outpatient clinic of XiJing Hospital. Scars were assessed using the VSS and assigned
      the mean score of the two observers. At 6-month follow-up, ultrasonography to measure the
      scar width will be performed. At the same time, patients were asked to evaluate their overall
      satisfaction, using a four-point grading scale for each half the scar(1= very satisfied, 2=
      satisfied,3= slightly satisfied, 4= unsatisfied ).Paired t-test was used to compare the VSS
      scores, scar width and the overall satisfaction between the BTA-treated group and normal
      saline group.
