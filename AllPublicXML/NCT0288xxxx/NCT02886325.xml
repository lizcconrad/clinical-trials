      The overall goal is to develop a culturally appropriate and easy to disseminate educational
      intervention documented to improve cancer prevention and increase cancer screening behaviors
      in the rural Midwest.

      Objective: To evaluate how a modified version of CC&amp;S may reduce health disparities.

      Specific Aim: To evaluate the impact of participation in CC&amp;S educational sessions on cancer
      prevention and screening.

      Study Design: To evaluate the impact of participation in CC&amp;S educational sessions on cancer
      prevention and screening. The investigators will recruit 60 community members; 30 will
      receive CC&amp;S training (intervention group) and 30 will not (control group). All 60 will be
      surveyed about their intent to change their behavior at the beginning of the study and their
      actual behavior changes and screening behavior 6 months after the beginning of the study.

      Goal: The overall goal is to develop a culturally appropriate and easy to disseminate
      educational intervention documented to improve cancer prevention and increase cancer
      screening behaviors in the rural Midwest.
