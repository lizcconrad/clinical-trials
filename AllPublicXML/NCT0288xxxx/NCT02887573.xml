    <textblock>
      Colon capsule endoscopy(CCE) is a new diagnostic method of colonic lesions.It has advantages
      of no requirement for sedation and air insufflation.The bowel preparation has a closely
      relationship with yield of diagnosing diseases.Bowel preparation of CCE is not only to clean
      the colon but also to promote capsule propulsion.Now there is not an optimal method for CCE.

      Objective: In this study, a new bowel preparation regime of the colon capsule is used.This
      regime combines free-residue nutrients and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to achieve a better
      preparation quality.

      Methods: Participants who underwent a diagnostic colonoscopy examination that demonstrated a
      colorectal polyps that required endoscopic treatment will be recruited to patients in the
      study. The first 32 participants receive a traditional low fiber diet two days before the
      test.Then the patients will take 2L polyethylene glycol (PEG) at 21:00-23:00 before the test
      day and 2L PEG at 05:00-07:00 on the test day for bowel preparation. The subsequent 30
      participants receive two-days free-residue nutrients without other diet before the test.Then
      the patients will take 2L PEG at 05:00-07:00 on the examination day for bowel preparation.
      Then they will take 5mg mosapride citrate at 8:00 and ingest the colon capsule at 8:30.0.75L
      and 0.50L PEG are administered as boosters.And the therapeutic endoscopy will be given on the
      following day.Before the therapeutic colonoscopy, the participants will take 2L PEG. The
      colon capsule results will be reviewed by two experienced endoscopists who are blinded to
      first endoscopy results.

    <description>The first 32 patients adopted a low fiber diet two days before the CCE procedure. Bowel preparation included the ingestion of 2L polyethyleneglycol in the evening before test day and 2L PEG in the morning on the test day. The subsequent 30 patients were received free-residue Nutrients。Then they ingested 2L PEG between 5:00 and 7.00 am of the examination day. The capsule was scheduled at 8:30 am. When the capsule reached the small bowel, 0.75L PEG was used as first booster. If the capsule had not been excreted 3 hours later, the patients was received 0.5L PEG.</description>
