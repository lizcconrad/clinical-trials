  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patient subjected to hemodialysis has a low physical capacity due to being advanced in
      years and the complexity of the process, which is encouraged by family members and caregivers
      who lead them to a total dependence. The Intradialytic physical exercise is presented as an
      alternative to counteract this functional deterioration of patients with terminal chronic
      kidney failure.

      Objective To evaluate the impact of the intradialytic physical training program on the level
      of disability and physical performance in patients subjected to hemodialysis.

      Materials and methods 18 patients subjected to hemodialysis, whose ages ranged from 54 to 84
      (10 women) were included in the study. Nine of these patients participated in a combined
      training program, which lasted 12 weeks, the training sessions were carried out within each
      dialysis session, the working session involved a warm-up period, aerobic exercise with
      pedals, or strength exercises based on free-weight depending on the training stage. The Borg
      scale and the heart rate reserve were used to control the training intensity. The disability
      level was evaluated at the beginning and end of the study through the World Health
      Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II, the six minutes walk test (6MWT), quadriceps
      strength, Kt/V, serum levels of potassium and creatinine.

      Outcomes One subject belonging to the experimental group did not complete the training due to
      problems in the venous access during the 1st month of training. 8 patients in to the
      experimental group showed significant improvements in the 6MWT, quadriceps strength and
      decrease in the level of disability. No changes were observed in the control group. No
      significant changes were found in the serum levels of potassium and creatine.

      Conclusions An Intradialytic physical training program achieved a substantial decrease in the
      level of disability, and an improvement of aerobic capacity and muscle strength. The study
      was funded by the extension office of the Austral University of Chile.

    <description>Nine patients participated in the experimental group in a combined training program, which lasted 12 weeks with a frequency of 3 times a week, the training sessions were carried out within each dialysis session during the first 2 hours of the dialysis treatment, the working session involved a warm up period, aerobic exercise with pedals, or strength exercises based on free weight depending on the training stage. The Borg scale and the heart rate reserve were used to control the training intensity. The disability level was evaluated at the beginning and the end of the study through the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II, the aerobic capacity was evaluated through the six minute walk and the limbs strength was evaluated through a dynamometer.</description>
