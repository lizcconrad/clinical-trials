    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter retrospective study in good prognosis Chinese patients. Data will be
      collected from infertile women who underwent first in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intra
      cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using a Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist
      (Cetrotide) protocol at about 4 IVF centers to investigate the factors associated with
      clinical pregnancy rate. The definition of the good prognosis subjects is, age not more than
      35 years old, Baseline serum Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level no more than 10
      milliinternational units (mIU)/milliliter (ml), Body mass index (BMI) not more than 30
      kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), previously underwent no more than 3 IVF/ICSI cycles, and
      the total dose of Gonadotropin used no more than 2500 IU in current cycle. No intervention(s)
      will be administered on the subjects. Data required to investigate the factors associated
      with the pregnancy outcome of GnRH antagonist IVF cycle will be collected from the subjects'
      medical records into database through electronic data capture system and analyzed.

Initiated cycle: an assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycle in which the woman receives specific medication for ovarian stimulation, or monitoring in the case of natural cycles, with the intention to treat, irrespective of whether or not follicular aspiration is attempted. Aspiration cycle Initiated ART cycle in which one or more follicles are punctured and aspirated irrespective of whether or not oocytes are retrieved.
