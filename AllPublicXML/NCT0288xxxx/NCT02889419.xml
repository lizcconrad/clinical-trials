    <textblock>
      KML is a multicenter, prospective, uncontrolled and before/after study. The study aims to
      estimate if the use of Selfia ® adapted underwear reduces the necessary duration for the
      realization of self-catheterisation (SC) for patients affected by multiple sclerosis with
      severe to moderate disability.

      Secondly, the study aims to :

        -  Estimate the effect of underwear on quality of life, tiredness linked to the act,
           comfort in the realization of SC, complications with SC, third party intervention ;

        -  Collect patients' opinion on the use of the underwear SELFIA ® at the end of the 2nd
           week of evaluation ;

        -  Measure if the patient reused underwear and if he bought it at 6 months and at 1 year

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder-sphincter disorders affect 80 % of the patients suffering from multiple sclerosis
      (MS) after 10 years of evolution and urinary self-catheterization (SC) are part of the
      therapeutic arsenal.

      SC involves different steps: the preparation of the material, the undressing, the transfer on
      toilets, the technical gesture and the dressing. Recommendations of good practice of SC of
      the French Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation evoke the necessity to adapt the
      wardrobe but without precision on the definition of this adaptation.

      Adapted underwear exists for patients with a disability and is accessible for the general
      public. However, no clinical trial has ever evaluated their real practical interest for
      disabled patients realizing SC.

      These undergarments, according to our experience, are very ingenious and would bring a real
      comfort in everyday life from patients with a disability.

      In case of SC, this underwear would facilitate and shorten the time dedicated to this
      technique, especially as SC are realized on average 6 times a day for patients already
      affected in their movements because of their initial handicap.

      The adapted underwear could bring an ease and a speed of dressing / undressing, allow an
      easier and faster access to the urinary meatus and a limitation of manipulations and
      mobilizations of the patient allowing an energy saving.

      Moreover, disabled patients request concrete advice from health professionals on everyday
      life problems such as dressing / undressing. Therefore it seemed interesting to estimate the
      benefits of using adapted underwear for the realization of SC for patients affected by MS
      with severe to moderate disability (EDSS 6 - 7.5) affecting everyday life activities.

    <description>Patients are evaluated for a week using their usual underwear for the realization of SC. At the end of the week, they receive Selfia ® adaptated underwear and they use it for one week for a new evaluation. Finally, underwear will be given to patients and during follow-up consultations in routine at 6 months and 1 year, he will be asked if they reused or bought underwear.</description>
