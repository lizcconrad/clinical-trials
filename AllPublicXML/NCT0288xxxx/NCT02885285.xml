  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about the impact of exercise on fatigue, anxiety, and
      depression in Parkinson's disease. It is well established that exercise improves the motor
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, it is not clear which types of exercise are most
      beneficial for specific non-motor symptoms.

      The investigators are recruiting 32 patients who will be randomized into either a spinning
      class, yoga class, dance class, or no exercise intervention. Classes will be conducted twice
      a week for 6 weeks total at times convenient for the patients. Patients will also be asked to
      complete questionnaires after exercise classes to see if the exercise intervention improves
      measures of fatigue, anxiety, and depression - and what exercise intervention may be
      superior.
