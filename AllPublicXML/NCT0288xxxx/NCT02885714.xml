  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tear is a very common and disabling condition that can be related to acute
      trauma such as falling on the shoulder. A tear is associated with symptoms such as pain in
      abduction, abduction weakness and night pain. Rotator cuff tear surgery is a well-established
      form of treatment in acute rotator cuff tears, although beneficial results have been reported
      for both conservative and surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears. Rotator cuff tear repair
      surgery involves a considerable amount of re-ruptures, and it is possible that the repaired
      tendon do not heal despite surgical repair. On the other hand rotator cuff tears are also
      found in completely asymptomatic persons and the clinical significance of a rupture may be
      generally lower than estimated. The above-mentioned factors, as well as recent research and
      meta-analysis on the treatment of mainly degenerative rotator cuff tears indicate that there
      is a limited evidence that surgery is not more effective in treating symptomatic rotator cuff
      tear than conservative treatment alone. However, these previous research findings cannot be
      applied directly to traumatic tears, although degeneration can be considered always to
      contribute to the creation of a rotator cuff tear.

      During few last decades, despite the lack of evidence on the superiority of one treatment
      over another, the use of surgery to treat this disorder has been substantially increased.
      Treatment expectations are found to be important in predicting patient related outcome
      measures. In addition, surgery itself may produce a profound placebo effect. There are no
      previous placebo-controlled trials on the topic of interest. In order to find out the true
      efficacy of surgical treatment of acute, trauma related rotator cuff tears involving mainly
      the supraspinatus tendon, the investigators have designed this multi-centre, randomized,
      placebo-controlled efficacy trial.

    <description>The patient is prepared for surgery as normal (plexus+general anesthesia or TIVA, with antibiotic prophylaxis). The arthroscope is introduced in the glenohumeral joint, and thereafter online randomization is performed. The joint space is evaluated. Nothing is to be removed or excised and the use of any vapour or shaver device is not allowed. The presence of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear is verified. Altogether 3 to 5 small stab wounds are made in typical locations resembling locations of typical rotator cuff repair. The time spent in the operating theatre with patients in placebo group should resemble the time spent with patients in the active treatment group and hence give an impression of a rotator cuff repair.</description>

The joint space is evaluated and the presence of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear is verified. The cuff tear is repaired to its anatomic location using suture anchors according to surgeon preference. . A biceps tenotomy or tenodesis may be performed according to surgeon preference if the biceps tendon is noted to be frayed, unstable or inflamed. An additional acromioplasty may be performed according to surgeon preference.</description>
