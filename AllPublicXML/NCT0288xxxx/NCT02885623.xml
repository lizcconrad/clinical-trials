    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical significance of CX3CR1-expressing myeloid and lymphoid
      cells in patients of hematologic malignancy.

      Tumor cells either express membrane molecules or release tumor-derived soluble factors able
      to alter myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Myeloid cells expressing CD11b play a critical role
      in sustaining cancer progression. Also, the fractalkine (CX3CL1; Fkn)/CX3CR1 axis plays an
      important function in the pathophysiology of various forms of cancers. Fkn is the only known
      ligand for CX3CR1, and it triggers recruitment of CX3CR1-positive cells through its unique
      receptor, CX3CR1. Therefore, the investigators focused the prognostic significance of CD11b+
      myelo-monocytic cells expressing CX3CR1 and CD3+ lymphoid cells expressing CX3CR1 in the
      clinical outcomes of newly diagnosed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Multiple
      myeloma (MM).

      Bone marrow aspirates will be obtained from newly diagnosed MM and DLBCL patients at the time
      of diagnosis and relapse. Peripheral blood will be obtained at the time of diagnosis,
      finishing treatment, 3 months after treatment and relapse.

      The investigators will analyze the cell fractions of CD11b+ CX3CR1+ cells and CD3+CX3CR1+
      cells in blood samples by flowcytometry. The investigators will find out the relationship
      between the tested cells and clinical outcome in MM and DLBCL.
