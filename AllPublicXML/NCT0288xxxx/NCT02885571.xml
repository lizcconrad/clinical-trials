  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether objective compliance monitoring can increase mandibular
      advancement device (MAD) usage in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Half of
      participants will be assigned to objective compliance monitoring group (experimental group),
      while the other will be assigned to subjective compliance monitoring group (control group). A
      physician will prescribe and explain to patients based on data from objective or subjective
      compliance monitoring.

    <textblock>
      The design of this study is a randomized controlled trial. Total 40 participants are randomly
      divided into 2 groups: objective compliance monitoring (n=20) and subjective compliance
      monitoring (n=20). Both groups wear the same MAD (commercial name: SomnoDent Flex with
      DentiTrac). They visit Seol National University Hospital at 1, 3, and 6 month after the
      initiation of MAD. A research coordinator acquires data by downloading from the MAD or by
      asking the patients, and then transfer the information to the physician. If the patient
      belongs to objective compliance group, data from the MAD will be transferred to the
      physician. But if the patient belongs to subjective compliance group, data acquired by asking
      patients will be transferred to the physician. A physician will prescribe and explain to
      patients based on data from objective or subjective compliance monitoring.The primary aims is
      to examine the effectiveness of SomnoDent Flex with DentiTrac, in terms of compliance.
