      Introduction- Oxidative stress plays a causative role in pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

      It has been reported that Spirulina platensis or its active ingredient C phycocyanin (CPC)
      exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and inhibitory effects on prostaglandin and
      leukotriene biosynthesis.

      Aim- To evaluate the effect of dietary spirulina as an adjunct to SRP on salivary
      antioxidants level in CP subjects.

      Materials And Methods- The study was a randomized double-blind clinical and biochemical trial
      in which 70 subjects with CP in the age group of 40-55 years, reporting to Department of
      Periodontology, TKDC and RC, New Pargaon, were equally and randomly divided into Test Group
      (TG) and Control Group (CG). TG was given 2 gm Spirulina capsules daily, after meals for 1
      month and CG was not given any supplementary diet. SRP was done at baseline in TG and CG.
      Whole saliva sample was collected. Clinical and biochemical parameters will be recorded at
      baseline, 1 month &amp; 3 months.
