    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel group study. The objectives of this
      study are to assess pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and naloxone from oxycodone/naloxone (OXN)
      prolonged release (PR) tablet 5/2.5 mg (OXN 5/2.5) and 20/10 mg (OXN 20/10) in Chinese
      patients with moderate to severe chronic non-malignant pain.

      It will be conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics of OXN 5/2.5 and OXN 20/10 tablets.
      Subjects will be allocated to a sequence of two strength group in accordance with a random
      allocation schedule (RAS) in a 1:1 ratio.

      Subjects will attend a screening visit within 14 days of the first (OXN) dosing day (Day 1).

      Eligible subjects will then check into the study unit on the day before OXN dosing (Day -2).
      Subjects will be administered their OXN dose the next 2 morning (Day 1), following an
      overnight fast.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult Chinese patients with moderate to severe chronic non-malignant pain.

          2. Male and female subjects with age range 18 to 65 years (including 18 and 65), body
             weight ≥ 45kg and BMI range 18 to 30 (including 18 and 30).

          3. Patients who should rate their pain (Pain Intensity Scale -&quot;average pain&quot; over the
             last 24 hours) as ≥4 on 0-10 scale.

          4. Patients, who are able to read, understand and sign written informed consent prior to
             study participation and are willing to follow the protocol requirements.

          5. Females of childbearing potential and less than one year post-menopausal must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test during screening visit and at check-in and be
             non-lactating. In addition, they must be willing to use adequate and reliable
             contraception throughout the study. Highly effective methods of birth control are
             defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when
             used consistently and correctly such as sterilization, implants, injectables, combined
             oral contraceptives, some IUDs (intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner.
