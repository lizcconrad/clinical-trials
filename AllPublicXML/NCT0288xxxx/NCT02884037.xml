  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multicentric, double-blind, randomized,placebo-controlled study, the investigators
      hypothesized that rifaximin might act on Gram-negative bacteria and intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth(IBO) thereby inhibiting lipopolysaccharides(LPS)-mediated proinflammatory cytokine
      production. This work evaluates the efficacy of 6 months administration of rifaximin in NAFLD
      patients.

      The investigators aimed to study the effect of rifaximin on NASH. 50 patients with
      biopsy-proven NASH were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized,placebo-controlled study.
      BMI, AST, ALT, gamma glutamyl transferase (γ-GGT), lipid profile, homeostatic model
      assessment (HOMA), serum endotoxin, Toll-like receptor 4 (TlR4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10,
      tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) levels were measured before and
      after a 6 month administration of rifaximin (1100mg/day, 550 mg tablets 1 × 2 before meals).

        In this multicentric, double-blind, randomized,placebo-controlled study, we enrolled
        consecutively 1072 participants with hepatitis irrespective to their etiologies referred to
        the Tropical Medicine and Internal Medicine Departments (Mansoura University), Tropical
        Medicine Department (Zagazig University), and Internal Medicine and Endemic Diseases and
        Gastroenterology Departments (Aswan University)from May 2012 to October 2016. All
        participants underwent to the following appraisal: physical and biochemical examination,
        complete history taking, abdominal ultrasound, and percutaneous ultrasound liver biopsy.
