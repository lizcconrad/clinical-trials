  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to observe the therapeutic effects and long-term follow-up after ending anti-HBV
      therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with chronic hepatitis b.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic hepatitis b were enrolled in the study. Age, sex, weight, height,
      symptoms (e.g., fatigue, poor appetite, jaundice), relapse, retreatment, occurrence of liver
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mortality and survival rate were recorded in
      the study. We also observed the laboratory tests including the levels of white blood cells
      (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelet (PLT), alanine transaminase (ALT),
      aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine,
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      DNA, CD4 positive T lymphocyte (CD4+T), CD8 positive T lymphocyte (CD8+T), Type 1 helper T
      lymphocyte (Th1), Type 2 helper T lymphocyte (Th2),fibroscan and B ultrasound. If clinical
      relapse occurred, patients were retreated with nucleos(t)ide analogs.
