      Investigators would like to assess the efficacy and safety of tegafur-uracil in patients with
      stage II MSI-L or MSS colon cancer under metronomic setting for one year.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15% cases of colon cancer are associated a type of inherited susceptibility
      called defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR), which is frequently measured by either the
      presence of microsatellite instability (MSI) or by testing for loss of the protein products
      for genes involved in DNA MMR (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2). Tumors are classified according to
      the percentage of abnormal microsatellite regions present: &gt;30-40% as high-level MSI (MSI-H),
      &lt;30-40% as low-level MSI (MSI-L) and no abnormalities as microsatellite stable (MSS). In the
      condition of MSI presence, evidence shows that MSI is a marker of a more favorable survival
      outcome and a predictor of decreased benefit from adjuvant therapy with 5-FU in patients with
      stage II disease. MSI status can be used in the clinic as a prognostic tool to identify a
      subgroup of stage II patients with improved prognosis. Patients with MSI-H tumors are not
      suggested to have adjuvant chemotherapy while patients with MSI-L or MSS tumors can benefit
      from adjuvant chemotherapy. oral tegafur-uracil as an adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
      Dukes' stage B2 and C2 colon cancer could be a good alternative to infusional 5-FU. Current
      evidences suggest adjuvant 5-FU-based therapy could improve survival outcome for patients
      with stage II MSI-L or MSS colon cancer, but not for patients with MSI-H colon cancer. Thus,
      oral tegafur-uracil is considered to have similar efficacy as 5-FU in this population.
