  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      iHIVARNA-01 is a novel therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients based
      on in vivo modification of DCs. It consists of HIVACAT-TriMix: mRNA encoding a mixture of APC
      activation molecules (CD40L, a constitutively active variant of TLR4 and CD70) and the HIV
      target antigens contained in HIVACAT to be administered through the intranodal route.
      iHIVARNA-01 aims to achieve the 'functional cure' of HIV infection, i.e. controlling viral
      replication in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of iHIVARNA-01 as a new therapeutic
      vaccine in HIV infected patients.

      Study design and duration: Phase IIa, multicentre double-blind placebo controlled
      intervention study. Each patient will be followed for 30 weeks. The study duration will be 38
      weeks from inclusion of the first patient.

      Sites: Erasmus MC, Rotterdam The Netherlands (sponsor), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona and
      Institut de Recerca de la Sida - Caixa, Barcelona, Spain, Instituut voor Tropische
      Geneeskunde Antwerp, Belgium and Vrije Universiteit Brussel/UZ Brussel, Belgium

      Study population: Chronically HIV-1- infected patients under stable cART with plasma viral
      load (pVL) ≤ 50 copies/ml and stable CD4+ T-cell counts ≥ 450/μl, aged 18 years or above.

      Sample size: after recruitment and screening, 70 patients will be included and randomized to
      one of the study-arms.

      Intervention: One group (n=40) receives the HIVACAT-TriMix (300 microgram TriMix + 900
      microgram HIVACAT) vaccine intranodally on three occasions with a two-week interval. One
      control group (n=15) receives TriMix only (300 microgram TriMix) and one group (n=15)
      receives saline intranodally on three occasions with a two-week interval. Two weeks after the
      last vaccination cART treatment will be interrupted. If plasma virus is detectable, cART will
      be re-initiated twelve weeks after treatment interruption. cART can always be re-initiated
      for medical reasons, as judged by the clinical investigator.
