  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      66 female patients undergoing breast cancer surgery were randomized in the Jules Bordet
      Institute, the Belgian oncology institute. One group received an opioid anesthesia, the other
      group an opioid free one. The hypothesis of this study was that opioid free anesthesia
      improves the postoperative quality of recovery of anesthesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids used as part of balanced anesthesia have known undesired side effects such as:
      respiratory depression, post-operative nausea and vomiting, pruritus, difficulty voiding and
      ileus.

      The purpose of this study was to determine whether opioid free anesthesia influences the
      quality of recovery. A multimodal approach combining ketamine, lidocaine and clonidine was
      used as an alternative for an opioid based anesthesia.

      The hypothesis of this study was that patient comfort and satisfaction level after an opioid
      free anesthesia would be higher compared to after a more traditional opioid anesthesia.

    <description>All drugs were given IV. Induction in the opioid free group began with a loading dose of clonidine (0.2 mcg kg-1), a bolus of ketamine (0.3 mg kg -1) lidocaine (1.5 mg kg -1) and a bolus of propofol (2-3 mg kg -1).
General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (MAC: 1) (adapted according to hemodynamic stability).
Upon the incision, acetaminophen (1000 mg) and diclofenac (75 mg) were given in both groups. A bolus of ketamine (0.2mg kg -1) was given if necessary in the opioid free group (up to three bolus max. were permitted).
A bolus of piritramide (0.03 mg kg -1) was administered upon subcutaneous closure.
Postoperative pain was treated with IV acetaminophen (1000 mg) every 6 h for the first 24 hours and IV diclofenac (75 mg) every 12 h for the first 24 hours. Patients received a PCIA (patient-controlled intravenous analgesia) pump of piritramide.</description>
