  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Besides classical cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, elevated cholesterol
      levels and diabetes there are also acute factors potentially triggering acute coronary
      events. The impact of various substances and air pollution are described.

      Particulate matter, especially with small particle size (&lt;2.5µm) has been shown to have a
      positive correlation with myocardial infarctions. However, other studies failed to show this
      correlation.

      With respect to nitric oxydes the majority of published studies detected a significant
      correlation with myocardial infarction, too, although a highly ranked publication failed to
      show the same result. In addition data on the impact of sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide
      concentration on cardiac events is very heterogeneous.

      Published data indicates additive effects of age and other epidemiological variables
      suggesting the need of a multivariate analysis.

      The rationale of the study is to test if the above mentioned air pollution factors have a
      significant and independent impact on the incidence of myocardial infarctions

      The analysis will be performed in a well characterized patient cohort of 12.000 myocardial
      infarctions within 10 years being invasively diagnosed at the catheterisation centers of the
      styrian capital Graz.
