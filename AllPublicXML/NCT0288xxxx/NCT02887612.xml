    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the common malignant tumors in China, with relatively high incident
      rate and mortality among the population. Surgery is the conventional treatment option for
      early and intermediate-stage stage gastric cancer, but postoperative relapse is the major
      issue. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is tumor-derived fragmented DNA with an average size of
      166 bp, mixed with cell free DNA (cfDNA) of other sources in blood circulation.ctDNA is
      reflecting the most up-to-date status of tumor genome. Hence, it is considered as a new
      biomarker for tumor, which can be qualitative, quantitative and used for disease monitoring.
      The present clinical trial aims to elucidate the correlation between the serum ctDNA status
      and the prognosis of patients with early and intermediate-stage gastric cancer upon surgical
      treatment, and explore the possibility of clinical utility of serum ctDNA as a clinical index
      to predict postoperative relapse.

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the common malignant tumors in China, withrelatively high incident
      rate and mortality among the population. 95% of the gastric cancer is adenocarcinoma. 70% of
      the patients at the early stage show no obvious symptom, and only small number of them has
      nausea, vomiting, or symptoms that are similar to the of peptic ulcer disease.

      Surgery is the conventional treatment option for early and middle stage gastric cancer, but
      postoperative relapse is the major issue. Currently, the only proven effective chemotherapies
      for gastric cancer are the taxane and platinum-based combination therapies. Also due to its
      molecular heterogeneity, the prognosis of gastric caner is highly varied among the patients.
      Therefore,there are not many effective targeting therapies available for the treatment of
      gastric cancer; and currently, trastuzumab and apatinib are the only two targeting drugs that
      have been clinically approved by CFDA.

      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is tumor-derived fragmented DNA with an average size of 166 bp,
      mixed with cell free DNA (cfDNA) of other sources in blood circulation (2, 3). Although the
      mechanisms of its release have not been fully addressed, most reports considered apoptosis
      and/or necrosis of tumor cells as its main sources, which makes it a genomic reservoir of
      different tumor clones (4). Also, as its half-life is up to hours, ctDNA is reflecting the
      most up-to-date status of tumor genome(5). Hence, it is considered as a new biomarker for
      tumor, which can be qualitative, quantitative and used for disease monitoring.

      By monitoring the serum ctDNA mutational profile using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), the
      present clinical trial aims to elucidate the correlation between the serum ctDNA status and
      the prognosis of patients with early and intermediate-stage gastric cancer upon surgical
      treatment, and explore the possibility of clinical utility of serum ctDNA as a clinical index
      to predict postoperative relapse. Moreover, by comparing the molecular profiles of patients
      with different prognosis, we may also screen out the molecular markers related to the
      prognosis of gastric cancer.

        This is a prospective clinical study collaborated with Geneseeq Technology Inc.200 of
        patients are planned. Total duration of the study is expected to be 2 years. The fresh
        tumor tissues/biopsies of each patient will be collected during the surgical treatment. The
        peripheral blood samples of each patient will be collected at the following time points: 1)
        prior to the surgical treatment; 2) 1 week after the surgical treatment; 3)every three
        months until disease progression or the end of the study. The collected fresh tumor
        tissues/biopsies or formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks/sections, and peripheral
        blood samples will be further subjected for NGS analysis and NGS-based ctDNA mutation
        profiling, respectively.
