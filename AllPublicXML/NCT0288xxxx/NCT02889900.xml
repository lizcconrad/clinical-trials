      This is an open label, single arm, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      the combination of cediranib and olaparib tablets in platinum-resistant relapsed high grade
      serous, high grade endometroid or clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal
      carcinoma patients who have received at least 3 prior lines of chemotherapy and who do not
      carry deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)
      mutations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit approximately 100 patients aged ≥18 years, with histologically proven
      diagnosis of platinum-resistant relapsed high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear
      cell ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have received at least 3
      prior lines of therapy, and who do not carry a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline
      BRCA mutation. All patients should have recurrent platinum resistant disease. The receipt of
      prior antiangiogenic treatment (e.g. bevacizumab) is optional. If used, it can be in the
      first line or recurrent setting. To be eligible to enter the study, all patients should have
      measurable disease (as assessed by the Investigator).

      There is no maximum duration for taking the study treatments (cediranib+olaparib). Patients
      should continue on study treatments until objective radiological disease progression, as
      defined by RECIST version 1.1 guidelines, or they meet other discontinuation criteria.
      Following discontinuation of study treatment patients will be followed for disease
      progression (if they have not already progressed), survival and post-progression anti cancer
      therapies until the data cut-off for the final OS analysis, approximately 12 months after
      enrolment of the last patient.
