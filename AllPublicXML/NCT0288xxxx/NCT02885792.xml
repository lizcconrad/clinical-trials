  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness associated with excess mortality and affecting
      nearly 1% of the population. The average life expectancy for patients diagnosed with
      schizophrenia has been 55-60 years through the last generations in Denmark, while the general
      population has over the same period of time experienced an increase in life expectancy. As a
      result, the standardized mortality rate for patients with schizophrenia has increased
      markedly over the last three decades and is currently a major public health concern. Causes
      of death are mainly cardiovascular disease and patients diagnosed with schizophrenia has a
      relative risk of cardiovascular disease that is about 2-fold higher than the general
      population.

      Little is known about severe progression of premature coronary arteriosclerosis in patients
      suffering from schizophrenia. Coronary artery calcium score is a well-defined measure to
      predict cardiovascular disease events, however there has not yet been any attempt to
      investigate whether there is an association between coronary artery calcium score and
      premature morbidity and mortality in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the progression of arteriosclerosis in patients
      with schizophrenia at different stages of the disease, and to offer and implement adequate
      treatment for these patients according to their somatic condition. This study will identify
      risk factors of somatic diseases in these patients, with specific focus on early diagnoses,
      prevention, intervention and treatment of arteriosclerosis in schizophrenic patients.

      The investigation is about the possibility of detecting any differences between developing
      arteriosclerosis in schizophrenia patients versus the general population, and how common risk
      factors are contributing to this process. The results of this study should provide important
      modifications in the clinical guidelines for treatment of patients diagnosed with
      schizophrenia.
