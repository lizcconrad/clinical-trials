      The newly developed CBT for ADHD inattentive-type (ADHD-I) protocol is tested for feasibility
      and acceptability in a pilot study with a single group design. The study also evaluates
      measurements and recruiting possibilities, and effects of the intervention. Research
      hypotheses include: 1. There is a basis for recruiting ADHD-I patients for participation in
      an RCT at psychiatric outpatient units, 2. The measurements in the study are feasible and
      reasonable in regards to patient characteristics; that is, the patients are responding to the
      questionnaires as intended, 3. The CBT for ADHD-I intervention is feasible in terms of
      treatment completion, compliance to home assignments, and credibility and relevance, and is
      lacking of or involves a tolerable degree of adverse effects, and 4. The CBT for ADHD-I
      protocol reduces core symptoms of ADHD-I as well as symptoms of stress, depression, and
      anxiety, and improves quality of life.
