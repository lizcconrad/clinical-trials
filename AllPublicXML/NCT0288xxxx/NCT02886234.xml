  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether phone-delivered mindfulness training is feasible and
      acceptable for persons living with HIV and whether it may help them improve adherence to
      medications and reduce risky sexual behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two-thirds of people living with HIV (PLWH) show sub-optimal adherence to antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) and one-third engages in risky sex. Both non-adherence and risky sex have been
      associated with emotional distress and impulsivity. In this trial, the investigators will
      examine the utility of phone-delivered mindfulness training (MT) for PWLH. The primary
      outcomes comprise feasibility and acceptability of phone-delivery; secondary outcomes are
      estimates of efficacy of MT on adherence to ART and safer sexual practices as well as on
      their hypothesized antecedents.

      Fifty participants will be enrolled in this parallel-group randomized clinical trial (RCT).
      Outpatients recruited from an HIV treatment clinic will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to either
      MT or to health coaching intervention; both interventions will be administered during 8
      weekly phone calls. ART adherence (self-reported measure and unannounced phone pill counts),
      sexual behavior (self-reports and biomarkers), mindfulness, depression, stress, and
      impulsivity will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months post-intervention.
