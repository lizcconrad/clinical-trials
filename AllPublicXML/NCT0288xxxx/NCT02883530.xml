      The Investigators hypothesise that asthma is not a single disease, but a syndrome resulting
      from several distinct underlying disease processes known as endotypes. There are
      approximately 30,000 genes in humans, and each gene is responsible for the production of a
      particular protein. Using a technique called &quot;whole genome expression profiling&quot; The
      Investigators have undertaken a small study looking at the activity of all 30,000 genes in
      the airway tissue of people with asthma. This work has identified 3 mutually exclusive
      distinct molecular patterns (endotypes) of severe asthma and has identified other potentially
      important molecular targets (manuscripts in preparation). In particular,the Investigators
      have found that 25-50% of patients have asthma associated with the activity of proteins
      called Th2 cytokines (Th2-high asthma). New treatments are in development that target this
      pathway. However, the Investigators do not know what is driving severe asthma in patients who
      do not express these Th2 cytokines. The aim of this study is to investigate in more detail
      the molecular mechanisms driving severe asthma in patients who do not express Th2 cytokines
      (Th2-low asthma), so that the Investigators can identify new targets for treatment in this
      group. To do this the Investigators will collect airway tissue via a telescope
      (bronchoscope), and analyse gene and protein expression in the tissue. The Investigators will
      then compare the molecular activity between patients with Th2-high and Th2-low asthma, and
      healthy control subjects (data obtained from a parallel study).

      Asthma is a very common disorder which causes a great deal of distress for patients, and
      occasionally results in premature death. Approximately 10% of people with asthma have severe
      disease which is not helped by current treatments; The Investigators need to find new
      treatments for these patients urgently. Patients with asthma are not all the same, but have
      distinct features which characterise their asthma.The Investigators therefore hypothesise
      that asthma is not a single disease, but a syndrome resulting from several distinct
      underlying disease processes known as endotypes. There are approximately 30,000 genes in
      humans, and each gene is responsible for the production of a particular protein. Using a
      technique called &quot;whole genome expression profiling&quot; The Investigators have undertaken a
      small study looking at the activity of all 30,000 genes in the airway tissue of people with
      asthma. This work has identified 3 mutually exclusive distinct molecular patterns (endotypes)
      of severe asthma and has identified other potentially important molecular targets
      (manuscripts in preparation).

      In particular, the Investigators have found that 25-50% of patients have asthma associated

      severe asthma in patients who do not express these Th2 cytokines. The aim of this study is to
      investigate in more detail the molecular mechanisms driving severe asthma in patients who do

    <description>Flexible bronchoscopy will be performed under conscious sedation (with premedication using a mild sedative such as 1−2.5 mg IV midazolam) followed by use of topical anaesthesia (lidocaine spray) on the throat, vocal cords, and trachea in order to investigate the airways. The procedure allows sampling of the airway tissue to allow for laboratory analysis. Three brushings of a small area of the epithelial surface of an airway will be performed via a specialised channel of the bronchoscope with the use of a sterile cytology brush and up to eight 2-mm endobronchial biopsies.</description>
