      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for Smoldering
      Multiple Myeloma.

      The following intervention will be involved in this study:

        -  Lenalidomide

        -  Durvalumab

        -  PVX-410

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.
      Smoldering Multiple Myeloma is an early precursor to a rare blood cancer known as Multiple
      Myeloma, which affects plasma cells.

      The vaccine in Combination with Lenalidomide is being used to hopefully provide immunity
      against Myeloma. Durvalumab is a check point inhibitor which is being combined here to
      further augment the immune activity of the vaccine. It is a monoclonal antibody known to take
      the brakes off the immune system to restore immunity. Lenalidomide in previously studied
      trials has demonstrated an increase in immune activity. It is the hope of the investigators
      the combination of the vaccine, Lenalidomide, and Durvalumab will augment immunity even
      further.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved PVX-410 as a treatment for
      any disease.Durvalumab is also not approved for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma.
