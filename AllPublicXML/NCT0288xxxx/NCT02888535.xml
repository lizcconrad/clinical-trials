    <textblock>
      Primary immune deficiencies (PID) are characterized by a failure of the immune system that is
      not explained by any infectious, neoplastic, or iatrogenic cause. In 2015, more than 300
      different inherited rare disorders were described. The occurrence of PID in adult is rare and
      diagnosis may be supported by the 6 ESID signs for adult. However these warnings signs are
      based only on expert recommendations and do not include comprehensive symptoms of PIDs.
      Recurrent infections, more aggressive, are the most common mode of revelation of the PID.
      Less frequently, autoimmune manifestation, solid tumor, lymphoproliferation tumor, chronic
      granulomatosis or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (HLS) may also revealed a PID.
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of unknown PID in adult admitted
      in critical care unit and to determinate if the investigation of PID in patients with severe
      infections or HLS should be routinely performed in MCIU.

    <description>A consultation in the Internal Medicine department is schduled 3 months after the hospitalization in intensive care unit to investigate an immune deficiency. This consultation consit on a physical examination and a immune testing. Immune testing included but is not limited to :
Complete blood count, blood smear Immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype and IgG sub class quantitation (gram per litre) Quantitative serum complement (C3 (milligram per litre), C4 (milligram per litre), CH50 (%) and AP50 when Neisseria meningitides infection) Extensive immunophenotyping of T, B, and natural killer cells (cells/mm3) Specific antibody response to a variety of vaccine (milligram/litre) HIV serology Body computed tomography (CT) scan Lymphocytes, macrophage functional assays or genetic assay when necessary The outcome measure is the number of participants with abnormal laboratory or radiology values leading to primary immune deficiency diagnosis</description>
