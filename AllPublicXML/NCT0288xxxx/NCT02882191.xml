      Study Design:

      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label, Phase II clinical study

      Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled at about 14 centers in the US.

      Study Population: Pre-menopausal women ages 18 - 40, at risk for pregnancy, who are
      interested in using only this intrauterine contraceptive for birth control will be eligible
      for this study. Subjects must provide written informed consent and meet the study subject
      selection criteria without any exclusions as outlined in the Clinical Investigation Plan
      (CIP).

      Primary Effectiveness Outcome:

      The primary outcome measure is effectiveness, evaluated as the absence of pregnancy during
      LevoCept use.

      Safety and other outcome measures include:

      Study Device Placement:

        -  Ease of placement

        -  Placement success

      Safety:

        -  Serious Adverse Events

        -  Adverse Events

      Tolerability:

        -  Bleeding and spotting patterns

        -  Discontinuation rate and reasons for discontinuation

             additional 25 subjects aged 36-40 (for safety only) (note: all subjects will be
             included in the analysis for device placement and tolerability);

             insertion date or is planning participation in another clinical trial with an
             investigational agent within 52 weeks (visit 6) after insertion.
