      The goal of the study is to investigate whether adding different doses of sulforaphane will
      benefit the clinical symptoms and cognitive function in individuals who have schizophrenia.

      This study will compare the sulforaphane with placebo. There is a thirty percent change (less
      than half) of receiving the placebo. The purpose of including placebo is to judge if the
      outcome is related to the study medication rather than other reasons.

      This study will be carried out in six mental health institutes in China and total of 180
      patients with first-episode or early onset schizophrenia will be enrolled into the study. The
      mental health institute at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University.

      Individuals who participate in the study will be followed for 24 weeks. The changes in
      clinical symptoms and neurocognitive function will be assessed from baseline (week-2) to
      week-6 (acute phase), and week-12 to week-24 (maintenance phase).
