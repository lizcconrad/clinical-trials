  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize adult subjects regarding their history of
      allergy and asthma, clinical manifestations of asthma, and exposures and conditions that may
      influence asthma severity and control. Assessments include baseline medical history, lung
      function tests, questionnaires and collection of specimens for phenotypic characterization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, two-visit study in which approximately 200 subjects
      will be enrolled, including healthy controls, atopic controls without asthma, and patients
      with stable asthma (n = 150). Among asthmatics, 2/3 will be on regular inhaled corticosteroid
      therapy and 1/3 will not be taking inhaled corticosteroids. Subjects who meet study criteria
      will undergo phenotypic characterization in multiple domains, including evaluation of lung
      function, assessments of asthma/allergy history, asthma triggers, asthma symptom control,
      environmental microbial exposures and dietary intake. Oral rinse, sputum, stool, urine and
      blood specimens will be collected for microbiome-related analyses, including molecular and
      culture-based assays, metabolite studies, and to relate these to markers of inflammation and
      immune function. The overall goal is to enroll a cohort of well-characterized asthmatic and
      non-asthmatic control subjects to enable mechanism-oriented studies of how members of the
      airway microbiota and possibly also gut microbiota influence phenotypes of adult asthma.

        1. For all subjects:

             Inclusion criteria:
