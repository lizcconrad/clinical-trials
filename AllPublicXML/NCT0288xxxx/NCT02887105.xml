  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine the relationship between anxiety and cognitive performances in
      patients with acute and chronic phases of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Data from
      neuropsychological assessment concerning cognitive processes (working and episodic memory)
      sensitive to different dimensions of anxiety will be analyzed.

      The secondary purpose is to evaluate how some neurological (hemispherical lateralization of
      lesions), psychological (depression) and demographic (quality of life) variables can increase
      the effects of different dimensions of anxiety on cognitive processes, during the acute
      and/or chronic phase of CVA.

      Data will be collected during usual neuropsychological evaluation and cerebral imagery
      examination (NIHSS, Rankin scale) of patients in acute (0-1 month) and chronic (6 months)
      phases of CVA.
