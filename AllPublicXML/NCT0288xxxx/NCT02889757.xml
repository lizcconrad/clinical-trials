  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal studies have shown that INH-RIF-induced oxidative injury can be prevented by
      supporting the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). However,
      there are few published data and large sample sizes regarding the protective effect of NAC
      against hepatotoxicty induced by anti-TB drugs in humans, to our knowledge.

      Therefore, the investigators designed a clinical trial with the aim to see whether NAC could
      protect against anti-TB drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA), the first-line drugs used for
      tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy, are associated with hepatotoxicity. A high rate of
      hepatotoxicity has been reported in some developing countries compared with advanced
      countries with a similar dose schedule. Sharifzadeh et al. reported an incidence of 27.7% in
      Iran. The reasons for this higher rate of hepatotoxicity are not completely clear. Ethnic
      variations, advanced age, female sex, alcoholism, underlying liver disease, acetylator
      phenotype, hepatitis B and C virus, HIV infection, extensive pulmonary parenchymal disease,
      and hypoalbuminemia have been observed to be the risk factors for the development of
      drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH) because of anti-TB treatment.

      The mechanism of DIH induced by anti-TB treatment is not yet fully understood. Sodhi et al.
      proposed oxidative stress as one of the likely mechanisms for INH-RIF-induced hepatic injury.
      It is well established that by augmenting a cellular antioxidative defense system, especially
      nonprotein thiols, that is, glutathione (GSH), cells can be protected against oxidative
      injuries produced by various drugs and chemicals.

      The study will be performed with randomized trial for assessment and protective effects over
      liver function in patients receiving anti-TB agents and using NAC.
