    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, 24 weeks, and investigator-initiated
      clinical trial to assess the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on liver function abnormality
      and the trough level change after conversion to Advagraf速 in liver transplant recipients.

      All subjects who are liver transplant recipients taking Tacrolimus bid and adaptable to be
      registered for the study will be classified by expressive or non-expressive CYP3A5
      polymorphism genotype and Advagraf速 will be administered same dose as Tacrolimus bid der day
      in 24 weeks.

      All subjects should check whether being registered in the hospital based on CYP3A5
      polymorphism genotype during screening visit. Registered subjects will visit seven times to
      the hospital during the study which includes screening visit and adverse reaction, acute
      rejection, and trough level will be tested during this period. Subjects who are additionally
      agreed for PK study will be hospitalized with the state of Tacrolimus bid therapy one day ago
      before taking IP. On the first day of hospitalization, his/her blood will be collected. At
      week 1 (plus seven days) after conversion to Advagraf速, his/her blood will be collected for
      PK analysis.
