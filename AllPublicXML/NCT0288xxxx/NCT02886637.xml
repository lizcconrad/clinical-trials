      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effects of immune function on prognositic
      outcome in critical ill patients with Acinetobacter baumannii infection.

      This is a single-center, observational study. Patients with Acinetobacter baumannii infection
      in the intensive care unit of Zhongda Hospital were enrolled. We recorded the data of age,
      ICU admission diagnosis, underlying diseases, APACHE II score and infection site. Body
      temperature, heart rate, white blood cell counts, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, SOFA
      score and the level of CD4+, CD8+, Th1, Th2 and HLA-DR in the blood measured by flow
      cytometry on the D1, D3 and D7 were also recorded.We can get the results of the change of
      immune function of critical ill patients after Acinetobacter baumannii infection. After
      compare the patients who die of survive at 28 day after infection, we can get the results of
      the relationship between the immune function and the outcome. We also can calculate the
      effect immune function on prognositic mortality in patients with Acinetobacter baumannii
      infection.
