  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine
      protein kinase that controls growth and metabolism. In mammals (including humans), mammalian
      TOR complex 2(mTORC2) contains mammalian TOR (mTOR), RICTOR, mSIN1 protein, and mLST8 gene.
      In an animal model, the adipose-specific rictor knockout (AdRiKO) mouse, systemic insulin
      resistance, hepatic steatosis, and cardiovascular dysfunction develop upon high fat diet
      (HFD)-induced obesity or aging. To find a molecular link between adipose mTORC2 and systemic
      insulin resistance, investigators have already performed transcriptomics and proteomics
      analysis on visceral white adipose tissue in a mouse model. The aim of the study is to
      confirm a molecular link between adipose mTORC2 and systemic insulin resistance in humans.
