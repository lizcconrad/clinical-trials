  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical Site Complications (SSC's) are responsible for increased morbidity in patients
      undergoing surgery resulting in prolonged length of stay in the hospital while increasing
      treatment and hospital costs dramatically. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) use on
      closed incisions has been reported in the literature to reduce SSC's including Surgical Site
      Infections (SSI's), with many promising studies in general surgery, including some studies
      using single use NPWT. However, to date, there are very few randomised controlled trials
      (RCT's) using this intervention. When using PICOTM (NPWT) for this indication, patients may
      be discharged from hospital earlier, with the negative pressure incision management in place.
      This has implications in terms of cost savings for the health care system and enables the
      patient to be able to return to their normal daily routine more quickly. The hypothesis of
      this study is that PICO NPWT will reduce frequency of SSC's, in a 30 day follow up period, as
      compared to standard care in patients undergoing colorectal procedures.

    <description>PICO is a Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) System consisting of a small portable pump, 2 lithium batteries, 2 dressings and fixation strips. The system is capable of delivering up to 80 mm Hg negative pressure to a wound or surgical incision site and managing low to moderate levels of exudate or fluid generated by the wound or incision. The therapy may be administered for up to 2 weeks.</description>
