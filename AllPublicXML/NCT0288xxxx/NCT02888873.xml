  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, prospective clinical study was to compare the clinical
      performance of a universal light-curing, ultra-fine particle hybrid composite with a new
      version of this product produced by the same manufacturer in Class 1 and Class 2 lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 80 (13 Class 1 and 67 Class 2) lesions in 40 patients (21 females, 19 males) with
      ages ranging between 18-38 years (23.15±5.15) were either restored with Charisma or Charisma
      Classic (Heraeus Kulzer) in combination with an etch and rinse adhesive system (Gluma 2 Bond)
      under rubber dam isolation by two experienced operators according to the manufacturer's
      instructions. Two independent examiners, who were blinded to the composites used evaluated
      the restorations according to the FDI (World Dental Federation) criteria. Bite-wing
      radiographs and intraoral digital photographs were taken before and after treatment and at 6
      months. The statistical analyses were carried out with McNemar, Pearson Chi-square and
      Cochran Q tests (p&lt;0.05).

    <description>The surfaces were etched using 35% phosphoric acid for 30 s. The etched surfaces were rinsed and dried. Charisma was used in combination Gluma2 Bond etch&amp;rinse adhesive. The composite resin restorations were light-cured (600 milliwatt/cm²). Occlusion was checked with thin articulating papers.
Restoration surfaces were finished and polished with fine finishing diamond burs, stones and rubber cups.</description>
