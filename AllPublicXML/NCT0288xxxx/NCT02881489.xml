  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative disorders,
      affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord.
      Hence, the signs of damage motor neurons are both at the peripheral (eg. atrophy), and
      central (eg. spasticity) level. There is no effective treatment for ALS and the majority of
      patients die within 5 years after diagnosis, usually due to respiratory failure. Numerous
      studies on murine models revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) successfully improve the
      clinical and pathological features of ALS. The goal of this nonrandomized, open label study
      is to investigate the safety and tolerability of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
      stem cell transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
      This clinical trial is conducted to test the therapeutic (neuroprotective and paracrine)
      effect of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). All patients
      enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study enrollment. Patients
      are recruited for a clinical trial not longer than 1 year from disease diagnosis. Then,
      patients are divided into two groups: Group I - patients receiving intrathecally one
      application of BM-MSCs and Group II - patients receiving intrathecally three applications
      (each administration every two months) of BM-MSCs. Subsequently, autologous bone
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation to the cerebrospinal fluid at the site
      of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and
      exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital capacity
      (FVC) and functional rating scale (FRS) to establish ALS progression rate will be recorded
      throughout the duration and in the post-treatment follow up period.
