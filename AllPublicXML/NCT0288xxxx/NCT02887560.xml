  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the early adaptation of the right ventricle assessed by
      echocardiography to change of pulmonary circulation secondary to pulmonary transplantation.

      Secondary objectives include change of haemodynamics measured by transpulmonary
      thermodilution and evolution of right heart function in terms of primary graft dysfunction
      grading.
