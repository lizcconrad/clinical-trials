  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients seen in the ED with either a laceration, minor head injury, or urinary tract
      infection will be randomized to one of two groups. Both groups will receive the standard
      written discharge instructions; in addition, one group will watch video discharge
      instructions. Each patient will be asked to complete a short survey with questions related to
      the discharge instructions received in the ED, and will be called 5-7 days after the ED visit
      to ask questions about discharge instructions and the ED visit.

      Patients will be enrolled in the study at George Washington University Hospital's Emergency
      Department. Patients who consent will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; (1) standard
      Written Discharge Instructions from the nursing staff (2) standard Written Discharge
      Instructions from the nursing staff AND watching the Video Discharge Instructions on a
      tablet. Subjects will complete a survey after they have received their discharge instructions
      and before leaving the ER. Several (5-7) days after leaving the Emergency Department,
      subjects will receive a phone call from one of the investigators staff members asking 2-3
      questions about their ED visit and how they treated the condition at home. The survey
      questions at discharge and at follow-up will pertain to how to care for the condition and
      will be based on the discharge instructions. The study is designed to determine if patients
      retain health information more accurately if they watch a video in addition to being given
      written information. A total sample size of 200 participants will be recruited. Enrollment
      for this study will begin June of 2016 and will continue until the investigators have enough
      participants. The data analyst will be blinded to treatment assignment when analyzing the
      data.
