  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose for the trial is intended to evaluate safety and effectiveness of an oxyhydrogen
      generator with nebulizer in an adjuvant therapy for patients with severe asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oxyhydrogen generator with nebulizer in (treatment group) or control group was applied
      randomly for the patients with severe asthma in this study, then the therapeutic effects from
      both treatment and control groups were analyzed and evaluated to verify its safety and
      effectiveness.This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind study. Each patient was
      expected to participate in the trial for 104±3 day.The screening period was 14±1 days, and
      the subjects would continue to be applied with the previous asthma treatment scheme. The
      primary objective was to collect the baseline data related to the subjects.The patients would
      receive 30±1 day of treatment with the product; after that, observation of 60±1 days was
      required.Total patients number is 150 cases, of which 75 cases are treatment group and the
      others are control group.All cases respectively are distributed in 5 clinical hospitals.

             clinical diagnosis by the respirologist based on the international standards
             (GINA2012).There was the support of one of the following objective evidences in
             screening and treatment or five years before the treatment:

               -  It was the positive reaction in the methacholine provocative test (for the
                  patients not applied with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) were required at
                  PC20&lt;8mg/mL and PD20&lt;0.7mg; for the patients applied with ICS were required at
                  PC20&lt;16mg/mL or PD20&lt;1.4mg);

                    -  The airway reversibility test, with a positive reaction, was defined
                       asΔFEV1.0% at a basis FEV1.0≥200mL at 30 minutes after 400μgsalbutamol
                       aerosol (mist-storing bottle might be used deliberately) was inhaled; ③ The
                       peak expiratory flow (PEF) aberration rate&gt;20% (that is, the difference or
                       average value of maximum and minimum PEFs times 100); it was measured for
                       seven days successively;

                            of treatment (e.g. four weeks) (defined as ΔFEV1.0 and its absolute
                            value≥200mL);

          3. According with severe asthma diagnosis: The drug therapy was required for Level-4 and
             5 asthma according to GINA Guide in the past year (The large dose of ICS combined LABA
             or leukotriene modifier/theophyline), or the systemic corticosteroid treatment lasted
             at ≥50% of the time to prevent from the &quot;uncontrollable&quot; asthma; or the
             &quot;uncontrollable&quot; asthma still occurred even if in above treatment. The uncontrollable
             asthma should meet one of the following requirements at least:

               -  Symptom control difference: ACQ&gt;1.5, and ACT&lt;20 (or &quot;Non-good control&quot; in GINA
                  Guide);

                    -  Frequent severe attack: Receiving systemic corticosteroid treatment for more
                       than twice in the past year (over three days each time); ③ Serious attack:
                       Hospitalizing once in ICU or mechanical ventilation at least in the past
                       year; ④ Airway limitation: After bronchodilator was stopped properly,
                       FEVl.0%&lt;80% (FEV/FVC decreased to be less than lower limit of the normal
                       value). The controlled asthma deteriorated at the decrement of above large
                       dose ICS or systemic corticosteroid (or combined biologic agent);

          4. The subjects or their legal agents could understand the trial objectives,
             demonstrating the compliance to the trail scheme, and signed the Informed Consent
             Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subjects at a body mass index＞38kg/m2, or a weight＜40kg;

          2. The subjects' smoking amount&gt;10 packages times the year number (e.g. number of
             cigarettes × the number of years for smoking/20);

          3. Based on clinical interview, experience or screening inspection results, the subjects
             should participate in this trial improperly if the doctor responsible for the trial
             believed there was risk when they participated in the trial, or the research results
             were affected;

          4. The subjects who had the recreational drug abuse history or other allergic history,
             but the doctor responsible for the trial believed these subjects limited by the
             history could participated in the trial;

          5. The women subjects who were in the pregnancy or suckling period, or six weeks at least
             after delivery, or stopped breastfeeding for six weeks. If the women subjects were
             found to be pregnant in receiving one inspection, then, the inspection data for this
             item should be rejected in analysis;

          6. The subjects ever participated in the study on a new drug or any other drugs, and were
             within 3 months for the first administration, or every participated in one research
             involved in invasive operation within 3 months. Any research evaluation should be put
             off to three months later in the first administration or invasive operation when they
             participated in the research. It was approved by the steering committee if the
             subjects participating in other researches were included in trial groups or continued
             participating in this research;

          7. The investigator believed the subjects showed the risk of non-compliance with research
             procedures;

          8. The subjects had the mental disease history resulting in loss of active ability in the
             recent period;

          9. The following disease history or evidences demonstrated within two weeks in baseline
             assessment that the subjects suffered upper or lower respiratory infections or related
             symptoms (including common cold) (the assessment should be put off);

         10. The subject changed the asthmatic drugs within four weeks before the screening;

         11. The subject suffered the asthma attack in the month prior (administered with systemic
             corticosteroid or temporarily increasing oral corticosteroid at three days of stable
             base dose at least);

         12. Other important diagnoses possibly similar to asthma or complicated asthma, especially
             respiratory dysfunction, panic attack and evident social psychological problems (if
             these diagnoses were seen as the patient's main symptoms rather than the symptoms
             except severe asthma);

         13. Other severe primary pulmonary diseases, especially pulmonary embolism, pulmonary
             hypertension, interstitial pulmonary disease and lung cancer;

         14. The subjects with emphysema and bronchiectasis should be excluded only when these
             diagnoses are considered as their main symptoms rather than other symptoms except
             severe asthma;

         15. The subjects who were diagnosed with other chronic inflammatory diseases (inflammatory
             bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis) except asthma.
