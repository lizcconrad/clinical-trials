      A single-center feasibility study performed in patients undergoing a planned cardiac
      catheterization. This study investigated the feasibility of the NeuroTronik CANS Therapyâ„¢
      System to improve acute hemodynamics. Purpose-built stimulation catheters were percutaneously
      inserted into an upper venous structure near the heart via right femoral vein and or left
      subclavian vein access using standard introducers and techniques. Subjects were instrumented
      with left ventricular and femoral artery catheters for pressure measurement and stimulated
      for approximately 60 minutes. Baseline hemodynamic measures were collected before stimulation
      and compared to measured values during stimulation. Following completion of the protocol, all
      in-dwelling equipment and catheters were removed.
