      IMCgp100-401 is a rollover study that is designed to provide continued access to IMCgp100 for
      eligible patients with advanced melanoma who have previously participated in an IMCgp100
      study (parent study). Parent studies that are eligible for patients to continue to receive
      IMCgp100 in this rollover study must have completed and satisfied its primary endpoints or
      have been terminated by the Sponsor for reasons other than safety.

      Eligible patients will have tolerated IMCgp100 for a minimum of 4 weeks of dosing without
      significant toxicities that would preclude further dosing in the opinion of the principal
      investigator or Sponsor.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is currently participating in an Immunocore-sponsored study of IMCgp100 and is
             actively receiving IMCgp100. Patient must have fulfilled all required assessments in
             the parent study (unless the study is being terminated)

          2. Patient is currently receiving clinical benefit from the treatment with IMCgp100, as
             determined by the principal investigator from the parent study

          3. Patient has demonstrated compliance with the parent study requirements, as assessed by
             the principal investigator and patient is able to comply with the necessary visits and
             assessments as part of the rollover study

          4. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to enrolling in the rollover study and
             receiving the study treatment. If consent cannot be expressed in writing, then the
             consent must be formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted
             witness

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from any IMCgp100 study or from IMCgp100
             treatment in the parent study due to unequivocal progressive disease, unacceptable
             toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures, withdrawal of consent, or any other
             reason

          2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin laboratory test

          3. Women of child-bearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male
             partner, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless
             they are using 2 methods of highly effective contraception from Screening, and must
             agree to continue using such precautions for 6 months after the final dose of
             investigational product; cessation of birth control after this point should be
             discussed with a responsible physician. Highly effective methods include barrier
             methods, intrauterine devices or hormonal methods. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm
             method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Women
             of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.
             Otherwise, female patients must be post-menopausal (no menstrual period for at least
             12 months prior to Screening), or surgically sterile

          4. Male patients who are not surgically sterile unless they are using a double barrier
             contraception method from enrollment through treatment and for 6 months following
             administration of the last dose of study drug
