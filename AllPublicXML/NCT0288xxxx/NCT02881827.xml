      The purpose of this study is to obtain experimental data on the possible changes that saliva
      may suffer when brought to low-level laser therapy protocols for analgesia in the masseter
      muscle, because this be on the Parotid salivary gland.

      Climate: The study will be conduced by Lasertherapy and Photobiology Center (CELAFO) at the
      Institute of Research and Development at the University of Vale do Paraíba (UNIVAP), which
      was air-conditioned with temperature at 22 ° C.

      Volunteers: 30 male volunteers aged between 18 and 30 years.

      Flow Analysis Salivary pH and saliva buffer capacity before LLLT and after LLLT: Two
      consecutive samples of whole saliva were obtained from each second volunteer. The first,
      unstimulated total saliva (UTS) and the second of stimulated total saliva (STS). Obtaining
      mechanically given by chewing a paraffin 5cm² fragment. The gathering was held in the
      afternoon and with the patient in breakfast for at least one hour. All the volunteers were
      instructed not to brush teeth or use mouthwash for one hour prior to saliva collection of the
      experiment. The samples were collected UTS and STS requesting voluntary saliva deposited
      directly into a sterile universal collector. Salivary samples were compared by the universal
      table salivary flow described by Saliva samples were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 minutes.
      All saliva volume produced during the 5-minute period was measured using test tubes recorded
      in milliliters. The pH was measured by a pH meter device. To test the buffer capacity, the
      saliva (3 mL) was placed in a Falcon tube containing 9 mL of 0,005 normal hydrochloric acid,
      subjected to manual shaking for 10 seconds, then maintained at rest for 10 minutes with open
      Falcon tube, aiming evaporation gases such as carbon dioxide which could interfere with the
      analysis. After 10 minutes the pH was measured with litmus tape aid compared with the color
      scale provided by the manufacturer.

      Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT): The investigators used the LLLT after the first collection of
      saliva, control therapies were applied, placebo LLLT red and LLLT in the infrared.The
      treatment was applied with an interval of 7 days in a randomized, controlled, double-blind,
      by drawing lots. Irradiation of LLLT was conducted in eight (8) points on the skin in the
      masseter region. The distance between points was 1cm. To know exactly the location of points,
      transparency sheets were used (irradiation feedback) and reference points of each volunteer,
      as follows: point 1 commissure eyelid, point 2 in the tragus of the ear and point 3 on the
      labial commissure.The anticipated period of 15 minutes to occur the desired effects of LLLT
      was performed new material collection.

      Data Analysis: The salivary flow data, pH and buffering capacity of saliva was analyzed using
      a analysis program statistics with the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. The significance
      level was 5% (p &lt;0.05)

    <description>A scientific control group allows the experimental study of a variable at a time, and is a vital part of the scientific method. In a controlled experiment, two identical experiments are conducted. In one, the treatment - tested factor - is applied. In another - control - the tested factor is not applied
For example, when testing a drug, it is important to carefully check the suspected drug effects are produced by the drug. Doctors can it with a double-blind study in a clinical trial: two ( statistically ) identical groups of patients are compared, one gets the drug and the other receives a placebo. Neither subjects nor investigators know which group receives the actual drug , which serves to prevent bias and isolating effects of such drugs.</description>

    <description>Supported by the physical phenomenon of stimulated emission postulated by Albert Einstein in 1916 the laser (light amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a device consisting of solid source materials, liquid or gas that produces beams of light when excited by a source of energy. This bright feature is a particular type of electromagnetic radiation, which differs from that emitted by conventional incandescent sources. These are the effects attributable to LLLT analgesic, anti-inflammatory and biostimulates and has been widely used due to low power densities and wavelengths with a penetration capacity in tissues without the generation of photothermal effects, which makes its feasible use multiple applications in Health area.</description>
