  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most immunodeficiencies are related to severe immunoglobulin deficiencies which require
      lifelong replacement therapy with immunoglobulin G (IgG) to reduce the incidence and severity
      of infections. IgG can be administered intravenously (IGIV) every 21 or 28 days or
      subcutaneously every week or every other week (IGSC) for subjects who do not tolerate IV
      infusions or have difficulties with venous access. No head-to-head data are available to
      directly compare HyQvia with conventional SCIG. However, SCIG is indicated for administration
      frequencies from daily up to every other week dosing while HyQvia is indicated for infusion
      frequencies every 2-4 weeks. This study is designed to assess the IgG trough level after
      switching from standard SCIG to every other week HyQvia and HyQvia every 3-4 weeks

      Open-label, one arm study conducted in France in subjects with PI to IgG trough level at
      steady state after standard SCIG dosing and after HyQvia administered every other week and
      every 3-4 weeks at equivalent dose. The study will have three periods:

        -  The first period is a one-week ramp-up period. The first administration of HyQvia will
           be with a one-week dose as specified in the summary of product characteristics of
           HyQvia.

        -  During the first three-month follow-up period, HyQvia will be administered, every other
           week at a dose equivalent to the dose administered with the previous treatment (standard
           SCIG).

        -  At the end of this first follow-up period, the dose of HyQvia will be increased for the
           next infusion to reach a 3-week equivalent dose. If it this volume is well tolerated,
           the following dosing will be a 4-week equivalent dose. HyQvia will then be administered
           every 3 or 4 weeks for three months.
