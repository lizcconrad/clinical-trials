  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study funded by the National Institute of Health. The rationale for the need of
      this research is the lack of any well proven risk-reducing intervention that may decrease the
      morbidity of lung cancer resection in patients with COPD or that may improve their quality of
      life trajectory, a meaningful outcome in the overall disease progression. The proposed
      intervention is unique as it combines exercise and behavioral interventions that were pilot
      tested in a randomized single-blinded controlled design in the proposed population and proved
      feasible and potentially effective. The aim is to test the effect of the proposed
      rehabilitation on length of stay, pulmonary complications and quality of life trajectory.

      Prospectively, 194 patients will be randomized to either ten sessions of preoperative
      pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) vs. standard care at a number of healthcare centers throughout
      the United States. This study will be open for 36 months. Randomization will be stratified by
      three variables: very severe lung function (yes vs. no), prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for
      this operation (yes vs. no) and open thoracotomy vs. video assisted thoracoscopy. The primary
      and secondary objectives are provided below.

      Primary Objective:

      To prospectively determine the effect of 10 sessions of customized preoperative PR on the
      length of hospital stay in patients that undergo a lung cancer resection and have COPD
      compared to a matched control group. Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR
      will significantly reduce the length of hospital stay.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To prospectively determine the effect of 10 sessions of customized preoperative PR on
           the number of postoperative complications in patients that undergo a lung cancer
           resection and have COPD compared to a matched control group.

             -  Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR will significantly reduce
                the number of postoperative pulmonary complications.

        2. To prospectively determine the effect of a 10-session preoperative PR on the trajectory
           of quality of life at 3 and 6 months after the curative resection compared to a matched
           control group.

             -  Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR will significantly and
                meaningfully (more than the minimal clinically important difference) improve
                quality of life after surgery compared to a control group.

      Patients will be followed at 3 and 6 months post-surgery.

    <description>Patients will receive 10 in-clinic sessions of preoperative Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) two weeks prior to surgery. Patients will receive a Participant Manual demonstrating and explaining the rehabilitation process. Patients will also receive a log for recording their efforts and notes for every day until the day of surgery. A video recording of the intervention from start to finish will be provided to all patients. The video recording should be played in all 10 sessions at the registering site. The PR sessions will include breathing awareness, upper and lower extremity exercise, instructions for inspiratory muscle training using the PFlex valve, practice at home and goal setting. Patients undergo surgery and will be followed until 6 months following surgery. Patients complete follow up questionnaires at 3 and 6 months after discharge.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a pedometer to monitor their daily steps and a pamphlet with exercises plus the standard course of care for patients undergoing lung resection surgery. The patients will not be asked to return the pedometer. The local institutional coordinator will go over the use of the pedometer and the exercise materials with the patient. The patients will be asked to keep a log of their pre-operative steps and mail the log to the registering site. Patients undergo surgery and will be followed until 6 months following surgery. Patients complete follow up questionnaires at 3 and 6 months after discharge.</description>
