  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incidental pancreatic solid or cystic lesions are diagnosed with increased frequency due to
      the widespread use of abdominal cross-sectional imaging to investigate unrelated symptoms.
      Lesions such as neuroendocrine tumors (NET), mucinous cystadenomas and intraductal papillary
      mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) have the potential of malignant transformation. The standard
      treatment of solid or cystic pancreatic lesions with malignant potential has been surgical
      resection, with lesions in the pancreatic head requiring a Whipple resection whereas
      pancreatic tail lesions are treated with distal pancreatectomy. Both types of resection carry
      significant morbidity and mortality. The study would like to outline the feasibility, safety,
      adverse events and early results of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) - radiofrequency ablation
      (RFA) in pancreatic neoplasms.

      The intervention described was radiofrequency ablation which was applied with an innovative
      monopolar radiofrequency probe (1.2 mm Habib EUS-RFA catheter) placed through a 19 or 22
      gauge fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle once FNA was performed in patients with a tumor in
      the head of the pancreas. The device had been certificated by the European Union (EU) and
      received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2015. The endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
      - radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a 1 Fr wire with a working length of 190 cm, which can be
      inserted through the biopsy channel of a EUS. RF power is applied to the electrode at the end
      of the wire to coagulate tissue in the liver and pancreas. In this study, the investigators
      will enroll 20 patients to receiving EUS-RFA of pancreatic neoplasms with the monopolar RF
      probe. The follow-up period will be one year with regular monitoring. Our primary endpoint
      will be to evaluate pancreatic tumor ablation effect, Secondary objectives will be to
      evaluate the mortality and morbidity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for this
             study:

               1. Cystic neoplasms in pancreatic parenchyma or outer portion of the pancreas are
                  defined by radiologists who evaluate the images more than twice in three months.
                  The size of benign cystic neoplasm is between 0.5-3 cm. Or surgical specialist
                  physician considers the benign tumor that larger than 3 cm is not suitable for
                  surgery or patients unwilling to accept surgery.

               2. Normal physical condition. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-2
                  and American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score ≤ 3.
