  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last ten years patient safety during routine surgical interventions has increased;
      however as there is an increase in the number of specialized surgical interventions and high
      risk patients like elderly and emergency patients, the incidence of perioperative cardiac
      arrest has not reduced but remains fixed. The incidence of perioperative cardiac arrest
      varies from 4.3-34.6 for each 10,000 procedures. However as in a lot of other countries exact
      data are lacking also for Turkey. With this study the investigators want to start collecting
      data about intraoperative cardiac arrest in Turkey, starting at their institution The aim is
      to evaluate the incidence and outcome in the study. Secondary aim is to assess the causes of
      cardiac arrest in the operating room.
