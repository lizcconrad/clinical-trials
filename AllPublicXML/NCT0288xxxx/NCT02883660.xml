      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who have been prescribed
      antidepressant medications and have experienced significant adverse effects are more likely
      to be poor metabolizers on the CYP450 (CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5+) drug metabolizing
      enzymes and/or homozygous for the short allele of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) compared
      to patients who took an antidepressant medication and did not experience significant adverse
      effects but also had minimal or no response to the medication. The target medications being
      studied include escitalopram, citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, duloxetine,
      bupropion, vortioxetine, vilazodone, and levomilnacipran only.

    <textblock>
      Genetic variations in the CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5+ drug metabolizing enzymes
      are responsible for metabolism of a large number of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric
      medications. Variations in the genes encoding for these enzymes can alter their activity
      resulting in unexpectedly high or low serum levels of the drug leading potentially to change
      in both efficacy and adverse events. The serotonin transporter protein is a presynaptic
      transmembrane protein responsible for serotonin reuptake. The &quot;short&quot; form of the serotonin
      transporter promoter (SLC6A4) is associated with reduced activity of the of the transporter.
      Patients who are homozygous for the &quot;short&quot; alleles of SLC6A4 may be more likely to have with
      poor response, slow response, and greater adverse events with serotonergic medications. The
      target medications being studied include escitalopram, citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine,
      venlafaxine, duloxetine, bupropion, vortioxetine, vilazodone, and levomilnacipran only.

        One hundred (100) subjects aged 18 years or older, currently or in the past on one of the
        target antidepressants, will be recruited into this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older

          2. Able to give informed consent prior to the initiation of any protocol required
             procedures.

          3. Subject must be able to understand the nature of the study, agree to comply with the
             study procedures, and communicate about medical history to the study personnel.

          4. Subject was treated with one of the following &quot;target antidepressants:&quot; Escitalopram,
             citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, bupropion, vortioxetine,
             vilazodone, and levomilnacipran. Rationale: These antidepressants are primarily
             metabolized by CYP isoenzymes that will be assessed. Antidepressants like sertraline,
             fluoxetine, and mirtazapine are metabolized by multiple CYP isoenzymes and therefore
             are less likely to be significantly affected by metabolizer status on a particular CYP
             isoenzyme. For patients who have been treated with multiple antidepressants, the
             antidepressant that was associated with the greatest overall burden of AEs will be
             selected as the target antidepressant.

        5a. Study group: &quot;Increased AEs&quot; currently or in the past on one of the target
        antidepressants as operationally defined as either A or B: A) One or more AEs that were
        moderate/severe OR three or more AEs that were mild occurring on less than the usual
        minimum recommended dose of the antidepressant, or B) Three or more AEs that were
        moderate/severe OR five or more AEs that were mild on a dose of the antidepressant within
        the usual recommended dose 5b. Control group: Both A and B A. Less than 30% reduction in
        the severity of depression after treatment for at least 6 weeks B. Minimal or no AEs on
        that antidepressant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects on antidepressants other than those specified in the inclusion criteria.

          2. Subjects for whom it is unclear which medication caused the adverse events

          3. Subjects for whom participation in the study would be detrimental to their mental of
             physical health based on investigator's opinion

          4. Subjects who have had a medical condition that, in the investigator's judgment, may be
             causing the reported adverse events

          5. Prisoners or patients who are involuntarily incarcerated
