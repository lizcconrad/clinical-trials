      Background: It has been shown that adults with Multiple sclerosis (MS) have less leg strength
      than their peers, as well as impaired balance, which has led to an increased prevalence of
      falls in this population.The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of 8-weeks
      aquatic exercise training in balance, endurance and speed in women with MS.

      Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 32 women with clinically-definite
      relapsing-remittent MS who were registered through the Isfahan MS association volunteered for
      this study. They randomly selected an aquatic exercise (n = 17) and control (n = 15) groups.
      Aquatic exercise group completed a 8-week aquatic exercise training program consisted of
      three sessions per week, each session lasting 45 to 60 minutes 50 to 75 percent of their
      maximum heart rate reserve on 20-25 degree centigrade's, whereas the control group was
      instructed to maintain their current lifestyle. The balance of angry was surveyed with using
      of Berg analyze, speed and endurance 6 minutes walking test before starting of exercise
      program and after 4 weeks and at the end of 8 weeks was analyzed. The obtained data's were
      analyzed using analysis of variance with repeated measures.
