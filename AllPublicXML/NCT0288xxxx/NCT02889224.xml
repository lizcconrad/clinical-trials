  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Working hypothesis: the interactions between the endogenous endocannabinoïds (ECS) - and
      cortisol, the end product of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis may play a role in
      the pathophysiology of Cushing's syndrome.

      The investigators speculate that:

        -  acute or chronic variations in plasma cortisol may induce changes in the activity of the
           ECS

        -  that there is a circadian rhythm of the ECS driven by the rythm of plasma cortisol
    </textblock>

      The study aim to identify the relationship between the ECS and the HPA axis in humans with a
      main objective to assess if Cushing's syndrome induces changes in the ECS activity.

      For this purpose:

        1. the investigors will compare plasma levels of ECS between obese controls and patients
           with Cushing's syndrome

        2. the investigors will compare plasma levels of ECS in patients with Cushing's syndrome
           before and immediately after curative surgery

        3. the investigors will compare plasma levels of ECS in patients with hypoadrenalism before
           and after the intake of substitutive doses of hydrocortisone

        4. the investigors will evaluate the plasma levels of ECS during a short synacthen test in
           healthy subjects.
