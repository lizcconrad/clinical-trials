  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide incidence of cutaneous melanoma has been increasing for the last 30 years in
      western populations. Among all melanomas, those located on the head and neck are more
      frequent than expected regarding the surface of this anatomical area, occur in older subjects
      than melanomas at other sites and have a worse prognosis than melanomas at other sites. The
      question whether head and neck melanomas could be a distinct entity has been debated.

      Aim of the study was to compare clinical and histological characteristics between head and
      neck melanomas and melanomas at other sites.
