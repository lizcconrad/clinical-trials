      This study aims to compare the results of two mini invasive surgical approaches in abdominal
      aortic surgery: mini lumbotomy with retroperitoneal approach versus mini laparotomy with
      transperitoneal approach. Respiratory and renal functions and recovery of intestinal transit
      will be assessed after 30 days.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to assess the life quality and morbi-mortality at 30
      days, as well as at 6 and 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following abdominal aortic surgery, post-operative outcomes are considered favorable with a
      rapid recovery of respiratory, renal functions and intestinal transit, with limited cardiac
      events. Complications are still frequent after the classic open abdominal surgery.

      In abdominal aortic surgery, &quot;mini&quot; abdominal incision has been proposed as an alternative to
      the classic large surgical approach.

      Two mini surgical approaches are possible: mini lumbotomy with retroperitoneal approach, and
      mini laparatomy with transperitoneal approach.

      Previous studies have only compared classic versus mini surgical approaches and many are
      retrospectives studies. Pain control through the mini-incision surgery allowed early
      mobilization of patients, improved lung function, reduced muscle loss, and favoured
      intestinal motility.

      So far, no study has compared the results of two mini invasive aortic approaches.

      The aim of this prospective randomized study is to compare two mini-invasive surgical
      approaches and to determine which of them allows the improvement of surgical outcomes with
      less morbi-mortality.

    <description>The patient will be positioned supine. After induction of general anesthesia, a median umbilical incision will be performed. The average length of the incision of the laparotomy will be 10 cm (8-12 cm). The small intestine will be then mobilized medially and held by an orthostatic retractor. Arterial dissection and control as well as bypasses will be performed according to the conventional technique. In case of occlusive disease of the iliac arteries, femoral site will be selected to achieve the distal anastomoses of the bifurcated prosthetic graft.</description>

    <description>After induction of general anesthesia, the patient will be positioned in right lateral decubitus at 45° of the table plane. The incision will be performed from the tip of the eleventh rib with a slightly sloping path to the outer edge of the rectus muscle. The average length of the incision of the laparotomy will be 10 cm (8-12 cm).
Abdominal aorta will be approached retroperitoneally. Arterial dissection and control as well as bypasses will be performed according to the conventional retroperitoneal technique. In case of occlusive disease of the iliac arteries, femoral site will be selected to achieve the distal anastomoses of the bifurcated prosthetic graft.</description>
