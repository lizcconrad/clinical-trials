      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerance and the efficiency of subcutaneous
      administration of Paracetamol for patients in palliative care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous administration is the most commonly used way for palliative care and geriatric
      service. A lot of drugs are recommended with subcutaneous administration, but their use is
      performed out of the Marketing Authorization, and fewer data exist about this practice in
      literature. Paracetamol is a grade 1 analgesic not currently recommended for subcutaneous
      injection, because of the lack of validated references. However this kind of administration
      is usually performed for Paracetamol in the French palliative care services related with its
      advantages for patients, as analgesic or antipyretic. The assumption of the study is that the
      use of paracetamol subcutaneously is possible with a good tolerance for hospitalized patients
      in palliative care service.
