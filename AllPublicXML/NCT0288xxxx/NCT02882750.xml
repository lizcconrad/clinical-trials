    <textblock>
      This study will monitor the effect on patients reported outcomes (PROMs) of VATS resection
      and SABR for NSCLC delivered at the Leeds Cancer Centre The investigator will support with
      this information the Shared Decision Making (SDM) process.

      300 consecutive patients will be followed up from prior the treatment to 12 months
      afterwards, administering multiple questionnaires (EORTC QLQ C-30 and LC-13, PSQ-18, Decision
      Self-Efficacy Scale) by a remote web-based system.

      Deliverable:

        1. Differences after VATS resections or SABR in terms of physical and psychological
           symptoms, quality of life and satisfaction

        2. Patient perspectives of the Shared Decision Making Process.

      1. Methods

           Aim and Objectives

           This study aims to describe the trajectory of lung cancer patients HRQoL, symptoms and
           functions following VATS or SABR treatment for Stage I-II NSCLC and to determine the
           feasibility and patient acceptability of online self-reporting of PROMs.

           Specific objectives of the study include:

             -  To compare changes before and after treatment of patient reported outcomes (HRQOL
                and Patient Satisfaction) after VATS lung resections or SABR in early stage lung
                cancer patients.

             -  To correlate clinical outcomes (complications and AEs) with Quality of Life in
                order to find objective predictors of major decline in patient reported outcomes.

             -  To identify specific factors, which have influenced the personal choice between the
                treatments (Decision Self-Efficacy Scale)

             -  Establish recruitment and attrition rates and adherence to PROMs reporting during
                the study

             -  To describe patient choice of electronic vs paper questionnaires

             -  To explore implementation issues through patient and staff interview.

        2. Design

      This is an observational prospective longitudinal study with repeated measures (PROMs),
      employing a convenience sample of consecutive patients planned to have VATS resections or
      SABR for stages I-II of NSCLC. Outcomes measures will be collected prior to treatment and
      1,3,6,12 months afterwards, administering the questionnaires by the remote web-based system.
      Paper administration will be offered to patients without Internet access.

      Sample size considerations

      Last year 100 pre-surgical quality of life questionnaires have been collected in 5 months
      from outpatients' clinic at Leeds Cancer Centre (LCC). For longitudinal studies involving
      regular PROMs, the investigators typically see 70% consent rate and 30-35% attrition over 3
      months24. Therefore the investigators expectations are to be able to recruit 200 VATS and 50
      SABR patients recruiting over 12 months with 12 months of follow-up.

      In order to detect a minimum difference of 10% from the baseline value and standard deviation
      of the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Scale scale (as measured in our historical cohort of 115
      anatomic lung resections), with a alfa level of 0.05 and statistical power of 90%, a sample
      size of 115 patients in the surgical arm was estimated.
