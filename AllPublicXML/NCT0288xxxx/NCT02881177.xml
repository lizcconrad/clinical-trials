  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the tolerability, feasibility, and
      preliminary effectiveness of intranasal oxytocin administration prior to motivational
      enhancement group therapy sessions on laboratory-based measures of addiction, social
      connectedness, and stress responsivity in methamphetamine(meth)-using men who have sex with
      men (MSM). The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, study of intranasal oxytocin
      versus placebo 40 IU prior to each of six Motivational Interviewing Group Therapy (MIGT)
      sessions in 28 mixed HIV sero-status MSM initiating treatment for amphetamine use disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high prevalence of amphetamine use disorder (AUD) among men who have sex with men (MSM)
      leads to significant health disparities, including increased risk for HIV sero-conversion.
      Reducing methamphetamine use mitigates HIV risk. Currently no psychopharmacological agent
      exists for the treatment of AUD; innovative interventions are desperately needed. Oxytocin, a
      social neuropeptide, has well-studied anti-addiction effects in animal models of substance
      dependence. The use of intranasal oxytocin for a variety of human substance use disorders is
      under early investigation, although no one has studied oxytocin's effects in AUD. In other
      populations, oxytocin's effects are known to vary depending on social context. Psychosocial
      treatment alone has been shown to reduce methamphetamine and HIV risk in MSM at a
      community-based clinic in San Francisco, The Stonewall Project. The investigators propose a
      randomized, double-blind pilot study of psychopharmacological-psychosocial combination
      therapy, administration of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo prior to six Motivational
      Interviewing Group Therapy (MIGT) sessions, in 28 mixed HIV sero-status MSM initiating
      treatment for AUD. The investigators aim to assess: 1) tolerability, 2) feasibility for
      larger randomized controlled trials, and 3) exploratory measures of efficacy, including: a)
      urine levels of methamphetamine and metabolites, b) methamphetamine craving, c) engagement in
      MIGT through third-party coding of videotaped group sessions and self-reported measures of
      group connectedness, d) psychophysiological stress responses to group engagement, and e)
      sexual risk taking.

    <description>Aim 1: To examine the tolerability of repeated oxytocin dosing in MSM who use meth.
Hypothesis 1: There will be no difference in side effect profiles for those receiving oxytocin (40 IU) versus placebo prior to each of six MIGT sessions, and there will be no study-related adverse events.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Aim 2: To determine the feasibility of implementing a larger randomized controlled trial of oxytocin dosing in meth-using MSM.
Hypothesis 2: This community-based pilot study will recruit and enroll 38 individuals within 6 months and have retention rates â‰¥75%. The investigators will collect effect size data to be used in planning the sample size of larger clinical trials. The investigators will collect pilot validation data for our exploratory measures and paradigms.</description>

    <description>Aim 3 (Exploratory): To examine the effects of oxytocin administration on multiple substance abuse and HIV risk-related outcomes.
Hypothesis 3: Although efficacy is not the primary aim of this pilot study, following administration of 40 IU intranasal oxytocin compared to placebo prior to six MIGT sessions the investigators expect to see trends toward: a) reduced urine meth and meth metabolite levels, b) reduced meth craving, c) improved engagement in MEGT sessions and greater feelings of connectedness with other group members, d) reduced psychophysiological stress responses while participating in MEGT sessions, and e) reduction in sexual risk taking.</description>
