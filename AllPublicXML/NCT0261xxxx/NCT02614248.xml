    <description>Participants in this group will receive the standard of care for preventing and treating diaper dermatitis at Genesis. This includes no treatment until a diaper dermatitis appears. If diaper dermatitis appears, participants will receive a generous layer of Medline Remedy Phytoplex Z-Guard Skin Protectant applied to the diaper area (buttocks and creases between thighs and hips) at each diaper change. This will continue until the patient is discharged or reaches the primary safety endpoint (skin that is eroded and/or blistered in the diaper area with bleeding).</description>
