  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of patients with a BMI above 70 kg/m2 who need immediate weight loss surgery is
      risen continuously. For those patients a prior-to-surgery conditioning therapy is mandatory
      to gain technical and physical operability. The exclusively well-established preliminary
      therapy so far was the intragastric balloon, which takes 7 months of treatment time. Due to
      life-threatening conditions of giant obese patients, who have been admitted to hospital, the
      investigators were forced to develop a more prompt acting conditioning therapy to bring those
      individuals in a short run to an improved and &quot;fit-for-surgery&quot; state. In such an impasse the
      investigators combine Liraglutide with its well-known weight-loss effect with a leucine-based
      amino acid infusion that is generally used for patients with liver insufficiency, in
      expectance of an additional weight loss and liver reduction effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a commercial available amino acid infusion (Aminosteril hepa 8%,
      Fresenius Karbi), which is used in clinical application for liver conditioning. It is mainly
      based on the branched-chained amino acid leucine (13.09 g per 1000 ml). The investigators
      will combine this with a daily subcutaneous injection of Liraglutide. Liraglutide is a GLP-1
      analogue, which achieved meanwhile the FDA approval for weight loss treatment. Initial
      Liraglutide dosage is 1.2 mg for three days, boosted to 1.8 mg consecutively. Participants
      receive energy reduced nutrition with 800 kcal/d.
