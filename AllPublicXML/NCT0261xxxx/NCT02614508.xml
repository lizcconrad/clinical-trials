    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of buparlisib when given together
      with ofatumumab or ibrutinib in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has
      returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Buparlisib and
      ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, may block cancer growth in different ways
      by targeting certain cells. Giving buparlisib or ibrutinib and ofatumumab together may work
      better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined ofatumumab and
      buparlisib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic
      lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have been exposed to ibrutinib (i.e., ibrutinib pre-treated).

      II. To evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined ibrutinib and
      buparlisib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic
      lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have NOT been exposed to ibrutinib (i.e., ibrutinib naïve)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined buparlisib and ofatumumab.

      II. Evaluate for efficacy of buparlisib in combination with ofatumumab in ibrutinib
      pre-treated patients with CLL/SLL.

      III. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined buparlisib and ibrutinib.

      IV. To evaluate for efficacy of buparlisib in combination with ibrutinib in ibrutinib naive
      patients with CLL/SLL.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of buparlisib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment cohorts.

      COHORT A (ibrutinib pre-treated): Patients receive buparlisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on
      days 1-28 and ofatumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 during of courses 1-2;
      and day 1 of courses 4-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT B (ibrutinib naive): Patients receive buparlisib as in Cohort A and ibrutinib PO on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

                       lifestyle of the subject; (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception)

                    -  Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
                       study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study
                       subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                       patient)

                    -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

                         -  a. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system
                            (IUS)

                         -  b. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm
                            or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository

                         -  c. Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and
                            implanted) are not allowed as buparlisib decreases the effectiveness of
                            hormonal contraceptives

          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; for women with
             therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status;
             NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
             (LH-RH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for
             induction of ovarian suppression

          -  Patients with a history of central nervous system involvement by CLL or who have
             prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL)

          -  Patients with known hepatitis B or hepatitis C (active or carriers)

          -  Patients with diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2

          -  Patients who have received oral or IV chemotherapy or targeted anticancer therapy ≤ 2
             weeks (4 weeks for nitrosourea, antibodies or mitomycin-C) prior to study enrollment;
             steroids used for anti-cancer properties must be tapered to 10 mg or less of
             prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to initiating therapy

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with a pan-selective PI3K inhibitor are not
             eligible
