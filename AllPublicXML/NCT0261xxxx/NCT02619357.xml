  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence, low cost, and low burden of wearable devices that provide quantitative and
      qualitative feedback on a subject's activity level present an opportunity for the use of
      these devices in clinical and observational studies. However, the accuracy and
      reproducibility of any given device may vary with device design and algorithm implementation.
      Therefore, validation of emerging technologies against known standards such as analysis of
      exhaled breath and currently available medical devices is critical. This is a single center,
      two-cohort, single period, open-label, methodology study. No investigational product will be
      used in this study. Eligible subjects will wear 2 generations of SenseWear Armband devices, 2
      ActiGraph GT9x devices (one on the wrist and one on the waist) and a Garmin Vivofit 2
      activity tracker wristband for up to 24 hours per day. Subjects who consent to participate in
      an optional sub-study will wear a SOMNOwatch Plus EEG-6 device while sleeping. Subjects will
      perform a variety of laboratory and field-based exercise tests and strength exercises using
      Latex-Free Therabands.The co-primary objectives of this study are firstly to compare the
      outputs of the test devices (SenseWear Armband Gecko and Actigraph GT9x) to those of the
      SenseWear Armband MF and secondly to assess the sensitivity and accuracy of the test devices
      in subjects with COPD or asthma while performing laboratory-based exercise testing.

             units per week and females &gt;14 units per week) or drug abuse within the last 2 years.
             One unit is equivalent to 8 gram (g) of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 milliliter [mL]) of
             beer, 1 glass (125 mL) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits.

          -  Inability to abstain from smoking during the period in which the subject is admitted
             to the Clinical Unit.

          -  A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to metal, particularly stainless steel.

          -  Clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG) as determined by the
             investigator.

          -  Any vital sign indicator, e.g., hypertension or tachycardia at rest that at the
