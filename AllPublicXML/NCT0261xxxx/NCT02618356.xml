        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ≥18 years of age

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum 3. No
             systemic chemotherapy for metastatic tumors

        4. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) 0-1 and expected survival period for 3 months
        or more 5. At least one measurable objective tumor lesions according to Response Evaluation
        Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 6. ANC≥1.5*109/L；PLT≥80*109/L；HB≥90g/L；Total
        bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) ; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
        aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with liver involvement
        of their cancer)；ALB ≥ 30g/L; Serum creatinine ≤1.5(ULN) or glomerular filtration rate
        (GFR) ≥60 ml/min screening within 7 days 7. Progression during or within 3 months following
        the last administration of approved standard therapies which must include a
        fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Subjects treated with oxaliplatin in an
        adjuvant setting should have progressed during or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant
        therapy. Subjects who progress more than 6 months after completion of oxaliplatin
        containing adjuvant treatment must be retreated with oxaliplatin-based therapy to be
        eligible. Subjects who have withdrawn from standard treatment due to unacceptable toxicity
        warranting discontinuation of treatment and precluding retreatment with the same agent
        prior to progression of disease will also be allowed into the study. Subjects may have
        received prior treatment with Avastin (bevacizumab) and/or Erbitux (cetuximab)/Vectibix
        (panitumumab) (if KRAS WT) 8. Signed informed consent obtained before any study specific
        procedures. Subjects must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed
        consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment with raltitrexed and gimeracil and oteracil potassium

          2. Systemic anticancer therapy including cytotoxic therapy, signal transduction
             inhibitors, immunotherapy and hormonal therapy during this trial or within 4 weeks (or
             6 weeks for mitomycin C) before starting to receive study medication.

          3. Alcohol or drug addictions

          4. Previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from
             colorectal cancer within 5 years prior to randomization EXCEPT for curatively treated
             cervical cancer in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer and superficial bladder tumors [Ta
             (non-invasive tumor), Tis (carcinoma in situ) and T1 (tumor invades lamina propria)]

          5. Any history of or currently known brain metastases

          6. Multiple primary colorectal carcinoma

          7. Concomitant participation or participation within the last 30 days in another clinical
             trial

          8. There is an important organ failure or other serious diseases, including coronary
             artery disease, symptomatic cardiovascular disease or myocardial infarction within 12
             months; serious neurological or psychiatric history; severe infection; actively
             disseminated vascula blood coagulation.

          9. Extended field radiotherapy within 4 weeks or limited field radiotherapy within 2
             weeks prior to randomization. Subjects must have recovered from all therapy-related
             toxicities. The site of previous radiotherapy should have evidence of progressive
             disease if this is the only site of disease.

         10. Pregnant or breast-feeding subjects. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             pregnancy test performed a maximum of 7 days before start of treatment, and a negative
             result must be documented before start of treatment.

         11. Pleural effusion or ascites that causes respiratory compromise (≥Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) Grade 2 dyspnea)

         12. Subjects unable to swallow oral medications

         13. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
