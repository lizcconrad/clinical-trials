  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-arm, cross-sectional, study to establish the effectiveness of MIAA to
      detect melanoma in pigmented lesions, compared to gold standard histological determination.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin Analytics Limited have developed an algorithm (MIAA) which reviews photographs of
      pigmented lesions to determine whether melanoma is likely to be present. This study aims to
      establish how well MIAA determines the presence or absence of melanoma, compared to a biopsy.

      Pigmented lesions that a dermatologist has decided to biopsy, and are suitable for
      photographing, will be photographed up to five times in a single visit. Three different
      camera will be used, and two different dermoscopic lens attachments will be used on
      smartphone cameras. Images will be analysed by MIAA and the results compared to the biopsy
      result. Clinicians, patients and the statistical analysis team will be blinded to the result
      of MIAA.

      At least 65 pigmented lesions positive for melanoma (as determined by biopsy) are required,
      which is predicted to mean 1250 patients will be recruited.
