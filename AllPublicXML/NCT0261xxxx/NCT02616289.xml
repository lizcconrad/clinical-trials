  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the absorption of topically applied EFA-containing
      emollient (SSO) into the skin and thence into the bloodstream in children with SAM will
      improve skin barrier function and accelerate weight gain and clinical rehabilitation beyond
      that possible through normal standard-of-care

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A child with SAM, in addition to wasting will often present with infection, hypothermia,
      dehydration and electrolyte imbalance - complications attributable, at least in part, to
      compromised skin barrier function. Essential fatty acid (EFA)-containing emollients such as
      sunflower seed oil (SSO) have been shown to augment skin barrier function, reduce
      transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and risk of bloodstream infection and mortality, and promote
      weight gain in preterm infants. Recent research from rural Bangladesh showed very low levels
      of EFAs in young children in the general population. It is believed that EFA levels will be
      further depleted in children with SAM. So the investigators aim to demonstrate the
      feasibility of topical applications of SSO to children with SAM, and to measure clinical
      impact of emollient therapy with SSO on skin barrier function, skin condition, EFA levels in
      blood, weight gain, co-morbidities (e.g., pneumonia, sepsis), and time to complete acute
      rehabilitation from SAM, in addition to the benefits of normal standard-of-care.

    <description>3 g of oil per kg of infant's weight at study entry of Sunflower Seed oil (SSO) will be applied three times per day at regularly spaced intervals (8-hour intervals) for 10 days. Oil will not be applied to the face (to avoid the possibility of any accidental aspiration or ingestion), ears or under the hairline. Care will be taken to not injure the skin during the massage treatment. The child's anal area will be washed prior to application to avoid the spread fecal flora from the anal region (to which the oil will be applied to last). Prior to bathing the child a minimum of 3-4 hours should have elapsed following the application of the SSO. The amount of oil required will be calculated based on the child's weight and the required amount weighed out each time.</description>
