  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the pain and functional outcomes of
      patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis treated with either intratendinous corticosteroid
      injection or high energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corticosteroid injections and high energy ESWT are standard therapies for lateral
      epicondylitis at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. While corticosteroid
      injections have been shown to be moderately effective in the short term for the condition, a
      significant minority of patients remains symptomatic. Low energy ESWT has mixed results in
      the orthopaedic literature, but to date no study has specifically examined the effects of
      high energy ESWT. The investigators plan to randomize a total of 80 patients with the
      diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis to either corticosteroid injection or high energy ESWT,
      and follow them for a total of 12 months. Primary outcomes will be Disabilities of the Arm,
      Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, Patient Reported Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) score, Mayo
      Elbow Score, Veterans Rand-36, and return-to-work status. Patients will be surveyed at
      baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. All assessments will be done by an independent
      physician examiner who is blinded to the treatment received.

    <description>Following clearance, patients will be booked for ESWT in the operating room either Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) or Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (KACC), depending on availability. Under conscious sedation, patients will receive 2000 shocks at 18-24 kilovolts, which is the standard dose utilized by our clinic in treatment of this condition. The range is necessary to account for differing size of the soft tissue envelope depending on patient habitus. The final dose utilized will be at the surgeon's discretion.</description>
