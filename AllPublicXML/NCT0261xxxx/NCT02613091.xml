  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a1972 study in the French Annals of Pharmaceuticals, Laroche and Laroche reported that the
      drug clemastine has a negative effect on patients' color discrimination, which is the ability
      to distinguish different hues and arrange them in the correct order. In an upcoming clinical
      trial studying the effect of clemastine on vision outcomes, our lab aims to assess color
      visual performance adding assessment of color defectiveness as a clinical endpoint. Color
      defectiveness is the ability to see certain colors, and is commonly referred to as
      color-blindness. Color discrimination and defectiveness can be related, but do not always
      correlate. This study aims to detect the effect, if any, that clemastine has on color
      defectiveness in healthy controls, which could confound its use as an outcome endpoint in
      future clinical trials relating to clemastine.

      Additional evaluation of pharmacokinetic data will be performed to confirm pharmacokinetic
      measures and correlate blood levels of drug to color performance if seen.
