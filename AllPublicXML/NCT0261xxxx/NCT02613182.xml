      The rationale for this study is to provide additional treatment with NEOD001 for subjects who
      complete Study NEOD001-001, and to continue to evaluate long term safety and tolerability.
      All subjects in the current NEOD001 trials are being dosed at 24 mg/kg, which will be
      continued in this study.

      The rationale for this study is to provide additional treatment with NEOD001 for subjects who
      complete Study NEOD001-001, and to continue to evaluate long term safety and tolerability.
      All subjects in the current NEOD001 trials are being dosed at 24 mg/kg, which will be
      continued in this study. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate long-term safety
      and tolerability of NEOD001 and the secondary objectives are to assess the immunogenicity of
      NEOD001 and to incorporate serum NEOD001 concentrations in a population pharmacokinetic (PK)
      analysis.

             initiation of any study procedures

          3. Has adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic and renal function, as demonstrated by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 ×109/L

               -  Platelet count ≥75 × 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2 times the upper limit of normal (× ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 × ULN

               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/minute

          4. Seated systolic blood pressure 90 to 180 mmHg

          5. ECOG Performance Status 0 to 2

          6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 28 days prior to the first administration of study drug and agree to use highly
             effective physician-approved contraception from 30 days prior to the first study drug
             administration to 90 days following the last study drug administration

          7. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use highly effective
             physician-approved contraception from 30 days prior to the first study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any new medical contraindication or clinically significant abnormality on physical,
             neurological, laboratory, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) examination (e.g.,
             atrial fibrillation; with the exception of subjects for whom the ventricular rate is
             controlled) that precludes continued or initiation of treatment with NEOD001 or
             participation in the study
