  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to develop an intervention to assess the feasibility of
      implementing Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) for low birth weight (LBW) and preterm babies in a
      community setting. A prototype intervention package will be developed using information
      obtained from in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and other qualitative research
      techniques. These interviews will help us identify current behaviours, barriers to adoption
      of KMC and effective ways to promote KMC in the community. The prototype intervention will be
      refined by conducting acceptability studies (household trials) with few mothers. The study
      team are identifying LBW and preterm infants, demonstrating to mothers how to practice KMC
      and following up till KMC is stopped. The process is being documented using observations and
      interviews. Information is obtained on acceptability of KMC, number of hours per day and
      number of days KMC was given, breastfeeding practices and support provided by other family
      members.

    <description>To determine whether community KMC is feasible to implement in the study setting and if so, can high enough adoption rates be achieved. This will be ascertained by documenting proportion of mothers doing KMC, number of hours each day and number of days skin to skin contact is given.</description>
