      The overall aim of this study is to determine modifications to Exposure and Response
      Prevention (ERP) therapy that are needed in order to effectively deliver treatment for
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in a community mental health center. This study is the
      final study in a series of three projects executed to adapt and pilot-test a team ERP (T-ERP)
      intervention that will optimize therapist time by utilizing paraprofessionals to assist with
      group-ERP treatment plans. The intervention will be tailored to meet the unique needs of
      low-SES individuals with OCD and be implemented in a community mental health center (CMHC).
