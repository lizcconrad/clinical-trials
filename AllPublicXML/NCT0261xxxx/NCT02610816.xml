  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this interventional study is to test and compare the effectiveness of two
      elimination diets—the 1-food elimination diet (1FED, milk only) and the 4-food elimination
      diet (4FED, milk, egg, wheat, and soy). The study will also test the effectiveness of
      swallowed glucocorticoid therapy in some of the study participants for whom diet therapy was
      not effective.

      This study will consist of two phases, plus a screening period. During the screening period,
      subject eligibility for the study will be determined. During Phase 1, qualified participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two elimination diet therapies--the 1FED or the 4FED.
      Participants will remain on the assigned dietary therapy for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks
      of therapy, esophageal biopsies from participant's standard of care (i.e. normal, routine
      care) endoscopy will be evaluated to determine disease status. Participants whose EoE is in
      remission (i.e. &lt;15 eos/hpf) will be done with the study.

      Participants whose EoE is still active (i.e. ≥15 eos/hpf) will continue into Phase 2 of the
      study. During Phase 2, participants who were on 1FED in Phase 1 will receive 4FED therapy for
      12 weeks, and participants who were on 4FED during Phase 1 will receive swallowed
      glucocorticoid therapy for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks of therapy, esophageal biopsies
      from participant's standard of care (i.e. normal, routine care) endoscopy will be evaluated
      to determine disease status.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have diagnosis of EoE (based on consensus criteria)

          -  Are aged 6 to 17 years

          -  Have histologically confirmed active disease &gt;15 eosinophils/hpf in either distal or
             proximal esophagus within 4 weeks of screening visit

          -  PPI confirmation

          -  Symptomatic (have experienced symptoms within the last month prior to enrollment)

          -  Has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening if of childbearing potential. Females
             of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test (β-hCG) prior to
             enrollment into the study (i.e., at screening). Subsequently, these participants must
             agree to use adequate birth control measures (e.g., condom,
             oral/injectable/subcutaneous contraceptives, intrauterine device, or sexual
             abstinence) during the study and for at least one month after the last dose of study
             drug which will be documented in the source documents.

             steroids within the past 3 months

          -  Have eosinophilia in segments of the GI tract other than the esophagus

          -  Have been diagnosed with a GI malabsorption disorder (i.e., Inflammatory bowel
             disease, Crohn's disease) or Celiac disease

          -  Are currently on dietary therapy avoiding milk

          -  Have concurrent H pylori gastritis or parasitic infection

          -  Are unable to obtain EGD with esophageal biopsies at CCHMC or other participating
             institution within 4 weeks of study completion

          -  Have previously failed (in a clinical trial setting) dietary therapy with one of these
             regimens or topical steroid treatment with fluticasone at a total dose of 1760 mcg per
             day.

          -  Have definitely responded (in a clinical trial setting) to either dietary therapy
             avoiding these antigens or to swallowed fluticasone at a total dose of 1760 mcg per
             day

          -  Are concurrently receiving any of the prohibited medications listed in Table 2
