  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are part of the multidisciplinary treatment of some chronic
      respiratory diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Although clinical
      guidelines of other diseases such as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (nCFBE) discuss the
      benefits of these programs in quality of life and exercise tolerance, evidence of such
      intervention in nCFBE patients is insufficient. Longer studies are needed with larger sample
      sizes and optimized to maximize the response and maintain long-term benefits. The present
      study aims to examine the effects in exercise tolerance of a pulmonary rehabilitation program
      combined with respiratory physiotherapy in patients with nCFBE. It is a randomized controlled
      clinical trial with a total duration of 24 months. The intervention will be performed during
      12 weeks and then will be a period of 12 months of maintenance. This is a multicenter study
      involving the following Hospitals: Hospital Clinic, Hospital la Plató and Hospital del Mar of
      Barcelona, Hospital Josep Trueta of Girona, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Fondazione
      Maugeri di Lumezzane of Italy. Subjects will be randomized into three groups in a ratio (1:
      1: 1) (1) Pulmonary Rehabilitation (2) Chest Physiotherapy and (3) Pulmonary Rehabilitation +
      Chest Physiotherapy. Hospital la Plató from Barcelona will be responsible for carrying out
      the Control Group. The primary endpoint will be the test of &quot;endurance shuttle walk test&quot;.

    <description>These sessions will be individually designed and they will be a combination of global aerobic interval training using a cycloergometer. The aim is to achieve a training intensity of 80% HR or greater of the obtained during the ISWT. This intensity will be progressively increased during the firsts four weeks until achieving the target. The duration will be of about 45 minutes per session. Oxygen Saturation, HR and Borg scale for dyspnoea and fatigue will be measured before, during and at the end of the session in order to monitories the effort.</description>

    <description>The ELTGOL technique (&quot;total slow expiration with glottis open in lateral decubitus&quot;) for airways clearance will be used in order to move respiratory secretions from the distal bronchial tree. It will be applied during 15 minutes each side (right and left lungs) assuming an approximate session length of 30 minutes. The patient could perform the cough technique when it's necessary.</description>

    <description>This group will perform a combination of the two programs in the same session with a total duration of 1h and 15 minutes. The session will be divided in different parts: First, we will execute 15min of chest physiotherapy (7.5min for each side); second, the pulmonary rehabilitation session (45min) and finally, another 15min of chest physiotherapy (7.5min for each side). The patient will have a rest when it's necessary and we will continue with the session when there is a decrease of 2 points in the Borg scale.
Intensity of physiotherapy exercises and drainage techniques will be maintained similar to the PR and CP programs.</description>

    <description>For the control group, participants will attend educational sessions to improve patients' understanding and awareness of the respiratory diseases. These sessions will be performed at beginning and at 12 weeks by the physiotherapist and the pulmonologist.
The physiotherapist will also do monthly telephone calls for patient's monitoring.</description>
