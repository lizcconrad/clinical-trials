    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common condition in critical ill patients
      affecting 7.2 people / 100,000 population / year and more than 7% of patients with invasive
      mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. ARDS carries a high hospital mortality of up
      to 48% and consumes large amounts of critical care resources. ARDS patients often present
      with severe hypoxemia that is refractory to conventional treatment and are thus evaluated for
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, uncertainty regarding the appropriate
      indication for ECMO and clinical evidence for ECMO as a rescue treatment are still
      controversial. In 2012 Grasso and colleagues therefore presented a case series of influenza A
      (H1N1) ARDS patients describing the use of esophageal pressure measurements for
      individualized PEEP titration to achieve an end expiratory plateau pressure of the lung
      (PPLATL) of 25cm H2O. After performing the measurements in 14 patients, ventilator settings
      could be adjusted in half of these patients by increasing PEEP which resulted in an increase
      of oxygenation measures to an extend that criteria for extracorporeal support where no longer
      met and conventional treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation could be continued.
      However, uncertainty remains as to whether these results are generalizable to ARDS of any
      cause. In addition, increasing PEEP might impact on cardiac function and might therefore be
      associated with clinical important hemodynamic effects in these patients.

      The investigators aim to evaluate hemodynamic changes in patients with severe ARDS in which
      an individualized PEEP treatment strategy can be employed. ARDS will be defined and
      stratified according to the Berlin ARDS definition. A naso-gastric probe capable of measuring
      esophageal pressure will be inserted directly after admission to the ICU as previously
      described. Invasive mechanical ventilation and oesophageal pressure measurements will be done
      using the GE Healthcare Carescape R860 ventilator. A pulmonary artery catheters (Edwards
      CCOcomb) will be inserted to evaluate the hemodynamic parameters of cardiac output, pulmonary
      artery pressures and left atrial pressures. Volumetric parameters will be measured using
      tanspulmonary thermodilution devices (Edwards EV1000). Cardiac function will be addressed in
      addition by the use of a predefined echocardiography protocol.
