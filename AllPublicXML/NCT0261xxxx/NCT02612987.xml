  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a commonly reported comorbidity for adolescents with psychiatric conditions. It
      is well-known that insomnia can exacerbate the concurrent psychiatric symptom load. Treatment
      of insomnia has been extensively examined in adults, but studies with adolescents are sparse.
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of internet-based
      cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT) in outpatients of Children and Youth
      Psychiatry. Twenty-one adolescents will be recruited and receive 7 weeks of iCBT. Outcome
      will be measured at pre treatment, at post treatment and at a three months follow-up. Weekly
      assessments will also be made during treatment on primary outcome and a presumed process
      variable constructed for the purpose of this trial.
