    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label, outpatient study of the safety and effectiveness of repeated doses
      of MYOBLOC over a 1-year duration in adult subjects with troublesome sialorrhea. The primary
      goal is to determine the long-term safety and tolerability of MYOBLOC (administered
      intraglandularly as single total dose of 3,500 Units) treatments every 13 weeks over a
      maximum possible duration of 1 year in adult subjects with troublesome sialorrhea. The
      secondary goal is to assess the magnitude of therapeutic response of MYOBLOC (administered
      intraglandularly as a single total dose of 3,500 Units) using effectiveness assessments
      performed at intervals after treatments every 13 weeks over a maximum possible duration of 1
      year.

    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are recorded at each study visits of both Parts A and B, starting from the first injection of MYOBLOC or placebo on Day 1 of Treatment Session 1 and ending at study completion. The occurrence, seriousness, severity, and causality assessment of adverse events will be assessed through evaluation of vital signs, physical exam, pulmonary function by spirometry, clinical laboratory tests, and neurological exams.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events of Special Interest</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events indicative of compromised airway protection as manifested by aspiration, aspiration pneumonia, choking, and dysphagia will be closely evaluated as adverse events of special interest (AESI) at each study visit and at discontinuation of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Columbia Suicide Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS measures both suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior and will be completed on Day 1 (before the first injection of study drug) and each subsequent clinic visit or, if applicable at discontinuation from the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of Dental Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Dental and oral health will be followed closely throughout the course of the study, with exams performed by either a licensed dentist (DDS or DMD) at each site, or oral examination by the Investigator. Dental adverse events include anything related to oral and dental health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unstimulated Salivary Flow Rate (USFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary flow rate, will be determined in an unstimulated state (i.e., at least 1 hour postprandial) at screening, just before the first injection of study drug (Day 1) to establish a baseline salivary flow rate, and at each subsequent study visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Change (CGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S will be used to record the severity of illness (sialorrhea) on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;normal&quot; to &quot;among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) and Change (PGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-S scale will be used by the subject to rate the severity of his/her illness (sialorrhea) on an 8-point scale ranging from &quot;normal&quot; to &quot;among the most extremely ill&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drooling Frequency and Severity Scale (DFSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The DFSS will be used to assess the frequency and severity of drooling on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (dry, never drools) to 5 (profuse, clothing, hands, tray, objects become wet). Drooling frequency will be assessed on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (never drools) to 4 (constantly drools).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drooling Impact Score (DIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The DIS is a 10-item questionnaire with each item rated by the subject to evaluate the impact of sialorrhea on daily activities (e.g., speech, social activities).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Seeking treatment for troublesome sialorrhea for at least 3 months that is occurring
             secondary to any disorder or related to any cause, including, but not limited to,
             Parkinson's Disease (PD), adult cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
             stroke, traumatic brain injury, oral cancer, and side effects of other medications.

          -  Able to read and provide written informed consent before enrollment into the study, or
             the subject's caregiver (Legally Authorized Representative) can provide written
             informed consent.

          -  Male or female, 18 to 85 years of age (inclusive).

          -  Minimum unstimulated salivary flow rate of 0.2 g/min at screening

          -  Minimum Investigator's Drooling Frequency and Severity Scale (DFSS) score of 4 at
             screening.

          -  Ability and availability to participate in the study for up to 1 year (ALS subjects:
             ability and availability to participate in the study for at least 6 months), based on
             overall health of the subject and disease prognosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A moderate to high risk of aspiration will exclude participation in this study.
             Subjects whose risk of aspiration are judged by the Investigator to be satisfactorily
             controlled by placement of PEG tube or G-tube for nutritional support are eligible to
             participate.

          -  Respiratory forced vital capacity (FVC) of &lt;20% of predicted

          -  Prior botulinum toxin type A or B treatment in the salivary gland(s) identified for
             treatment in this study within 24 weeks before screening. Prior botulinum toxin type A
             or B treatment into other anatomical regions not selected for treatment in this study
             is not exclusionary, but must have occurred at least 12 weeks before screening

          -  Subjects should be excluded if, in the Investigator's opinion, the subject failed to
             respond to previous treatment with botulinum toxin. Subjects should not receive nor
             have any plans for receiving any botulinum toxin treatment, other than the study drug
             (MYOBLOC), during the entire course of the study (from the point the informed consent
             is signed until subject's participation is complete).

          -  Concomitant use, or exposure within 5 half-lives of screening, of aminoglycoside
             antibiotics, curare-like agents, or other agents that interfere with neuromuscular
             function

          -  Prior salivary gland surgery

          -  Current treatment or treatment at any time during the study with Coumadin® (warfarin)
             or similar anti-coagulant medications. Anti-platelet medications are not specifically
             exclusionary

          -  Evidence of any clinically significant neurologic disease

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Anticipated or scheduled surgery during the study period. A PEG tube/G tube may be
             placed for nutritional support at any time during the study and will not exclude the
             subject from continued study participation.

          -  Major surgery (requiring general anesthesia, except PEG tube/G tube placement ) within
             the previous 6 months before screening.

          -  Current infection at the sialorrhea treatment injection site(s)

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse currently or within the previous 6 months
