  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the a Qigong based exercise intervention, here referred to as
      Meditative Movement (MM), to ameliorate the symptoms associated with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and its co-morbidities. It tests the hypothesis that MM will have a
      beneficial effect on COPD in FA, particularly on functional ability, respiratory symptoms,
      affective state, inflammation, and autonomic imbalance. If the hypothesis is correct, MM
      could be rapidly and inexpensively taught to FA with COPD and other COPD patients to slow
      degeneration and improve quality of life.

      The study has two phases.

      Phase 1 will identify the best MM practices and their impact on a test group of affected FA.
      Phase 2 will develop a video to apply what is learned in Phase 1 to a larger group of
      affected FA, and will document the resulting impact on various aspects of pulmonary
      dysfunction and its comorbidities.

      Phase 1: To identify the best set of MM exercises for improving COPD-related symptoms. This
      will be done by conducting a 12-week in-person MM program that will be held in one or more
      locations in the Northeastern region of the US and possibly other regions of the
      country.These training sessions will be used to determine precisely which MM exercises are
      most appropriate for this group. Selection will be based on professional judgment,
      participant feedback, and objective pre- and post-intervention measurements taken at the
      beginning and end of the 12-week program.

      Phase 2: To use an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of the exercises selected in Aim 1, as
      delivered by video only. We will design and produce an instructional DVD based on the
      findings in Aim 1.In the RCT we will test the hypothesis that targeted MM training and
      practice using the DVD alone will improve QOL, exercise tolerance, autonomic balance and
      pulmonary function, and reduce fatigue, in flight attendants with a COPD diagnosis. Pre- and
      post-intervention measurements will be compared, and to outcomes from a control group of
      flight attendants who will be wait listed for later participation in the study.
