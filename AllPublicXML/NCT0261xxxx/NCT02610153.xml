    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study is to assess the predictive factors of poor control of
      international normalized ratio (INR) to determine the treatment strategies received by
      patients with a poor control of INR in real-life clinical practice and to explore the
      effectiveness and safety of these strategies in patients with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation who start vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment

    <intervention_name>Vitamin K Antagonist</intervention_name>
    <description>The vitamin K antagonists exert their anticoagulant effect through inhibition of the enzyme complex of vitamin K epoxide reductase subunit 1 with subsequent reduction of the gamma-carboxylation of certain glutamic acid molecules endpoints located on factors coagulation II (prothrombin), VII, IX and X and protein C or its cofactor protein S. This gamma-carboxylation has a significant bearing on the interaction of coagulation factors referenced with calcium ions. Without this reaction, blood clotting cannot be initiated. The dose must be adjusted to each patient at baseline and after regular basis, since the sensitivity to anticoagulants varies between individuals and can also vary throughout the treatment. For this, the Prothrombin Time (PT) is used and standardized ratio called International Normalised Ratio (INR).</description>
