          -  SPOM score greater than or equal to 50 in study shoulder

          -  Willing to discontinue oral and topical analgesia other than rescue acetaminophen

          -  abstinence from any other IA or per-articular injections for the shoulder during the
             course of the trial

          -  patients with chronic shoulder pain lasting more than 6 months without clinically
             significant improvement in pain over the past one month

          -  pain at least 50% of the days during previous month

          -  patients who have failed conventional therapy of NSAIDs or steroid injections

          -  patients with a retained active range of motion of at least 30% in all directions to

          -  cooperative and able to communicate effectively

          -  agree not to participate in any other studies during trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  significant pain from other joints requiring chronic analgesic therapy

          -  presence of one or more conditions besides OA that could confound pain and functional
             assessments

          -  clinically apparent tense effusion, malalignment or instability in study shoulder

          -  shoulder x-rays of acute fractures, sever loss of bone density, avascular necrosis or

          -  allergic reaction to HA

          -  any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient

          -  pregnant or breastfeeding women
