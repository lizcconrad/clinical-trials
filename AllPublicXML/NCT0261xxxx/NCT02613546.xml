      This research is a randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate the influence of
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) on quality of life and sexual function of patients
      with sexual dysfunction. The notion of sexual health for the World Health Organization
      exceeds the concept of sickness absence, having a subjective well-being of significance in
      the spheres of self-concept, self-image, interpersonal relationships and sense of self worth.
      Furthermore, sexual satisfaction and relationship quality of life is also evidenced in many
      studies. CBT is a brief and focal psychotherapy with proven efficacy in several mental
      disorders, improving health and quality of life of the treated populations. However, they did
      not find clinical trials that showed the effectiveness of CBT in Sexual Dysfunctions. This
      study aims to then fill this gap by evaluating the relationship from the use of techniques of
      CBT.
