  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and feasibility of a new less invasive
      surfactant administration (LISA) technique with a specific designed cannula for surfactant
      administration using Beractant replacement in preterm infants &lt;32 weeks of gestation and
      compare short and long term outcomes with the intubation, administration of surfactant and
      extubation method (INSURE).

      This was a single-center, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, controlled study with an
      experimental cohort of 30 patients treated with LISA and a retrospective control group
      comprising the 30 most recently treated patients with INSURE. Beractant (4 ml/Kg) was
      administered as exogenous surfactant in both groups if patients on nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (nCPAP) during the first three days of life were needed of more than 30% of
      fraction of inspired oxygen inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2).

    <description>All infants were supported with nCPAP while breathing spontaneously during instillation. A 5Frenchgamma sterilized multi-access catheter specifically designed to deliver surfactants for Neonates was placed 1-2 cm below the vocal cords by direct laryngoscopy without the use of a Magill forceps. Beractant was used as exogenous natural surfactant, (100mg/kg; 4ml/kg) and administered in two aliquots during 1-3 minutes. Positive pressure inflations were given by a mask and bag only if the infant was apneic or bradycardia develops despite the interruption of the procedure. The surfactant administration catheter was removed after surfactant instillation and nCPAP support was maintained. A second dose of surfactant was administered during the first 3 days of life if more than 40% of FiO2 was needed while on nCPAP with at least 6 cm H2O pressure.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>INSURE</intervention_name>
    <description>The INSURE technique was performed using Beractant (4ml/kg) after endotracheal intubation. A multi-access catheter for Neonates/Pediatrics designed to deliver surfactants (KimVentTrach Care Technology ®, United Kingdom) was pre-connected to the endotracheal tube and used for surfactant administration without having to disconnect the ventilator. While surfactant was administered all infants were connected to pressure support ventilation modality (PSV) combined with volume guarantee (VG), Dräger ventilator). A tidal volume of 4ml/kg was initially adjusted.
After surfactant administration, all infants were to be extubated, in accordance with our institutional extubation guidelines, if FiO2&lt; 0.35; for a target Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) of &gt;90%, and if a consistent respiratory effort was present. Extubation was supported with nCPAP in all patients.</description>
