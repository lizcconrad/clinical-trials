    <textblock>
      This study seeks to assess the acceptability, compliance, and preference for iron
      supplementation; micronutrient powders (MNP) versus iron syrup. Additionally, this study
      seeks to assess front line health worker perceptions and experiences regarding ease of
      implementation of each strategy and delivery strategy preference.

      The specific aims of this study are to assess the acceptability of, compliance, and
      preference for two delivery vehicles for pediatric prophylaxis iron supplementation
      (micronutrient powders (MNP) that contain iron versus iron syrup) among rural households in
      Bihar India delivered through home visits by front line health workers. Additionally, this
      study seeks to assess front line health worker perceptions and experiences regarding ease of
      implementation of each strategy and delivery strategy preference.
