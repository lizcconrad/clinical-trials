  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a bilateral, progressive corneal degenerative disorder that often leads to
      significant visual deterioration over time. Corneal collagen crosslinking with riboflavin
      (CXL) was developed as a treatment to halt the progression of keratoconus and thus negate the
      need for corneal transplantation. However, the treatment alone has little impact in terms of
      improving visual function. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is the application of an excimer
      laser to treat a patient's refractive error, therefore decreasing the dependence on
      spectacles or contact lenses for improved vision.

      Corneal collagen crosslinking combined with photorefractive keratectomy has been explored to
      partially correct the refractive error in keratoconic patients, whilst simultaneously
      stabilizing the corneal changes. Recently, the iDesign® Advanced WaveScan Studio (iDesign
      system; Abbot Medical Optics; Santa Ana, CA) has been launched as the most advanced
      high-resolution aberrometer. It is capable of mapping highly aberrated corneas for
      wavefront-guided laser procedures, and represents an important technological advance in
      treating corneal disease.

      The purpose of this single center, prospective pilot study is to assess the safety and
      efficacy of combined wavefront-guided PRK and CXL in patients with early keratoconus using
      the iDesign® aberrometer. Results of this pilot study will be used to provide sample size
      estimates for an extension of the study, which aims to determine whether sequential or same
      day procedure leads to better outcomes.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the visual outcomes of combined wavefront-guided
      PRK and CXL in Krumeich stage 1 and 2 keratoconic eyes. The investigators will be conducting
      a prospective study at the University of Ottawa Eye Institute. A total of 24 patients will be
      enrolled in the study divided into two groups:

      Group 1: PRK performed12-18 months after CXL; Group 2: PRK performed or on the same day as
      CXL

      Participants will be followed at regular intervals for 1 year and information regarding
      visual, refractive, keratometric and higher order aberration outcomes will be collected.

      The researchers aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of combined wavefront guided PRK
      and CXL. Results of this pilot study will used to provide estimates for sample size
      calculation for an extension of the study, which aims to determine whether sequential or same
      day procedure leads to better outcomes.
