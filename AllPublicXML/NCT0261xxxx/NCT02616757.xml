    <textblock>
      Simple bone cysts (SBCs), also known as unicameral bone cysts (UBCs), are benign bone
      lesions. Literature to date describes little agreement between clinicians on specific
      prognostic criteria for the prediction of cyst healing, recurrence or fracture. Evidence has
      shown that bone mineral density (BMD) is a reliable indicator of risk to SBC patients given
      its association with the mechanical properties of bone. There has been further exploration
      into the use of quantitative ultrasound to assess bone density by measuring the velocity of
      the ultrasound transmission over the bone. To determine whether the QUS can provide
      prognostic information with respect to cyst healing, recurrence or fracture with a SBC,
      further study is needed.
