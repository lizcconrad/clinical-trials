    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow
      stem cell implantation for the treatment of leg ulcer in adult patients with sickle cell
      disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells, including endothelial progenitor cells and
      mesenchymal stromal cells, into leg ulcers has been shown to improve wound healing.

      In the present study the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells
      implantation will be investigated in patients with chronic leg ulcers. Forty cases will be
      enrolled. Improvement in the pain, rate and extent of leg ulcer wound healing as measured by
      change in wound surface area will be evaluated until one year.
