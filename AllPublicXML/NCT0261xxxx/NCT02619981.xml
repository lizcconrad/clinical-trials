      dental clinics Riyadh Colleges of Dentistry and Pharmacy using convenience sampling. Pulse
      rate for each patient was measured at different clinical situation starting from patient
      parent separation until end of appointment using a pulse oximeter, Data which collected was
      statistically analyzed using appropriate statistical analyses using SPSS ver.19 data
      processing software.

      150 children aged between five and seven years presenting for the first dental visit, whose
      parents consented to participate in the study were selected from patients reporting to the
      dental clinics Riyadh Colleges of Dentistry and Pharmacy using convenience sampling. Only
      children who were classified as anxious but able to cope were included in the study (Rating 2
      on the Venham's scale).

      Pulse rate for each patient was measured at six different clinical situations. 1) Baseline 2)
      Seating of the child at the chair, 3) Arrival of the dentist, 4) Administration of local
      anesthesia 5) During the procedure, 6) End of Appointment.

      Based on the accompanying person the children were classified as children accompanied by
      mothers alone, children accompanied by fathers alone, children accompanied by both parents.

      The behavior of the child at each situation was recorded using the modified Venham's scale at
      each interval. The heart rate and oxygen saturation were recorded using pulse oxymetry
