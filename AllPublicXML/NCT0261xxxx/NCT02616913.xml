    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if a single oral dose of 150 mg of the novel food ingredient (AME001,
      R,R-monatin) does not have an effect on the Fridericia-corrected QT ECG interval (QTcF)
      exceeding 10 milliseconds (msec). Each subject will consume test article (150 mg), placebo,
      and moxifloxacin (400 mg; positive control) in each of 3 treatment periods.

      This study is specifically designed to evaluate the potential effects of ingestion of the
      novel food ingredient on cardiac safety. The objective will be fulfilled by assessing cardiac
      parameters including heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG/QT interval in healthy adult male
      subjects following a single dose oral administration of the test article.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that a single oral dose of 150 mg of
      the test article does not have an effect on the Fridericia-corrected QT ECG interval (QTcF)
      exceeding 10 milliseconds (msec).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-smoking healthy male between 18 and 45 years of age;

          -  Subjects with a partner of childbearing potential agree to use dual methods of
             contraception from Check-in until 3 months (90 days) after the last treatment, and to
             provide no sperm donation from Check-in until 3 months (90 days) after last
             administration of test article. Double barrier methods include: a male condom with
             spermicide; a sterile sexual partner; use by female sexual partner of an intrauterine
             device (IUD) with spermicide; a female condom with spermicide; contraceptive sponge
             with spermicide; an intravaginal system (e.g. NuvaRing®) a diaphragm with spermicide;
             a cervical cap with spermicide; or oral, implantable, transdermal, or injectable
             contraceptives;

          -  Subjects must be in good health, determined by no clinically significant or relative
             abnormalities identified by medical history, full physical examination, vital signs
             measurements, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations;

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements;

          -  Subjects must have given written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of history of any disorder that may prevent successful completion of the
             study, in the opinion of the investigator;

             or a medical device) within the 30 days prior to Day -1 of the first treatment period
             (Check-in);

             immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease that are

             at home; recurrent use in physically hazardous situations; recurrent substance-related
             legal problems; or continued use despite persistent or recurrent social or
             interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the substance;

          -  Admitted alcohol abuse or history of alcohol use that may interfere with the subject's
             ability to comply with the protocol requirements in the opinion of the Investigator;
