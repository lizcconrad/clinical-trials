  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are one of the leading causes of coronary artery disease
      mortality, and among the top reasons for health care utilization in Canada. Physical activity
      counselling is a core component of secondary prevention interventions because increased
      physical activity is associated with reduced mortality risk, improved quality of life,
      reduced coronary risk factors, and reduced health care utilization. Despite these health
      benefits, between 40% and 60% of patients after an ACS event are insufficiently active.
      Web-based interventions offer innovative alternatives for intervention delivery via the
      Internet in secondary prevention. However, there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials
      testing, in ACS patients, computer-tailored interventions that include videos within the
      tailored algorithm. The purpose of this multicenter randomized controlled trial is to test a
      web-based intervention, TAVIEenM@RCHE, that uses tailored-videos of a nurse, the 'virtual
      nurse', aimed at increasing physical activity through walking in ACS patients.

      After baseline data is collected, the participants (N = 148) will be randomized to either one
      of two groups: 1) access to the 4-week TAVIEenM@RCHE intervention with an additional
      &quot;booster&quot; at 8 weeks (experimental group) or 2) access to a list of publicly available
      websites (control group). Participants will be included if they report insufficient levels of
      physical activity prior hospitalization, and they have no serious medical conditions impeding
      adherence to moderate-intensity physical activity. Data collection will occur at recruitment
      (in-hospital), at baseline (home 3 weeks post-hospital discharge), and at 5 and 12 weeks post
      baseline. The data analysis will be consistent with intention-to-treat principles. Baseline
      characteristics will be compared using descriptive statistics to identify trends in group
      imbalances. For the analysis of the primary outcome of change in steps per day between
      baseline and 12 weeks, and the secondary outcome of change in steps per day between baseline
      and 5 weeks, a repeated measures ANCOVA model will compare the adjusted differences between
      the experimental and control groups at a significance of 0.05. For the analysis of the two
      secondary outcomes of change in energy expenditure in walking and in moderate-intensity
      physical activity between baseline and 5 weeks, and between baseline and 12 weeks, a repeated
      measures MANCOVA model will compare the adjusted differences between the experimental and
      control groups at a significance of 0.05.

    <description>The intervention goal is to increase up to 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity through walking. The intervention is underpinned by Strengths-Based Nursing Care that specifies nursing values, and by Self-Determination Theory that specifies variables to tailor the intervention. The four intervention strategies are: 1) Providing information and feedback, 2) Exploring reasons to build motivation, 3) Exploring strengths to build confidence (self-efficacy), and 4) Developing an action plan to maintain motivation and confidence (self-efficacy). The TAVIE system platform is designed to provide a fully automated, easy to navigate website, and the main mode of delivery is video clips of a 'virtual nurse' who presents the tailored intervention content.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Discharged 3 weeks home post ACS-related hospitalization.

          2. No serious medical condition exists that would impede adhering to moderate-intensity
             physical activity. Medical conditions include, for instance, incapacitating chronic
             pain, paralysis, equilibrium problems, diabetic ulcers, fluid restrictions, dyspnea,
             home oxygen dependency, cancer and others. Also, no environmental restrictions that
             would impede walking.

          3. Receives usual care follow-up post ACS-related hospitalization.

          4. Reported access to any computer device that has a USB port and this computer is
             connected to the Internet to allow upload of data from the accelerometer, and has
             speaker or headphones to enable listening to the intervention on the computer device
             of choice.

          5. Reported ability to read and speak French.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Reported sufficient physical activity during 6 months prior to hospitalization:
             performed at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week (30
             minutes five days a week) or at least 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity
             physical activity (25 minutes three days a week).

          2. Indicated in the medical chart or reported by staff, physical or
             psychological/cognitive that would make it impossible for the patient to provide
             informed consent.

          3. Documented New York Heart Association Class III to IV heart failure.

          4. Involved in other intensive regular clinical follow-up during TAVIEenM@RCHE.
