  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of clinical studies on SD-OCT of ocular pathologies and potential new
      clinical applications has recently been published in the peer-reviewed literature. However,
      the successful use of SD-OCT in routine clinical use depends upon the diagnostic sensitivity,
      biometric accuracy and reliability of the SD-OCT machines. This prospective, comparative,
      observational study aims to evaluate the imaging quality and diagnostic performance of two
      commercially available SD-OCT machines for both the anterior and posterior segment of the
      eye.
