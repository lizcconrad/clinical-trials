      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy
      (HIPEC) with Mitomycin C used during surgery for treatment of locally advanced colorectal
      carcinoma is effective in the treatment of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma.

      The Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is expected to be an effective
      treatment with minimal side effects, it has already provided clear benefits in terms of
      overall survival in patients with advanced cancer.

      This is an attractive option for the healthcare professionals who face daily to peritoneal
      recurrence after performing complex surgeries, however its application is difficult due to
      the cost and resources increase. This leads to the necessity of administering the treatment
      within a clinical trials and in order to obtain a significant power this clinical trials will
      be multicenter and it will be performed in several Oncological surgery Units highly
      specialised and with extensive experience in colorectal carcinoma.
