  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new PET imaging agent
      (Ga-68 HBED-CC PSMA) in order to evaluate it's ability to detection prostate cancer in
      patients with high risk disease prior to prostatectomy, patients with biochemical recurrence
      and patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer.

    <textblock>
      Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.
      Patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer will be imaged using Gallium-68 labeled
      HBED-CC PSMA in order to demonstrate its utility. The investigators plan to utilize this data
      to obtain further approvals of the HBED-CC PSMA compound, so that this agent will become
      available for clinical imaging in prostate cancer patients.

      This compound has been shown to be superior to choline based PET agents for the staging of
      prostate cancer, both Carbon-11 and Fluorine-18 compounds. But this compound was not patented
      and therefore no company or private entity will make the investment required to bring HBED-CC
      PSMA to market. In the vacuum of availability, academic groups must take the lead in order to
      collect the necessary data for future FDA approval.

      This study focuses on three patients populations that are imaged. In the pre-prostatectomy
      population, the primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity for
      detection on nodal metastasis. In the biochemical recurrence population, the primary
      objective is to determine the sensitivity of recurrence location. In the castrate resistant
      prostate cancer population the primary objective is to determine if PSMA PET detects more
      metastatic lesions than conventional imaging.

    <description>it will be assumed that all patients with biochemical recurrence will have active disease, therefore the estimated prevalence will be 100%. Therefore the sensitivity will be determined by the percentage of patients in which positive disease is noted.
