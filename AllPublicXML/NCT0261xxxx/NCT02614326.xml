  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A wealth of research has demonstrated that they way in which the investigators recall our
      personal, autobiographical memories is influential in the course of depression. Biases in the
      recall of autobiographical memory occur in the midst of a depressive episode, and are shown
      to prolong symptoms, however these biases also remain when depression remits, and may
      predispose the individual towards relapse. A novel cognitive intervention, MemFlex, aims to
      train individuals to be flexible in their retrieval of autobiographical memories, and thereby
      reduce depressive relapse. Changes in memory bias may also have an effect on intermediate
      processes that increase risk of depression, such as rumination, impaired problem solving, and
      cognitive avoidance. This feasibility trial compares the effects of MemFlex and
      Psychoeducation in their ability to reduce memory bias and intermediate cognitive risk
      factors, and thereby depressive relapse, in individuals remitted from Major Depressive
      Disorder. Clinical outcome and process measures will be assessed immediately following
      completion of the intervention, at 6 months post-intervention, and at 12 months
      post-intervention. If encouraging, the results of this pilot trial may provide a foundation
      for a later phase trial.

    <description>MemFlex training draws on cognitive bias modification and memory specificity training techniques (Raes et al., 2009; Dalgleish et al., 2014). MemFlex is primarily self-guided and aims to reduce autobiographical memory biases associated with depression. The training is presented over one face-to-face session and eight self-guided sessions. In the initial session, the researcher introduces cued-recall tasks used throughout the workbook, and guides the participant in completion of the tasks. When understanding of the basic principles is satisfactory, the researcher assists the participant to set a schedule for completion of the workbook over the following four weeks. The participant will receive a phone call at the beginning of week three to check progress, and clarify any difficulties.</description>

    <description>The psychoeducation condition will also complete an initial face-to-face session. This session will cover the symptoms and causes of depression, and the workbook will be introduced. The workbook will consist of eight self-guided sessions that the individual will be required to complete over four weeks. The workbook content will cover the presentation of depression and basic information on factors associated with depression, such as worry, procrastination, and sleep difficulties. Each session consists of psychological theories of the topic, followed by a series of questions about the material to ensure participant engagement. The participant will receive a phone call from a team member at the beginning of week three to check progress, and clarify any difficulties.</description>
