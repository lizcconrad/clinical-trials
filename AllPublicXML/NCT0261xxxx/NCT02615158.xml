      The hypothesis is that toddlers with parents who are randomized to a parenting intervention
      and toddlers with parents who are randomized to the maternal intervention focused on maternal
      diet and physical activity will be more likely to have weight status within normal and to
      consume a healthy diet and engage in physical activity than toddlers with parents in a
      placebo (safety) intervention.

      Background:

      Overweight is a serious public health problem which can begin in early childhood. Factors
      which contribute to overweight include: overfeeding, excessive intakes of fat and sugar;
      frequent sedentary activities (i.e. television watching).

      Overweight, defined as a BMI &gt; 95th percentile, in early childhood has reached epidemic
      proportions with 14% of 2-5 year olds overweight and 26.2% &quot;at risk of overweight,&quot; defined
      as a BMI &gt; 85th percentile (Ogden et al., 2006).

      Dietary and physical activity patterns established early in life track over time, making the
      first few years of life an ideal time to help families establish healthy eating and physical
      activity behaviors and avoid overweight. This project works to identify techniques that could
      prevent overweight.

      Purpose of Study:

      The investigators are collaborating with the Anne Arundel County, MD WIC Program and the
      University of Maryland's Pediatric Ambulatory Center to implement strategies that will
      prevent overweight among toddlers. The project focuses on the dietary, physical activity, and
      growth patterns of WIC toddlers. The investigators are conducting a 3-cell randomized trial
      consisting of: 1) a maternal intervention focusing on healthy diet and physical activity
      patterns for mothers; 2) a toddler parenting intervention focusing on parenting, limit
      setting, and development strategies; and 3) an intervention on child safety. The
      interventions are implemented over 3 months, with 8 sessions.

      The investigators hypothesize that altering maternal behavior will have a positive impact on
      the growth and development of the toddler by preventing behaviors that lead to overweight
      among children. The parenting intervention will improve parenting skills by offering
      information on proper approaches to feeding, discipline and educational play. The
      investigators will compare the growth patterns of toddlers whose mothers were randomized to
      the maternal and parenting interventions with those in the safety intervention. This study
      design allows us to examine the mechanisms linking the interventions to improvements in diet,
      physical activity, and growth.

      In addition, the investigators will conduct the safety promotion intervention for the
      attention control group, considering the high risk of unintentional injuries among the
      toddlers from low-income families. The investigators also hypothesize that the safety
      promotion intervention will reduce the safety problems of the toddlers' homes. The underlying
      mechanisms will be examined, if there is a significant intervention effect.

    <description>At each session, mothers will identify a dietary goal for the next session (e.g., reduce soda intake). They will learn to track and evaluate their progress, setting new goals or modifying existing ones as necessary. Mothers will be given pedometers and shown how to keep a pedometer tracking chart. As with dietary choice, our objective is to have the mothers identify personal goals and strategies to achieve those goals, so they are more likely to continue to engage in physical activity after the intervention ends.</description>
