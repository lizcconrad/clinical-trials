      In previous studies the investigators have demonstrated that gamma-tocopherol-enriched (yT)
      supplementation decreased systemic oxidative stress, increased serum levels of yT, and
      inhibited monocyte responses to LPS without any adverse health effects. Free Radic Biol Med.
      2008 Jul 1;45(1):40-9. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.03.002. Epub 2008 Mar 12.

      Oxidant stress plays an important role in mucosal inflammation. Oxidant stress occurs
      individuals after exposure to air pollution, including high levels of ozone, LPS exposure and
      woodsmoke particle exposure. Potential exposure to all of these are naturally occurring
      events. Previous studies have also shown that asthmatic individuals tend to have lower
      endogenous levels of antioxidants such a s vitamins E and C, and that supplementing
      antioxidants can decrease exacerbation's associated with ozone exposure in children. The
      investigators are interested in future studies to examine the benefits of a rapid gamma
      tocopherol supplement in individuals who will be exposed to air pollution, either in a
      controlled chamber study or in a real life event, such as during high O3 days or when a
      woodsmoke fire is in their neighborhood.

      This study is to address the question: can the investigators see an increase in serum levels
      of gT with a shorter course of gT supplementation? Additionally, before embarking on other
      investigations of gT as a potential prophylactic supplement, it is prudent to determine is
      discernible levels can be achieved with a shorter dose of gT.
