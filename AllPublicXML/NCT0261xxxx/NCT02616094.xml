    <textblock>
      Extending previous findings, and applying a novel multi-method translational approach, this
      project hypothesizes that there are alcohol-related neuroendocrine and neural changes
      observable in acute and protracted abstinence, and which can accurately classify future
      relapse and treatment outcome in separate alcohol dependent (AD) patient samples, thereby
      validating them as biomarkers of relapse, with potential clinical utility as prognostic
      markers in identifying and treating those most susceptible to relapse.

    <description>The Time-Line Follow-Back Interview will be used to assess alcohol use in the previous ninety days (which is standard for TLFB surveys), during the study and during follow-up. This can only be measured once relapse occurs. It will be measured once relapse occurs or will not be measured at all if relapse does not occur within 200 days.</description>

    <description>Group consists of 100 treatment seeking alcohol dependent (AD) men and women (ages 18-60). AD subjects will complete either 8 weeks of outpatient treatment at the Yale Stress Center, or the first 4 weeks as inpatient treatment at the CNRU, followed by 4 weeks of outpatient treatment at the Yale Stress Center. While in outpatient treatment, AD subjects may be admitted to the CNRU or HRU for the 1-5 days prior to one or both of their scans, to ensure abstinence for their scans.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Group consists of demographically and handedness matched 50 socially drinking controls. Healthy controls will be moderate and binge/heavy social drinkers who will participate in a single MRI session after baseline assessments. Healthy controls may be admitted to the HRU overnight prior to their scan.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Prazosin/Placebo Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This is a separate group of 60 treatment seeking AD subjects in a NIAAA-funded RCT of Prazosin vs placebo for alcohol dependence ( PI: Sinha, Hic protocol 0705002691, NCT00585780) to assess target primary and secondary predictors of alcohol treatment outcomes in the context of a currently ongoing RCT. AD subjects enrolled in the PZ/PL RCT will NOT be given drugs as part of this study. That study and intervention is listed elsewhere (NCT00585780). Subjects will participate in a baseline scan and a second scan between weeks 10-12 of the 12-week RCT with follow-ups. PZ/PL is only given to subjects enrolled in 0705002691, not the current protocol.</description>

    <description>The MRI scan will be conducted on a 3-T Siemens Trio MRI system equipped with a standard quadrature head coil, using T1 MPRAGE sequence for structural scanning and T2*-sensitive gradient-recalled single shot echo planar pulse sequence for functional scans. Two multimethod MRI scans will be conducted in the AD sample, while the controls will participate in a single scan.</description>
