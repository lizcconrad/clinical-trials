  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effect of tucatinib vs. placebo in combination with capecitabine and
      trastuzumab on progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 based on independent central
      radiology review.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, international, multi-center, double-blinded study in patients with progressive
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer who have had prior treatment
      with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive
      tucatinib or placebo in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab.

      Stratification factors include presence or history of treated or untreated brain metastases
      (yes/no), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (0 vs. 1), and
      region of world (US vs Canada vs Rest of World).

      No crossover from placebo to tucatinib will be allowed.

      Safety assessments will be performed at a minimum of once every three weeks throughout study
      treatment and 30 days after the last dose of study drugs. Laboratory assessments will be
      performed locally at sites. Left ventricular ejection fraction will be assessed by MUGA or
      ECHO at screening and once every 12 weeks thereafter.

      Contrast brain MRI will be performed at baseline in all patients. Efficacy assessments (CT of
      chest, abdomen and pelvis at a minimum) utilize RECIST 1.1 and include patients with
      evaluable tumors defined as measurable target lesions and non-measurable non-target lesions.
      RECIST assessment is performed at baseline, every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, and then
      every 9 weeks thereafter. Repeat MRI of the brain will be required on this same schedule only
      in those patients with brain metastases identified at baseline. All treatment decisions are
      made based upon investigator assessment. All patients undergo a repeat MRI of the brain
      within 30 days of the end of treatment unless previously performed at time of disease
      progression. Patients in both arms of the study will be followed for OS after completion of
      study treatment.

                  contrast brain MRI performed during screening for this study may be eligible to
                  enroll if the following criteria are met:

             i. Time since whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is ≥ 21 days prior to first dose of
             study treatment, time since stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is ≥ 7 days prior to first

             progression or toxicity)

          2. neratinib, afatinib, or other investigational HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor
             (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) at any time previously

          3. previously been treated with capecitabine for metastatic disease except in cases where
             capecitabine was given for &lt; 21 days and was discontinued for reasons other than
             disease progression or toxicity. Patients who have received capecitabine for adjuvant
             or neoadjuvant treatment at least 12 months prior to starting study treatment are
             eligible.
