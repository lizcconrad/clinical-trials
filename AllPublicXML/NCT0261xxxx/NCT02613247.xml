    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common overuse injury seen in the athletic
      population, particularly amongst runners. The standard of care treatment for PFPS is a
      comprehensive active rehabilitation program. Eighty percent of patients with PFPS report
      improvement in their symptoms with such a program. Unfortunately, the remaining twenty
      percent fail to achieve adequate symptom relief with rehabilitation alone. Considering the
      enormous number of individuals running for fitness, PFPS represents a significant challenge
      to public health as the investigators strive to encourage active living in our society.

      A relationship between PFPS and the development of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) has
      been suggested in scientific literature. Given that intra-articular viscosupplementation
      (hyaluronic acid) injections have shown clinically significant symptom improvement in knee
      osteoarthritis, and PFPS is likely on the same spectrum, the investigators propose a trial
      for therapy-resistant PFPS.

      Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring molecule found in the synovial fluid of freely
      movable joints (such as the knee). It is believed to contribute to lubrication and cushioning
      in these joints. The composition of synovial fluid within arthritic joints is altered,
      resulting in reduced fluid viscosity and elasticity. One modern formulation of hyaluronic
      acid is Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc-One, Sanofi Canada). This treatment is offered as a single
      injection and will be utilized in this clinical trial.
