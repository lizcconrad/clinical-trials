  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how taking JNJ-54861911 every day will effect the
      amount of rosuvastatin or metformin in your blood after taking only a single dose of either
      one.

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      fixed sequence, 2-panel study in a total of 32 healthy adult participants (16 participants
      per panel). The study consists of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of approximately 3 weeks (Days
      -22 to -2), an Open-Label Treatment Phase consisting of a single 19 day Treatment Period for
      Panel 1 (Days -1 to 18) or a single 18 day Treatment Period for Panel 2 (Days -1 to 17) and a
      Follow-up Phase of 5 to 7 days. In Panel 1, each participant will be administered a single
      oral dose of 10 milligram (mg) rosuvastatin on Day 1 and Day 14. Participants will receive
      JNJ-54861911 at a dose of 25 mg once daily from Day 8 until Day 17. In Panel 2, each
      participant will be administered a single oral dose of 500 mg metformin on Day 1 and Day 14.
      Participants will receive JNJ-54861911 at a dose of 25 mg once daily from Day 8 until Day 16.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The AUC (0‐infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration‐time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC (last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC (last) is area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C (last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda (z) is elimination rate constant.</description>
