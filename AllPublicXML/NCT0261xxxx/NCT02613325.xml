  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose the use of functional photoacoustic microscopy (fPAM) to evaluate
      both benign and malignant pigmented lesions for tumor depth. Through fPAM analysis followed
      by histological examination, the investigators anticipate that they will be able to
      non-invasively determine tumor depth of pigmented lesions (moles and melanoma). In melanoma,
      tumor depth (Breslow's depth) is not only an important prognostic indicator, but also directs
      surgical treatment. The ultimate goal is to develop a sensitive clinical tool that will allow
      non-surgical evaluation of pigmented lesions, which eventually, will aid in melanoma
      diagnosis and management - potentially an earlier and more definitive surgical management.

      In addition, the investigators propose to use the combination of fPAM and single-cell PAM to
      respectively image CTCs in trunk vessels and cuticle capillaries. Based on the investigators'
      murine models, the investigators anticipate that they will be able to differentiate CTCs from
      other blood cells and reliably calculate CTC concentration in a non-invasive manner. CTC
      concentration has been demonstrated to be a valuable indicator of a melanoma's metastatic
      potential and a potential tool in evaluating treatment efficacy. The ultimate goal is to
      develop a sensitive imaging device that will allow accurate evaluation of the risk of
      melanoma recurrence and metastases, that may facilitate treatment monitoring.

    <description>fPAM imaging will be performed prior to scheduled excision. The time to excision will not be extended longer than 2 weeks for imaging purposes.
When the participant presents for imaging, the area of the thickest lesion depth will be determined by fPAM. The area of deepest thickness will be marked perpendicular to the longest axis of the lesions and a clinical photo will be taken and placed in the image storage database.
Surgical excision will be performed as standard of care and fPAM depth will be compared with histological examination.
To image CTCs in cutaneous blood vessels, a small cuticle area on a finger will be imaged (Single cell PAM imaging) and the most distal cutaneous metastasis or metastasis of largest diameter will be imaged</description>
