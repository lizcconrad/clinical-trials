      Recent studies have proved :

      -Garlic oil as garlic may reduce platelet aggregation, patients taking anticoagulant
      medication are cautioned about consuming garlic.

      A 2013 meta-analysis concluded that garlic preparations may effectively lower total
      cholesterol by 11-23 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by 3-15 mg/dL in adults with high cholesterol
      if taken for longer than two months. The same analysis found that garlic had a marginally
      positive effect on HDL cholesterol, no significant effect on blood triglyceride levels, and
      that garlic preparations were generally well tolerated with very few side effects.

        -  Nattokinase Nattō is made from fermented soybeans and has been eaten in Japan for about
           a thousand years. Nattō is produced by fermentation by adding the bacterium Bacillus
           natto to boiled soybeans. Nattokinase is produced by the bacterium acting on the
           soybeans . While other soy foods contain enzymes, it is only the nattō preparation that
           contains the specific nattokinase enzyme.

        -  Estradiol valerate is one of the most widely used esters of estradiol.

        -  Progesterone: Hormone replacement therapy. Progesterone is combined with 17-beta
           estradiol in the estrogen patch.
