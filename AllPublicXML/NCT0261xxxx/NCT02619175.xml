      aims:

        1. To characterize compensatory balance reactions to platform translations during standing
           and walking in poststroke individuals in comparison to healthy individuals.

        2. To explore the effect of lesion characteristics (location, size) on the patients'
           balance reactions.

        3. To explore the impact of clinical measures of unilateral sensory motor impairments,
           balance, gait and fear of falling on postural reactions in stroke subjects.

        4. To examine the effect of a perturbation-based balance training on balance reaction
           characteristics in post stroke individuals.

      Study design: Two stage study. Stage 1 - examination, stage 2 - intervention. stage 1: 60
      post-stroke subjects will be recruited from rehabilitation units at Loewenstein hospital,
      Raanana, Israel. 60 healthy age-matched controls will be recruited by snowball sampling
      method from the physical therapy department and will be matched as close as possible for
      gender and BMI.The following measurements will be administered:

      1)Compensatory balance reaction measurement:

      Compensatory balance reactions will be measured using the BalanceTutor (MediTouch). The
      BalanceTutor is a mechatronic device consisting of a computerized treadmill with a horizontal
      movable platform and an operator station. Measurements will be taken in two conditions:

      Standing. Subjects will be instructed to stand and will be exposed to random unexpected
      platform translations. The platform translations will be increased systematically and
      controlled. The increases in platform translation will be adjusted by the examiner to the
      subject's ability to recover from perturbations. Participants will be asked to respond in a
      &quot;natural&quot; manner to perturbations.

      Walking. Subjects will be instructed to walk comfortably (self-paced) on the treadmill, and
      will be exposed to random unexpected platform translations. The platform translations will be
      increased systematically and controlled and will be adjusted by the examiner to the subject's
      ability to recover from perturbations. Compensatory balance reaction characteristics
      (reaction time, swing time, compensatory step time, step length etc.) will be collected
      through a three-dimensional motion analysis system. During examination subjects will wear a
      loose safety harness that will prevent a fall and yet allow the execution of balance recovery
      reactions.

      In addition, clinical measures will be used: Berg Balance Scale, 6 minute walk test, 10 meter
      walk test, the Fugl-Meyer test for motor recovery after stroke and the ABC
      (Activities-specific Balance Confidence) scale. Normalized lesion data will be computed using
      the ABLE module within MEDx software (Medical Numerics).

      Stage 2 - 60 stroke subjects from the neurology rehabilitation unit at Loewenstein hospital
      will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: 1) perturbations based balance training 2)
      Balance and gait training without external perturbations (control).

      Group 1 - Perturbations based balance training Subjects will complete a perturbation based
      balance training while standing and walking on the BalanceTutor (MediTouch). Perturbation
      level will be individually adjusted and progressed according to subject's abilities.
      Progression occurs by increasing perturbation level (increase distance, velocity and
      acceleration). At each practiced level subjects will be exposed to random
      right/left/forward/backward unannounced platform translations while standing and to
      right/left perturbations (in defined events in gait cycle) while walking. In order to examine
      adaptation to repeated perturbations, kinematic data will be collected in the first session.

      Group 2 - Balance and gait training without external perturbations (control) Subjects will
      complete a balance training program that includes voluntary weight shifting while standing on
      a computerized posturography (NeuroCom) and walking on a treadmill. Weight shifting toward a
      target will be adjusted and progressed according to subject's abilities. Progression in
      difficulty level will occur by increasing the distance to target without changing the base of
      support. At each practiced level weight shifting will be conducted to
      right/left/forward/backward directions. In the gait part of the session, subjects will be
      asked to walk at their preferred treadmill walking speed.

      Subjects in both groups will complete 10-12 training sessions, 4-5 per week for 3 weeks. Each
      session will last 30 minutes and will include practice in standing and walking. Subject's
      activities will be documented in each session in both groups. Furthermore, in each session
      subjects will be asked to rate their perceived level of challenge on a 0-10 scale.

      In addition to training sessions pre- and post-intervention measurements as in stage 1 will
      be conducted. In addition, an accelerometer will be placed with a sticker on the subject's
      thigh for recording 24-48 hour activities. A follow-up measurement will be conducted 3-6
      weeks post intervention.
