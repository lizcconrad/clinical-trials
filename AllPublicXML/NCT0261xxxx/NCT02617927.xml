      The safety assessment of Vedolizumab during pregnancy in IBD patients.

      The primary objective of this study is:

        1. To quantify incidence of major structural birth defects and other birth outcomes in
           infants born to women with UC/CD with exposure to Entyvio compared to women with
           exposure to other biological agents or conventional IBD therapy during pregnancy

        2. To assess the health and developmental status of infants up to 1yr of age.

      The IBD MOM clinic currently follows women with IBD from the preconception stage through
      postpartum period. In addition, we have now started following the offspring for 1 year with
      an option of extending the follow up until 4 years after birth with participation of the
      family health center. Data is collected longitudinally on use of non-immunomodulator
      medications, AZA/6MP, biologic therapy infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and natalizumab.
      Corticosteroids,5-ASA and Methotrexate), disease activity during gestation, complications of
      pregnancy and delivery, and infant birth outcomes during the first year of the child's life
      because from population-based data, including the Kaiser sample1 and studies from Europe2-4
      women with IBD clearly have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm
      birth and/or low birth weight infants, even with inactive disease.10.

      Study duration: September 2015- September 2022 This is a non-interventional observational
      prospective cohort study to be conducted in an actual clinical practice setting.

      This is an exposure-based cohort study in which there will be 3 reference groups. Women on
      conventional therapy only, women on Vedolizumab and women on other biologics.

      The source database contains information collected from our IBD MOM clinic in Shaare Zedek
      Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel.

    <time_frame>1 year from birth</time_frame>
    <description>A major Body measurements defect is defined as a defect that has either cosmetic or functional significance to the child (eg, a cleft lip), as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; [4]). These defects in aggregate typically occur in &lt;4% of the general population. Over 100 specific structural defects are considered to be major. Measurements of head circumference, length, weight, palpebral fissure length, inner canthal distance, ear length, and philtrum length will be taken. These will be compared to mean values for infants of the same age and sex (where sex-specific normative data are available). Less than or greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean will be used to define such terms as microcephaly, hypertelorism, etc.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minor body measurements defects of the infant</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year from birth</time_frame>
    <description>A minor structural defect is defined as a defect that has neither cosmetic nor functional significance to the child (eg, complete 2,3 syndactyly of the toes) and is identified using a study-related checklist incorporated into the study dysmorphology examination of live born infants.
Measurements of head circumference, length, weight, palpebral fissure length, inner canthal distance, ear length, and philtrum length will be taken. These will be compared to mean values for infants of the same age and sex (where sex-specific normative data are available). Less than or greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean will be used to define such terms as microcephaly, hypertelorism, etc.</description>

    <description>Is defined as an enrolled subject where follow-up information on the outcome (live birth, fetal loss) is not obtainable, or for a live birth if the birth defect status is designated as &quot;unknown&quot;. The OTIS Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy Project has experienced extremely low losses to follow-up (&lt;5% of enrolled subjects) by virtue of maintaining consistent contact with the pregnant woman. Before a subject is designated as lost to follow up, the subject or reporter receives at least 3 reminder telephone calls (documented in the database) followed by written correspondence and alternative contact information that is requested upon enrollment is utilized. Voluntary subject withdrawals will be considered separately.</description>
