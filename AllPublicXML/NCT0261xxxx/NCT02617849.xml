                  subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN

               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with
                  total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver
                  metastases

               -  Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL

               -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT)

               -  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless subject is
                  receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range
                  of intended use of anticoagulants ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving
                  anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of
                  intended use of anticoagulants

          8. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         10. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with

         11. No known active or chronic infection with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:

          1. Has had prior treatment for advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Prior
             treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors is permitted in this setting. A washout of at
             least 5-half-lives (median terminal half-life) prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment must have elapsed.

          2. Has received prior therapy with an anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2
             agent.

          3. Has evidence of symptomatic CNS lesions as determined by the investigator. Patients
             with asymptomatic lesions or previously irradiated or surgically resected are
             eligible.

          4. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

          5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy (&gt;10 mg
             daily prednisone equivalents) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7
             days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and
             adrenal replacement doses ≤ 10 mg prednisone equivalents are permitted.

          6. Has ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.

          7. Patients with an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune
             disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.
             Patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy is an exception to this
             rule. Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid
             injections would not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism stable
             on hormone replacement will not be excluded from the study.

          8. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          9. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         10. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         11. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         12. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

         13. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
