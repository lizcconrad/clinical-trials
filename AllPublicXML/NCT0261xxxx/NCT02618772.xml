  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laceration repair can cause significant anxiety in children. As open wounds account for
      21-25% of injuries in children presenting to the emergency department, the management of
      anxiety is of great importance. Anxiety can often lead to poor patient cooperation and the
      use of potentially excessive physical restraint. High rates of procedural anxiety have also
      been correlated with increased rates of negative behaviours after discharge.

      The current standard of care for suture closure of lacerations throughout most of Canada is
      to provide local analgesia only. The literature has therefore focused on finding anxiolytic
      adjuncts to local analgesia.

      Midazolam is an ideal adjunct due to its fast onset and short duration of action with an
      excellent safety profile. The advantages of the IN route are less pain on administration when
      compared to the IV and IM routes, and increased acceptability compared to the rectal route in
      older children. Oral midazolam also has poor palatability.

      While the onset of INM at 5-10 minutes, and duration of 20-40 minutes make it an ideal
      candidate for anxiolysis in the ED its use has been limited by the common side effect of
      nasal irritation, burning and lacrimation when it is administered in its droplet form. The
      recent development of mucosal atomization devices (MAD) has resolved this issue by delivering
      30-Î¼ particles to the nasal mucosa.

      Previous studies investigating the use of INM for laceration repair in the pediatric ED have
      demonstrated that INM is safe but most used non-validated measurement tools to assess anxiety
      and facilitation. Only one of these studies used atomized INM, retrospectively examining
      safety as the primary outcome. The authors reported an excellent safety profile for INM using
      the mucosal atomization device MAD-300 (Wolfe Tory Medical Inc.). The use of atomized INM for
      anxiolysis during pediatric laceration repair has not been evaluated prospectively.

      Most studies have focused on preschool aged children (&lt;6 years). While studies have
      demonstrated that the prevalence of procedural anxiety is higher in younger children, up to
      51% of children age 7-12 years experience high levels of procedural distress. The
      effectiveness of INM in the pre-adolescent age group is, therefore, yet to be determined.

      It is hypothesized that INM will reduce anxiety in children age 2-12 years undergoing
      laceration repair and will facilitate the successful completion of suturing by the physician.

    <measure>Intention to Treat (ITT): Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score (mYPAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: During suturing</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of patient anxiety used to test effect of anxiolytic pre-medication.The mYPAS consists of 5 items (activity, vocalizations, emotional expressivity, state of apparent arousal, and use of parents). Each item has Likert scale whereby participant's behavior is rated from 1 to 4 (Note: Vocalizations is the only item rated from 1 to 6), with higher numbers indicating the highest severity within that item. Each participant was given a mYPAS score for the &quot;suturing&quot; by two independent raters. These raters watched a digital recording of the participant undergoing suturing and from this digital recording used the mYPAS scale to assign a measurement of the participant's anxiety.
The mYPAS scale is rated as follows: Final scores = (Activity/4 + Vocal/6 + Emotional/4 + Arousal/4 + Parents/4) X 20. Scores range from 23 to 100 where a lower score is indicative of a lower level of anxiety and a higher is indicative of a higher level of anxiety.</description>

          <description>This baseline measure describes the blood pressure (diastolic) at triage measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Note: not all participants had their blood pressure (diastolic) measured at triage.
This is for the Intention to Treat analysis and thus, includes all participants that received the study intervention i.e., intranasal saline or intranasal midazolam.
This is for the per-protocol analysis and thus, includes all participants who fulfill the protocol in the terms of eligibility, all interventions, and outcome assessment.</description>

        <title>Intention to Treat (ITT): Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score (mYPAS)</title>
        <description>Measurement of patient anxiety used to test effect of anxiolytic pre-medication.The mYPAS consists of 5 items (activity, vocalizations, emotional expressivity, state of apparent arousal, and use of parents). Each item has Likert scale whereby participant's behavior is rated from 1 to 4 (Note: Vocalizations is the only item rated from 1 to 6), with higher numbers indicating the highest severity within that item. Each participant was given a mYPAS score for the &quot;suturing&quot; by two independent raters. These raters watched a digital recording of the participant undergoing suturing and from this digital recording used the mYPAS scale to assign a measurement of the participant's anxiety.
The mYPAS scale is rated as follows: Final scores = (Activity/4 + Vocal/6 + Emotional/4 + Arousal/4 + Parents/4) X 20. Scores range from 23 to 100 where a lower score is indicative of a lower level of anxiety and a higher is indicative of a higher level of anxiety.</description>

          <title>Intention to Treat (ITT): Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score (mYPAS)</title>
          <description>Measurement of patient anxiety used to test effect of anxiolytic pre-medication.The mYPAS consists of 5 items (activity, vocalizations, emotional expressivity, state of apparent arousal, and use of parents). Each item has Likert scale whereby participant's behavior is rated from 1 to 4 (Note: Vocalizations is the only item rated from 1 to 6), with higher numbers indicating the highest severity within that item. Each participant was given a mYPAS score for the &quot;suturing&quot; by two independent raters. These raters watched a digital recording of the participant undergoing suturing and from this digital recording used the mYPAS scale to assign a measurement of the participant's anxiety.
The mYPAS scale is rated as follows: Final scores = (Activity/4 + Vocal/6 + Emotional/4 + Arousal/4 + Parents/4) X 20. Scores range from 23 to 100 where a lower score is indicative of a lower level of anxiety and a higher is indicative of a higher level of anxiety.</description>

        <description>Validated measurement of anxiety, to be used to test parental/guardian anxiety at two time points. These time points are before intervention and immediately after suturing (prior to patient discharge from the ER, i.e. same day). The STAI contains 10 items for assessing trait anxiety and 10 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a standard scale (&quot;Not at all&quot;, &quot;Somewhat&quot;, &quot;Moderately so&quot;, &quot;Very much so&quot;) with a range of 20 to 80 where higher scores indicate greater anxiety and lower scores indicate lower levels of anxiety.</description>

The scale shows a visuals (faces) for each levels 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 of the scale. For example, 0 is represented by a &quot;face&quot; visual that expresses no hurt.
FLACC Scale: Tool to assess pain in children unable to use Faces Pain Scale-revised. The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale or FLACC scale is a measurement used to assess individuals that are unable to communicate their pain. The scale is scored in a range of 0â10 (0 represents no pain).</description>
