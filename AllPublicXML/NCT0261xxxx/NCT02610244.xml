  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADHD youth (8-16 years) will be randomized to either treatment-as-usual group or a modified
      version of the Cogmed program (MCT) that is suitable for use in a hospital setting (duration
      = 3 daily 35-min sessions for 10 weeks). The main objectives are to determine whether there
      is improvement in working memory and attention, a reduction in concerns related to ADHD and
      social emotional behaviour,and transfer effects for reading and math following participation
      in our MCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Cogmed working memory training program consists of 5 daily 50-min sessions for 5 weeks.
      This program has been identified as a promising intervention for youth with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who have deficits in aspects of executive functioning (EF),
      such as working memory (WM) and attention (ATT), as well as social-emotional behavior (SEB).
      Findings regarding the efficacy and generalization of transfer effects associated with Cogmed
      have been mixed, possibly due to methodological limitations of the standard program. In our
      study, these limitations will be addressed with ADHD youth (8-16 years) in a randomized
      controlled trial using a modified version of the Cogmed program (MCT) that is suitable for
      use in a hospital setting (duration = 3 daily 35-min sessions for 10 weeks). The main
      objective is to determine whether there is improvement in WM and ATT, a reduction in concerns
      related to ADHD and SEB, and transfer effects for reading and math following participation in
      our MCT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Youth who are between 8-16 years age.

          2. Youth with a primary diagnosis of ADHD per psychiatric and psychological assessment.

          3. Youth with an estimated Intelligence Quotient (IQ) equal or greater than 80 on an
             intelligence measure (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; WASI), where the
             average IQ varies from 90-110.

          4. Youth with reading comprehension at or above a grade 2 level on a standardized reading
             test (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - 3rd Edition; WIAT-III).

          5. Youth who are receiving medication will have made an adequate adjustment to their
             medication as shown by stable blood levels, psychiatric consultation, and self and
             parent report at least 2 weeks prior to the start of their acceptance into this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Youth who are younger than 8 or older than 16 at the time of enrollment.

          2. Youth who do not have a primary diagnosis of ADHD.

          3. Youth with an estimated Intelligence Quotient (IQ) below 80 on an intelligence measure
             (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; WASI), where the average IQ varies from
             90-110. Children with intellectual functioning below this level have been found to
             have trouble following instructions that are necessary for the training program.

          4. Youth with reading comprehension below a grade 2 level on a standardized reading test
             (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - 3rd Edition; WIAT-III). Children with reading
             skills below this level have been found to have trouble following instructions that
             are necessary for the training program.

          5. Youth do not intend to begin new medication, discontinue existing medication, or
             change dose in medication - unless indicated per their doctor's instructions - for the
             duration of their involvement in the study.

          6. Youth cannot be accepted into the study if they have a significant medical impairment
             that would preclude their participation, a significant uncorrected visual/hearing
             deficit that would make it difficult for them to see a computer screen and follow
             verbal instructions, and/or a significant problem with their fine motor control that
             would make it difficult for them to use a keyboard.
