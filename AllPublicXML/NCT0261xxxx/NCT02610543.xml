  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week proof-of-concept
      study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of UCB5857 in subjects with primary
      Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy on overall disease activity
      and safety of UCB5857 added to current treatment relative to placebo in subjects with pSS.
