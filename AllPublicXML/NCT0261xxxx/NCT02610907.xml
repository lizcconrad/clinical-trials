    <description>This is a sub-study testing three patches consisting of an adhesive patch and a sleeve. The sleeve can contain one of three solutions:
Buffer Own output Simulated output (digestive enzymes)
All subjects will test the three solutions at the same time, hence the three patches with different solutions will be placed on the peristomal skin simultanously.</description>
