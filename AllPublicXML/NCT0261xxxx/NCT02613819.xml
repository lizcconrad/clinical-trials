      Who is it for?

        -  Age &gt; 18 years old

        -  All patients must have a biopsy confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with a
           single lesion within a kidney

        -  ECOGperformance of 0-2 inclusive.

        -  Life expectancy &gt; 9 months

        -  Either medically inoperable, technically high risk for surgery or decline surgery.

        -  Multidisciplinary decision for active treatment

      Study Details:

      Definitive external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is often used to treat medically inoperable
      patients with cancers in many different organs, including the kidneys. However, renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC) is conventionally considered &quot;radioresistant&quot; to fully fractionated EBRT. In
      an effort to overcome the perceived &quot;radioresistance&quot; of RCC, severely hypofractionated EBRT
      in the form of stereotactic radiotherapy has renewed interest in the management of renal cell
      carcinoma with radiotherapy. This study will be evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
      Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) for the treatment of cancers of the kidney.

      Participants in this study will be allocated to receive either multi-fraction SABR (3
      fractions over 2 weeks) or single fraction SABR (1 fraction only).

      All participants will be assessed at regular intervals post treatment in order to estimate
      the activity and efficacy of the technique, evaluate tolerability, estimate survival,
      estimate distant failure rate, and renal function change after SABR.

      The follow-up visits occur at 4 weeks and every 3 months in the 1st year post treatment, then
      every 6 months in the second year and then yearly until study closure (2 years after the last
      participant finishes study treatment).
