  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is a key intervention used to reduce the healthcare costs and the negative
      consequences of Parkinson Disease (PD) by improving walking and balance and reducing the
      number of falls. However, not all exercise classes provide the same results for people with
      PD. Specific exercises designed to target the features of PD have shown greater outcomes than
      generic physical activity. The exercise principles include high-intensity (size and speed)
      movement, task repetition, rhythmical rocking, mental imagery, cognitive strategies,
      treadmill walking, and making use of internal and external cues. Collectively these
      PD-specific exercises can be designed to be run in exercise groups. Structured exercise
      groups also include social interaction that is known to improve depression and apathy, both
      of which are features common in people with PD.

      This study will compare the effect of specific, long-term community-based exercise class on
      balance, walking, quality of life, and mood compare to self-directed exercise.

      Investigators anticipate that participants from the community-based, long-term intervention
      will show better improvements in balance and walking compare to participants that are
      self-directing their activities.

      This is a mixed-method, randomized design study. Participants will be assessed using
      qualitative and quantitative measures before and after a nine-month intervention.Outcome
      measures for motor function will be described using Paired t-tests for continuous variables
      and McNemar's Test for categorical variables. Participants will be recruited from the LGH
      NROP program, North Shore physicians, and the Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre Movement
      Disorders Clinic, UBC. Potential participants will be approached by their treating physicians
      during their clinical visits. People who are interested in participating in the study will be
      invited to contact the NROP Registered Nurse (RN) to discuss study participation and review
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study will recruit fifteen participants for the
      intensive community-based exercise group and fifteen for the self-directed exercise group.The
      sample size calculation was performed using G*power 3.1.9.2.Once participants provide a
      signed informed consent they will be randomly assigned to one of the groups by picking a
      number from 00 to 30 out of an envelope.

      The class will consist of evidence-based exercises such as: sustained, high effort exercises,
      resistance exercises, and endurance training. The other participants will continue on their
      own. All participants will be asked to fill out a physical activity diary regarding the
      frequency, duration, and intensity of the activities during the nine months trial.
