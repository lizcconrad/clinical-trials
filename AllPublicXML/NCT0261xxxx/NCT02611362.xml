      This study will develop and test a novel, smartphone based gaming intervention to improve
      adherence to medication to prevent HIV (known as Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, PrEP) and to
      decrease HIV risk behaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM). In the intervention,
      participants will engage with an immersive app/game on their iPhone that is connected to
      smart, electronic pill organizer/dispenser. Data on adherence from the pill dispenser will be
      integrated into the app/game wirelessly and will translate into enhancements during game
      play. While gaming, participants will gain information about their health, improve motivation
      for PrEP and medical appointment adherence, and practice healthy behaviors. If the
      intervention is found to be effective, it can be tested in a larger study and then
      disseminated to other people taking PrEP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of antiretroviral medications to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection
      (Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, PrEP) is an efficacious and promising new prevention strategy. In
      published studies, failure of PrEP was associated with poor adherence and low plasma drug
      levels. This indicates that optimal PrEP treatment will require behavioral interventions to
      promote adherence. Averting increases in risk behavior will also be essential for maintaining
      PrEP's protective effects. Interventions will need to address on-going HIV risk behavior and
      be relevant for persons using PrEP (e.g. young adult MSM). Borrowing from recent literature
      in HIV prevention and treatment adherence, interventions that utilize intuitive easy to use
      technologies with motivational components show promise for behavior change and dissemination.

      This study will examine a multi-level technology that integrates a medication monitoring
      device (Wisepill dispenser) WITH an interactive smartphone based app/game that is immersive
      and appealing. This novel, but intuitive multi-level technology will measure PrEP adherence,
      promote engagement in treatment and safe sexual behavior. The smartphone app/game will be
      developed to include content consistent with the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills
      (IMB) Model. While gaming, participants will experience absorbing action-oriented adventures
      that increase information about their health (e.g. knowledge about PrEP treatment and HIV),
      improve motivation (e.g. action-figures experience health benefits of adherence), and build
      skills (e.g. utilize clinicians as partners, condom self efficacy). Adherence data from
      participants' Wisepill device will be integrated into the app/game wirelessly and will
      translate into enhancements during game play. In-depth interviews with young adults on PrEP
      and an open trial of the intervention will inform the development of the intervention and
      procedures. A small randomized controlled pilot study among 50 participants on PrEP will
      examine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention (integration of the Wisepill dispenser
      with the IMB informed app/game). It is hypothesized that, compared to subjects in the control
      group, participants in the IMB Gaming Intervention will show: improved adherence to PrEP,
      higher blood ARV levels, decreased HIV risk behaviors, and improved self efficacy and
      attitudes for PrEP treatment adherence.

      The specific aims are:

        1. To create an engaging and absorbing smartphone based app/game with content consistent
           with the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model to measure and improve
           PrEP treatment adherence and safer sex behaviors, and to receive feedback on the game's
           utility and acceptability from in-depth interviews with MSM (estimated mean age 27).

        2. To conduct an open trial of the IMB Gaming Intervention (that integrates the electronic,
           portable medication dispenser and the IMB game, Viral Combat) with MSM to obtain further
           qualitative and quantitative information on its acceptability, and feasibility. These
           data will be used to modify the approach and technology as needed.

        3. To evaluate, in a 24 week randomized controlled pilot study (n=50), the preliminary
           efficacy of the IMB Gaming Intervention that integrates the electronic medication
           dispenser and the IMB informed app/game compared to a time, attention, and technology
           matched group. We will examine the impact of the IMB Gaming Intervention in improving
           treatment adherence (measured by medication dispenser openings, clinic visits attended,
           self-report) and biological measures (ARV levels). We will also examine the impact on
           HIV risk behaviors.

    <description>Intracellular TFV-DP and FTC-TP will be measured in red blood cells using dried blood spots. TFV-DP levels provide a measure of long-term adherence over the preceding month (like hemoglobin A1C) and a detectable FTC-TP provides information about recent dosing (i.e. if FTC-TP is detectable, a recent dose was ingested Y/N). The level of intracellular TFV-DP can be used to estimate how many doses/week the participant is taking on average (eg 7/wk on average, 4-7/wk on average, 2-4/wk on average, &lt;2/wk on average). 25µL will be drawn each time.</description>

    <description>The IMB Gaming Intervention is designed to improve information, motivation, and skills about adherence and HIV preventative behaviors throughout play. The mission of Viral Combat is: kill virus and build strength through taking medicine, learning HIV prevention information, and engaging with healthy characters in order to improve motivation and build skills. Wisepill openings translate into enhanced game play (i.e. &quot;nanobucks&quot; used to buy game enhancements). Participants will be told to take PrEP daily and phones and software will be coded to record and react to daily dosing. If a participant misses a dose, a message is sent from the Wisepill dispenser to study investigators' database on a secure server. Participants will get a game graphic with a supportive message such as &quot;Missing you: Get in the Game&quot; to their phones. Throughout the gaming intervention subjects will continue routine clinical care visits and HIV testing in the PrEP clinic.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>This condition will be matched with the IMB Gaming Intervention for appeal, time and attention. Subjects in COMP will each receive smartphones with the same data service plan as the active arm. Smartphones given to participants in COMP will have a stylistically similar non-PrEP, non-IMB game designed by Mission Critical Studios (Dr. Nano X: Incredible Voyage Inside The Body, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyHzSZFzU1Q ). This is the same game that Viral Combat is being adapted from. Therefore, the iPhone game in COMP will have a look and feel that is very similar to our intervention game but without IMB, PrEP, and HIV prevention related content. Participants will also receive a Wisepill device, which records pill dispenser openings, but there will be no dose related game enhancement or messaging. Similar to the Intervention group, participants will have routine clinical care visits in the PrEP clinic (or more frequently if needed for urgent care).</description>
