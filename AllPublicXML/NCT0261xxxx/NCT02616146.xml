  <brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Etonogestrel + 17β-Estradiol Vaginal Ring and Levonorgestrel-Ethinyl Estradiol Combined Oral Contraceptive in Adult Women at Risk for Pregnancy (MK-8342B-062)</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-Comparator Controlled Clinical Trial to Study the Contraceptive Efficacy and Safety of the MK-8342B (Etonogestrel + 17β-Estradiol) Vaginal Ring and the Levonorgestrel-Ethinyl Estradiol (LNG-EE) 150/30 μg Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC) in Healthy Women 18 Years of Age and Older, at Risk for Pregnancy.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the contraceptive efficacy of the ENG-E2 vaginal ring
      in women between 18 and 35 years of age based on the number of in-treatment pregnancies as
      expressed by the Pearl Index (PI). The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of
      ENG-E2 vaginal ring. The levonorgestrel-ethinyl estradiol (LNG-EE) 150/30 μg combined oral
      contraceptive (COC) will be used as the active comparator.
