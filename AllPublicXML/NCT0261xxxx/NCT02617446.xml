  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To Assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two different doses of istaroxime (0.5 and
      1.0 µg/kg/min), a new agent with lusitropic and inotropic activities that improves the
      cardiac contraction-relaxation cycle. The 2 doses of istaroxime (0.5 and 1.0 µg/kg/min) will
      be infused i. v. for 24 hours in comparison with placebo, in treatment of Chinese and Italian
      patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure. In all the Italian patients and in a subset
      of Chinese patients pharmacokinetics and metabolism of istaroxime shall also be studied.

             symptoms of hypoperfusion including cardiogenic shock, cold extremities and peripheral
             vasoconstriction, oliguria/anuria, signs of cerebral hypo perfusion such as confusion;
