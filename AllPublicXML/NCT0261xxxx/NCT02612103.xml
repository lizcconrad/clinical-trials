  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD). At the time of diagnosis it is not possible to predict the course of the
      disease, which can range from a few flares in a lifetime to uncontrollable disease leading to
      hospitalization, surgery and stoma. There is a continuous need to improve diagnostic and
      prognostic tools.

      In chronic inflammation diseases there is an excessive turnover of the extracellular tissue.
      Tissue is broken down to small fragments and released into the circulation. Changes in the
      amount of these fragments in the blood may provide information on the damage and quality of
      the affected tissue and may therefore act as objective measure of disease burden and severity
      - a so called biomarker.

      The potential of such biomarkers is evaluated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal
      survey including 300 patients with UC, CD, irritable bowel disease and healthy controls. The
      patients are followed for up to 1 year. Changes in biomarker are correlated to standard
      markers of inflammation during active disease and remission.

      Perspective The use of new biomarkers may offer a tool to evaluate early changes in the gut
      of patients with IBD, may be a supplement to the diagnosis, serve as markers for effect of
      treatment and prognosis, and in time be a good alternative to fecal samples or endoscopy.

        IBD and IBS patients at The Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Odense University
        Hospital will be asked to participate when they contact the department due to progression
        in disease activity or at their regular consultations in the out-patient clinic.

        Healthy controls will be recruited by advertising in local news paper and advertising in
        public places.
