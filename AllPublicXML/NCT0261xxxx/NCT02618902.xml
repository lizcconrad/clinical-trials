  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A first-in-human clinical trial to treat patients with multiple sclerosis by vaccination with
      tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC), generated using Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) will
      be conducted. In doing so, the feasibility and safety of administering myelin-derived
      peptide-pulsed tolDC in patients with MS will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase I dose-escalating clinical trial will be conducted in a coordinated and comprehensive
      manner to determine safety and tolerability, and to enable selection of a suitable dose
      regimen for phase II trials. The primary objective of the phase I study will be to determine
      whether tolDC-based therapy is safe and well tolerated and to establish the dose-response,
      with clinical relapse rates, neurological disability (assessed using various scales) and MRI
      endpoints, measured over 12 months. Patients will serve as their own controls pre- and
      post-vaccination. Completion of screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility
      criteria should take no longer than 6 weeks. First-line treatments will be stopped 6 weeks
      before baseline at the latest.
