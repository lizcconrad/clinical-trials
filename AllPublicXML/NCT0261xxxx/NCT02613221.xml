      To evaluate the combination of panitumumab and TAS-102 in patients with RAS wild-type
      metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) refractory to standard chemotherapy (oxaliplatin,
      fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan and anti-VEGF therapy).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combination of panitumumab and TAS-102 in
      patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) refractory to standard
      chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan and anti-VEGF therapy).

      Patients who are judged eligible for the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria
      will be received panitumumab (6 mg/kg) every 2 weeks and TAS-102 (35 mg/m² given orally twice
      a day in a 28-day) in 2-week cycle of 5 days of treatment followed by a 2-day rest period,
      and then a 14-day rest period.

      A maximum of 58 subjects will be enrolled.
