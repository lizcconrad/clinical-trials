    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of (0.02 mg EE as
      betadex clathrate [β-CDC]) / 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP) for dysmenorrhea. In order to
      appropriately evaluate the efficacy of EE(β-CDC)/DRSP the study was set up as a
      placebo-controlled comparative study

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suffering from dysmenorrhea for at least the previous 3 months prior to Visit
             1 with a minimum visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 30 mm with regard to pain during
             the menstrual period of the screening period

          -  Good general health (except for findings related to dysmenorrhea) as proven by medical
             history

          -  Patients aged 18 years or older at the time of obtaining informed consent; smokers
             must not be older than 35 years at the time point of informed consent

          -  Normal or clinically insignificant cervical smear not requiring further follow up (a
             cervical smear has to be taken at screening visit or a normal result has to be
             documented within the previous six months). Human papilloma virus (HPV) testing in
             subjects with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) can be used
             as an adjunctive test. Subjects with ASCUS can be included if they are negative for
             high-risk HPV strains (HPV 16, HPV18).

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree that adequate contraception will be used
             when they are sexually active. This applies from signing of the informed consent form
             until 2 weeks after the last study drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy (confirmed or suspected) or lactation (less than three months since
             delivery, abortion, or lactation before start of treatment)

          -  Patients who wish to become pregnant during the course of the study

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 32 kg/m2

          -  Hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drug

          -  Laboratory values outside inclusion range before randomization

          -  Any diseases or conditions that can compromise the function of the body systems and
             could result in altered absorption, excessive accumulation, impaired metabolism, or
             altered excretion of the study medication

          -  Any diseases or conditions that might interfere with the conduct of the study or the
             interpretation of the results

          -  Any disease or condition that may worsen under hormonal treatment according to the
             assessment and opinion of the investigator.
