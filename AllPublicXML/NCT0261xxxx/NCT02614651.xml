      The main objective of this study is to quantify vision parameters in subjects with concentric
      visual field constriction, and this in relation to the display on virtual reality goggles.
      More specifically:

        -  The maximum brightness value for visual comfort (THRESHOLD_MAX)

        -  The minimum value of the perceptible light contrast in low light perceptible
           (THRESHOLD_MIN)

        -  The speed of light change adaptation in the range [THRESHOLD_MAX-THRESHOLD_MIN] and
           [THRESHOLD_MIN-THRESHOLD_MAX].

      Secondary objectives are to:

      A. Quantifying the device parameters &quot;RV glasses + camera&quot; depending on visual acuity and the
      visual field of each subject:

        -  Optimal extent of the visual field provided by the device &quot;RV glasses + camera&quot;.

      B. Measuring the effectiveness of different image processing algorithms used in the
      development of the software part of this technical assist device:

        -  Capture and display HDR images (High Dynamic Range)

        -  Color adjustment.

    <arm_group_label>The study population</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The study population consists of subjects with a concentric constriction of the visual field (retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma) whose motor capacity allows the use of a computer keyboard with one hand. Subjects are recruited on a voluntary basis, from information disseminated to professionals in the rehabilitation of functional low vision and patient associations, in the Ophthalmology Service of the University Hospital of Nimes and within the ARAMAV Institute.
Intervention: Find visual comfort threshold related to light intensity
Intervention: Find the size of the visual field
Intervention: Effectiveness of brightness control
Intervention: Performance of color correction

    <intervention_name>Find visual comfort threshold related to light intensity</intervention_name>
    <description>In this testing session, the patient's visual comfort threshold related to light intensity will be determined. Test sessions are kept under 45 minutes.
The subject is sitting in front of a keyboard and a computer screen. He/she is invited to recognize letters successively displayed in the center of the screen, this center is marked with a black cross. Each letter appearance is preceded by a beep. The subject must click on the &quot;space&quot; bar on the keyboard as soon as he/she recognizes the letter, then gives his/her answer orally.</description>

    <intervention_name>Find the size of the visual field</intervention_name>
    <description>For these tests, the subject is seated at a table, 1.5m from a wall. It features a computer keyboard. It projects an image on the wall, using to a video projector. An image moving towards a target (along 16 different trajectories) is used to evaluate the size of the visual field.</description>

    <intervention_name>Effectiveness of brightness control</intervention_name>
    <description>During this testing session, the investigators seek to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms used to control the brightness.
The subject is in a room with four different computers. The subject is asked to identify the objects displayed on different computer monitors in the room: he/she must press a key on the keyboard when he/she detects an object and state aloud the nature of the object.</description>

    <intervention_name>Performance of color correction</intervention_name>
    <description>During this session, the investigators try to assess the performance for the color vision correction (saturation and hue).
The subject, while wearing the virtual reality glasses + camera performs a test (twice) that requires matching colored dots (i.e. a Farnsworth test) under controlled light conditions.</description>

    <description>The other interventions are performed with the use of virtual reality glasses, specifically the Vuzix Wrap 1200DX. In case of technical difficulties, the latter can be swapped with the Oculus Rift model or another model. The associated webcameras are from Logitech, and the exact model used can vary and does not carry any importance for this research.</description>
