  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Philips Sonalleve HIFU system is expected to be efficacious in reducing pain scores in
      patients with painful osteoid osteoma and other benign bone tumors, and in reducing their
      pain medication usage. No serious adverse effects are expected to result from this treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound
      (MR-HIFU) is safe and effective technique for alleviating the pain associated with osteoid
      osteoma and other benign bone tumors in paediatric patients and adults(up to age 40 yrs).
      This technique meant to be an alternative to the standard-of-care, radiofrequency and
      laser-based percutaneous ablation. Safety of the technique will be assessed through
      evaluating non-targeted heating using MRI based temperature mapping. and inspecting patients
      post treatment for skin burns or other signs of serious adverse events. Efficacy of the
      technique will be assessed by evaluating/recording patients observed pain, quality of life,
      and pain medication usage both before and up to 6 months following treatment.

             applicable.

          -  Weight &lt;140 kg (requirement to fit safely on top of the HIFU table and inside the
             MRI).

          -  Definitive radiographic &amp; clinical presentation of osteoid osteoma or other benign
             tumor lesion(avoiding need for biopsy).

          -  Pain specifically at the site of interest target lesion.

          -  Pain score for target lesion &gt;/= 4 (indicating at least moderate pain) or an
             age-appropriate pain scale.

          -  Target lesion is uncomplicated (i.e. no fracture/spinal cord compression/cauda equina
             syndrome/soft tissue component).

          -  MR-HIFU treatment date &gt;/= 2 weeks from most recent surgical treatment of lesion.

             cartilage/ bone growth).

          -  Target lesion located in skull, spine (excluding sacrum, which is allowed) or sternum.

          -  Scar along proposed HIFU beam path.

          -  Orthopaedic implant along proposed HIFU beam path or at site of target tissue.

          -  Serious cardiovascular, neurological, renal or haematological chronic disease.
