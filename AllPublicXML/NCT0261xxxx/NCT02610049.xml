      This is a randomized, controlled trial of adjunctive art therapy during cognitive processing
      therapy for PTSD.

      The objective of this study is to examine the effects of art therapy with combat veterans who
      have PTSD and to measure if it reduces symptoms more than verbal Cognitive Processing Therapy
      (CPT) alone. This study will incorporate art processes and materials into an already
      established protocol of CPT in order to create a sense of safety for veterans in beginning
      therapy, and access the nonverbal parts of the trauma in order to process it. Art-making will
      be used to help veterans address trauma and integrate who they were before the trauma with
      who they are currently. It will assist in addressing the grief and loss caused by combat, and
      will be used as veterans begin building a worldview and self-concept that are not filled with
      trauma and war. It is hypothesized that the veterans who receive art therapy with CPT will
      show a significantly greater decrease in PTSD symptoms than those who receive only CPT.
