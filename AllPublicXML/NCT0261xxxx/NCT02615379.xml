      EPIFLO® unit along with standard wound care vs only standard wound care for Surgical site
      infections (SSI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) after instrumented spinal fusions are not rare, and patients
      with SSI after instrumented spinal surgery often require repeat operations and prolonged
      intravenous antibiotic therapy. Wound hypoxia has been identified as a pathogenic mechanism
      behind wound infection and poor healing. Transdermal oxygen delivery (EPIFLO) has recently
      become a novel strategy to facilitate wound healing.

      The study doctor will give an EPIFLO® unit along with standard wound care to some subjects in
      this study to see if it is safe and can help them. Another purpose of this study is to find
      out if using EPIFLO® is better than getting only standard wound care for Surgical site
      infections (SSI). The sponsor also wants to compare the cost of using the study device and
      standard wound care to the cost of standard wound care alone. The U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) has approved EPIFLO® to treat skin ulcers (including diabetic skin
      ulcers), bedsores, amputations, skin grafts, burns, and frostbite.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to assess surgical site infection within 3 months of surgery for &quot;high risk&quot; patients undergoing posterior cervical, posterior thoracic, or posterior lumbar instrumented spinal fusions in patients receiving adjunct Transdermal Continuous Oxygen therapy vs. standard of care control. Surgical site infection will be clinically assessed by the PI according to CDC criteria. Independent blinded assessment by a clinician blinded to the allocation arm will also be obtained. The number of patients with infection (and the severity of infection) in the treated arm will be compared to the number in the control arm.</description>

    <description>Transdermal continuous oxygen therapy is oxygen delivery to the wound site directly. Ogenix makes a small portable oxygen concentrator (Trade Name: EPIFLO) that makes continuous transdermal delivery of oxygen possible. It is a 3 ounce oxygen generator that continuously delivers 3 ml of pure oxygen to the wound site.</description>
