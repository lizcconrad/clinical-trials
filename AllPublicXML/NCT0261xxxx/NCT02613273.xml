  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, open-label, three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the
      effects of 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise vs. 12 weeks of supervised resistance
      exercise vs. usual care in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer to
      determine the safety, feasibility, and tolerance of exercise; quality of life indicators, and
      a prognostic score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a PI-initiated, randomized clinical trial of 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise
      vs. 12 weeks of supervised resistance exercise vs. usual care among 60 men with metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer. Eligible men will be randomized with equal probability
      to one of the three regimens. All patients will receive a packet of print material on diet,
      exercise, and psycho-social support appropriately geared for men with late stage disease at
      the end of the trial. The aerobic exercise arm (N=20) will receive a 3 day/week supervised
      exercise regimen that includes high-intensity interval training and continuous vigorous
      intensity aerobic exercise training. The resistance exercise arm (N=20) will receive a 3
      day/week resistance exercise regimen incorporating different volumes and loads. Men in the
      control arm (N=20) will be asked to continue their typical exercise practices for 12 weeks.
      Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires, physical function and strength tests, body
      measurements, and collection of blood specimen at baseline and 12 weeks.
