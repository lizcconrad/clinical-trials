  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is a well-known group of obesity-related metabolic disorders
      including insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia and hypertension (HTN). In addition,
      overweight has a causal relationship with a chronic low grade systemic inflammatory condition
      and increased intestinal permeability. Over the last decade, this multiplex disorder has
      progressively become a major worldwide public health problem, because of its association with
      increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and
      all-cause mortality. Scientific evidence for measures to improve cardiometabolic and
      intestinal health by non-pharmaceutical means are of urgent need. Administration of the
      flavonoid hesperidin to those at risk may have beneficial effects on glucose / insulin
      metabolism, lipid metabolism, blood pressure, heart rate, pro-inflammatory and oxidative
      stress biomarkers and gut barrier function.

      Objective: To determine the 12-week effect of daily administration of hesperidin on the main
      cardiometabolic disorders related to MS as assessed by investigation of glucose/insulin
      metabolism, blood lipid profile, blood pressure, heart rate, body composition and gut barrier
      function in subjects at risk for MS.

      Study design: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with parallel
      design.

      Study population: Healthy (male/female) volunteers, age 18-65, at risk for metabolic syndrome
      (presenting with 2 out of 5 of the components from NCEP-ATP-III criteria).

      Intervention: Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the intervention groups. One
      group will receive one daily dose of hesperidin capsules while the other group receives
      identical looking placebo capsules for a period of 12 weeks. The capsules will have to be
      ingested with a glass of water every morning just before breakfast.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary efficacy parameter of this study is the oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a validated surrogate endpoint to study the β-cell function
      and insulin sensitivity. Secondary endpoints entail the evaluation of effects of daily
      administration of hesperidin on lipid profile (blood measurements), blood pressure and heart
      rate, body composition, low-grade inflammation biomarkers (blood measurements) and gut
      barrier function (blood measurements, fecal samples, urine collection).
