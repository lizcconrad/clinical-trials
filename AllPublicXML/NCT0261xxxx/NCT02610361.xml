        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.

          2. Male or female and at least 18 years of age.

          3. A life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor for which
             no effective standard therapy is available.

          5. One of B-RAF, N-RAS, or K-RAS mutation positive solid tumor.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1.

          7. Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          8. Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm^3

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm^3

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN
                  (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with known liver metastasis)

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min (calculated by the Cockcroft Gault formula).

          9. Female subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they are of:

             a) Non childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),
             including any female who

             i) Has had a hysterectomy,

             ii) Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy),

             iii) Has had a bilateral tubal ligation, or

             iv) Is post menopausal (total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year).

             b) Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 7
             days of the first investigational product administration), and uses adequate
             contraception before study entry and throughout the study until 28 days after the last
             investigational product administration. Adequate contraception, when used consistently
             and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician,
             are defined as follows:

             i) Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is the
             sole sexual partner for that female.

             ii) Any intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

             iii) Double barrier contraception defined as condom with spermicidal jelly, foam,
             suppository, or film; OR diaphragm with spermicide; OR male condom and diaphragm.

         10. Subjects with treated brain metastasis are eligible to enter and participate in the
             study if they are neurologically stable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

          2. Subjects receiving cancer therapy (chemotherapy or other systemic anti cancer
             therapies, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery) at the time of enrollment.

          3. Any major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment.

          4. Any radiotherapy within 14 days prior to enrollment, providing the subject has
             recovered from all toxicities to NCI-CTCAE ≤ Grade 1.

          5. Use of any investigational anti cancer drug within 28 days before the first
             investigational product administration.

          6. Unresolved toxicity &gt; Grade 1 (according to NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.03) from previous
             anti cancer therapy, unless agreed by the sponsor.

          7. History or presence of gastrointestinal disease or other condition known to interfere
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          8. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to the study drug or to any component of BGB-283. (To date there
             are no known Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved drugs chemically related to
             BGB-283).

          9. Untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastasis. Subjects with previously treated brain
             metastasis that are asymptomatic, off steroids for longer than 28 days are permitted.

         10. Any unstable, pre-existing major medical condition that in the opinion of the
             Investigator contra indicates the use of an investigational product, including active
             infection, known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive subjects, or known
             Hepatitis B or C.

         11. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.

         12. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening
             investigations, the investigator considers the subject unfit for study.

         13. Is on medication listed in the protocol or requires any of these medications during
             treatment with BGB-283.
