  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes has become a threat to human health and an independent risk factor to macrovascular
      and microvascular diseases. Large prospective clinical studies have shown a strong
      relationship between time-averaged mean levels of glycemia as measured by HbA1c and diabetes
      complications. However, in recent years several pieces of evidence indicated that glucose
      variability may also contribute to the development of diabetes complications. Thus, glucose
      variability may become a new target in treatment of diabetes. Traditional Chinese medicine，a
      kind of multitargeted compound, may contribute to maintaining blood glucose homeostasis in
      diabetes.

      Tianqi capsule(Chinese herbs extract) is a Chinese patent medicine approved to treat T2DM in
      China. Previous clinical studies have shown that Tianqi capsule could lower blood glucose
      measured by HbA1c. What's more, Tianqi capsule has also been proved to improve the
      glycometabolism and lipid metabolism in T2DM and IGT.

      This research adopts a randomized, open, parallel double blind, placebo controlled clinical
      method. The patients, meeting eligibility criteria, are divided into experimental group and
      placebo group and treated for 12 weeks . A main outcome，glucose variability is detected by
      continuous blood glucose monitoring system which could obtain continuous and comprehensive
      blood glucose by &quot;glucose sensor&quot;. The influence of Tianqi capsule on glucose variability in
      type 2 diabetes will be evaluated.

    <description>Glucose variability is evaluated by continuous glucose monitoring system, the main parameters include mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE)(mmol/L) and mean of daily differences (MODD)(mmol/L). The amplitude of glycemic excursions（AGE）is obtained by continuous glucose, MAGE is calculated using the criterion that both segments of the amplitude of glycemic excursions (AGE) exceed 1 SD, the calculations were carried out as described below, using the formula: MAGE (mg/dL)=∑AGE/n (n=number of glycemic excursions&gt;1 SD). The MODD was calculated as the mean of the absolute difference of glucose values from corresponding times of day from two consecutive days.</description>
