    <textblock>
      An exploratory study to examine the efficacy and safety of imatinib mesylate on the
      suppression of parasitemia in patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In
      vitro studies of P. falciparum parasitized erythrocytes demonstrate that inhibitors of the
      protein tyrosine kinase SYK prevent malaria parasite egress from infected red blood cells and
      thereby eliminate the parasitemia. Although no potent syk kinase inhibitors are currently
      approved for human use, a bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate (Gleevec®))
      that also exhibits weaker (15-fold) inhibition of syk tyrosine kinase, has been FDA-approved
      for treatment of a number of human malignancies including chronic myelogenous leukemia and
      GIST. Because imatinib can be taken daily for many years without significant toxicity, it can
      be used to obtain a preliminary indication of whether inhibition of erythrocyte syk kinase
      can suppress parasitemia in patients with P. falciparum malaria. If anti-malaria activity is
      observed with imatinib, resources will be committed to developing an inexpensive, more potent
      syk kinase inhibitor for dedicated treatment of malaria.

    <description>28-day cure rate was defined as the percentage of participants with blood parasite count of zero after 28 days of treatment and no evidence of recurrent infection with the same parasite genotype after reduction of the asexual parasitemia. Follow up after treatment will only be performed in the case of complete clearance of parasites at D5 due to Imatinib treatment.</description>
