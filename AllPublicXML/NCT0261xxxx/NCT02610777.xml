  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pevonedistat plus
      azacitidine versus single-agent azacitidine in participants with higher-risk myelodysplastic
      syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and low-blast acute myelogenous leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to
      treat people with myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and low-blast
      acute myelogenous leukemia as a combination treatment with azacitidine. This study will look
      at the overall survival, event free survival and response to treatment in people who take
      pevonedistat and azacitidine when compared to people who take single-agent azacitidine.

      The study will enroll approximately 117 participants. Once enrolled, participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in
      28-day treatment cycles:

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination

        -  Single-agent azacitidine 75 mg/m^2

      All participants will receive azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous route. Participants
      randomized to the combination arm will also receive pevonedistat intravenous infusion.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 45 months. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy
      if that occurs sooner. Participants will enter event-free survival follow-up or response
      follow-up (study visits every 3 months) if their disease has not transformed to AML (for
      participants with HR MDS or CMML) or progressed (for participants with low-blast AML), and
      they have not started subsequent therapy. Participants will also enter overall survival
      follow-up (contacted every 3 months to document subsequent therapies and survival status).

             the following:

             French American British (FAB) Classifications:

               -  Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) - defined as having 5% to 20%
                  myeloblasts in the bone marrow.

               -  CMML with 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5% to 19% blasts in
                  the blood.

             Worl health organisation (WHO) Classifications:

               -  RAEB 1 - defined as having 5% to 9% myeloblasts in the bone marrow.

               -  RAEB 2 - defined as having 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5% to
                  19% blasts in the blood.

               -  CMML 2 - defined as having 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5% to

                  method and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception at the same
                  time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 4 months after the
                  last dose of study drug, or

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only,
                  and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female
                  and male condoms should not be used together).

             Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (that is, status postvasectomy), who:

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner]
                  withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable
                  methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together).

         10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may

             pulmonary hypertension. As an example, well controlled atrial fibrillation would not
             be an exclusion whereas uncontrolled atrial fibrillation would be an exclusion.
