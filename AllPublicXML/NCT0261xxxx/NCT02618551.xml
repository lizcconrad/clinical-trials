  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial thermoplasty is a treatment for severe asthma that consist in decreasing the
      thickness of bronchial muscle by heat using a catheter inserted into the bronchi under direct
      vision with the help of an endoscope This treatment has shown efficacy on symptoms, quality
      of life and the number of exacerbations related to severe asthma.

      This clinical study evaluates the efficiency of this treatment on the dynamic hyperinflation
      phenomenon (worsening of bronchial obstruction during exercise in patients with asthma
      contributing to worsening shortness of breath).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial thermoplasty is a recently validated bronchoscopic technique for the management of
      severe asthma that treats smooth muscle by radiofrequency to reduce its thickness. This
      procedure leads to improved asthma control and quality of life, but also to decreased
      exacerbations frequency and number of emergencies hospitalizations. This treatment requires 3
      procedures every 3 to 4 weeks.

      The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying its effectiveness need to be better understood
      for an improved selection of best candidates. In particular, there is a discrepancy between
      the improvement observed in symptoms (ACQ), quality of life (AQLQ) and the lack of
      improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Investigator assume that this
      paradox is due to an efficiency appearing at effort, targeting dynamic hyperinflation
      phenomenon.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of bronchial thermoplasty on dynamic
      hyperinflation in severe asthma. The secondary objectives are to assess the effectiveness of
      bronchial thermoplasty (ACQ, AQLQ) in a selected population of patients with dynamic
      hyperinflation and to describe bronchial wall structural changes by probe-based confocal
      LASER endomicroscopy (pCLE).

The plethysmography will be made before the first procedure and three months after the third procedure.</description>

    <description>Three sessions of bronchial thermoplasty are needed to treat patients. There will be 3 to 4 weeks between each procedure.
Bronchial thermoplasty procedure is performed under general anesthesia. The medical device used in this research to achieve the thermoplasty is the Alair system (class IIb medical device ; Boston scientific)
A confocal endomicroscopy will be conducted at the first and final session of thermoplasty. This examination involves analyzing and recording the structure of bronchi microscopy through a small catheter placed on the bronchus. Photographs of the bronchi will be realized.</description>
