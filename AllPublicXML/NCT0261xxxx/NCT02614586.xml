  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether improvement in P50 (a pharmacodynamic
      marker) in auditory sensory gating is demonstrated after administration of TAK-058 and
      ondansetron compared to placebo in participants with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-058. TAK-058 is being tested to evaluate
      its effects on P50 auditory gating in people who have stable schizophrenia. This study will
      look at the effect of TAK-058 on P50 auditory gaiting of people with schizophrenia.

      This study will be performed in a sequential manner progressing from an optimization
      (screening) phase in healthy volunteers, to screening of subjects with schizophrenia in part
      1, to a 3 period crossover treatment phase in part 2. In the screening phase, 15 healthy
      volunteers will be enrolled to optimize the settings for the measurement of
      neurophysiological markers prior to any dosing in participants with schizophrenia. If
      optimization is not reached, the study will be terminated. In part 1 participants with
      schizophrenia will receive 2 P50 electroencephalography (EEG) sessions. A measurable deficit
      in auditory P50 gating S2/S1 ratio greater than (&gt;) 0.5 will be established during this
      phase. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be calculated for the P50 auditory
      gating S2/S1 ratios collected during the 2 sessions. If these P50 auditory gating S2/S1 ratio
      measurements are found to have at least a fair level of agreement within individuals (that
      is, ICC &gt; 0.5), part 2 of the study will begin. 12 participants demonstrating P50 impairment
      in part 1, will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the six
      treatment crossover sequences —which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Placebo + TAK-058 + Ondansetron

        -  TAK-058 + Placebo + Ondansetron

        -  Ondansetron + Placebo + TAK-058

        -  Placebo + Ondansetron + TAK-058

        -  TAK-058 + Ondansetron + Placebo

        -  Ondansetron + TAK-058 + Placebo

      All participants will be asked to take one dose of capsule, followed 1 hour later by one dose
      of solution on Day 1 of each intervention period.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 118 days. Participants will make be confined to
      the clinic for 3 days (Day -1 through Day 2 of each period), a final visit for schizophrenic
      participants in Part 2 after receiving TAK-058, on Day 2 of Period 3 (no final visit for
      optimization phase healthy participants), and a telephonic follow up assessment 21 days after
      last dose of study drug.

    <description>Participants were planned to check for P50 gating ratio. Stimulus signal of 90 decibel pulses of 0.1 millisecond (msec) was to be generated and recorded the event-related potential waveforms. 32 pairs of auditory clicks were to be presented every 10 seconds, with a 500 msec interclick interval. S1 is defined as the conditioning P50 wave with the most positive peak between 30 and 90 msec after the conditioning stimulus. S2 is defined as the test P50 wave with the positive peak after the test stimulus that was closest in latency to the conditioning P50. Amplitude is the difference between the positive peak and the preceding negative trough for both waves. The data from the vertex (Cz site) was to be collected and the P50 gating ratio (S2/S1) was to be calculated as the ratio of the test P50 amplitude to the conditioning P50 amplitude.</description>

        <description>Participants were planned to check for P50 gating ratio. Stimulus signal of 90 decibel pulses of 0.1 millisecond (msec) was to be generated and recorded the event-related potential waveforms. 32 pairs of auditory clicks were to be presented every 10 seconds, with a 500 msec interclick interval. S1 is defined as the conditioning P50 wave with the most positive peak between 30 and 90 msec after the conditioning stimulus. S2 is defined as the test P50 wave with the positive peak after the test stimulus that was closest in latency to the conditioning P50. Amplitude is the difference between the positive peak and the preceding negative trough for both waves. The data from the vertex (Cz site) was to be collected and the P50 gating ratio (S2/S1) was to be calculated as the ratio of the test P50 amplitude to the conditioning P50 amplitude.</description>
