  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a complex physiologic and behavioral process essential for rest, repair, well-being,
      and survival. Sleep is defined as a periodic, reversible state of cognitive and sensory
      disengagement from the external environment. Critically ill patients experience poor sleep
      quality. Surveys of ICU survivors have shown that sleep disruption, pain and intubation for
      mechanical ventilation are the major sources of anxiety and stress during the ICU stay. Many
      physiological, psychological and environmental factors contribute to the incidence of sleep
      disruption for the ICU patients. The primary physiologic factors documented in the literature
      are pain, medications and illness.The primary psychological factors documented in the
      literature are stress and worry. Environmental factors include noise, patient care activities
      and therapeutic modalities as mechanical ventilation. Our research aim will be the impact of
      effective interventions like use of ear plugs and eye mask on decreasing light exposure and
      promoting sleep in ICU patients.
