  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
      patients with the combination of alpha-type-1-polarized dendritic cell (αDC1) vaccines and
      tumor-selective chemokine modulation (CKM) will promote the infiltration of
      vaccination-induced CD8+ CTLs to tumor lesions and subsequently tumor regression with
      improved patient survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic colorectal cancer is a major health concern in the United States, and the second
      leading cause of death due to cancer. The purpose of this trial is to see if the combination
      of the study vaccine and drugs in patients with this disease can prevent the growth of cancer
      and prevent new tumors from growing. The study drugs are a combination of celecoxib
      (Celebrex®), Interferon-α2b (IFN), and rintatolimod (Ampligen®), or CKM.
