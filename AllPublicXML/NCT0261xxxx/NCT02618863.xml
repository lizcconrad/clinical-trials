  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators have observed that women may require less CF than men to occlude the
      esophageal entrance, and that the routine use of 30 N in women may actually increase the
      incidence of airway-related problems. The objective of the current investigation was to test
      this hypothesis. In this study, real-time visual and dynamic means were used to assess the
      effectiveness of different forces applied to the cricoid cartilage in occluding the
      esophageal entrance in men and women. The patency of the esophageal entrance was directly
      visualized using the Glidescope Video Laryngoscope in anesthetized and paralyzed patients
      with and without CP. Evidence of closure of the esophageal lumen was confirmed by the
      inability to introduce a gastric tube (GT) into the esophagus under direct vision. New method
      , using Cricometer , was used to measure the applied force .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 (30 men; ages 18 - 50 yr; body mass index &lt; 28 kg/m2 physical status 1, 2 patients were
      recruited for the study. These patients were to undergo general anesthesia with tracheal
      intubation. starting force was 20 N in both sex. These forces were standardized by
      reproducing a new device : cricometer. The sequence of the applied forces was done by using
      the up and down method in both sex. After preoxygenation, anesthetic induction, muscular
      relaxation and mask ventilation, the study commenced. Direct laryngoscopy using the
      Glidescope video laryngoscope was performed and the view of the glottis and the esophageal
      entrance was video recorded with each CF. 2 attempts to insert a lubricated gastric tube (GT;
      size 20 F, 12 F) were carried out by a &quot;blinded&quot; operator in each patient. A successful
      insertion of the GT indicated a patent esophagus. When this occurred while CP was applied, it
      indicated ineffective CP. An unsuccessful insertion of the GT while CP was applied indicated
      a non-patent esophagus (effective CP). The position of the esophageal entrance relative to
      the glottis during CP was assessed from the video recordings.
