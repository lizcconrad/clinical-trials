  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the RetCam (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA)
      to a new prototype pediatric imaging system, COSMOS, produced by Phoenix Clinical
      Incorporated (PCI) (Pleasanton, CA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Proposed comparison (RetCam vs. COSMOS) was unfeasible. Device is now licensed in Canada.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the field of view in RetCam and COSMOS images</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Masked investigators will review images from the RetCam and the COSMOS. Field of view will be graded on a scale from 1-5, with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. We will test for significant difference, at alpha level 0.05, between scores of the images taken by the RetCam and the COSMOS.</description>

        -  Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Any patient who has a cloudy cornea.

               -  Any patient whose RetCam imaging exam easily produces blanching of the optic
                  nerve in the normal course of imaging.

               -  Any patient who has consented to the procedure, but whose course of examination
                  has filled the time allotted, leaving no time to evaluate the COSMOS.

          -  Inclusion Criteria:

               -  Current patients undergoing clinically indicated EUA and RetCam imaging for
                  surveillance and treatment of ophthalmic conditions at The Hospital for Sick
                  Children.
