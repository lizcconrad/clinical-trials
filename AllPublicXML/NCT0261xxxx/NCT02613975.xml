  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positional therapy is considered as a kind of conservative treatment especially for patients
      with OSA which varies with body positions, and has been reported to be useful in selected
      cases especially those with positional OSA. Positional OSA is present when the overall apnea
      hyponea index (AHI) is &gt; 5/hr with a supine AHI being more than 2 times of AHI in other
      positions, in a symptomatic patient. There will be 2 groups of patients in this study. Group
      1 consists of patients with positional OSA who refuse CPAP or tolerate CPAP poorly. They will
      be provided with a vibration device as treatment, which will be worn on the neck during
      sleep. This device senses the position of the patient during sleep. It will vibrate when the
      patient lies supine until the patient turns laterally, thus prevents the patient to lie flat
      during sleep and reduce the severity of OSA. It will be switched on and off for a period of
      15 days alternatively with sleep study performed at the end of each period respectively to
      determine its efficacy in the on and off mode. There will be a wash out period of 1 week in
      between the on and off period to remove any residual effect. Group 2 consists of patients
      with positional OSA who are using dental device but response or tolerated poorly. They will
      use the vibration device with dental device together as dual therapy, to assess the role of
      combination therapy. The device will be operated in on and off mode with sleep study being
      performed in a similar manner as in group 1. Informed consent will be signed. Each
      participant will have 2 sleep studies performed at home, which will be supported technically
      by technician visiting their home for hook up of necessary equipment.

          2. Patients who cannot tolerate/not using CPAP.

          3. Patients who are on dental devices but residual AHI is &gt; 15 and symptomatic.

          4. Patients consent to study and able to follow the instruction of using positional
             device and home sleep study device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with pregnancy.

          2. Patients who refuse home sleep studies.

          3. Patients with parasomnias.

          4. Patients who cannot follow the instruction of using positional device or home sleep
             study device.

          5. Patients who tolerate CPAP well with good treatment outcome.

          6. Patients on dental device with good symptoms improvement and residual AHI &lt; 15/hr
