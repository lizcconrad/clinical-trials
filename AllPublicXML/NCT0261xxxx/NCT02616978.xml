    <textblock>
      This is an Internet survey to collect data on the use of the Cefaly device to treat migraine
      attacks in regular Cefaly users.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 1000 CEFALY users, having the device since more than one year and having reordered
      electrodes in the last year, will be invited to participate to an Internet survey. This
      survey contains at most 8 questions, and data will be collected completely anonymously.
      Questions concern the use or not of the CEFALY during migraine attacks, the number of treated
      attacks and the number and type of acute anti-migraine drugs that were avoided thanks to the
      use of the CEFALY.
