      OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical response of the non-ablative
      radiofrequency (RF) in the outcome cosmetic female external genital and its effect in the
      sexual function. METHODS: Single blind randomized controlled trial. Sample of 43 women (29
      sexual active) with insatisfaction appearance of the external genitalia, 21 (14) in the study
      group and 22 (15) in the control group. The protocol consisted in 8 sessions of RF once a
      week. The instruments of evaluation were photo (taken before the first session and eight days
      after the last session), which were evaluated by the patient and by three health professional
      (that did not know the group); by the 3 points Likert scale (unsatisfied, unchanged,
      satisfied) and (worst, unchanged, improved). The sexual function was evaluated by the Female
      Sexual Function Index (FSFI) before and after, and analyzed by the T Test of Student. The
      patients' satisfaction and the health professionals' evaluation were analyzed by the
      chi-squared test and by binomial comparison inter-group and intra-group.

    <description>The application of RF was through Tecatherap-VIP unit (VIP-Eletromedicina, Argentina) with bipolar method, using a gauntlet of 2cm, and the coupling electrode, which was located in the sacral region (fig x). For the application, participants were placed in a supine position with legs in lithotomy position, it was used water soluble gel for coupling and slide of the gauntlet. The application in external labia majora was made in the caudal-cranial direction, with constant movement and electrode lightly pressed. (fig) During the session, the heat level was monitored verbally and by infrared digital thermometer. The intensity was gradually increased, and at the time when the temperature reached values between 39-41ºC, the intensity was reduced two points and the procedure was maintained for two minutes.</description>

    <description>The treatment protocol for the control group was identical, differing only in relation to the RF equipment, which was turned off, but a water-soluble gel was used, heated by a resistor, preventing the patient from knowing to which group she belonged. Just the physiotherapist who performed the procedure knew which group the patient belonged to.</description>
