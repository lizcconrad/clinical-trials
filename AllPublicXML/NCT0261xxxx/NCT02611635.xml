    <textblock>
      The main research question of this patient survey is to assess AF patients' preferences
      associated with different attributes which describe the different available anticoagulation
      treatment options (VKA or NOACs and, in case of NOACs, Apixaban, Dabigatran or Rivaroxaban).

      VKA (WaranÂ®) will be compared to Rivaroxaban.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the following research questions in a
      cross-sectional survey of Swedish AF patients being treated either with a VKA or with a NOAC:

        -  Which attributes of a medication to prevent stroke do AF patients view as important?

        -  Do AF patients have a preference regarding the attributes of the medication options VKA
           or NOAC and, in case of NOACs, with regards to rivaroxaban attributes?

        -  Are there subgroups of AF patients whose preference for one of the medication options
           appears above or below average?

        -  What is the quality of life of Swedish AF patients? Are there subgroups with differences
           in their quality of life (for example: subgroups of patients with different CHA2DS2-VASc
           scores)?

        -  Which burden do Swedish AF patients experience in association with their anticoagulation
           therapy? Are there differences in the burden of treatment (ACTS) between patients
           treated with VKA or with NOACs?
