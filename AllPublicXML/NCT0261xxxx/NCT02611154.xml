      Hypothesis: Intranasal administration of exogenous testosterone results in a characteristic
      profile during anti-doping testing, which is different than the profile seen when
      testosterone is administered into muscle, on skin or under the tongue.

      Objective: The investigators aim to characterize the unique steroid doping profile following
      administration of intranasal testosterone to healthy, active volunteer subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Testosterone is a substance commonly abused in the sporting world despite being banned by all
      American sports leagues, international federations, and the World Anti-Doping Agency. Current
      methods employed to detect exogenously administered testosterone include direct detection
      using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and indirect detection using the athlete
      biological passport (ABP). However, different formulations of testosterone (oral,
      transdermal, sublingual, etc) are expected to result in characteristic IRMS profiles, affect
      the ABP readings in unique ways, and differ in their windows of detection. In 2014, a new
      formulation of testosterone, Natesto, which is administered intranasally, was FDA approved.
      Though only approved for medical use, it is expected athletes may use this product, and its
      effect on steroid doping markers has yet to be determined. Characterization of this detection
      profile is necessary for confirmation of the exact product being administered in an
      anti-doping setting. In this study, the investigators aim to understand the effects on the
      steroid doping profile following a single administration of Natesto to healthy, active
      volunteers. Windows of detection will be determined for the standard dosing of Natesto, and
      the effects on ABP markers and IRMS profiles will also be established.

    <description>Participants were instructed to follow this dosing pattern:
Begin taking Intranasal Testosterone at Day 1 for 5 consecutive days (Days 1-5), then to take 2 days off (Day 6 and 7) Urine sample at Day 6 Begin taking Intranasal Testosterone at Day 8 for 5 consecutive days (Days 8-12), then to take 3 days off (Day 13, Day 14, Day 15) Urine sample at Day 13 Begin taking Intranasal Testosterone at Day 16 for 5 consecutive days (Days 16-20), then to take 2 days off (Day 21 and 22) Urine sample at Day 21 Begin taking Intranasal Testosterone at Day 23 for 5 consecutive days (Days 23-27 ), then to take 2 days off (Day 28 and 29) Urine sample at Day 28
The first day of the dosing pattern is considered Day 1 and the last day of the pattern is considered Day 29.
Samples 4-8 were analyzed between 0 and 24hours post-dose Sample 9 was analyzed 48 hours post-dose Sample 10 was analyzed 72 hours post-dose Sample 11 was analyzed one week post-dose</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Suspicious Steroid Profile in Urine Samples at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 3, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to provide 3 urine samples at Day 1, Day 3, Day 5 to measure their baseline urinary steroid marker levels. To accommodate participant schedules, all baseline samples were collected within a two week timeframe. This outcome is measuring if any participants baseline urine samples resulted in a suspicious steroid profile. For this study, &quot;suspicious&quot; is defined as any urine sample resulting in testosterone steroid detection above 200ng/mL.</description>

          <description>Participants were instructed to follow this dosing pattern:
Begin taking Intranasal Testosterone at Day 1 for 5 consecutive days (Days 1-5), then to take 2 days off (Day 6 and 7) Urine sample at Day 6 Begin taking Intranasal Testosterone at Day 8 for 5 consecutive days (Days 8-12), then to take 3 days off (Day 13, Day 14, Day 15) Urine sample at Day 13 Begin taking Intranasal Testosterone at Day 16 for 5 consecutive days (Days 16-20), then to take 2 days off (Day 21 and 22) Urine sample at Day 21 Begin taking Intranasal Testosterone at Day 23 for 5 consecutive days (Days 23-27 ), then to take 2 days off (Day 28 and 29) Urine sample at Day 28
The first day of the dosing pattern is considered Day 1 and the last day of the pattern is considered Day 29.
Samples 4-8 were analyzed between 0 and 24hours post-dose Sample 9 was analyzed 48 hours post-dose Sample 10 was analyzed 72 hours post-dose Sample 11 was analyzed one week post-dose</description>

To accommodate participant schedules, all baseline samples were collected within a two week timeframe. This outcome is measuring if any participants baseline urine samples resulted in a suspicious steroid profile. For this study, &quot;suspicious&quot; is defined as any urine sample resulting in testosterone steroid detection above 200ng/mL.</description>
