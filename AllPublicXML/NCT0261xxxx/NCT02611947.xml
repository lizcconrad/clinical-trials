  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various indexes have been proposed to quantify both pulmonary emphysema and airways disease
      on chest CT scans. It is unknown whether these indexes should be consider in absolute values
      or as compared to predicted normal values. The purposes of the present study is thus : a) to
      measure these indexes at CT in healthy volunteers; b) to investigate their relations with
      gender, height and weight.

      87 healthy volunteers performed consecutively a low-dose chest CT scan and pulmonary function
      tests:

        1. On chest CT scans, indexes reflecting pulmonary emphysema and airways measurements have
           been computed by using dedicated softwares. Each of our three readers performed two
           reading sessions.

           Relative area of lung parenchyma with attenuation value less than -960 Hounsfield Units;
           luminal area and wall thickness in third and fourth generations airways were recorded.

        2. Pulmonary function tests were performed: vital capacity, forced vital capacity ,
           functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, residual volume, forced expiratory
           volume in one second, and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide were recorded
           (either in absolute values and percentage of predicted values).

      CT indexes were compared with gender, height and weight.
