      Background: Thrombosis may be crucial in driving the progression of fibrosis in chronic liver
      disease (CLD). The potential role of platelets and platelet activation in this process is
      unclear. Platelets participate in inflammation by secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators
      which may advance hepatic fibrosis. Hepatitis B virus transgenic mice, developed
      significantly smaller necroinflammatory foci and their serum ALT levels were 80% lower, if
      they were pre-treated with anti-platelet antibodies. Sinusoidal aggregation of activated
      platelets also occurs in chronic hepatitis C in humans. It may contribute to thrombocytopenia
      observed in CLD. Platelet activation is generally believed to be compromised in CLD. However,
      there is data suggesting that CLD may even be associated with an enhancement of platelet
      activation. Measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) constitutes the most
      common method for estimation of portal venous pressure. HVPG is significantly correlated with
      histological indices of CLD progression.

      Study hypotheses:

        1. HVPG as a marker for advancement of hepatic fibrosis and progression of CLD is
           associated with an increase in platelet activation.

        2. Platelet activation and function is not generally compromised in CLD. Comparison of
           platelet function in CLD to a control group of healthy volunteers is intended to clarify
           whether CLD leads to a manifest platelet dysfunction

      Methods: Study design is observational. 100 patients with CLD of various origins (viral,
      alcoholic, cholestatic) scheduled for routine HVPG measurement will be enrolled. 30 healthy
      volunteers will donate blood as a control group. Platelet function and activation will be
      evaluated by multiple electrode aggregometry (primary outcome variable area under the curve
      (AUC). Plasma levels of P-selectin (ELISA), PFA (Platelet Function Analyzer) 100™ parameters
      (EPI-CT and ADP-CT), percentage of P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa, thrombin receptor positive
      platelets after stimulation (flow-cytometry) will constitute secondary outcome parameters.
      Plasmatic coagulation will be evaluated by rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM). Platelet
      count and routine coagulation parameters will be monitored. HVPG measurement by hepatic vein
      catheterization and patient blood sampling will be carried out via the internal jugular vein.
      Blood sampling in volunteers will be performed via the antecubital vein

      Study Rationale: If higher levels of platelet activation are associated with increased HVPGs,
      this would provide an insight into the pathogenesis of CLD. It would also point toward a
      possible benefit of anti-platelet therapy in CLD. Verification of platelet dysfunction in CLD
      is relevant to clinical practice in anaesthesiology and intensive care as procedures are
      often postponed in CLD-patients for fear of bleeding complications. CLD patients may also
      receive prophylactic platelet concentrates prior to interventions which is costly, fraught
      with risk of bacterial infection and may be unnecessary in the absence of platelet
      dysfunction.
