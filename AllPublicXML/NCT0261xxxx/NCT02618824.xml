  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Terminal warm blood cardioplegia (TWBC) has been shown to enhance myocardial protection in
      adult patients. Even in pediatric patients, the use of cold blood cardioplegia followed by
      administration of TWBC will provide cardioprotective effect similar to adult patients.
      Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK), is attractive for cardiac surgeons because it is
      administered as a single dose and is claimed to offer myocardial protection for a period of
      up to 180 minutes allowing performance of complex procedures without interruption. Merging
      the use of TWBC on the use of HTK cardioplegia, especially for pediatric cardiac cases, have
      not been investigated. This technique is expected to provide a longer ischemic time and a
      protective effect against reperfusion injury.

      The design of this study is a randomized controlled trial in children younger than 5 years
      old undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The objective of this study is to
      assess the role of TWBC in use of HTK cardioplegia compared with the use of HTK cardioplegia
      alone in open heart surgery of complex congenital heart disease. This study will be conducted
      at the National Cardiac Centre Harapan Kita Hospital Indonesia. Surgery will be performed in
      the operating room of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery Unit. This study uses
      non-probability consecutive sampling. The samples are all pediatric patients with complex
      congenital heart disease who meet the inclusion criteria and not excluded by the exclusion
      criteria. Patients will be divided into two groups, the treatment group who received HTK
      cardioplegia and TWBC, and the control group that only received HTK cardioplegia alone.
      Hearts will be arrested with HTK solution during cardiac operation. HTK cardioplegia will be
      given through the aortic root at a dose of 50-60 ml/kg after aortic cross-clamped. For the
      treatment group, TWBC will be given shortly before the aortic cross clamp is removed at a
      dose of 10 to 15 ml/kg with temperature of 34 to 36 oCelcius. TWBC is a mixture of blood and
      HTK kardioplegia with a composition of four to one. The outcomes of this study are
      malondialdehyde as a marker of reperfusion injury due to oxidative stress, caspase-3 as a
      marker of apoptosis, cTn-I as a marker of myocardial cell damage and the incidence of low
      cardiac output syndrome.

    <description>Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the end product of lipid peroxidation by ROS results in a state of oxidative stress, and a marker of the increase in ROS in reperfusion injury. MDA concentration in plasma of patients measured by test methods thiobarbituric acid and spectrophotometric examination.</description>

    <measure>Change of Caspase-3 levels</measure>
    <time_frame>after induction of anaesthesia, 30 minutes post aortic cross clamp removal</time_frame>
    <description>Caspase-3 is a protease, a family of cysteine proteases that act as executor in the process of apoptosis, and is used as a marker of apoptosis. The expression of caspase-3 measured quantitatively by immunohistochemistry using polyclonal antibody method cleaved caspase-3 from myocardial biopsy.</description>

    <description>Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) s a protein involved in the process of contraction of the heart, and is only found in heart cells, which will be released into the blood circulation when heart injury. CTn-I measured with Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay technique. Specimens for measurement of cTnI are from whole blood or serum.</description>

    <description>Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) is a state in which clinical sign and symptoms of low cardiac output are found with or without the increasing of arterial and venous saturation gap and metabolic acidosis, the use of new inotropic, mechanical support, or other maneuvers in order to increase cardiac output. LCOS is determined by intensivist based on the clinical presentation, laboratory and inotropic scores.</description>
