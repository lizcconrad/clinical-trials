      Dedicated Sheath feasibility study: A prospective, open-label study to evaluate the
      feasibility and safety of the Valve Medical Dedicated Sheath during Balloon Aortic
      Valvuloplasty (BAV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, single arm clinical study. Up to 15 patients undergoing
      valvular intervention will be enrolled. Follow up will take place at 1, 6 and 24 hours post
      procedure. No follow up visits are required.

      During the study, the patient will undergo the following tests:

        -  Physical examination (includes blood pressure, age, height, weight).

        -  Echo assessments prior to procedure.

        -  Hemodynamic study prior and post BAV.

        -  Full blood count

        -  Angiography
