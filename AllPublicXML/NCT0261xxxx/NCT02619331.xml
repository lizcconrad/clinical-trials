  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin prick tests (SPT) are commonly used in daily allergological practice to assess skin
      reactivity to allergens. Multiple factors can contribute to non-optimal results of
      conventional wheal and flare measurement (CWFM) of SPT such as inaccurate measurements,
      observer-dependency and absence of traceability.

      This study aims to evaluate the quantification of SPT by a novel High Speed Laser Doppler
      Imaging (HSL-DI) and to compare it with CWFM. First, SPT with birch and/or grass pollen
      extracts as well as positive and negative controls will be performed in 20 volunteers (11
      atopics, 9 non-atopics) to establish the characteristics (cut-off, optimal reading time and
      allergen concentration) of HSL-DI analysis based on two parameters (&quot;area&quot; and &quot;flow&quot;
      measurement). In a second step, fifty patients will be tested with birch and grass pollen
      extracts at optimal allergen concentration and time window. Analysis of SPT by HSL-DI and
      CWFM will be compared.

    <description>Allergy tests will be performed in allergic patients with rhinoconjunctivitis and allergy test reading measured following two different methodologies. 1) test reading based on conventional wheal and flare measurement (wheal diameter in mm, CWFM), 2) test reading based on high speed laser doppler imaging (HS-LDI). Both type of tests reading will be compared.</description>
