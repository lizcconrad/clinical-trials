  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AGS67E in subjects
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine a safe dose for future development. In
      addition, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), the immunogenicity, and the
      anti-leukemic activity of AGS67E.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will sequentially evaluate AGS67E given as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion in
      two different schedules: once every 3 weeks (Q3) and then once weekly for 3 weeks.

      The dose escalation follows a 3 + 3 design.

      The Data Review Team may expand any dose level or intermediate dose level that has been
      deemed safe and resulted in at least one subject with a Composite Complete Remission (CRc).
      An expansion cohort may enroll up to 15 subjects.
