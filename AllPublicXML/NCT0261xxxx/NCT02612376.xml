    <textblock>
      This study plans to establish a large bank of blood, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), imaging,
      and clinical data. These data and samples will be used for future research into the causes of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), Down Syndrome (DS) and other diseases that cause thinking and
      memory problems. This future research will also study how treatments for these diseases work.
      This research may help develop new treatments for some diseases of the nervous system and
      help understand these diseases better.
