  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of intravenous
      allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy for idiopathic Parkinson's
      disease (iPD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be delivered intravenously
      at one of four doses: 1 x 10 6 MSC/kg, 3 x 10 6 MSC/kg, 6 x 10 6 MSC/kg, or 10 x 10 6 MSC/kg
      of body weight to a population of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). The
      infusion will be at 1 week after the baseline visit, following two screening visits. Patients
      will be followed until 52 weeks after the infusion visit. The safety of the therapy, as well
      as the impact of the therapy on the rate of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression, will be
      assessed.

    <measure>Change in motor function as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Total score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS serves as a disability and impairment scale for progression follow-up and is divided into four sections.
Part I: evaluation of mentation, behavior, and mood (13 questions).
Part II: evaluation of activities of daily living including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food (13 questions).
Part III: motor examination (33 scores based on 18 questions with right, left or other body distributions scores)
Part IV: motor complications (6 questions)
All items have 5 response options with uniform anchors of: 0 = normal, 1 = slight (symptoms/signs with sufficiently low frequency or intensity to cause no impact on function), 2 = mild (symptoms/signs of frequency or intensity sufficient to cause a modest impact on function, 3 = moderate (symptoms/signs sufficiently frequent or intense to impact considerably, but not prevent function), 4 = severe (symptoms/signs that prevent function).</description>

    <description>A set of diffusion-weighted image volumes (32-directions, high angular resolution) will be collected using the gradient overplus option with one B0 (non-diffusion weighted) image volume acquired before the acquisition of one repetition of the diffusion-weighted scans. Diffusion tensor and associated computations will be performed. White matter microstructure will be examined, which represents the structural pathways linking specific cortical and subcortical regions. It will be determined whether there is increased fractional anisotropy and decreased mean diffusivity along white matter fibers that link regions exhibiting increased functional connectivity, such as substantia nigra and dorsal striatum.</description>

Functional imaging will be done in the OFF medication state. It will be determined whether there is a reduction in the abnormally high activity pattern in motor cortex and an increase in putamen activity.</description>

All items are assumed to impact QoL and must be answered to compute scores for each dimension. Questions are answered based on experiences from the preceding month using a 5-point ordinal scoring system: 0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always. Each scores range from 0 = never have difficulty to 100 = always have difficulty.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between the ages of 45 and 70. The 45-year-old age cutoff ensures that
             we do not enroll juvenile PD patients.

          -  Diagnosis of Parkinson disease by the United Kingdom (UK) brain bank criteria
             including the presence of 2 cardinal signs of PD plus bradykinesia. Diagnosis will be
             confirmed by the PI or other specialists in Movement Disorders and based on medical
             history, physical and neurological exams. Patients should have an asymmetric onset,
