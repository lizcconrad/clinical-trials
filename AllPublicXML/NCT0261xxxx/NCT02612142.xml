  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      35 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder were randomized in 3 intervention
      groups: (1) aerobic exercise (AE) ; (2) placebo (stretching) exercise (ST); and (3) no
      intervention (control group; NI). The intervention length was 10 consecutive days. In groups
      1 (aerobic exercise) and 2 (sham exercise), participants exercised for 30 minutes each day.
      Depressive symptoms were assessed the day before the beginning of intervention and the day
      after the end of intervention for participants of both groups.

      In the aerobic exercise (AE) group, the intervention consisted of 30 minutes of daily brisk
      walking or jogging. This was done individually and supervised. Participants who missed &gt; 2
      training sessions were considered as non-completers. Exercise intensity had to be maintained
      within 65%-75% of age-predicted maximal heart rate, as commonly prescribed in studies using
      aerobic exercise to alleviate depression. Heart rate monitoring devices were used.

      Participants in the stretching (ST) group also performed a daily 30 minutes exercise program
      but this was &quot;sham&quot; exercise, consisting of stretching exercises. Several muscle groups
      (thighs, calves, gluteal, shoulders, back) were stretched for 60 seconds, with equivalent
      resting intervals between stretching series. These activities were also individual and
      supervised. As was the case for the AE intervention, participants who missed &gt; 2 training
      sessions were considered as non-completers.

      Participants in the control (NI) group received no intervention other than prescribed
      medication.

      All participants started antidepressants within less than 2 weeks before study entry.
