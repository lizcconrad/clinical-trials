    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)
      and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are effective in reducing depressive symptoms in
      patients after cancer

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients are prone to develop depressive symptoms, even after curative treatment.
      Conventional therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based
      cognitive therapy (MBCT) are frequently used for reducing these depressive symptoms in
      patients with medical conditions. However, until now evidence from proper designed randomized
      controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of both interventions in cancer survivors, is
      lacking. Therefore, our longitudinal study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CBT and
      MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms in cancer survivors. In addition, potential moderators
      and mediators of each intervention will be explored.
