      The purpose of this research is to develop and test a mobile application called RELAX, which
      is designed to help with stress management during weight loss.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and stress are highly comorbid and both increase risk for cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). Stress is associated with disinhibited eating, junk food consumption and low
      consumption of produce and whole grains. Both stress and stress-induced eating are not only
      associated with obesity but also predict worst outcomes in lifestyle interventions. Stress
      and stress-induced eating should be targeted in interventions to maximize weight loss;
      however, this makes for a very intensive intervention. Technology could be leveraged to
      reduce intervention burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop and test the
      feasibility and proof-of-concept of RELAX Application Suite (AS), a mobile-, cloud- and
      web-based companion to a lifestyle intervention that addresses stress. RELAX-AS will be
      designed to reduce clinical visit time by identifying for the clinician the patient's
      behavior and stress patterns that account for the greatest deviations in energy balance.
      Investigators have created an app for diet and exercise self-monitoring. The RELAX-AS will
      build upon previous work to create a comprehensive weight loss and stress reduction
      application suite.

      RELAX-AS will include RELAX-app and RELAX-web. RELAX-app is a patient-facing mobile
      application that will be linked to the Microsoft Health Vault, a cloud-based platform that
      allows for secure access of health data online. RELAX-app will include self-monitoring (diet,
      exercise, stress, stress-induced eating); automated feedback via easy-to-interpret visual
      displays and feedback reports on the amount, timing, context, and relationship between target
      behaviors; and self-guided stress management features that are prompted when stress ratings
      are elevated. To minimize burden, investigators will incorporate barcode scanners for diet
      recording, GPS for exercise tracking, visual analogue scales for stress ratings, and provide
      brief stress reduction strategies. RELAX-web is a web-based application for clinicians to
      access the patient's information in the form of easily digestible visual displays and
      feedback reports to increase the efficiency of their counseling. In traditional counseling
      much time is spent reviewing paper self-monitoring records and soliciting information from
      the patient about factors impacting their adherence (e.g., stress and stress eating). The
      purpose of RELAX-web is to reduce the clinic time needed to deliver care. The goal is to use
      RELAX-AS to create an intervention delivery model that reduces both weight and stress. The
      investigators propose a 3-year study to develop and test usability, feasibility, and
      acceptability. This work is in preparation for a 2-arm efficacy trial comparing RELAX-AS with
      a brief lifestyle intervention to a brief lifestyle intervention alone on weight, stress, and
      stress eating.
