      This study is aiming to evaluate the clinical efficacy of complete laparoscopic resection of
      recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      The investigators conducted a prospective study of 64 patients who were diagnosed with
      recurrent HCC and underwent surgical resection at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center
      from June 2014 to November 2014; 31 patients were enrolled in the laparoscopic group and
      underwent complete laparoscopic resection of HCC, and 33 patients were enrolled in the
      control group and underwent open surgical resection. The operation time, intraoperative blood
      loss, shortest distance between the tumor edge and normal liver tissue, postoperative pain
      scores, postoperative time until the patient could walk, postoperative time until the patient
      could pass gas, hospital stay, and inpatient costs were compared between the two groups. The
      patients were followed up for one year after surgery, and the relapse-free survival was
      compared between the two groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. recurrent HCC after open surgery

          2. recurrent HCC located in any part of the left lateral lobe or the diaphragm side of
             the right lobe and near the surface of the liver, which resulted in an easier
             operation

          3. no significant surgical contraindications

          4. no major vessel or bile duct tumor invasion and metastasis

          5. grade A or B liver function or grade C liver function that recovered to grade A after
             liver-protective treatment;

          6. the patient and his/her family was willing to undergo laparoscopic resection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. major vessel or bile duct tumor invasion

          2. recurrent HCC located in the right liver parenchyma and near secondary vessels and
             bile ducts, resulting in a difficult operation

          3. grade C liver function

          4. significant surgical contraindications

          5. the patient and his/her family declined laparoscopic hepatectomy.
