      This non-interventional study aims primarily at assessing the clinical effectiveness and the
      impact of the therapy on cancer-related symptoms and patients' HRQoL. In addition, it
      represents an attempt towards gaining experience on the routine use of trabectedin in daily
      clinical practice in a representative sample of Greek subjects with aSTS.
