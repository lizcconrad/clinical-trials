  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to test the potential for successful implementation
      of an intervention designed to study the effect of six hours out of bed time on the overall
      level of deconditioning in pediatric stem cell transplant (SCT) patients. Previous research
      has demonstrated that deconditioning occurs rapidly over the course of the hospitalization
      post-transplant and can negatively impact quality of life. By encouraging patients to be out
      of bed for six hours each day, it is anticipated that patients will experience less
      deconditioning than those patients who previously had no established minimum time out of the
      bed.

    <description>18-item, 7-level ordinal scale instrument that measures a child's consistent performance in essential daily functional skills. Three main domains (selfcare, mobility, and cognition) are assessed by interviewing or by observing a child's performance of a task to criterion standards
Categorized into 2 main functional streams: &quot;Dependent&quot; (ie, requires helper: scores 1-5) and &quot;Independent&quot; (ie, requires no helper: scores 6-7). Scores 1 (total assistance) and 2 (maximal assistance) belongs to the &quot;Complete Dependence&quot; category. Scores 3 (moderate assistance), 4 (minimal contact assistance), and 5 (supervision or set-up) belongs to the &quot;Modified Dependence&quot; category. Scores 6 (modified independence) and 7 (complete independence) belongs to the &quot;Independent&quot; category.</description>
