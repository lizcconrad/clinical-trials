    <textblock>
      This study is being done to examine the impact of an interactive, social robotics program in
      helping children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) understand emotions and how to better
      recognize emotions while interacting with others. Eligible families will be randomized to
      either the robot intervention (n=20) or a no intervention (TAU; n=20) condition for 8-14
      weeks. Assessments will occur at pre- and post-intervention as well as weekly for both
      conditions.

    <description>The Transporters Quiz (Autism Transporters CIC, Autism Research Center) is a quiz developed to test a child's understanding of the emotions portrayed in stories. The quiz examines whether a child can link a word describing an emotion, the facial expression of that emotion, and the causes of the emotion. This quiz will be given prior to starting treatment and again at the completion of the intervention.</description>

    <description>Families assigned to the robot condition will be asked to complete pre-test assessments and post testing as well as to participate in the robot intervention. The intervention will last for a 8-14 week period in which families will bring their child in 2-3 times a week on average for approximately 30 minutes until 24 treatment sessions have been completed. Children will receive one-on-one intervention with an interventionist facilitating the child's interactions with the robot.</description>

    <description>Families assigned to the TAU condition will be asked to complete pre-test assessments and approximately 8-14 weeks later return to complete post-test assessments where the social emotions activity will be retested. During the 8-14 weeks between the testing assessments, families in the TAU condition will also receive a weekly email asking about their child's media use.</description>
