      Randomised two parallel groups multicenter study using a Prospective Randomised Open Blinded
      End-point design (PROBE), aiming at comparing the efficacy of a therapeutic strategy
      targeting the normalisation of arterial stiffness for reducing cardiovascular (CV) and renal
      events, in comparison with a classical therapeutic strategy implementing the European Society
      of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology (ESH-ESC) Guidelines, in patients with
      essential hypertension and medium-to-very high CV risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to show that a therapeutic strategy targeting the implementation of
      international guidelines PLUS the normalisation of blood pression (BP &lt; 140 and 90 mmHg) plus
      the normalisation of arterial stiffness (measured every 6 months) Pulse Wave Velocity group
      (PWV group) reduces CV and renal events to a significantly greater extent than the sole
      implementation of Guidelines (conventional group, with PWV measurement at baseline and every
      2 years).

      Experimental design: Prospective Randomised Open Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) multicenter, two
      parallel groups, study.

      Therapeutic strategy in the PWV group:

        1. Use maximal recommended doses of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs) or
           Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as first step treatment. And then adapt
           treatment to PWV values.

        2. In second step, use combination therapy with Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)

        3. Use diuretics in combination therapy, either as an alternative to CCBs in second step or
           as triple therapy in third step

        4. Use, as fourth step, vasodilating beta-blockers (VD-BB) or spironolactone

        5. In parallel, correct all CV risk factors according to ESH-ESC Guidelines, and reinforce
           treatment (hypolipidemic drugs, glucose lowering drugs, antiplatelets) if secondary
           prevention.

      Therapeutic strategy in the conventional group: Apply the ESH-ESC Guidelines

    <description>Arterial stiffness will be measured through the determination of the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV).
In the &quot;PWV group&quot;, PWV will be measured at baseline, and then every 6 months. PWV measurement will guide the intensification of treatment. Measurements will be immediately available to the physician in charge of the patient, in order to adapt treatment. The therapeutic strategy is based both on the normalisation of BP and then on the BP-independent reduction in PWV, using commercially available antihypertensive medications.
In the &quot;conventional group&quot;, PWV will be measured at baseline, after 2 years, and at the end of the study. PWV values will be masked to the physician</description>
