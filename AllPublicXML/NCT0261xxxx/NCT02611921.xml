    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if intranasal ketamine shows initial evidence of
      safety, tolerability and efficacy for the treatment of social impairment in individuals with
      Autism Spectrum Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the significant need for effective treatment of core symptoms of Autism Spectrum
      Disorder (ASD), this trial is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot
      study of intranasal ketamine in 24 individuals with ASD ages 12- 30 years using a novel
      quantitative eye-tracking outcome measure to assess impact of the drug on social impairment.
      Additionally, to develop a ketamine-focused personalized medicine approach in ASD, the
      investigators will include pharmacokinetic, molecular pharmacodynamic, and
      electrophysiological assessments into initial systematic study.

    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale designed to measure symptomatic change at a specific time as compared to baseline. The CGI-I will be focused on the target symptoms of social impairment. CGI-I is a gold standard measure of potential change with treatment in placebo- controlled pharmacotherapy trials in ASD</description>
