      The objective of this research is to determine if the addition of the Clear Guide ONE, a
      Computer Assisted Instrument Guidance (CAIG) system, provides improvement over existing
      ultrasound guided, needle-based procedures for peripheral nerve blocks. The ultrasound can
      visualize the targeted vessel or nerve, but the addition of the CAIG may help the clinician
      better guide the needle to the target.

      This pilot study will be a randomized, single-blinded control trial. The clinicians cannot be
      blinded, but the person questioning the patient post-op to determine success rate will be
      blinded. There will be two randomized groups of patients: control and test. The control group
      will receive the procedure with traditional methods and equipment currently in use at Cooper
      University. The test group will receive the same procedure utilizing existing ultrasound
      equipment with the supplemental CAIG system.
