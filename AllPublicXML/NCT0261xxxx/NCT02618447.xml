  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that 4Dimensional Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography
      (4D PC MRA) evaluation of portal venous flow predicts underlying liver function and
      hypertrophic potential in patients with liver cancer presenting for portal vein embolization
      (PVE). 4D PC MRA may provide a non-invasive measure of liver function that could help
      determine which patients could safely and successfully undergo PVE and subsequent resection
      of tumor. By comparing 4D PC MRA results with invasive catheter measurements the
      investigators will validate the flow findings. Further regression/correlation analysis with
      functional measures of the liver (HIDA scans), volumetrics, Doppler flow analysis, histology,
      and outcomes will help the investigators to determine the ability of 4D PC MRA to predict
      functional status and hypertrophic potential of the liver prior to PVE and hepatectomy
      allowing for better patient selection and reduced morbidity/mortality.

    <description>-4D PC MRA results will be compared with invasive catheter measurements to validate the portal venous flow findings. Regression/correlation analysis will be used to analyze association between 4D PC MRA and liver function. Residuals will be tested for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk W test, and if residuals are non-normally distributed, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient will be used</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Each patient will undergo a total of 3 MRI/MRA scans (lasting 30-60 minutes):
Scan 1: Baseline (pre-portal vein embolization (PRE))
Scan 2: Early after PVE (within 48 hours)
Scan 3: Late after PVE (at 3-8 weeks).
Scans 1 and 3: routine liver MR sequences with/without contrast (Gadoxetic acid, Eovist) and 4D phase contrast of the portal venous system. The 4D phase contrast sequence will be repeated twice at each time point, adding about 15-30 minutes to each scan.
Scan 2: 4D phase contrast sequences and imaging for localization.</description>
