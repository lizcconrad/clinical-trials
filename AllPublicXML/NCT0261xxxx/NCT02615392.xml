      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of prescribing park use (i.e., ''Park
      Prescription'') to insufficiently active individuals. It is hypothesized that Park
      Prescription will motivate the target population to increase physical activity and thereby
      improve their physical and mental health.

      BACKGROUND: There are substantial international research findings supporting the role that
      natural environments play in enhancing human health and the prevention of chronic diseases.
      Also, there is evidence highlighting the (cost-) effectiveness of prescribing physical
      activity to promote one's physical activity and health. However, there is a lack of
      methodologically rigorous studies that have looked into the effectiveness of combining these
      two promising approaches; i.e., physical activity prescription with a focus on the use of
      parks and green spaces: Park Prescription.

      AIMS: This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will investigate the concept of Park
      Prescription as a health promoting intervention for individuals. The primary objective is to
      investigate the effectiveness of a park prescription interventions to increase participant's
      time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Main secondary objectives are to
      assess; A) improvement in physical health (e.g., blood sugar and blood pressure) and health
      behaviour (e.g., sitting time); B) improvement in mental health (e.g., quality of life); 3)
      intervention implementation fidelity and the association with park use and perceived study
      participant satisfaction.

      METHODOLOGY: Participants aged between 40 and 65 years will be recruited from the Singapore
      Population Health Community Screening Programme conducted by Alexandra Health Pte Ltd. They
      will be randomly assigned to one of the following two arms; 1) park prescription +
      participation in a weekly structured physical activity program conducted in the park, and 2)
      control group. Participants will be enrolled in the study for a period of 6 months. They will
      have to complete a baseline assessment, 3-month and 6-month follow-up. The investigators aim
      to recruit 80 participants in each arm, making a total of 160 study participants.

    <description>The participants in this group will receive a brief counseling on physical activity together with a park prescription that highlights the importance of engaging in at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week and the possibility of engaging in physical activity in the park. In addition, they are invited to join in a structured and supervised physical activity program in the park. The structured physical activity program will take place in public parks located in the participants' neighbourhood. Participants will receive text messages for reminder and registration purposes approximately once a week. Also, participants will receive a sheet to monitor their weekly physical activity, information about parks in their neighborhood, and a counseling phone call half-way through the study.</description>

          7. provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded from
        participation:

          1. pregnant women;

          2. people who have severe medical conditions prohibiting participation in physical
             activity as assessed by the PAR-Q (including, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes);

          3. people who have a blood pressure of &gt;139 mmHG (systolic) over &gt;89 mmHG (diastolic);

          5. those with physical disabilities or lower limb disorders.

               -  The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) is a self-guided, nine
                  question screening tool that can quickly identify conditions or risk factors that
                  require further assessment before engaging in physical activity. See: British
                  Columbia Ministry of Health Department of National Health and Welfare: Physical
                  Activity Readiness Questionnaire. Canada: 1992.For the current study, we are
                  using an amended version of the PAR-Q.

        The PAR-Q+ also includes an additional section to formally assess subjects' age, whether
        they have physical disabilities or lower limb disorders, and their physical activity
        status.
