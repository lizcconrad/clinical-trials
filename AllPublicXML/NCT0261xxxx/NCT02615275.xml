  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if mBCA, a type of scale that measures body mass
      (the amount of muscle and fat in your body) and your level of hydration can help researchers
      identify patients who are losing muscle mass during radiation therapy. This information will
      help researchers make decisions about nutritional supplementation and the placement of
      feeding tubes in patients receiving radiation therapy.

      Study Visits:

      At the start of radiation therapy and then every week during treatment (about 6-7 weeks):

        -  You will have your weight and body mass measured with the mBCA. You will stand on a
           scale with your feet on specific spots and your hands gripping the railing on either
           side of you. There are electrodes in the hand grips and scale that will use very small
           electrical currents to measure the water, muscle, and fat in your body. To do this test
           you will need to hold still while standing for up to 50 seconds.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your symptoms.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be over after you have completed follow-up.

      Follow-Up:

      About 10-12 weeks after you have completed radiation therapy:

        -  You will have your weight and body mass measured with the mBCA.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a CT or PET scan.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your symptoms.

        -  Family members may be contacted for follow up data collection if you cannot be reached.

      Other Information:

      The information learned in this study will not affect your care or treatment.

      Data collection will occur only during scheduled pre-treatment, treatment, and follow-up
      visits. There will be no additional study visits required.

      This is an investigational study. The mBCA is FDA approved for the use of measuring muscle
      mass and hydration in healthy adults. Its use in measuring the muscle mass and hydration in
      patients receiving radiation therapy is considered investigational. The study doctor can
      explain how mBCA is designed to work in more detail.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
