    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to compare rates of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in
      professional wind versus non-wind instrument players in the Philadelphia Orchestra. A
      secondary objective is to evaluate intra-ocular pressure and choroidal thickness of wind
      instrument players under variable playing conditions.

      Participants of this study will be any current or retired member of the Philadelphia
      Orchestra. Approximately 100 participants will be divided into 2 groups: 1) wind instrument
      players and 2) non-wind instrument players.

      A wind instrument is defined as any instrument that contains a resonator, in which a column
      of air is set into resonation by the player blowing into a mouthpiece at one end of the
      resonator. A non-wind instrument is defined as any instrument that does not meet the wind
      instrument criteria.

      On the day of the eye examinations, the investigator will provide a brief overview to explain
      the purpose and goals of the study to all potential participants. The examination team will
      be set up in an adjoining room. Members of the orchestra will be able to visit the
      examination team at any time during their practice session. A trained technician will perform
      the following for both eyes for all participants:visual acuity,undilated fundus color
      photography and intra-ocular pressure measurement. The investigators will record the
      examination findings using a standard form. Demographic information, including ocular,
      medical, social, and family history, will be documented for all participants.
