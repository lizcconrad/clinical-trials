  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug
      known as LY2599666 in different groups of people - those who are healthy, those who have mild
      cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and those with mild-to-moderate AD. The
      study will measure how much LY2599666 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the
      body to get rid of it. It will also evaluate how LY2599666 affects the body. The study has
      three parts. Part A will last about 2 months. Parts B and C will each last about 23 weeks.
      Participants may only enroll in one part.
