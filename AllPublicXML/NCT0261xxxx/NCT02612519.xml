  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicentre, open, randomised, and controlled trial conducted in patients diagnosed with
      recurrent/refractory ascites who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. The efficacy of the
      Alfapump, TIPS and paracentesis with regard to the treatment of ascites will be compared. All
      patients will receive medical care for cirrhosis and ascites according to the institution's
      standards of care. Standard of care may include, but is not limited to the administration of
      diuretics, paracentesis and consideration for orthotopic liver transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and recurrent or
      refractory, with regular requirements for large volume paracentesis (see subject inclusion
      criteria). With respect to TIPS-contraindications patients will be assigned to two
      substudies. If no TIPS-contraindications exists (sub-study 1) patients will be randomized to
      Alfapump or TIPS. The presence of at least one TIPS-contraindication (sub-study 2) is leading
      to a randomization to Alfapump or standard of care. All patients will receive medical care
      for cirrhosis and ascites according to the institution's standards medical care. Standard of
      care may include, but is not limited to, administration of diuretics, paracentesis and
      consideration for orthotopic liver transplantation.

         11. Acute peritonitis

         12. Pregnant or nursing women. (A serum pregnancy test is required for fertile women
