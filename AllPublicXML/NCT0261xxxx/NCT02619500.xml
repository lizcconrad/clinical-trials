  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the use of thrust manipulation to non-thrust
      mobilizations for mechanical neck pain when they are applied to both the cervical and
      thoracic spine. Both of these techniques have been compared in previous trials but a
      pragmatic approach will be employed as well as controlling for clinical equipoise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total sample size of 136 subjects with mechanical neck pain will be recruited to
      participant in this trial from multiple clinic and university sites around the country. Each
      subject will be evaluated by a licensed physical therapist that specializes in orthopedic
      manual therapy (OMT). Each treating therapist will be blinded be the data collection and each
      data collection therapist will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Subjects data will be
      collected at the initial visit, second visit, and at discharge. The maximum number of weeks
      that a subject may be enrolled is 8 weeks (2 months). At that point, they are discharged from
      the study. The treating therapist will allocate the subject through the already completed
      randomization procedures. Once the subject is randomized, the treating therapist will perform
      the OMT based on their clinical reasoning and in a manner they feel would benefit the patient
      the most. In addition to the OMT, each subject will receive a home exercise program, advice,
      encouragement, and education. A number of outcome variables will be collected regarded pain
      and disability as well as one physical performance measure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI is a self-report measure of perceived disability and it is comprised of ten questions using an ordinal scale from 0 to 5 for a maximum of 50 points. The score is doubled to achieve a % score. The higher an individual scores on the NDI, the greater their perceived level of disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on The Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSFS is a patient identified self-report questionnaire that measures general activity limitations. The scale ranges from 0 (unable to perform) to 10 (able to perform the activity at the level prior to injury). The patient reports three activities that are limited due to the current injury and an average rating for all three activities is calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on The Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Two separate pain ratings will be collected (current and average over a 24 hour period) experienced over 24 hours and then averaged for a composite score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on The Global Rating Of Change Scale (GROC)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GROC is a 15-point scale used to quantify a patient's improvement with treatment or to record the clinical course of a condition over time. Patients are asked to describe their overall condition since the start of treatment until the present time with options ranging from -7 (&quot;a very great deal worse&quot;) to +7 (&quot;a very great deal better&quot;) and 0 being described as &quot;about the same.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Deep Cervical Flexion Endurance (DCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are positioned in supine and will be instructed to maximally tuck his/her chin isometrically. Patients will then be instructed to lift their head 2.5 cm off the plinth and to maintain upper cervical flexion simultaneously for as long as they were able. A skin fold along the antero-lateral neck will be monitored and the investigator's hand will remain under the occiput of the patient for tactile cueing. The timing of the position began once the patient is in the correct position and stopped if; the patient's head drops into the fingers of the clinician, is elevated greater than one inch, the patient loses the skin fold on the antero-lateral neck, or the patient is unable to continue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire using a scale that rates each clinicians own Clinical Equipoise</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>Therapist equipoise will be measured globally regarding both of the orthopedic manual therapy techniques on a single scale that ranges form 0 to +2 (only a single measure. Each treating therapist will make a global opinion regarding the efficacy of non-thrust mobilization compared to thrust manipulation. An ordinal scale will be used with a score of 0 meaning that the clinician does not believe that either of the competing treatments are more beneficial than the other. The scale then ranges from +1 and +2 for both mobilizations and manipulations. The rater circles if one of the numbers depending on which of the treatments they feel are clinically more effective. See below.
Mobilization is better Neither Manipulation is better
