  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this observational study is to determine performance characteristics
      and usability of Lumosity and the Brain Performance Test in a group of older adult
      volunteers.

      Approximately 200 prospective users currently will be provided free 6-month premium access
      Lumosity accounts. Participants will be provided with an account activation code and
      instructed on how to sign up for Lumosity with their email address. They will be subject to
      the Lumosity Terms of Service and follow the typical user experience. Upon creating an
      account, users would be asked to complete a short demographic survey that includes questions
      on gender, education, occupation, years since retirement, health, computer familiarity, and
      perceptions of brain training.

      Those who sign up will have immediate access to the Lumosity training system and the entire
      suite of Lumosity games. In addition, they will be invited, via email, to take the Brain
      Performance Test one week after the initial sign-up and then again 12 weeks later.
      Approximately every 8 weeks, users will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about
      their experience with Lumosity. This questionnaire will be accessed via email. Participants
      will be asked to train 5 days a week for 20-30 minutes per day, but are free to play as much
      or a little as they choose. Community associates at the sites will be encouraged to host
      group training sessions, giving the seniors a chance to gather and complete their training
      together, share their experiences, and get any help they may need. In addition, sites will
      have the option of hosting 1-2 focus groups with participants and researchers from Lumos
      Labs. The focus groups will be an opportunity to give and receive direct feedback about
      Lumosity, and get any questions answered by the researchers.
