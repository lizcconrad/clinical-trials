  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is standard chemotherapy alone. For the
      first part of this study (phase I), there are two purposes. The first is to see whether
      AZD2014 can affect glioblastoma multiforme, and the second purpose is to see what effects it
      has.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In both the phase I &amp; II parts of the study, consenting patients will receive single agent
      AZD2014 for 2 days immediately prior to surgery (and PK sample) at a fixed dose of 125 mg bid
      po (i.e. on days -2, -1, and on morning of day 0 [day of surgery]). After recovery from
      surgery, patients will, within 7-21 days after tumour resection, either start the dose
      escalation part of the phase I (within 7-21 days after tumour resection) (at the appropriate
      dose level) or continue on the phase II if the phase II is open. Patients who are unable to
      proceed to the dose escalation part post resection will be replaced. For this part of the
      study the purpose is to find the highest dose of AZD2014 that can be tolerated without
      causing very severe side effects when receiving temozolomide therapy and to see what effects
      the study drugs have on the participant and their cancer. This is done by starting at a dose
      lower than the one that investigators know can be given safely to patients when used on its
      own. Participants are given AZD2014 together with temozolomide and will be watched very
      closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe.
      If the side effects are not severe, then new participants will be given a higher dose of
      AZD2014. Participants joining this study later on will get higher doses of AZD2014 than
      participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe
      but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.

      The researchers doing this study are also interested in looking for markers that will help
      predict which patients are most likely to be helped by AZD2014.

      For the second phase of this study (phase II), the purpose is to find out the effects that
      AZD2014 has on participants and their glioblastoma, using doses found to be safe in the first
      part of the study, when given with temozolomide.

             informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those physically
             incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the study.
             Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the

        Please note: use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception cannot
        be considered highly effective as it is currently unknown whether AZD2014 may reduce their
        effectiveness).
