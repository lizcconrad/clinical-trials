      The objective of this study was the evaluation of periodontal condition in pregnant women and
      the effect of the treatment of periodontal disease upon low birth weight.

      This research was carried out in the following three centers: Samsun Birth and Children's
      Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of
      Dentistry of the University of Ondokuz Mayıs. 269 women in their first trimester were
      included in this study. Their ages ranged from 18-35 years, their height was above 150 cm and
      they have no history of any systemic disease. At the end of each trimester these measurements
      were performed: attachment level, probing depth, gingival index, plaque index, and bleeding
      on probing. According to the periodontal diagnosis the research population was divided into
      three groups: periodontally healthy women; periodontally diseased women, however rejection of
      treatment; periodontally diseased women, however acceptance of treatment.In this study
      one-way ANOVA, chi-square, conditional logistic regression analyses were used.

    <description>Some periodontal measurements (attachment level, probing depth, gingival index, plaque index, and bleeding on probing) were performed in periodontally healthy pregnant. These measurements were performed at the end of each trimester.
Parameters such as number of pregnancies, previous low birth weight, prenatal care, genital tract infection, use of antibiotics, smoking, tooth brushing habit and birth weight were evaluated.
