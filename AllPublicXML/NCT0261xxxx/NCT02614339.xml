      The aim of this study is to identify the effect of adjunctive metformin on recurrence of
      non-DM stage III colorectal cancer. This study is open-label randomized controlled study.

      The primary endpoint is to compare the 3-year disease free survival between metformin group
      and non-metformin group. The secondary endpoint is to compare the 5-year overall survival and
      disease specific survival between two group, to identify the safety of metformin, and to
      compare the recurrence rate of polyps after polypectomy between two groups.

    <description>The patients of this group are treated according to NCCN guideline for stage III colorectal cancer and receive an additional prescription metformin. Metformin will be prescribed 1g/day (500mg, 2 table/day, or 1000mg, 1 table/day). After adjustment period for 1month, patients who do not have side effects will be taken metformin for additional 35 months (total 36months including the adjustment period).</description>
