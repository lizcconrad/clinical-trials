  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if: the large muscles of the leg, activated during
      walking, are also active during scooting; whether scooting alters the relationship between
      leg and breathing heaviness; whether there is evidence of leg fatigue during scooting.

    <measure>slope of the relationship between self-reported breathing and leg heaviness using Borg scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Borg scale ratings of breathing and leg heaviness will be measured during stepwise incremental speed exercise tests. The relationship between leg and breathing heaviness with increasing demand (speed) is quantified by the slope of the relationship between self-reported breathing and leg heaviness under each condition of customary walking and scooting.</description>
