      It is the aim of this trial to use a new computerized cell selection method, in addition to
      the current and world-wide used scoring system of fertilized oocytes implemented by Scott, to
      determine whether this leads to an increase in pregnancy rates in women undergoing assisted
      reproductive techniques.

      It is the aim of this trial to use a new computerized selection method, in addition to the
      current and world-wide used scoring system of fertilized oocytes (zygotes) implemented by
      Scott in 1998, to determine whether this leads to an increase in pregnancy rates in women
      undergoing assisted reproductive techniques. If successful this could in the future lead to a
      reduction in the numbers of embryos required to achieve a pregnancy. Transferring only one
      embryo means minimizing the incidence of high order multiple pregnancies.

      Regularly couples gain several fertilized oocytes (zygotes) due to artificial reproductive
      techniques. As a routine, these cells are archived using pictures and videos for quality and
      safety reasons in different stages of development. Because it is planned to transfer only one
      or two developed embryos to the uterus, investigators have to select the zygotes with the
      highest potential for implantation and pregnancy. The remaining cells are preserved using
      vitrification.

      In the study, investigators use in addition to the established Zygote-score (Z-score) by
      Scott a new selection method for one group of patients: The quality of the zygotes of all
      patients is classified according to the described Scott system. Patients are randomized to
      two groups. Group 1 is the control group without any further intervention. If needed for
      selection, the quality of the zygotes of the patients of group 2 is additionally scored with
      a new method. The pictures of the cells, already taken for quality and safety reasons, are
      taken and the cells surface is analysed using a computer algorithm.

    <description>A live birth is defined as the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of fertilization, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as heart beat, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite movement of voluntary muscle, irrespective of whether the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached.</description>

    <description>In addition to the routine Z-score for zygote selection, if needed, the photographs of the zygotes already taken for quality and safety reasons are analysed using the new computer algorithm. Within a few minutes it generates a score, determining the quality of the cells. The two best cells upon Z-score result and new computer algorithm result are selected for first transfer.</description>

    <description>After fertilisation pronuclei and nucleoli can be seen inside the cells by microscope. Routinely, the alignment of nucleoli can be used generating a score, the Z-score 1-4, established by Scott. Two zygotes getting the best Z-score are selected for cell culture and the cells that develop to embryo stage are used for first transfer.</description>
