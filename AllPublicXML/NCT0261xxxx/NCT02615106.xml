  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Radiotherapy plus
      Endostar(Recombinant Human Endostatin) in patients with Pediatric Neuroblastoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical data proved that Endostar was a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which
      could suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent
      human genome. So investigators design Radiotherapy plus Endostar to treat Pediatric
      Neuroblastoma to research the RR and safety. Investigators believe this treatment regimen may
      be a new approach to the pediatric neuroblastoma patients.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma
             or elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 months.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2

          -  Diagnostic Imaging MRI and/or CT of the area to be treated within 8 weeks of any
             treatment. Baseline bone marrow biopsy and bone scan (with 99mTc-diphosphonate or MIBG
             scan (131I-MIBG or 123I-MIBG) from time of original diagnosis is required.

          -  Because radiation is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability of the patient or the patient's legal guardian to understand and the
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Participants or their legal guardian must sign consent prior to the initiation of
             radiation therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be ineligible if any prior therapeutic radiation therapy &gt; 500 cGy has
             been delivered.

          -  Patients will be ineligible if chemotherapy was completed ≥ 1 year from the planned
             start date of radiation therapy or if the patient is referred for radiation therapy
             after a relapse following a regimen with chemotherapy alone.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Pregnant females are excluded. Women of childbearing age/menstruating must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to initiation of radiation therapy.
