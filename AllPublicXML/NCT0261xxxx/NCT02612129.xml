      A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutic study in patients
      with confirmed diagnosis of NiemannPick disease type C (NPC).

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of arimoclomol (compared to
      placebo) when it is administered as an add-on therapy to the patient's current prescribed
      best standard of care; patient's standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat.

    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutic study in patients
      with confirmed diagnosis of NiemannPick disease type C (NPC).

      Patients must either 1) have completed Visit 2 (end of study [EOS]) of the CTORZYNPC001 study
      or 2) meet the eligibility criteria of this study including a requirement of stable treatment
      with miglustat for 6 months (if on miglustat therapy) prior to enrolment into the study.

      Aim:

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of arimoclomol (compared to
      placebo) when it is administered as an add-on therapy to the patient's current prescribed
      best standard of care; patient's standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat.

      Randomisation:

      Patients will be randomised to receive placebo or arimoclomol (with an allocation ratio of
      1:2).

      Pharmacokinetic evaluation(age below 12):

      To confirm the selected dose, patients less than 12 years of age will undergo an arimoclomol
      single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation before randomisation and the start of continuous
      (multiple dosing) treatment.

      Early Escape Clause:

      In patients whose disease progression is too severe and/or too fast, the &quot;early escape
      clause&quot; will allow the Investigator to apply the escape route which implies that the patient
      can be treated with arimoclomol (as per blinded phase study schedule) and be followed up on
      an annual basis until arimoclomol has received EU MA or until the analysis of data from the
      controlled, 12 month blinded phase study period does not support the efficacy and/or safety
      of arimoclomol.

      Study duration:

      The duration of the blinded phase study period will be 12 months.

      Following this, all patients will be offered to continue into the extension phase of the
      study where every patient will receive arimoclomol and be followed up and attend site visits
      at 18 months and 24 months (after randomisation) and then on an annual basis thereafter.The
      extension phase runs until arimoclomol has received Regulatory Approval or until the analysis
      of data from the controlled, blinded phase 12 month study period does not support the
      efficacy and/or safety of arimoclomol.

                  o If a patient has been discontinued from prescribed treatment with miglustat,
                  they must have been discontinued for at least 3 continuous months prior to

               -  Ability to walk either independently or with assistance.

                    -  Written informed consent (and assent if appropriate to local laws and

                    -  Willing to participate in all aspects of trial design including blood
                       sampling (PK, blood biomarkers and safety labs), skin biopsies and imaging
                       (ultrasonography of the liver and spleen);

                    -  Ability to travel to the corresponding clinical trial site at the scheduled
                       visit times for evaluation and follow-up;

                    -  All sexually active female patients of child-bearing potential
                       (post-menarchal) must use highly effective contraception during the study
                       and until 1 week after the last dose of IMP.

        Highly effective birth control methods include: Combined (oestrogen and progestogen
        containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,
        intravaginal or transdermal); progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with
        inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable); intrauterine device (IUD);
        intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal occlusion; and vasectomised
        partner.

        All sexually active male patients with female partners of child-bearing potential
        (post-menarchal) must use a condom with or without spermicide in addition to the birth
        control used by their partners during the study and until 3 months after the last dose of
        IMP.

        Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective birth control method only if it is
        defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the study and for 1 week after
        the last dose of IMP (for female patients of child-bearing potential) and for 3 months
        after the last dose of IMP (for male patients with female partners of child-bearing
        potential). The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated by the Investigator
        in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of
        the patient.

        •Ability to comply with the protocol-specified procedures/evaluations and scheduled visits.

             limit of normal (central laboratory assessment);

          -  Known or suspected allergy or intolerance to the IMP (arimoclomol or constituents);

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient's clinical condition does not allow
             for the required blood collection and/or skin biopsies as per the protocol-specified
             procedures;

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug during the study or in the 4 weeks prior to
             entering the study.

        This includes treatment with any investigational drug during the study in an attempt to
        treat NP-C;

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding;

          -  Current participation in another trial is not permitted unless it is a
             non-interventional study and the sole purpose of the trial is for long-term follow
             up/survival data (registry);

          -  For patients who have not completed the CTORZYNPC001 study, fulfilling any of the
             criteria listed below:

               -  Patients with uncontrolled severe epileptic seizures period (at least 3
                  consecutive severe epileptic seizures that required medication) within 2 months
                  prior to the written consent. This includes patients with ongoing seizures that
                  are not stable in frequency or type or duration over a 2 month period prior to
                  enrolment, requiring change in dose of antiepileptic medication (other than
                  adjustment for weight) over a 2 month period prior to enrolment, or requiring 3
                  or more antiepileptic medications to control seizures;

               -  Neurologically asymptomatic patients;

               -  Severe manifestations of NP-C disease that would interfere with the patient's
                  ability to comply with the requirements of this protocol;

               -  Treatment with any IMP within 4 weeks prior to the study enrolment.
