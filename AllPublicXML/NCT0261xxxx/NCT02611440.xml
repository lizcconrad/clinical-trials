  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence is a major factor to prevent vascular recurrence after a first ischemic
      stroke. Nevertheless, it is suboptimal and the implementation of specific interventions are
      needed to improve it.

      A patient - centered and pluriprofessional structured intervention, targeting the medication,
      introduced at hospital discharge and continued at home (by regular telephone contact) could
      improve medication adherence one year after stroke.

      This intervention would consist of semi structured interviews patient-pharmacist at different
      times during one year after stroke. The information about the therapeutic management of the
      patient will be shared between healthcare professionals : general practitioners (GP) and
      community pharmacists (CP), hospital clinical pharmacist (HCP) and physician (HPhys).

      It will allow for decrease of the recurrent stroke and others cardiovascular complications
      based on a better adherence to preventive medication. Furthermore the decrease of the
      iatrogenic events and the improvement of the quality of life of patients may be also
      associated.

Pharmacist advices focused on how to take medication and how to manage adverse events will be provided.
Telephone interviews with hospital clinical pharmacist - patient (at M3 M6 and M9): The objective is to review with the patient its medication-taking routine and its potential difficulties, to motivate adherence to treatment and lifestyle/dietary rules, to give advices about therapeutics and how to take medication.
HCP contacts CP to determine the prescription refill. Final interview with HCP pharmacist (at M12): The objective is to take stock with the patient about its taking drug load.</description>
