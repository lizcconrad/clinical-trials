        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female children from 6 to less than 18 years of age suffering from narcolepsy
             with or without cataplexy - ICSD-3 criteria (narcolepsy type 1 and 2).

          -  PDSS

          -  Patients should be free of non-authorized medication, in particular psychostimulant
             treatments as from the screening visit onwards.

          -  Parents - and patients old enough to understand who have expressed a willingness to
             participate in the study, who have signed and dated the informed consent form prior to
             beginning protocol required procedures.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the patient must have adequate support to comply
             with the entire study requirements as described in the protocol (e.g., transportation
             to and from trial site, self rating scales and diaries completion, drug compliance,
             scheduled visits, tests).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other conditions that can be considered the primary causes of EDS.

          -  Cataplectic patients treated by anticataplectics which are not under a stable
             treatment at the time of inclusion.

          -  Patients treated for cataplexy or any other pathology, by tricyclic antidepressants.

          -  Any significant abnormality of the electrocardiogram and particularly Fridericia's QTc
             interval.

          -  Patients with significant abnormality or clinical laboratory results.

          -  Psychiatric and neurological disorders in the investigator's opinion, would preclude
             the patient's participation and completion of this trial or comprise reliable
             representation of subjective symptoms.

          -  Active clinically significant illness, including unstable cardiovascular, endocrine,
             neoplastic, gastrointestinal, haematological, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic,
             neurological (other than narcolepsy/cataplexy), pulmonary, and/or renal disease which
             could interfere with the study conduct or counter-indicate the study treatments or
             place the patient at risk during the trial or compromise the study objectives.
