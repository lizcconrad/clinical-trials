      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the presence of a pharmacy
      technician in a care unit (Hepato-Gastroenterology Department) on detected medication errors.

      This is a before-after study consisting of three sequential phases:

      Month 1: one month of observation of what is happening in the department Month 2: one month
      wash out period Month 3: active participation of a pharmacy technician in the department

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A- To assess the impact of the presence of a pharmacy technician on the ratio of the number
      of patients with at least one medication error / number of included patients hospitalized in
      the service.

      B- To characterize detected medication errors.

      C- To identify and evaluate the potential causes of medication errors.

      D- To evaluate whether the presence of a pharmacy technician reduces nursing time spent on
      medication management.

      E- To evaluate the economic impact of the presence of a pharmacy technician.

      F- To evaluate the acceptability of the intervention by the nursing staff and pharmacy
      technicians using questionnaires.

    <measure>For each medication error: the criticality of the error</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Criticality is graded according to the following classes:
C: no potential harm to the patient;
D: treatment or increased monitoring without harm to the patient
(E to I): potential harm to the patient
3E: treatment or surgery with temporary harm 3F: longer duration of hospitalization with temporary harm 3G: permanent harm 3H: involving a life-threatening harm 3I: death
Criticality is determined by the concordance of two, independent expert opinions; or, in case of discordance, the concordance of 2 out 3 expert opinions.</description>
