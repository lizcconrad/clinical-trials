      Project title: A randomized controlled trial of whole soy diet in place of red/processed meat
      and high fat dairy products on metabolic features in postmenopausal women Objectives:
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an escalating public health problem especially in postmenopausal
      women. Traditional whole soy foods are rich in unsaturated fats, high quality plant protein
      and various bioactive phytochemicals that could benefit on MetS. The aim of the study is to
      examine the effect of whole soy replacement diet on the features of MetS among postmenopausal
      women.

      Hypothesis to be tested: Whole soy diet in place of red or processed meat and high fat dairy
      products will significantly improve metabolic features.

      Design and subjects: This will be a 12-month randomized, single-blind, controlled trial among
      208 postmenopausal women with high risk of MetS or early MetS.

      Study instruments: After 4 weeks' run-in, participants will be randomly allocated to either
      of two intervention groups, whole soy replacement group or control group, each for 6 months.

      Interventions: Subjects in whole soy group will be required to include 4 servings of whole
      soy foods (containing 25g soy protein) into their daily diet isocalorically replacing red or
      processed meat and high fat dairy products. Subjects in the control group will remain an
      usual diet.

      Main outcome measures: The outcome measures will include the indices of metabolic features as
      well as a 10-year risk for ischemic cardiovascular disease.

      Data analysis: The changes and %change of the metabolic features at 6- and 12-month will be
      compared among the two groups.

      Expected results: Whole soy diet substitution of high saturated fat and cholesterol rich
      animal products will notably decrease the risk of MetS.
