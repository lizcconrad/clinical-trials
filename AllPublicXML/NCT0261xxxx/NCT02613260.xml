  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uptake of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is suboptimal in the San Francisco Health Network
      and access to care may be limited so novel models of health care delivery are warranted. The
      objective of this study is to examine whether a centralized panel management model with
      mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) will be effective at increasing the uptake of CRC
      screening and could be developed and sustained within the typical parameters of
      cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses.

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Since uptake of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is suboptimal in the SF
      safety-net system and access to care may be limited, novel models of health care delivery are
      warranted. The overall hypothesis is that a centralized panel management model with mailed
      fecal immunochemical test (FIT) will be effective at increasing the uptake of CRC screening
      and could be developed and sustained within the typical parameters of cost-effectiveness and
      budget impact analyses. Barriers to immunization of adults include missed opportunities
      during visits, limited access to providers, and provider and patient beliefs of efficacy.

      Design: To rigorously examine the benefit of the centralized panel management to improve
      uptake of CRC screening with mailed FIT, the electronic health system will be used to
      identify eligible patients who are not up-to-date with CRC screening. Broadly, patients will
      be randomized 1:1 to usual care or intervention arm, stratified by clinic, gender, prior
      screening, and race to receive mailed FIT kits + usual care versus usual care alone. The
      cost-effectiveness of no screening, usual care, and centralized management with mailed FIT
      outreach will be compared using mathematical simulation models.

    <intervention_name>FIT Outreach</intervention_name>
    <description>This arm will consist of priming patients with a postcard and a possibly a phone call two weeks prior to them being mailed a FIT kit. The FIT kits will be mailed to the patients with a letter from their clinic's care team informing them why they should complete the FIT and wordless instructions to help them complete the FIT. Two weeks after the FIT kit is mailed the patients that have not returned the kit will receive up to two reminder calls. During the phone calls the outreach workers will use health coaching techniques to encourage patients to complete the FIT. All written materials have been translated into English and Chinese and during phone calls patients will be spoken to in the language that they are most comfortable using.</description>
