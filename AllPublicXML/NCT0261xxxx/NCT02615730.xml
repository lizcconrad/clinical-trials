  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/IIa, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, multi-center study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and clinical activity of oral
      GSK2636771 in combination with intravenous (IV) paclitaxel in two independent subject
      populations: subjects with PTEN-deficient, advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. This study will
      be conducted in two phases: the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose Expansion Phase. The Dose
      Escalation Phase (Phase Ib) is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of GSK2636771 administered in combination with paclitaxel.
      The Dose Expansion Phase (Phase IIa) will further evaluate the safety and clinical activity
      of the RP2D as determined in the Dose Escalation Phase.
