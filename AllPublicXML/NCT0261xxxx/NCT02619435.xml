      The purpose of this study is to purpose of this study is to assess if regorafenib is active
      enough, in terms of 6-month progression-free rate, to warrant further comparative studies in
      patients with RAS-mutant advanced colorectal cancer who have progressed after first-line
      oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab.
