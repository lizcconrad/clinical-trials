      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact Pono Choices has among youth for teen
      pregnancy and STI prevention measures such as: initiation of sexual activity; engagement in
      high risk sexual behaviors; knowledge of pregnancy and STI prevention; attitudes toward
      healthy sexual behaviors; skills in managing relationships and choices; and intentions about
      future sexual activity.

      The study used a cluster randomized controlled design to evaluate the impact of Pono Choices.
      Thirty-six middle schools in Hawaii were randomly assigned to participate as either a
      treatment or control school. Treatment school teachers were trained to deliver Pono Choices.
      Control school teachers did not receive training and chose their own middle school sexual
      health education curricula.

      Over 1,700 7th and 8th grade students in 34 Hawaii schools enrolled into the study. As part
      of the study, students were invited to participate in baseline and follow-up surveys. The
      student survey responses were used to determine the impact Pono Choices has on teen pregnancy
      and STI prevention measures.
