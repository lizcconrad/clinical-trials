      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if RecoverMI care can help to shorten
      the time that patients are in the hospital after surgery and if it can help them recover
      sooner.

      RecoverMI includes the following parts:

        -  Preoperative Education

        -  Early oral intake

        -  Early mobilization

        -  Telemedicine

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one group
      is the same, better, or worse than the other group.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 1, you will receive standard enhanced care after your
           surgery.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive routine care after surgery, but you
           will also receive accelerated recovery, early discharge, and Telemedicine. Participants
           will be loaned an iPad to use for video-conferencing and text messaging in this study.

      This is an investigational study. The study doctor can explain how RecoverMI is designed to
      work.

      Up to 32 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
