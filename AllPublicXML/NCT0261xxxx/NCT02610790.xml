  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to quantify pre- and postoperative physical activity of patients
      operated on colorectal surgery. Daily physical activity (No. of footsteps) is going to be
      recorded from 15 days before surgery to the end of hospitalization after surgery in a
      prospective cohort of consecutive colorectal patients by use of an attached strap. Then, the
      investigators will propose physical activity thresholds (adapted to the age, gender and
      patient comorbidities) to optimize the ERAS protocol (Enhanced Rehabilitation After Surgery).
      Thus, this analysis will allow the investigators to provide patients with physical
      rehabilitation programs &quot;a la carte&quot; during a hospitalization for colorectal surgery.
      Connected bracelets will directly involve patients in their care and rehabilitation.

      Connected bracelet will be given to 50 consecutive patients undergone colorectal surgery 15
      days before surgery. The investigators will measure pre- and postoperative physical activity.
      It is an observational activity of patient's physical activity during the perioperative
      period with no intervention.
