    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to preliminary evaluate the efficacy and safety of NIBS system for
      treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) (over 6 months). The trial is of a double blind
      sham controlled partial crossover design and will involve 2 weekly treatments and evaluations
      for 6 weeks, with 6 weeks follow-up. The goal of the study is to 1. Asses the CLBP change
      immediate and long term effect for the trial duration and follow-up. 2. Asses quality of life
      improvement as measure by sleep quality and questioners. 3. Asses long term neuronal changes
      or lack thereof in treated and untreated subjects.
