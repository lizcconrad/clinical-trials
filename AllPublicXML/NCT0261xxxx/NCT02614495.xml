      This study adopt Simon's two-stage designs method. In the first stage, When the first 12
      patients enrolled complete therapy of Cycle 1, investigators and sponsors will analyze safety
      and pharmacokinetic (PK) data, to determine whether the dose is suitable for TC and
      enrollment should be stopped during this period.15 subjects will be enrolled in both
      subgroups (advanced MTC and iodine-refractory DTC), and more 10 subjects in each subgroups
      will be enrolled after efficacy assessment in the second stage.

      Patients receive oral sulfatinib at a dose of 300mg/d within 1 hour after breakfast
      (once-daily dosing continuously, every 28-day treatment cycle) until disease progression,
      death, or intolerable toxicity, or in the opinion of the investigator, patients were no
      longer deriving clinical beneﬁt、lost to follow-up、withdrew informed consent form, or sponsors
      terminated the study, whichever comes first.
