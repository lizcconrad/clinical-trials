  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Literature shows that anaesthetists have a low success-rate when trying to access the airway
      percutaneously in case of failed ventilation and intubation.

      The study will investigate anaesthetists ability to locate the trachea and the thyroid
      cartilage and the cricoid cartilage in patients, using different methods including
      application of ultrasonography.

      percutaneously in case of failed ventilation and intubation.

      The researchers will investigate anaesthetists ability to locate the trachea and the thyroid
      cartilage and the cricoid cartilage of a healthy subject with different methods including
      application of ultrasonography.
