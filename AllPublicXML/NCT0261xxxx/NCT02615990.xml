  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of the Erigo applied as part of the early mobilization
      program in the Trauma ICU at the University of Kentucky. It is our hypothesis, that with the
      Erigo, critically ill patients will tolerate verticalization and mobilization earlier and
      safely resulting in improved outcomes measured by increased mobility and strength on ICU
      discharge, decreased requirements for mechanical ventilation, reduced complication rates and
      decreased ICU and hospital LOS.

      The &quot;Erigo&quot; by Hocoma is a combination of tilt table with a robotic stepper device allowing
      for cyclic leg loading. Erigo now also includes Functional Electrical Stimulation to optimize
      active neuromuscular stimulation. It allows for protected gradual verticalization and
      mobilization based on patient tolerance and progress. It has been shown to improve
      orthostatic tolerance, cerebral blood flow and muscle strength.

      Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial will compare two groups. The patients that meet
      inclusion criteria will be randomized into either the treatment group or a control group.
      General ICU mobility guidelines consist of scaled activity related to the patients'
      stability. The control group will get the general ICU mobility treatments and the treatment
      group will have one mobility treatment replaced with the Erigo treatment.

    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Rapid decreases in blood pressure are a common clinical challenge when trauma patients go from lying down to standing. Changes in blood pressure will be compared between groups to determine if verticalization with an ERIGO Pro tilt table will alleviate the drop in blood pressure more quickly than standard of care. Participants will have their blood pressure measured upon initial verticalization after injury and at each treatment session there after until they achieve ambulation (the ability to move without assistance). Data will be presented as the number of days of treatment required to achieve blood pressure homeostasis during the positional change from lying to standing.</description>

        <title>Orthostatic Tolerance During Verticalization</title>
        <description>Rapid decreases in blood pressure are a common clinical challenge when trauma patients go from lying down to standing. Changes in blood pressure will be compared between groups to determine if verticalization with an ERIGO Pro tilt table will alleviate the drop in blood pressure more quickly than standard of care. Participants will have their blood pressure measured upon initial verticalization after injury and at each treatment session there after until they achieve ambulation (the ability to move without assistance). Data will be presented as the number of days of treatment required to achieve blood pressure homeostasis during the positional change from lying to standing.</description>

            <description>The Erigo device therapy is a combination of tilt table with robotic stepper device allowing for cyclic leg loading. It also includes Functional Electrical Stimulation to optimize active neuromuscular stimulation. It will be used once a day to replace one of the standard PT therapies. The exercise mimics walking beyond what regular range of motion provides. Patients will have 2 additional PT therapies 20 minutes of standard range of motion movements.

It also includes Functional Electrical Stimulation to optimize active neuromuscular stimulation. It will be used once a day to replace one of the standard PT therapies. The exercise mimics walking beyond what regular range of motion provides. Patients will have 2 additional PT therapies 20 minutes of standard range of motion movements.
