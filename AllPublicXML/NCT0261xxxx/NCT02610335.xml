  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In actual practice the patients with mild or moderate lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms receive
      an epidural infiltration and participate in kyphosis reeducation in first intention. Yet the
      kyphosis reeducation did not show a real profit in the time compared with the natural
      evolution of the pathology. The study assume that the spinal mobility reeducation will reduce
      the incidence of pain recurrences compared with the classic kyphosis reeducation.

    <textblock>
      The standard treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis is the lumbar canal recalibration surgery
      which presents co-morbidity factors and risks of post-operative complications. The
      non-invasive methods are a good alternative compared with the surgery : the patients
      medically treated present few damages and the results of the postponed surgery are equivalent
      to the immediate surgery. That is why a non-surgical treatment is proposed in first intention
      to the patients with mild or moderate symptoms : this treatment associates an epidural
      infiltration and a kyphosis reeducation.

      Yet the kyphosis reeducation did not show a real profit in the time compared with the natural
      evolution of the pathology. The benefits of the infiltration are lost three months after this
      one in 80 % of the cases. A return to physical activity and a restored spinal mobility would
      improve the duration of the infiltration effect. The objective is then to compare the
      efficiency of a spinal mobility reeducation program versus a kyphosis reeducation program in
      patients with acquired and central lumbar spinal stenosis. It is a prospective, monocentric,
      randomized, superiority and parallel-group study :

        -  group C (control group) : kyphosis reeducation + patient education + auto-reeducation at
           home,

        -  group M (test group) : spinal mobility reeducation + patient education +
           auto-reeducation at home.
