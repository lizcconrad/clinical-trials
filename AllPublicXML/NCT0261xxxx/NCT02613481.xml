  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluates the emotional and functional benefits of Poly-L-Lactic Acid
      (Sculptra™), a cosmetic product used to fill defects of the skin. All participants will
      receive Sculptra™.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facial volume loss can result in emotional distress and functional impairment in some
      affected individuals. Poly-L-Lactic Acid (Sculptra™) stimulates collagen production in the
      skin thereby replenishing some of the collagen lost to natural aging and ultraviolet damage.
      This study will assess the emotional and functional benefits of Poly-L-Lactic Acid treated
      subject's through self report measurement tools.
