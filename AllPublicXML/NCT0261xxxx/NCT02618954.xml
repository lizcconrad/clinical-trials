  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the longitudinal relation between clinical
      remission and ultrasound (US) remission in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      At a patient level, US-detected residual synovitis (evaluated both by US grey-scale signals
      and power Doppler signals) is frequent in patients with RA in clinical remission. Several
      longitudinal studies reveal an association of US-detected residual synovitis and risk of
      relapse and radiographic progression, in individual patients and joints, over 1-2 years.

      However, the longitudinal relation between clinical remission and US remission is not so
      well-known and it is possible that clinical remission arrive before ultrasound remission.
      Thus arise the question as to whether the presence of US-detected residual synovitis require
      to adapt the treatment to ultrasound findings or to simply increase the patient care.

      The investigator propose to conduct a prospective, bi-center, non randomized study.

      The study population will include all RA patient at least 18 years old in clinical remission
      for less than 6 month.

      The primary endpoint (ability of US-detected residual synovitis to predict relapse or
      radiographic progression in individual patients and joints) will be evaluated afer 12 months
      of follow-up The total follow-up will be 12 months with a follow-up every 3 months. In
      addition to the standard care, each follow-up will include an ultrasound examination of 40
      joints and 8 tendons
