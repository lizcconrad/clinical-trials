  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to estimate and rank-order the longitudinal
      standardized mean changes over 6 months and over 12 months, for a set of novel outcome
      measures administered to participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in order to
      identify measures that are more sensitive to disease progression than Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). The secondary objectives of this study
      are: To evaluate the test-retest reproducibility of each outcome measure; To determine
      correlations between 6 and 12-month changes in all exploratory measures with 18 and 24-month
      changes in ALSFRS-R and survival; To assess correlations between/among the various measures;
      To obtain biological samples in order to identify molecular correlates to the clinical
      measures and to further characterize previously identified and novel molecular biomarkers of
      disease progression for incorporation into future clinical studies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal standardized mean change in electrophysiological measures as assessed by electrical impedance myography (EIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6 and Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>EIM is an electrophysiological technique in which current is applied to a muscle of interest and resultant voltage and impedance are measured. These measured parameters reflect the conductivity of underlying tissue and presumably the pathologic state of denervated muscle in an ALS participant</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal standardized mean change in electrophysiological measures as assessed by compound muscle action potential (CMAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6 and Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>CMAP is a standard electrophysiological measure generated by maximally stimulating a nerve such that all muscle fibers innervated by the respective nerve are depolarized. Reduction of CMAP amplitude reflects loss of motor axons and, therefore, is directly relevant to ALS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal standardized mean change in electrophysiological measures as assessed by motor unit number estimation (MUNE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6 and Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Optional, to be administered at each site's Investigator's discretion. MUNE is used to estimate the number of functioning motor units.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal standardized mean change in electrophysiological measures as assessed by motor unit number index (MUNIX)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6 and Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>MUNIX estimates functioning motor units within a muscle. CMAP and surface electromyography potentials (surface interference patterns) are obtained at various levels of voluntary effort, and MUNIX is estimated using power and area of CMAP and surface interference patterns.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal standardized mean change in muscle strength measures as assessed by hand-held dynamometry (HHD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6 and Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>HHD tests isometric strength of multiple muscles using standard participant positioning. Approximately 10 muscle groups will be examined (per each side) in both upper and lower extremities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal standardized mean change in respiratory measures as assessed by slow vital capacity (SVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6 and Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Vital capacity will be measured by means of an SVC test, administered in the upright position. Upright SVC will be determined by performing 3 to 5 measures, in accordance with criteria established by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal standardized mean change in functional measures as assessed by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6 and Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R has been demonstrated to predict survival. The ALSFRS-R measures 4 functional domains, including respiratory, bulbar function, gross motor skills, and fine motor skills. There are a total of 12 questions, each scored from 0 to 4 for a total possible score of 48 [Cedarbaum 1999], with higher scores representing better function.</description>
