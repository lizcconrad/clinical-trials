      This study is a collaboration between the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Prison
      System, and the North East Treatment Center (NETSteps). It purpose is to study the impact of
      an injectable opiate addiction medication (extended release naltrexone) given before reentry
      into the community that might help to improve reconnection to healthcare and other support
      systems, and possibly help reduce recidivism.

      The primary objectives for this study is to offer tools to support improve healthcare and
      related outcomes and reduce the risk of relapse and recidivism for opiate addicted prisoners
      reentering into the community after release from correctional facilities. In this study the
      investigators examine a medication-assisted therapy (extended release naltrexone) that is
      likely to be acceptable to correctional facilities and opioid addicted prisoners and that can
      improve the outcomes achieved by the usual detoxification/treatment referral approach. The
      results may be used to facilitate policy changes that involve adding extended release
      naltrexone to correctional facility formularies for use before reentry, and collaborating
      with one or more outpatient treatment providers to maintain continuity of care. Two hundred
      (200) opioid addicted prisoners currently incarcerated in the Philadelphia Prison System, who
      meet study admission criteria and express an interest in extended release naltrexone
      treatment, who give informed consent and will be scheduled for release within 14 days of
      being randomized into the study will be enrolled. These 200 subjects will be stratified by
      sex (male/females), will be 18 years or older, and are not sentenced).

    <description>Extended Release Naltrexone is currently marketed in the US for use in adults with alcohol dependence. It will be administered in this study at the currently marketed dose of 380 mgs. Subjects will be randomized to receive one injection of 380 mg of extended release naltrexone, at baseline, before they leave the prison, or either 380 mg of extended release naltrexone after they are released from prison. Both groups will receive three additional monthly doses of 380 mgs while enrolled in intensive outpatient treatment for six months. Subjects will also receive weekly psychosocial counseling.</description>
