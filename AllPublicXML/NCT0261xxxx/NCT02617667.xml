  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of two
      different dose levels of CyclASol Ophthalmic Solutions to placebo (vehicle) and Restasis for
      the treatment of the signs and symptoms of Dry Eye Disease (DED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study will explore the safety, efficacy and tolerability of two CyclASol
      concentrations as one drop twice daily versus vehicle (placebo). In addition to the masked
      vehicle control arm, an open-label comparator arm consisting of Restasis will be included.

      The study will explore a range of signs and symptoms of DED to gain an understanding of the
      possible treatment effects in comparison to vehicle and estimation of effect sizes. In line
      with current treatment guidelines, the proposed phase 2 population will consist of patients
      suffering from moderate to severe DED.
