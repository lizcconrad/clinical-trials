    <textblock>
      Autologous human bone marrow mononuclear fraction (BMMF) will be harvested and given to
      children with bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss. The aim is to
      determine if bone marrow mononuclear fraction (BMMF) infusion is safe, feasible, improves
      inner ear function, audition, and language development.

      Autologous human bone marrow mononuclear fraction (BMMF) will be given to children with
      bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss.

      Subjects will come to Orlando for pretesting to include an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
      Auditory brainstem response (ABR), blood work: Complete metabolic panel (CMP), Complete blood
      count (CBC), Hepatic Function Panel, Prothrombin (PT), Partial thromboplastin time (PTT),
      International normalized ration (INR), Chest Xray, and a Speech and Language Evaluation.

      After pretesting, the subjects will undergo a bone marrow harvest and then receive their
      autologous bone marrow mononuclear fraction (BMMF) intravenously. The subjects will then be
      monitored for 24 hours post infusion. After 24 hours, the subject will undergo repeat blood
      work and a chest x ray. Subjects will then be discharged home. Subjects will follow up in
      Orlando at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year post infusion. Follow up testing will repeat the
      exams performed at pretesting.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post infusion day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The reticuloendothelial system can sequester immature blood elements, theoretically resulting in hepatic injury. An acute elevation of the aspartate transaminase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase test (ALT) hepatic enzymes &gt;5.0 - 20.0 x upper limit normal (ULN) in the first 24 hours post infusion will trigger the stopping rules. This level corresponds to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v4.0 Grade 3 adverse event. It is unlikely that &quot;end vessel&quot; microthrombosis would occur in the liver due to the dual blood supply of the liver and the lung is the first pass organ. This will be reported as the number of participants with abnormal laboratory values and adverse events related to treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in baseline to 1 day post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the subject's acute neurologic status will be monitored hourly for 4 hours after infusion. Data recorded include Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) from infusion to discharge. Grade 3 Central Nervous System (CNS) event as defined in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v4.0 occurring within 12 hours of cellular product infusion will trigger the stopping rules. Other changes temporally related to infusion (those events occurring within 12 hours of infusion) will be considered associated with the protocol and recorded as an adverse event. This will be reported as the number of participants with adverse events related to treatment.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events for Pulmonary Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 hours after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Blood-oxygen saturation will be monitored by finger oximeter. Moderate respiratory dysfunction within the first 24 hours post infusion will be considered an adverse event but will not warrant stopping the trial unless recommended by the Data Safety Monitoring Board. In the event of pulmonary dysfunction, standard supportive therapy will be given. Pulmonary symptoms/events corresponding to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0 Grade 3 will trigger the stopping rules</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Audiometry, to-acoustic emissions and Auditory Brainstem Response will be used to assess the physiologic integrity of the neural structures which are critical to normal audition and speech. Changes in these areas will be evaluated by repeating the measures all follow-up visits.</description>
