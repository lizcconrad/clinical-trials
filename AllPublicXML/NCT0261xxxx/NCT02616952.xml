      decoction, is effective in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot randomized, controlled trial is aimed to preliminarily assess the effectiveness of
      Yiqi Suoquan Tang, a Chinese Herbal decoction, in the treatment of female stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI). Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receiving Yiqi
      Suoquan Tang or pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) using a random number generator in a 1:1
      ratio. To minimize the evaluation bias, the outcome assessors and statisticians will be
      masked to treatment allocation.

      Assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05, power of 90%, and a 20% drop-out, a sample size of 36
      would be needed for each group. The statistical analysis will be performed based on the
      intention-to-treat principle, which is defined as patients that have received at least one
      treatment. Missing data will be replaced by the last observed value. Continuous variables
      will be compared by Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables will be
      analyzed by chi-square test, Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis H test as appropriate. For
      comparison between two time points, paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used
      as appropriate. A statistically significant difference was set at P&lt;0.05.

    <description>In intensive exercises, participants are taught how to identify the muscles: 1) identify anal sphincter/feel anus, and try to raise it from chair (without adding abdominal, thigh, and buttock muscles) with a position of sitting; 2) identify levator ani and try to raise vagina from chair (without adding abdominal, thigh, and buttock muscles) with a position of Sitting, bent forward, elbows on knees; 3) contract levator ani with a position of sitting, lying, and standing; 4) contract anal sphincter with a position of sitting, lying, and standing. Once the participants can identify the muscles, they are asked to do a set consists of 10 contractions, each lasting 5 seconds, with a 5 seconds break between contractions. Then they need to do same procedure 3 times daily as the home exercises.</description>
