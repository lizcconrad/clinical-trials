    <textblock>
      Pathway Genomics Corporation (Pathway Genomics), a San Diego, California company, is involved
      in the development and validation of new molecular diagnostic assays for the analysis of
      circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) found in the plasma-derived DNA
      (cell-free DNA or cfDNA) in order to identify specific variants (mutations) in cancer driver
      genes. The purpose of testing for mutations in ctDNA is to detect and monitor cancer. All
      cells shed DNA into the bloodstream. Finding cancer-associated mutations in the cfDNA may
      lead to early detection of cancer in an otherwise apparently healthy (i.e. asymptomatic)
      individual or may allow the healthcare provider to more effectively monitor and treat a known
      cancer patient. The analysis is performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
      methodology where oligonucleotides are designed to target specific mutations in designated
      genes of interest followed by next generation deep sequencing of the amplified targets.
      Evaluation of the performance of these assays for screening for cancer in asymptomatic
      subjects is essential for the clinical validation of the use of these assays. The specific
      aim of this protocol is to obtain relevant human blood samples from individual subjects at
      higher than average risk for the development of cancer due to age, heredity, or environmental
      or toxic exposures for use in the statistical analysis of this method as an adjunct screening
      test for the potential presence of cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to obtain human blood samples from asymptomatic subjects who
      have never been diagnosed with cancer, but who may be at increased risk for cancer due to
      heredity, exposures, age, or family history to assess the validity of screening healthy but
      at risk patients for cancer via analysis of ctDNA.

      Specifically, the blood specimens will be collected from individuals who have responded to a
      self-administered health questionnaire that screens for higher risk of contracting cancer.
      Each participant will be asked to provide a 30 ml blood sample to be drawn by a primary care
      provider (PCP) or licensed phlebotomist. The specimens collected during the study may also be
      used in the research and development of new or modified molecular genetics assays. The
      results of these studies will be used to further the understanding of the use of ctDNA for
      the detection and monitoring of cancer in humans.

      The blood samples are collected in blood collection tubes (BCT) called Cell-Free DNA BCT®
      manufactured by Streck and intended for collection, stabilization and transportation of
      cell-free plasma DNA. This device also stabilizes and preserves cellular genomic DNA present
      in nucleated blood cells and circulating epithelial cells (tumor cells) found in whole blood.
      This product has not been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for In Vitro
      Diagnostic use and is labeled by Streck for research use only. Under the Clinical Laboratory
      Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations, laboratories are authorized to validate and use,
      as part of a laboratory-developed test (LDT), devices that have not been cleared or approved
      by the FDA. Pathway Genomics validated the CancerInterceptTM Detect molecular analysis system
      with the Streck tubes, in accordance with CLIA.

      Once the specimen has been collected and sent to Pathway by the physician or the phlebotomist
      who collects the samples, all other processing and testing are conducted by Pathway
      laboratory personnel. The analysis begins with the separation of the plasma from the rest of
      the blood sample. cfDNA will then be isolated from each sample. The quantity of cfDNA is
      measured and then the sample is amplified via PCR for next generation sequencing. The results
      of the sequencing will then be analyzed for the presence of one or more of the 96 mutations
      analyzed in this assay. The data are then reviewed and a report will be generated.

    <description>The group is to include at least 1000 individuals who are at high risk for the development of cancer. Risk is assessed through the completion of a clinical history questionnaire. Examples of such subjects include those with known hereditary cancer syndrome pathogenic variants without a diagnosis of cancer, with significant family history of breast, ovarian, colon, or lung cancer or melanoma, or another strong history of cancer but no prior molecular diagnosis, heavy smokers or those exposed to carcinogens and mutagens. The individuals who meet criteria for inclusion will undergo cell-free DNA isolation and circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis for the detection of genetic mutations associated with the possible development of a malignancy.</description>
