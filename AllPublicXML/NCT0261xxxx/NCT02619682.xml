    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the safety of alternating ixazomib citrate and lenalidomide as
      treatment to help keep cancer from coming back after stem cell transplant (maintenance
      therapy) in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Lenalidomide may
      stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells. Giving ixazomib citrate and lenalidomide
      as maintenance therapy after transplant may prolong the length of time until the cancer
      returns.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the toxicity of the use of ixazomib (ixazomib citrate) and lenalidomide as
      maintenance therapy after autologous transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the ability to deliver the planned therapy.

      II. Assess initial response to therapy.

      III. Evaluate the median time to disease progression.

      IV. Assess overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 30-120 days after completion of autologous transplant, patients receive ixazomib
      citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days for 2 courses, followed by lenalidomide
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28 for 2 courses. Treatment repeats, alternating after every 2
      courses, for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.

    <description>The first four months of therapy will be used as the time period in which toxicity will be evaluated and stopping rules for unacceptable toxicity will be implemented. A true withdrawal rate within first 4 months of 15% will be considered excessive. The incidence of second cancers will also be collected.</description>

    <description>Response criteria will be determined by International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. In patients with chemo-refractory disease at the time of ASCT, the therapy will be felt to be promising if median time to progression is &gt; 9 months. If chemo-sensitive disease at time of ASCT, the therapy will be felt to be promising if median time to progression is &gt; 41 months based on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 10014 lenalidomide maintenance study post ASCT. Initial response rates and outcome will be descriptively reported.</description>

    <description>Within 30-120 days after finishing autologous transplant, patients receive ixazomib citrate PO on days 1, 8 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will continue to alternate between ixazomib citrate and lenalidomide every 2 courses for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
