  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthritis in children is a long-term illness and it can make a child's life very difficult.
      In children 8-11 years old, the child and their family work together to deal with the
      problems that arthritis can cause. Learning to cope with and manage the problems that come
      with arthritis can stop it from getting worse. It is important to create programs that teach
      children and families how to cope with and manage arthritis. This study will develop and test
      an online game that helps children learn how to better manage their arthritis. The goal of
      these studies is to test: (1) how easy to use and acceptable the online game is; and (2) if
      children who play the game feel less pain, have fewer limitations, and a better quality of
      life compared to children who do not play the game.

For example, issues from a technical standpoint (for example, game not downloading properly, participant requiring assistance using the technology) or logistics standpoint.</description>

    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Standardized Universal Pain Evaluations for Rheumatology providers for children and youth (SUPERKIDZ). It consists of 4 domains: pain intensity and location (5 items), fatigue (1 item), pain interference/evaluative dimension (10 items), and affective/emotional dimension (4 items) for children â‰¥ 8 years (and parent proxy report for children 4-8 years). This measure takes 3 - 5 minutes to complete.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain-related Activity Limitations</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Child Activity Limitations Interview (CALI-21). This is a 21-item self-report scale divided into (i) active (e.g. gym, sports) and (ii) routine (e.g., schoolwork, reading) activity subscales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Arthritis Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). The PedsQL Arthritis Module is a 22-item self-report scale with five subscales: pain and hurt, daily activities, treatment, worry, and communication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Children's Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (CASE). The CASE is a disease specific 11-item self-report measure that is divided into three sub-scales: activity, symptom, and emotion. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate responses to each item with 1 = &quot;not at all sure&quot; to 5 = &quot;very sure&quot; based on how confident the child is that they can manage disease effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>JIA-specific Disease Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the 24-item Medical Issues, Exercise, Pain and Social Support Questionnaire (MEPS). MEPS is made up of 4 sub scales (medical issues, exercise, pain, and social support). Items are rated on a 10-cm VAS with higher scores indicating greater disease knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to medical treatment will be assessed using the 34-item Child Adherence Report Questionnaire (CARQ) that assesses adherence to prescribed medications, exercises, and wearing of splints over the past 3 months. The CARQ was developed specifically for children with JIA and consists of three sections: (1) responsibility for treatment, (2) child's ability to adhere to the three types of treatment, and (3) perceptions about helpfulness of therapies. Items in the last two sections are rated on 11-point numeric pain rating scale with higher scores indicating better adherence and perceived helpfulness of therapies.</description>

    <description>In addition to standard medical care, children in the experimental group will receive the Match-3 game. The game will be designed for short individual gameplay sessions (as little as a few seconds), once to three times a day, over the course of 8 weeks, involving no more than 15 minutes per day in anticipated screen time. There is no way to &quot;lose&quot; the game. Through a structured series of daily interactions, the player will learn strategies and develop decision-making abilities that will assist with management of their own JIA. The Match 3 concept (similar to the game, Bejeweled) will require the player to successfully match the treatment strategy to the JIA symptom.</description>
