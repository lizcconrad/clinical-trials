    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional post-marketing observational study (PMOS) of participants
      with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with Duodopa/Duopa in a routine clinical
      setting. Effectiveness of treatment will be collected with physician and
      participant/caregiver health outcomes beginning with PMOS enrollment (baseline visit), at the
      start of Duodopa/Duopa treatment via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-with jejunal
      extension (PEG-J), at regularly scheduled visits closest to Months 3 and 6, and every 6
      months thereafter up to 36 months.
