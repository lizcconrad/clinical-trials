  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to enroll patients with acquired hemophilia A (AHA) who are
      prescribed and treated with Obizur, to assess safety, and to describe factors related to
      safety, utilization and effectiveness in a real-world setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, uncontrolled, open-label, non-interventional post-marketing
      safety surveillance study to describe the use of Obizur in patients with acquired hemophilia
      A (AHA), and secondarily, where data are available, to describe the hemostatic effectiveness
      and immunogenicity of Obizur.

      Patients should be enrolled at the earliest possible time point after initiating Obizur.

      In an attempt to collect safety and utilization data on patients treated with Obizur since
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in October 2014, Baxalta will make an effort to
      identify all persons treated with Obizur and to collect data for as many patients as
      possible.
