  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, effects of different information of fat
      content of high or low fat will be examined in FD patients and healthy volunteers (n=30,
      respectively). These data will provide a better understanding of symptom generation following
      food ingestion in general as well as in patients with respective functional gastrointestinal
      disorders.

    <description>Resting BOLD (Blood oxygenation level-dependent) signal before and after yogurt ingestion will compared between groups.
There is a small risk of discomfort from claustrophobia, periods of immobility, and exposure to the noise of the magnet. The investigators will offer the participants ear plugs. In rare cases the participants experience dizziness, nausea, or tinnitus which normally disappear after the measurement. During the measurements there is the possibility of warming which could lead to skin irritation in people with tattoos. Therefore, the participants with tattoos will not be included. The participants are instructed to tell the investigators immediately if any uncomforted appears. The study will be performed by experienced experimenters who know all about the risks. During the measurements, the participants are monitored. As a commercial yogurt (200 ml) will be used, the investigators do not expect any side effects. Food allergy will be checked before.</description>
