      This project aimed at analyzing and assessing of the early and late Hospital-Acquired
      Pneumonia(HAP) bacterial pathogens and their resistance to antimicrobial agents. The
      incidence of their resistance to antimicrobial agent is assessed. Included are patients
      hospitalized in the Intensive Care Departments of cooperated University hospitals, who
      developed early or late HAP. Bacterial pathogens and their resistance to antibiotics are
      identified using standard microbiological methods. The patient's mortality with respect to
      their initial antibiotic therapy is statistically analyzed.

      Introduction. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most frequent and most severe medical
      complications in patients hospitalized in intensive care units. It develops mainly in
      association with invasive airway management and mechanical ventilation. It is an important
      factor affecting health care economy and often related to bacterial resistance. Understanding
      the etiology of pathogens and their potential resistance to antimicrobial agents has a major
      impact on both patients' morbidity and mortality and the economic aspect of their treatment.
      Pneumonia is diagnosed by assessing clinical signs and detecting etiologic agents. Clinical
      signs are assessed especially by finding fresh or progressive infiltrates on chest
      radiographs, together with at least two other signs of respiratory tract infection. From the
      epidemiological point of view, pneumonia may be either community-acquired (CAP) or
      hospital-acquired (HAP). CAP is defined by developing in the community outside health care
      facilities and, if the patient is hospitalized, clinical manifestations within 48 h of
      hospital admission. HAP may be characterized as pneumonia developing 48 h or more after
      admission to a health care facility or within 14 days after discharge. More precise
      classification according to the time of the onset of clinical signs distinguishes early-onset
      (from 2 to 4 days after admission) from late-onset (from day 5 after admission) HAP. The most
      common pathogens causing CAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae. HAP is mostly caused by endogenous bacterial strains, originating from
      primary microflora or secondary colonizing bacteria with a higher level of resistance in the
      early- and late-onset forms, respectively. This knowledge is used to select the proper
      therapy since the proportion of individual pathogens determines the strategy of initial
      antibiotic treatment. Adequate antibiotic therapy is an important factor influencing the
      effectiveness of therapy and, of course, the patient's survival. The prospective study aimed
      at identifying etiologic agents of pulmonary inflammation in patients with the most severe
      forms of respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. The objectives were to
      describe the prevalence of respiratory tract pathogens, to determine their susceptibility to
      a range of tested antibiotic agents, and to acquire information on the proportion of
      resistant strains in the population of these pathogens. The impact of adequate antibiotic
      therapy was assessed, with respect to patient mortality and morbidity rates.

      Hypothesis. Most sever types of nosocomial bacterial pneumonias, required artificial lung
      ventilation are often exogenous. The infection source is transferred to patient´s airways
      from outsider during hospitalisation. The object of the research is bacterial agent direct
      recognition, its originality identification based on genome restrict fragment analysis.

      Material and Methods. The group comprised patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care
      Departments of cooperating hospitals between 1 May 2013 and 30 April 2015 who developed signs
      of HAP. Also included are patients with positive findings in their tracheal secretion on
      admission to the department if transferred from another ward of the hospital. In intubated
      patients, secretion samples for microbiology culture tests are obtained by aspiration from
      the lower airway. Mortality is statistically analyzed by Fisher's exact test. The clinical
      signs of pneumonia are defined as the presence of newly developed or progressive infiltrates
      on chest radiographs plus at least two other signs of respiratory tract infection:
      temperature &gt;38 °C, purulent sputum, leukocytosis &gt;10x103/mm3 or leukopenia &lt;4x103/mm3, signs
      of inflammation on auscultation, cough and/or respiratory insufficiency with oxygenation
      index≤300 mm Hg. Each sample is processed by semiquantitative method based on the
      four-quadrant streak technique using a calibrated loop. The etiologic agent is considered
      relevant if cultured in the tracheal secretion at a enough quantity. Tracheal secretion
      samples are processed by traditional microbiological methods. The microorganisms are
      identified by biochemical dentification tests, and automated systems. The yeasts are
      identified using commercial kit. If an identical culture, determined as the etiologic agent,
      is repeatedly isolated from multiple samples obtained from the same patient, only the first
      isolated culture is included in the study. Susceptibility to antibiotics is determined by the
      standard microdilution method. Adequate initial therapy is defined as administrative of at
      least one antibiotic (suitable for treating pneumonia) shown in vitro to be effective against
      the isolated causative agent.

      Progress chart. The collection and processing of the patient´s microbiological samples at
      cooperatived clinic departments between 1 May 2013 and 30 April 2015 will be performed. The
      co-operative centers sent the samples to microbiological departments of their own hospitals
      and there the samples will processed and safed. Collected data will continuously to the
      central database be stored. The microbiological samples collection will finish 30 April 2015
      and between 1 May 2015 and 31 december 2015 the data will be analysed and assessed. The
      processing of the data allows express conclusions and prepare proposals to event. hygienical
      arrangement changes.

      Way of data acquiring. In intubated patients, secretion samples for microbiology culture
      tests were obtained by aspiration from the lower airway. The group comprise patients
      hospitalized in the Intensive Care Department of Hospitals, cooperated in study, between 1
      May 2013 and 30April 2015 who developed signs of HAP. Also included are patients with
      positive findings in their tracheal secretion on admission to the department if transferred
      from another ward of the hospital. Predicted number of patients is 300 (400 - 500 positive
      isolates). Considerate number is estimated according the pilot study. Predicted number of
      patients in all cooperated centers is about 15 per month. There the data analysis will be
      made with statistic normality test Shapiro-Wilk and Mann-Whitney U test. Computer program
      SPSS version 15 to statistic assessment will be used.

      Cooperation. The project is multicentric. There are cooperating Departments of Anesthesiology
      and Intensive Care Medicine in Olomouc, Brno, Hradec Kralove and Thomayer's Hospital Praha.
      The assessing of microbiological samples, collected from patients in this hospitals will be
      in microbiologic departments of this hospitals made.

      Discussion. Given the incidence of 51 cases out of a total of 508 patients hospitalized in
      the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine Olomouc, Czech Republic, in
      2011, the prevalence (10%) was at the lower limit of the commonly reported range (9-24%). In
      agreement with the literature, most cases (86%) were late-onset HAP. Bacterial pathogens
      associated with the majority of deaths were strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Burgholderia cepacia komplex and Escherichia coli, more than 50% of which were
      multiresistant. In late-onset HAP, multiresistant strains accounted for as many as 58% of
      strains. In early onset HAP, the proportion of multiresistant strains could not been reliably
      assessed due to the small number of cases. The mortality rates in patients receiving adequate
      initial antibiotic therapy were 13% lower than in those treated with antibiotics to which
      isolated bacterial pathogens were later found to be resistant. According to Fiser's two-sided
      exact test, the resulting difference in mortality rates between the two studied groups is not
      significant (P=0.385), because of small set of data. Given the fact that despite adequate
      initial antibiotic therapy, the mortality rates were relatively high (9 out of 30 dead
      patients) and mortality is also likely to be influenced by the time of initiation of
      antibiotic therapy. In case of the mortality rates in patients with adequate therapy, our
      results (30%) are in agreement with those by Luna et al. who reported 38%. The same authors
      also found 91% mortality associated with inadequate therapy, a much higher rate than our
      results (43%). The difference, however, might be explained by a different epidemiological
      situation at bacterial resistance levels. HAP may be characterized as endogenous. Despite the
      high proportion of multiresistant strains, clonal spread was not confirmed, with the
      exception of Burgholderia cepacia komplex. Thus, secondary colonization of patient's
      microflora during hospitalization is likely.
