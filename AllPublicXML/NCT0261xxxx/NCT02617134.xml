          -  Eligible diseases: MUC1+ malignant glioma of brain, colorectal carcinoma and gastric
             carcinoma.

             treatment of glioblastoma multiforme; documentation by magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) of an interval increase in nodular gadolinium enhancement consistent with
             recurrent malignant glioma suitable for therapeutic re-resection; previous
             pathological diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV glioma;

             1b. Colorectal Carcinoma Patients must have histologically proven adenocarcinoma
             primary to the colon or rectum and clinical or pathologic evidence of distant
             metastasis;

             1c. Gastric Carcinoma Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach,
