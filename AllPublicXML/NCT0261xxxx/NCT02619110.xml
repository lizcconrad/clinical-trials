      The purpose of this research was to discuss the effect of backward walking treadmill training
      on balance ability, speed of walking and cardiopulmonary fitness in patients with chronic
      stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Walking training is a good method and strategy to improve postural stability, balance, gait
      symmetry, and increase walking ability. Generally, there are many walking training theories
      and methods for patients with chronic stroke and treadmill walking training is applied in
      recent years. Previous studies showed that patients with stroke improve the walking abilities
      and speed after the walking treadmill training. However, most studies have demonstrated that
      forward walking treadmill training improved balance and walking ability in patients with
      stroke, but fewer studies have investigated the effects on backward walking treadmill
      training. However, no studies to date have investigated the effects of backward walking
      treadmill training for patients with chronic stroke.
