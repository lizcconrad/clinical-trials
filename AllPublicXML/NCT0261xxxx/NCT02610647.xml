  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare between groups the level of complexity of the
      estimated sensorimotor performance through multi-fractal (minmaxMF-DFA) exponents.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the level of complexity of the
      estimated sensorimotor performance using the(A) mono-fractal exhibitors (the αDFA values) and
      the (B) coefficient of variation (CV) between groups.

    <description>Subjects will be placed at a table in a sitting position where they will perform a rhythmic finger tapping test. The seat height is adjusted so that the front dominant arm rests comfortably on the table. Subjects will be equipped with headphones to receive auditory signals during a first synchronized phase of tapping.
After the last auditory signal, participants will continue the tapping task by themselves as directed: &quot;after the metronome stops,continue tapping the prescribed tempo as accurately and consistently as possible throughout the test.&quot; The movements of the index finger will be measured by a single-axis accelerometer (15 × 15 mm) attached to the nail.</description>
