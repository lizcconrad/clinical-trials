  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia is a very common disorder of great challenge to clinical management. A
      therapeutic targets is up-regulation of visceral pain threshold. The transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel therapy that pursues these properties, besides its
      safety and easy adherence. There is a great need of new treatments for functional dyspepsia.
      There is no current study evaluating tDCS for this disease.

    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia is a high prevalent disease with substantial costs to health system.
      There are many available treatments, but disappointing results are reported in clinical
      trials.

      TDCS is a noninvasive, secure and painless technique of brain stimulation. It is delivered by
      a battery-operated device that transfers low intensity electrical current to all surface of
      the brain. Then there is a modulation of cortical excitability and influence on central
      neurological functions. It has been reported its efficacy for the treatment of many diseases
      such as depression and chronic pain.

      Impairment of central mechanisms of interpretation and threshold of pain are related to
      functional dyspepsia. Therefore, tDCS may benefit dyspeptic patients.

      This study is a double blind randomized controled trial to test tDCS effectiveness on
      functional dyspepsia. Seventy functional dyspeptic patients will be enrolled, being
      randomized to either tDCS or sham tDCS.

    <description>TDCS will be delivered with two saline-soaked sponge electrodes. The main electrode to anodal stimulation will be placed over the motor cortex, M1. The second electrode is neutral and will be placed on the skin overlying the supraorbital region The current will be delivered at the intensity of 2mA for 20 minutes. The procedure will be repeated at five consecutive days.</description>

    <description>Two electrodes are positioned at M1 and supra-orbital Ã¡rea. To deliver sham, the current will be delivered for 30 sec only to elicit tingling skin sensation but no cortical excitability changes. The procedure will be repeated at five consecutive days.</description>
