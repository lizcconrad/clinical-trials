      Investigation of objective tinnitus diagnosis method through measurement of continuous
      resting EEG, auditory ERP before and after Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (rTMS) treatment of tinnitus.

    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is defined as the subjective perception of a sound in the absence of any physical
      sound. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of tinnitus is so difficult.

      So, Investigators measure auditory ERP through autonomously developed system to make a
      objective diagnosis tinnitus. Moreover, patients undergo continuous resting EEG measurement.

      In this study investigators examined the efficacy of rTMS treatment for tinnitus and check
      into changes in brain connectivity or auditory task with ERP, continuous resting EEG before
      and after rTMS. And develop a new test that can detect tinnitus objectively in humans, using
      the prepulse gap paradigm
