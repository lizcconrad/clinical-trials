      The purpose of the main study is to determine whether the daily consumption of protein-rich
      meals containing high quality, lean beef products improves appetite control and cognitive
      function during a weight maintenance diet.

      The purpose of the sub-study is to determine whether the daily consumption of protein-rich
      meals containing the same amount of high quality, lean beef products improves appetite
      control and cognitive function during a modest energy restriction, weight loss diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two cross-over design studies were completed in overweight, sedentary but otherwise healthy
      women. For study 1, 17 participants randomly consumed 4 eucaloric diets containing
      standard-protein (SP; 76±1g protein/d) or high-protein (HP; 126±1g protein/d) for 7
      consecutive days/treatment. The SP treatments contained all plant proteins (PLANT) or a
      combination of beef and plant proteins (BEEF) that were evenly distributed throughout the day
      (EVEN). The HP treatments were also BEEF provided as EVEN or an uneven distribution (UNEVEN)
      pattern. For study 2, 17 participants randomly consumed 3 energy restriction (1250 kcal/d)
      diets containing SP-PLANT (EVEN) and SP-BEEF (EVEN) (both, 48±1g protein/d) or HP-BEEF (EVEN)
      (123±1g protein/d). During day 6 of each treatment (for both studies), the participants
      completed a 12-h controlled-feeding, clinical testing day which included repeated appetite,
      satiety, food cravings, and mood questionnaires; blood sampling; and cognitive
      function/performance testing. During day 7 of each treatment (for both studies), the
      participants completed a free-living, ad libitum testing day at home/work to assess ad
      libitum (voluntary) daily intake and food choice. Each of the 7-day dietary patterns occurred
      during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, there were 2-3 week washout periods
      between dietary treatments.

    <measure>Perceived Appetite and Satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires, assessing appetite sensations (i.e., hunger, fullness, prospective food consumption, motivation to eat), hedonic ratings (pleasure), and palatability will be completed throughout each of the 12-hour testing days (which are separated by 3-4 weeks). The questionnaires contain validated visual analog scales (VAS) incorporating a 100 mm horizontal line rating scale for each response. The questions are worded in the following manner &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; with anchors of &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Appetite and Satiety Hormones (i.e., Ghrelin, PYY)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>23 total blood samples will be drawn throughout each of the 12-hour testing days (which are separated by 3-4 weeks). Specifically, there will be 4 ml/sample; 92 ml (3.1 oz.)/testing day. The samples will be collected in test tubes containing EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). Protease inhibitors will be added to the sample to reduce protein degradation. Samples will be centrifuged at -4°C for 15 minutes. The plasma will then be separated and stored in microcentrifuge tubes at -80°C for future analysis. Plasma total ghrelin and total PYY will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed during each of the 12-hour testing days (which are separated by 3-4 weeks) using CNS Vital Signs, a validated computerized assessment. This system contains a core battery of tasks assessing attention, executive function, working, verbal, and visual memory, decision making, and response time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mood state will be assessed during each of the 12-hour testing days (which are separated by 3-4 weeks) using 1) Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS2), consisting of a core battery of tests with 7 sub-categories (Tension, Depression, Anger, Vigor, Fatigue, Confusion, Friendliness); and 2) Affect Grid, to assess various emotional states (pleasure, stress, depression, excitement, relaxation, arousal, and sleepiness).</description>
