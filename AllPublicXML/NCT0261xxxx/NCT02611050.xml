  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center randomized trial to evaluate the Multi-vessel Coronary Artery
      Disease Option Grid patient decision aid compared to usual care in patient reported
      decisional conflict, knowledge, and shared decision making.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multi-vessel coronary artery disease can be treated through percutaneous coronary
      intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, or medical therapy. Treatments have risk
      benefit tradeoffs, making patient preference integral to the treatment decision. The
      Multi-vessel Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid patient decision aid was developed to
      improve the decision making process for patients and clinicians.

      Objectives:

        1. Evaluate The Multi-vessel Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid impact on patient
           treatment decisional conflict, knowledge, and shared decision making.

           The randomized controlled trial will compare validated and standardized measures of
           patient decisional conflict, shared decision making, and condition specific treatment
           knowledge between Option Grid and usual care patients. The investigators hypothesize
           Option Grid patients will have improvements in patient decisional conflict, shared
           decision making, and knowledge compared to usual care patients. Baseline feasibility
           enrollment at each site prior to randomization will be used to identify current
           treatment patterns, and prepare intervention delivery and fidelity. Registry data will
           be used to identify patient treatment received and compared between Option Grid and
           usual care arms.

        2. Examine the physician and patient process of and factors influencing Multi-vessel
           Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid use.

      Semi-structured interviews and process evaluations will be used to describe Option Grid use
      and experience and identify factors that are associated with beneficial Option Grid use.
