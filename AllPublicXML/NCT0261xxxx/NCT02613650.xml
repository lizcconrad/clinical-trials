               -  Patients with treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical
                  intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the disease-free duration, are eligible

             unable to swallow medication.(patients may not receive drug through a feeding tube),
             social/ psychological issues, etc.

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug and for 15 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

          -  Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that may compromise the patient's
             ability to understand the patient information, give informed consent, comply with the
