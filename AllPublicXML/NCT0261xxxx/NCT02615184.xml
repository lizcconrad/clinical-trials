    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of treatment with once
      daily (QD) oral administration of dexlansoprazole 30 or 60 mg for 8 to 12 weeks in pediatric
      subjects aged 1 to 11 years inclusive, with erosive esophagitis (EE) and to assess the safety
      and effectiveness of dexlansoprazole 15 or 30 mg compared to placebo in maintenance of healed
      EE for 16 weeks.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being
      tested to heal erosive esophagitis (EE) and maintain healing of EE in pediatric participants
      aged 1 to 11 years. This study will look at the healing of EE followed by maintained healing
      of EE in children who take dexlansoprazole.

      The study will be conducted in two periods; a Healing of EE Period and a Maintenance of
      Healed EE Period. Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled in this study. Participants will
      be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive dexlansoprazole 60 mg or
      dexlansoprazole 30 mg for 8 to 12 weeks during the Healing of EE Period. Participants who
      have healed EE confirmed by endoscopy at week 8 or 12 will enter the Maintenance of Healed EE
      Period and will be randomly assigned to receive half their healing dose of dexlansoprazole,(
      i.e., either 30 mg, dexlansoprazole 15 mg), or placebo (this is a capsule that looks like the
      study drug but has no active ingredient).

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record any time they have heartburn symptoms in a
      diary.

      Subjects who complete the 16 weeks of the Maintenance of Healed EE Period (Week 24 or Week 28
      as applicable) and have maintained healing of EE as confirmed by endoscopy, will enter a
      Post-Treatment Follow up Period for up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug. During
      this period subjects will continue to complete the symptom questionnaires daily in the
      eDiaries and return for a clinic visit each month. Subjects who require an invasive procedure
      or treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or histamine 2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) for
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)/EE will be discontinued from the Post-Treatment
      Follow-up Period and a Final Study Visit will be performed.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 40 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic including a
      final visit 3 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

             requirements.

          2. Prior to any study-specific procedures being performed, the informed consent and the
             assent form must be signed and dated by parent(s) or legal guardian and by the
             participant respectively, if appropriate.

          3. Has a medical history of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) for at
             least 3 months prior to Screening.

          4. Has medical history of at least 1 failed attempted withdrawal of prior proton pump
             inhibitor (PPI)/acid suppressive therapy with a return of symptoms upon withdrawal.

          5. Has met the electronic diary (eDiary) qualification criteria as assessed by the
             Pediatric GERD Symptom Daily Diaries (PGSDD), defined as hurting or burning in the
             stomach, chest, or throat on at least 3 of any 7 consecutive days during the Screening
             Period. (Note: If an endoscopy performed within 1 week of signing informed consent and
             assent is used to confirm diagnosis of erosive esophagitis (EE), the participant does
             not need to meet this criterion).

             endoscopy performed either during the Screening Period or within 1 week prior to
             signing informed consent and assent (as applicable). An endoscopy that was performed
             within 1 week prior to signing informed consent and assent, as applicable, is an
             acceptable replacement for the Screening endoscopy if EE is documented by HD
             classification scale criterion previously described, protocol-required biopsies were
             collected and endoscopic pictures were obtained.

          7. Is male or female and age 1 to 11 years inclusive at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Has a coexisting disease affecting the esophagus (eg, esophageal varices, scleroderma,
             viral or fungal infection, or esophageal stricture), history of radiation therapy or
             cryotherapy to the esophagus, caustic or physiochemical trauma such as sclerotherapy
             to the esophagus.

          3. Has any findings in his/her medical history, physical examination, or safety clinical

          4. Has a history of hypersensitivity or allergies to dexlansoprazole or any component of
             dexlansoprazole or any PPI (including lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole,
             pantoprazole, or esomeprazole) or antacids.

          5. Is required to take excluded medications or it is anticipated that the participant

             study; or the participant has: creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal (×ULN), or
             total bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL with AST/ALT elevated above the limits of normal values.

         21. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependent relationship
             with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study or may consent

             the supervision of, or in a subordinate role to, the investigator are also ineligible.

         22. The participant, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the
