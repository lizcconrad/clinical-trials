  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of the new formulation of
      fentanyl transdermal system (JNJ-35685-AAA-G021) compared with DURAGESIC fentanyl in healthy
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single application and 2-way
      Crossover (the same medications provided to all participants but in different sequence)
      pivotal study to determine the bioequivalence of marketed reference formulation DURAGESIC and
      the test formulation Fentanyl transdermal system (JNJ-35685-AAA-G021). Approximately 56
      healthy participants will participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (within 21
      days before the first study drug administration of the first period), an open-label treatment
      Phase consisting of 2 single-application treatment periods (26 days) and End-of-Study (at the
      end of Period 2). The total study duration for each participant will be from 43 days to a
      maximum of 59 days. Participants will receive a single application 100 microgram per hour
      (mcg/h) dose of DURAGESIC fentanyl transdermal system as Treatment A (Reference) and 100
      mcg/h Fentanyl transdermal system (JNJ-35685-AAA-G021) as Treatment B (Test). Bioequivalence
      will be primarily evaluated by pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
