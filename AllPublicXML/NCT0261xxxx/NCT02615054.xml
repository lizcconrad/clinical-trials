  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is for participants with a history of HER2-positive breast cancer and were treated with
      chemotherapy that increases the risk of abnormal heart function. Strain (a marker of heart
      function) is a new method of monitoring heart function in cancer patients and is measured
      with an ultrasound. Exercise testing is another method that can be used to monitor for
      abnormal heart function in cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to see if strain and
      exercise testing can be used to detect for late signs of heart damage from chemotherapy.

        Potentially eligible subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and who were treated at MSK
        between 2005 and 2010 will be identified through query of MSK institutional databases.
        Healthy control subjects will be largely recruited from (though not restricted to) MSK
        employees.

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients:

          -  Aged ≥ 18 years

          -  Female

          -  MSK histologically confirmed primary invasive breast carcinoma

          -  Pathologically confirmed HER2-positive breast cancer

          -  Treated with adjuvant trastuzumab (either alone or in combination with other anti-HER2
             agents)

          -  ≥ 2 years since completion of targeted chemotherapy without evidence of disease

          -  Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

        Patients in the cardiotoxicity (TOX) group must meet the following criteria:

          -  Development of treatment associated cardiotoxicity during trastuzumab therapy, defined
             as an absolute decrease from baseline in LVEF by ≥ 10%, to an LVEF of below 55%.

          -  No clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure (NYHA class III or IV) at the time of
             cardiotoxicity.

        Note: NYHA Class III symptoms include marked limitation of physical activity. Less than
        ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. NYHA Class IV
        symptoms include inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms
        of heart failure or anginal syndrome may be present at rest, and if any physical activity
        is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

        Patients in the no cardiotoxicity (NO-TOX) group must meet the following criteria:

          -  Maximum absolute decrease in LVEF ≤ 5% from baseline during trastuzumab therapy.

          -  Echocardiogram with LVEF assessment performed at baseline (prior to initiation of
             trastuzumab therapy) and at least two timepoints during trastuzumab therapy.

          -  LVEF ≥ 55% on each echocardiogram assessment during trastuzumab therapy.

          -  No clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure (NYHA class III or IV) during
             trastuzumab treatment.

        Note: NYHA Class III symptoms include marked limitation of physical activity. Less than
        ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. NYHA Class IV
        symptoms include inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms
        of heart failure or anginal syndrome may be present at rest, and if any physical activity
        is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

        Participants in the healthy control group must meet the following criteria:

          -  Aged ≥ 40 years

          -  Female

          -  No history of cancer with the exception of localized basal and/or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin

          -  No prior history of known cardiac disease (e.g. ischemic heart disease, heart failure,
             cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease [moderate to severe], or significant
             arrhythmias).

          -  Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Presence of metastatic disease

          -  Treatment with additional cardiotoxic therapy for a secondary malignant neoplasm, or
             treatment with additional cardiotoxic therapy for breast cancer recurrence since
             primary breast cancer diagnosis [Note: Patients who are diagnosed with a second
             primary malignancy are not excluded from participation in the study, unless they meet
             this exclusion criterion.]

          -  Subjects must not have any of the following absolute contraindications to
             cardiopulmonary exercise testing : (a) acute myocardial infarction (within 3-5 days of
             any planned study procedures), (b) unstable angina, (c) uncontrolled arrhythmias
             causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise, (d) symptomatic severe aortic stenosis,
             (e) recurrent syncope, (f) active endocarditis, (g) acute myocarditis or pericarditis,
             (h) uncontrolled heart failure, (i) acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction,
             (within 3 months of any planned study procedures), (j) thrombosis of lower
             extremities, (k) suspected dissecting aneurysm, (l) uncontrolled asthma, (m) pulmonary
             edema (within 3 months of planned study procedures), (n) room air desaturation at rest
             ≤85%, (o) respiratory failure, (p) acute noncardiopulmonary disorder that may affect
             exercise performance or be aggravated by exercise (i.e., infection, renal failure,
             thyrotoxicosis), or (q) mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate.
