  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      99mTc-MIP-1404 is a radioactive diagnostic imaging agent indicated for imaging men with newly
      diagnosed prostate cancer whose biopsy indicates a histopathologic Gleason Score of ≤ 3+4
      severity who are candidates for active surveillance and are undergoing voluntary radical
      prostatectomy (RP) [Cohort A] or routine prostate biopsy [Cohort B]. This Phase 3 study is
      designed to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT imaging to
      correctly identify subjects with previously unknown clinically significant prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, multi-reader, open-label trial, comparing 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT
      imaging in men who have had a diagnostic trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy with a
      histopathologic finding of Gleason score ≤3+4 who are candidates for active surveillance and
      are undergoing routine biopsy or voluntary RP with or without a pelvic lymph node dissection
      (PLND). This study will evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT
      image assessments to correctly identify subjects with previously unknown clinically
      significant prostate cancer in two cohorts: (1) Low grade prostate cancer who have elected to
      undergo RP [Cohort A]; and (2) very low risk (VLR) prostate cancer per 2016 NCCN Guidelines
      who are scheduled to undergo routine prostate biopsy [Cohort B].

      Subjects will receive a single dose of 99mTc-MIP-1404 Injection (study drug) followed by
      whole body planar and SPECT/CT (pelvic) imaging 3-6 hours after injection. In accordance with
      standard of care procedures, subjects will undergo either voluntary RP [Cohort A] or prostate
      biopsy [Cohort B] within 42 days after study drug dosing. 99mTc-MIP-1404 image data will be
      collected by a central imaging core laboratory and evaluated for visible uptake within the
      prostate gland. These findings will then be compared against central histopathology as the
      truth standard. The central imaging core lab independent readers for the SPECT/CT scans will
      be blinded to all clinical data, including pathology results. Likewise, central pathologists
      are to remain blinded to all clinical data, including imaging results.
