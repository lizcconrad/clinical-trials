      This study will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 given orally
      in combination with intravenous MEDI4736. Secondly, the immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and
      preliminary anti-tumour activity will be determined in patients with refractory solid tumours

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of oral therapy with AZD1775 when combined with a fixed-dose of MEDI4736.
      Immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumour activity in patients with
      refractory solid tumours will also be investigated.

      In the initial design of this study a novel combination of AZD1775 and MEDI4736 was tested.
      The starting dose of AZD1775 was 125 mg BID, over 5 days with 9 days off in 14-day cycles.
      This was designated Schedule A. This dose was not well tolerated. Two of six patients
      experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The protocol was amended to include three
      additional dosing schedules, designated Schedules B, C, and D.

      In Schedule B patients will receive MEDI4736 on Day 1, AZD1775 on Days 15-17 and Days 22-24
      of a 28-day cycle.

      In Schedule C, patients will receive MEDI4736 on Day 1, AZD1775 on Days 8-10, Days 15-17 and
      Days 22-24 of 28-day cycles.

      In Schedule D, patients will receive MEDI4736 on Day 1 and AZD1775 QD on Days 15-19 and Days
      22-26 of a 28-Day cycle.

      AZD1775 will be dosed on a maximum of 6 days (Schedule B), 9 days (Schedule C), or 10 days
      (Schedule D) in each 28-day cycle. In all schedules, dexamethasone will be administered as an
      anti-emetic on the first day of each of the AZD1775 consecutive dosing day blocks including
      the lead-in portion for Schedules B, C, and D. AZD1775 will be administered at least 1 week
      after MEDI4736 administration.

      Three to six patients will be enrolled in dose level 1 of Schedule B and evaluated for safety
      over a 28 day cycle prior to opening Schedule C dose level 1 for enrolment. Following safety
      evaluation of three to six patients in Schedule C dose level 1, a decision will be made by
      the Safety Review Team (SRT) to move forward with one or both schedules for further dose
      escalation.

      Three to six patients will be enrolled in Schedule D dose level 1 and evaluated for safety
      over a 28-day cycle. Patients in Schedule D will be evaluated for escalation independently of
      those in Schedules A, B, and C.

      Dose escalation will continue until identification of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). Once
      the MTD is determined this cohort will be expanded to a total of 18 patients to collect
      further safety data and for preliminary assessment of efficacy. Alternative dose
      levels/cohorts and/or schedules may be explored if emerging data suggest these would be more
      appropriate.

      The first day of Cycle 1 in Schedules B, C, and D will be preceded by a lead-in period of
      AZD1775 monotherapy to enable serial sampling for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters.
