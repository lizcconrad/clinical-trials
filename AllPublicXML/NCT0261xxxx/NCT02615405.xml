    <textblock>
      With the dissatisfaction of monoamine-based pharmacotherapy and the high comorbidity of
      physical illness in depression, the serotonin hypothesis seems to fail in approaching the
      etiology of depression. Based upon the evidence from epidemiological data, case-control
      studies of PUFAs compositions, and antidepressant effects in clinical trials, phospholipid
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is enlightening a promising path to discover the unsolved
      of depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several important questions to answer regarding phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (PUFAs) hypothesis of depression. Firstly, although case-control studies revealed that
      depressive patients had lower levels of omega-3 PUFAs, the abnormal findings in individual
      PUFA of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or arachidonic acid (AA) are
      not consistent. Secondly, the deficits in n-3 PUFAs are related to their metabolic enzymes.
      However, the association study of polymorphisms of PUFA-metabolism related genes in
      depression is limited. Thirdly, the active component of antidepressant effect in n-3 PUFAs is
      still in debate. Fourthly, the molecular mechanisms of n-3 PUFAs' antidepressant effects have
      yet to be elucidated in human brain functional neuroimaging or in cellular models.

      This 3-year proposal is divided into 2 clinical studies. In study 1, the investigators aim to
      test the clinical and biological effects of n-3 PUFAs (EPA: 3.5 g/d and DHA: 1.75 g/d versus
      placebo: high oleic oil) for depressive symptoms in a 12-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of patients with drug-free MDD. In study 2, the investigators will
      measure the biological and neuroimaging markers to investigate the biological mechanisms of
      EPA (3.5 g/d) versus DHA (1.75 g/d) in 12-week, double-blind, randomized-controlled trial
      with patients with drug-free major depression disorder (MDD).
