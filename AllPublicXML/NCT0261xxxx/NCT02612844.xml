      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the Safety,
      Tolerability,Pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and
      Pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of subcutaneous
      NNC0143-0406 A 0.6 mmol/L in Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes
