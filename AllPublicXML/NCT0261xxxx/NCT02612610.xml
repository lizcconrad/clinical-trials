  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of three dose regimens of gefapixant
      ([MK-7264] 7.5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg) relative to placebo in reducing awake objective cough
      frequency. The primary hypothesis for this trial is that at least one dose regimen of
      gefapixant is superior to placebo with respect to the mean change from baseline in awake
      cough frequency (on the log scale).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency After 12 Weeks of Treatment (Day 84)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit (Day -1), Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Awake Objective Cough Frequency (per hour) was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period (in general, 24-hr interval) while the participant was awake divided by the total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period that the participant was awake. 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at Week 12 (Day 84) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. Least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline (in log scale) with associated standard error (SE) reported for each treatment group. Change from Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency = (Post-Treatment Awake Cough Frequency minus Baseline Awake Cough Frequency).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency After 12 Weeks of Treatment (Day 84)</title>
        <description>Awake Objective Cough Frequency (per hour) was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period (in general, 24-hr interval) while the participant was awake divided by the total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period that the participant was awake. 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at Week 12 (Day 84) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. Least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline (in log scale) with associated standard error (SE) reported for each treatment group. Change from Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency = (Post-Treatment Awake Cough Frequency minus Baseline Awake Cough Frequency).</description>

        <description>24-hr Objective Cough Frequency was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period divided by the total duration in hours for the monitoring period (generally 24 hours). 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at Week 4 (Day 28) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. LS mean change from baseline (in log scale) with associated SE reported for each treatment group.

          <description>24-hr Objective Cough Frequency was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period divided by the total duration in hours for the monitoring period (generally 24 hours). 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at Week 12 (Day 84) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. LS mean change from baseline (in log scale) with associated SE reported for each treatment group. Change from Baseline in 24-Hour Objective Cough Frequency = (Post-Treatment 24-Hour Cough Frequency minus Baseline 24-Hour Cough Frequency).</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who had taken at least 1 dose of study medication and provided at least 1 baseline and at least one post baseline endpoint observation during the treatment period.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency at the Follow-up Visit (Day 98)</title>
        <description>Awake Objective Cough Frequency (per hour) was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period (in general, 24-hr interval) while the participant was awake divided by the total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period that the participant was awake. 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at the Follow-up visit (Day 98) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. Change from Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency = (Post-Treatment Awake Cough Frequency minus Baseline Awake Cough Frequency).</description>

        <description>Awake Objective Cough Frequency (per hour) was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period (in general, 24-hr interval) while the participant was awake divided by the total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period that the participant was awake. 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at Week 8 (Day 56) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. The percentage of participants that met responder criteria for ≥70%, ≥50%, and ≥30% change (reduction) from baseline levels in Awake Objective Cough Frequency were reported for each treatment group at Day 56.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With ≥70%, ≥50%, and ≥30% Change From Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency at the Follow-up Visit (Day 98)</title>
          <description>Awake Objective Cough Frequency (per hour) was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period (in general, 24-hr interval) while the participant was awake divided by the total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period that the participant was awake. 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at the Follow-up visit (Day 98) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. The percentage of participants that met responder criteria for ≥70%, ≥50%, and ≥30% change (reduction) from baseline levels in Awake Objective Cough Frequency were reported for each treatment group at Day 98.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who had taken at least 1 dose of study medication and provided at least 1 baseline and at least one Day 98 endpoint observation during the treatment period.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With ≥70%, ≥50%, and ≥30% Change From Baseline in 24-Hour Objective Cough Frequency After 12 Weeks of Treatment (Day 84)</title>
          <description>24-hr Objective Cough Frequency was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period divided by the total duration in hours for the monitoring period (generally 24 hours). 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at Week 12 (Day 84) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. The percentage of participants that met responder criteria for ≥70%, ≥50%, and ≥30% change (reduction) from baseline levels in 24-hr Objective Cough Frequency were reported for each treatment group at Day 84.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who had taken at least 1 dose of study medication and provided at least 1 baseline and at least one Day 84 endpoint observation during the treatment period.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sleep Objective Cough Frequency After 12 Weeks of Treatment (Day 84)</title>
        <description>Sleep Objective Cough Frequency was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period while the participant was asleep divided by the total duration in hours for the monitoring period that the participant was asleep. 24 hour sound recordings were made at Baseline (Study Day -1) and at Week 12 (Day 84) using a digital recording device. An independent cough monitoring center documented the time of each cough event over the 24 hour period, as well as the time when the participant went to sleep and the time the participant woke. LS mean change from baseline (in log scale) with associated SE reported for each treatment group. Change from Baseline in Sleep Objective Cough Frequency = (Post-Treatment Objective Sleep Cough Frequency minus Baseline Sleep Cough Frequency).</description>

LS mean change from baseline of the weekly mean total daily CSD score was reported for each treatment group with associated SE. Baseline was defined as the average CSD scores collected during the week prior to Day 1 (Study Day -7 to Day -1).</description>

        <description>The daily CSD instrument has a total of 7 items, each with scores ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). The total daily CSD is the sum of these 7 item scores (Min=0, Max=70). Mean total daily score (the sum of 7 item scores divided by 7) was derived for each day. Weekly mean total daily score was defined as the average of the mean total daily scores for each week. LS mean change from baseline of the weekly mean total daily CSD score was reported for each treatment group with associated SE. Baseline was defined as the average CSD scores collected during the week prior to Day 1 (Study Day -7 to Day -1).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weekly Mean Daily CSD Total Score at Week 10</title>
        <description>The daily CSD instrument has a total of 7 items, each with scores ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). The total daily CSD is the sum of these 7 item scores (Min=0, Max=70). Mean total daily score (the sum of 7 item scores divided by 7) was derived for each day. Weekly mean total daily score was defined as the average of the mean total daily scores for each week. LS mean change from baseline of the weekly mean total daily CSD score was reported for each treatment group with associated SE. Baseline was defined as the average CSD scores collected during the week prior to Day 1 (Study Day -7 to Day -1).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Weekly Mean DCS at Week 3</title>
          <description>The DCS has a score ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). Weekly mean daily score was defined as the average of the daily scores for each week. Baseline was defined as the average DCS score collected during the week prior to Day 1 (Day -7 to Day -1). Participants rated the severity of their cough using the DCS each day. LS mean change from baseline of the weekly mean Daily Cough Score with associated SE was reported for each treatment group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) Total Score After 4 Weeks of Treatment (Day 28)</title>
        <description>The LCQ instrument is designed to assess the impact of cough on various aspects of a participant’s life over the preceding 2 weeks. It consists of 19 items which are divided over 3 domains: Physical (items 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15), Psychological (4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, and 17), and Social (7, 8, 18, 19). A 7-point Likert scale is used to rate each item. For each domain, the domain score (range 1-7) is the sum of the individual item scores within the domain divided by the number of items in the domain. The total score is the sum of the three domain scores and ranges from 3-21; a higher score corresponds to a better health status. Baseline LCQ was defined as the LCQ collected at Baseline (Study Day -1). LS mean change from baseline in total LCQ score was reported for each treatment group with associated SE.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) Total Score After 4 Weeks of Treatment (Day 56)</title>
        <description>The LCQ instrument is designed to assess the impact of cough on various aspects of a participant’s life over the preceding 2 weeks. It consists of 19 items which are divided over 3 domains: Physical (items 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15), Psychological (4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, and 17), and Social (7, 8, 18, 19). A 7-point Likert scale is used to rate each item. For each domain, the domain score (range 1-7) is the sum of the individual item scores within the domain divided by the number of items in the domain. The total score is the sum of the three domain scores and ranges from 3-21; a higher score corresponds to a better health status. Baseline LCQ was defined as the LCQ collected at Baseline (Study Day -1). LS mean change from baseline in total LCQ score was reported for each treatment group with associated SE.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Reporting “Very Much Improved” or “Much Improved” According to the Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC) After 4 Weeks of Treatment (Day 28)</title>
        <description>The self-reported measure Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC) reflects a participant’s belief about the efficacy of treatment. PGIC is a 7-point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement. Participants rate their change as “very much improved,” “much improved,” “minimally improved,” “no change,” “minimally worse,” “much worse,” or “very much worse.” The counts and percentages of ordered responses to the participant’s global perception of change were computed for each treatment group on Day 28 and the percentage of participants with improvements (either &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved&quot; on the PGIC scale) was reported for each treatment group.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Reporting “Very Much Improved” or “Much Improved” According to the Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC) After 4 Weeks of Treatment (Day 28)</title>
          <description>The self-reported measure Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC) reflects a participant’s belief about the efficacy of treatment. PGIC is a 7-point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement. Participants rate their change as “very much improved,” “much improved,” “minimally improved,” “no change,” “minimally worse,” “much worse,” or “very much worse.” The counts and percentages of ordered responses to the participant’s global perception of change were computed for each treatment group on Day 28 and the percentage of participants with improvements (either &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved&quot; on the PGIC scale) was reported for each treatment group.</description>

Clinicians rated the participant’s change at Week 12 (Day 85) as “very much improved,” “much improved,” “minimally improved,” “no change,” “minimally worse,” “much worse,” or “very much worse.” The counts and percentages of ordered responses to the clinician’s global perception of change were computed for each treatment group, and the percentage of participants rated by clinicians as having improvement (either &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved&quot; on the CGIC scale) was reported for each treatment group.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who had taken at least 1 dose of study medication and provided at least 1 baseline and 1 Day 85 CGIC observation during the treatment period.</population>
