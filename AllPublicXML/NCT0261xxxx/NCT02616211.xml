    <textblock>
      Patients are asked to participate in this study if they have been diagnosed with a thoracic
      carcinoma which includes lung cancer and have a gene mutation (alteration in the body's
      genetic instructions) and after undergoing treatment the cancer has come back, progressed, or
      shown a partial response on standard treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the treatment outcome for thoracic carcinomas after they become resistant
      to targeted therapy, the investigator is using tumor biopsies at the time of recurrence for
      genomic analysis to identify novel somatic changes in critical genes and gene pathways that
      can potentially be targeted with therapy. The study team is also creating patient-derived
      xenografts to test drug efficacy and optimize personalized therapy for each patient.

    <measure>Number of tumorgrafts from biopsies of the recurrent tumor grown and used for drug treatment selection based on genomic signatures.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Mice will be used to grow tumor xenografts. For subsequent passages, tumors will be implanted through passage mice. The patient-derived xenograft-baring mice will then be used for anti-tumor efficacy studies according to the patient prior therapeutic history and molecular signature of the tumor biopsy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recording turn-around-time</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Time metrics from biopsy to completion of molecular genetic tests; the time and the success rate of tumorgraft growth in mice as well as the optimal time lapse between initiation treatment to observation of response will be examined. This will aid in the determination of feasibility and opportunities of using patient specific treatment for tumor recurrence.</description>

      At the time of recurrence, a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of four (4) tissue cores will
      be taken through interventional biopsy, ultra sound guided biopsy, surgical resection, or
      bronchoscopy. Investigators may also collect waste pleural fluid in patients who have a
      pleurx catheter in place. These biopsies will be collected and individually processed for
      pathology, gene mutation screening, transcriptome profiling and tumor xenografts.
