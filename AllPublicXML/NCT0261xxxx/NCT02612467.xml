      Background Studies in the United Kingdom find the stratified care model of the STarT Back
      Tool (SBT) to be superior to usual care in primary care low back pain (LBP) patients.
      However, considerations on differences in health care and social systems across countries are
      required before taking steps towards any recommendations of implementing stratified care into
      other health care services.

      Objective To investigate the effectiveness of the stratified care model of the SBT, when
      embedded into the regional disease management programs on LBP in primary care as compared to
      current best practice care.

      Methods The study is a two-armed randomized controlled trial in Danish primary health care
      setting. In total 700 patients are included in the study.

      The patients are randomised automatically by a developed database to; 1) Stratified care
      (treatment matched to stratification according to SBT) or 2) Control treatment (treatment
      based solely on clinical reasoning).

      All data including patient consent is collected and monitored using a web-based data
      management system.

Low risk: Reassuring information.
