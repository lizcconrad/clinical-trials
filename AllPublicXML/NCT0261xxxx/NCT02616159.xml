    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to compare the glycemic and insulinemic responses over 3
      hours elicited by 3 oatmeal varieties compared to each other and to controls of ready to eat
      and hot cereals.

      Participant eligibility will be screened at visit 1. The study will be a randomized,
      cross-over design. Participants will come to the study site on 5 separate occasions separated
      by a 2-day to 2-week washout period. Participants will arrive to the lab in a fasted state. 2
      fasting blood samples will be collected, and further blood sampled will be taken over a
      3-hour period post study product consumption.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or non-pregnant females, 18-75 years of age, inclusive

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 20.0 and &lt; 35 kg/m² at screening (visit 1).

          -  Willing to maintain habitual diet, physical activity pattern, and body weight
             throughout the trial and to refrain from smoking for 12hr prior to each visit.

          -  Willing to maintain current dietary supplement use throughout the trial. On test days,
             subject agrees not to take any dietary supplements until dismissal from the GI labs.
             Failure to comply will result in a rescheduled test visit.

          -  Normal fasting serum glucose (&lt;7.0mmol/L capillary corresponding to whole blood
             glucose &lt;6.3mmol/L).

          -  Willing to abstain from alcohol consumption and avoid vigorous physical activity for
             24 h prior to all test visits.

          -  Absence of health conditions that would prevent fulfillment of study requirements as
             judged by the Investigator on the basis of medical history.

          -  Understanding the study procedures and willing to provide informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization to release relevant protected health
             information to the study investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet any one of the inclusion criteria

          -  Known history of AIDS, hepatitis, a history or presence of clinically important
             endocrine (including Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus), cardiovascular (including,
             but not limited to, atherosclerotic disease, history of myocardial infarction,
             peripheral arterial disease, stroke), pulmonary, biliary or GI disorders.

          -  Use of medications known to influence carbohydrate metabolism, including, but not
             limited to adrenergic blockers, diuretics, thiazolidinediones, metformin and systemic
             corticosteroids within 4 weeks of the screening visit, or with any condition which
             might, in the opinion of Dr. Wolever, the president of GI Testing, either: 1) make
             participation dangerous to the subject or to others, or 2) affect the results.

          -  Major trauma or surgical event within 3 months of screening.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the experimental procedures and to follow GI
             Labs safety guidelines.

          -  Known intolerance, sensitivity or allergy to any ingredients in the study products.

          -  Extreme dietary habits, as judged by the Investigator (i.e. Atkins diet, very high
             protein diets, etc).
