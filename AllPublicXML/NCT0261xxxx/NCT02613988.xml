  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies advanced MR imaging techniques in measuring early response of
      standard treatment may become predictors of long-term treatment response in patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastomas.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard care of patients with glioblastoma is concomitant chemoradiation and adjuvant
      temozolomide. Allowing for assessment of tumor therapy prior to treatment completion is
      important to select patients most likely to benefit from alternative treatment option.
      Multimodal advanced MR imaging- contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted
      imaging, chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging, and perfusion imaging on 3T enables
      quantitative assessment of treatment response. Quantifying changes in advanced MR imaging
      techniques would allow predict outcome for early and long-term treatment response and
      survival in glioblastomas.

    <description>The response was determined by a modification of the RANO criteria that combined the image assessment, neurologic evaluation and assessment of steroid use. Clinical and radiologic assessments were carried out at pre-CCRT; 4 weeks after completion of the CCRT; and every 2 or 3 months during the adjuvant TMZ therapy. Complete Response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance on MR of all enhancing tumor; Partial Response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in tumor size on MR by bi-dimensional measurement; Pseudoprogression was defined when there was a decrease or stabilization of the contrast-enhancing lesions for a minimum of six months and combined with no change in treatment/ or a increase in contrast-enhancing lesion on the first subsequent follow-up MR image, as long as it stabilized on the second follow-up and there was no need for treatment change. Responder = CR+PR+Pseudoprogression, Non-responder = Progression.</description>

          -  Patients must have radiologically and histologically confirmed diagnosis of newly
             diagnosed glioblastoma

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as evident tumors with gadolinium
             enhancement on MRI that is measurable in at least one diameter

             temozolomide therapy)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document;
             all patients, or their legal guardians, must sign a written informed consent and
             Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization in
             accordance with institutional guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:
