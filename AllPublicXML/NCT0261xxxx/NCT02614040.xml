  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a cluster-randomized, single-center trial comparing 0.9% saline (normal
      saline) vs physiologically-balanced crystalloid fluids (Lactated Ringers or Plasmalyte A) for
      intravenous fluid administration in the emergency department.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of intravenous fluids is ubiquitous in the care of the acutely ill.
      Commonly available isotonic crystalloid solutions contain a broad spectrum of electrolyte
      compositions including a range chloride concentrations. Recent studies have associated
      solutions with supraphysiologic chloride content with hyperchloremia, metabolic acidosis and
      renal vasoconstriction, acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy, and increased
      mortality but no large, randomized-controlled trials have been conducted. SaLt-ED will be a
      large, cluster-randomized trial enrolling adults requiring intravenous isotonic crystalloid
      administration and hospital admission from the Vanderbilt University Emergency Department
      from January 1st 2016 until April 30 2017. The primary endpoint will be hospital-free days to
      day 28.
