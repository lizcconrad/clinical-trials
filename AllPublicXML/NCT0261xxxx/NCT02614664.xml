  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with single ventricle physiology (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid
      atresia) frequently have feeding difficulties necessitating procedures such as Nissen
      fundoplication and G-tube placement. With advances in minimally invasive surgery, these are
      frequently performed using laparoscopic techniques. Although generally safe and effective,
      the increase in IAP during laparoscopy may increase systemic and pulmonary vascular
      resistance and decrease cardiac output. This prospective study will include 50 patients with
      single ventricle physiology presenting for laparoscopic procedures. There will be no change
      in the anesthetic or perioperative care of these patients. Tissue and cerebral oxygenation
      will be monitored using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
