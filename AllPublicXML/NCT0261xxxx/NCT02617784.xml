  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of oseltamivir and its
      metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate in participants undergoing routine HD and CAPD for
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Participants will receive 6.5 and 6 weeks of the marketed
      oral oseltamivir suspension dosed according to the HD or CAPD schedule, respectively.

            <description>Participants on HD received 9 doses of 30-mg oseltamivir oral suspension, given 1 hour after completion of alternating HD sessions. All HD participants were planned to receive 19 routine HD sessions (three per week) during the 6.5-week study period.</description>

          <description>Dialyzer samples were obtained up to 5 hours from the start of dialysis on Days 3 and 40 (corresponding to HD sessions 2 and 18). Arterial concentrations were estimated using the inflow to the dialyzer, and venous concentrations were estimated using the outflow from the dialyzer. The concentration at each collection time was recorded and averaged among all participants and expressed in ng/mL.</description>
