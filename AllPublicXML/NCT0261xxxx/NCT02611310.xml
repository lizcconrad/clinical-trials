  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, national, multicenter, non-interventional study designed to enroll
      participants who have an initial diagnosis of unresectable LA/mBC made up to 6 months prior
      to registry enrollment. These participants will be prospectively followed for at least 5
      years after study enrollment to evaluate their anti-cancer treatments. Data on participants'
      previous anti-cancer treatments for breast cancer will be collected retrospectively at study
      entry.
