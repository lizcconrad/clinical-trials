  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A long-standing intervention during tracheostomy tube suctioning in acute care settings is
      use of saline to loosen and remove respiratory tract secretions, maintain airway patency, and
      prevent mucus plugs. Controversy exists regarding safely using saline prior to suctioning for
      head and neck cancer and mechanically ventilated patients. To date, all studies had
      methodological limitations. In 2013, the clinical consensus statement published by AAO-HNSF
      identified a research gap based on lack of strong scientific evidence. A single site,
      randomized controlled pilot study will be conducted to evaluate effects of saline
      instillation with tracheostomy tube suctioning; test feasibility of proposed methods and
      procedures; and ensure proposed outcome variables are measurable and not confounded by
      extraneous variables. Institutional review board approval will be obtained before eligible
      adult subjects (inpatient and intensive care units) are recruited and consented. Oxygen
      saturation and heart rate are primary outcome variables; secondary outcome variables are
      mucus plugs and ventilator-associated pneumonias; other demographic data and patient
      characteristic variables; and outcome variables on complications and length of stay. Mean,
      standard deviation, median, and interquartile range will be calculated for continuous
      variables using t-tests to compare pre- and post-assessment scores. Frequencies and
      percentages will be calculated for categorical variables using Chi square and Fisher Exact
      tests to compare pre- and post-assessment scores. Multiple regression analysis will be used
      to control for confounding variables. This study is innovative as the first to recruit both
      head and neck cancer patients and mechanically ventilated patients and to measure all major
      outcomes of interest in one study. Understanding the effects of normal saline instillation
      will enable development of evidence-based guidelines and standardized protocols for
      tracheostomy tube suctioning.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult Patients, ages 18 or older, cared for on adult inpatient units/wards.

          -  Patients who have a tracheostomy tube.

          -  Tracheostomy tube has been in place at lease for 72 hours (to avoid any late effects
             of anesthesia that was administered at the time of tracheostomy tube placement).

          -  Patients must have a physician order to suction the tracheostomy tube at least every 8
             hours. This will help us to recruit patients for whom suctioning is already part of
             standard care. Therefore, patients will not undergo unnecessary suctioning for the
             purpose of the study.

          -  Expected hospitalization to be 5 days or greater after consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fresh tracheostomy that still has bleeding from the stoma (&lt; 72 hours since the
             surgical placement of a tracheostomy tube).

          -  Active respiratory distress or hemodynamic changes that warrant a change in the
             existing treatment plan.

          -  Patients who are expected to die or undergo withdrawal of treatment within 48 hours.

          -  Patients who are allergic to latex to avoid a reaction with the red rubber suction
             catheter that will be used in the study.
