  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be female, ages 18 and older and have a diagnosis of Clinical T1 or T2
      invasive breast cancer with no suspicious palpable adenopathy. Patients will undergo standard
      of care lumpectomy without sentinel node biopsy and whole breast radiation, followed by
      chemotherapy.

      Sentinel node biopsy is also considered standard care when patients have localized breast
      cancer. Treatment can often be influenced by whether the results of the biopsy show cancer or
      not. However, the biologic factors of the primary tumor have become more important in
      determining treatment recommendations in women with clinically node negative breast cancer.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the locoregional recurrence rate in
      patients with clinically node negative T1 and T2 breast cancer treated with systemic
      chemotherapy and whole breast irradiation in whom biopsy of the sentinel node is not
      performed. A locoregional recurrence is defined as any recurrence in the ipsilateral axillary
      nodes or in the supraclavicular nodes.

      After surgery, a patient will receive standard of care radiation on her affected breast and
      chemotherapy. A physical examination of the affected breast and regional lymph nodes will be
      conducted every six months for the first two years of follow up and then yearly for the last
      3 years of follow up. Imaging of the affected breast will occur every 12 months after surgery
      per standard of care.

          -  Planned treatment with breast conserving surgery and whole breast irradiation

          -  Chemotherapy required postoperatively based on patient and tumor characteristics at
             diagnosis
