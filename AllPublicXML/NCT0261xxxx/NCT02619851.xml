      This clinical trial is a Phase II controlled, parallel, open-label trial, designed to test
      the efficacy and safety of ALLO-ASC-DFU and conventional therapy in Deep Second-degree burn
      wound subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
      Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release growth factors such as
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can
      enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in
      treating Deep Second-degree burn wounds.
