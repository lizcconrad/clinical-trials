    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study to assess safety and clinical activity of continued AFFITOPE® PD01A
      vaccinations in patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients, who have already participated in
      the AFF008 program will be involved and will receive a second boost immunization with
      AFFITOPE® PD01A. One study site in Vienna (Austria) will be involved.

      In addition, up to 6 patients will be offered participation within an untreated control
      Group.
