  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine if protein is less likely to create positive
      energy balance when added to the diet compared to carbohydrate. To do this, the investigators
      will take detailed measurements of participant's baseline metabolic rate to understand their
      energy requirements. Then, the investigators will feed participants all their meals for two
      weeks, Monday-Friday, and measure their food intake. During one of the week-long feeding
      periods, participants will consume a shake made of egg protein that is ~20% of their energy
      requirements. During the other week, participants will consume a shake made of carbohydrate
      that is ~20% of their energy requirements. Participants will drink the assigned shake at the
      beginning of each of their daily three meals, and then they will be offered a 'regular' meal
      of unlimited quantity. Participants will not know that the investigators are measuring the
      food consumed after drinking the shake. Participants will drink the protein shake for the
      first week and carb-based shake for the second week, and vice versa-- depending on the
      randomization order. To account for energy expenditure, participants will wear an activity
      monitor, an accelerometer. Energy balance, measured as participant energy intake minus energy
      expenditure, will be our main outcome for each treatment. However, because participants may
      change their behavior if made aware of the true research question, the investigators will
      tell participants that the purpose of the study is to see how low fiber and high fiber shakes
      affect mood. The hypothesis is that during the week when participants consume the protein
      shake, they will remain in energy balance, but during the week of carbohydrate shake
      consumption, participants will have positive energy balance.
