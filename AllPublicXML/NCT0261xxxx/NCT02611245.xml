    <textblock>
      This study aims to first apply near-infrared fluorescence imaging technology in thoracic
      surgery with indocyanine green in China. To evaluate the feasibility usage of the
      investigators' fluorescence imaging systems and the safety applications in intraoperative
      sentinel lymph node mapping of lung and esophageal cancer, lung nodule imaging, lung segment
      resection boundary determination, esophagus - tubular anastomosis, thoracic duct imaging and
      chylothorax repairing thoracic surgery. Aim to achieve precise boundaries definition during
      thoracic surgery and realize accurate, minimally invasive thoracic surgery with fluorescence
      imaging technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a major threat to human health. Diagnosis and treatment using precision
      medicine is expected to be an effective method for preventing the initiation and progression
      of cancer. Although anatomical and functional imaging techniques such as radiography,
      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography
      (PET) have played an important role for accurate preoperative diagnostics, for the most part
      these techniques cannot be applied intraoperatively. Optical molecular imaging is a promising
      technique that provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in tumor margin
      detection. Furthermore, existing clinical applications have proven that optical molecular
      imaging is a powerful intraoperative tool for guiding surgeons performing precision
      procedures, thus enabling radical resection and improved survival rates. However, detection
      depth limitation exists in optical molecular imaging methods and further breakthroughs from
      optical open surgery to minimally invasive intraoperative imaging methods are needed to
      develop more extensive and comprehensive intraoperative applications.

    <description>This group of patients under general anesthesia to accept conventional thoracoscopy or thoracotomy. Before systematic lymphadenectomy, four-point of ICG with 10mg was injected in normal lung tissue around the tumor. After 3-5 minutes, fluorescence and white-light images were collected and recorded in real-time. With the guidance of intraoperative images, all fluorescent lymph nodes were removed and sent to routine pathological confirmation.</description>

    <description>This group of patients accepted intravenous injection from 0.5mg / kg to 5mg / kg ICG within 4 to 24 hours before surgery. All patients under general anesthesia to accept conventional thoracoscopy or thoracotomy. After entering the chest using fluorescence thoracoscopy system to collect the fluorescence and white-light images and record the video. After following the routine preoperative planning surgery, the researchers will carefully assess the possibility of the benign and malignant nodules and to communicate with the families of patients. If the patient's family expressed their willingness to dissect the nodules, the researchers will remove this extra pulmonary nodules. Resected specimens will send to routine pathological confirmation compared with the fluorescence results.</description>
