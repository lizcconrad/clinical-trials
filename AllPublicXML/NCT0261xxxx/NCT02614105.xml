  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to investigate whether pelvic floor muscle training or
      cough-suppression therapy reduces symptoms of urinary incontinence amongst women with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease grade 1-4 (mild to very severe disease).

      This two-centre study will consist of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel
      group design and include two intervention groups and one control group. Recruitment and data
      collection will occur simultaneously at the Ã˜HT and St. Olav's Hospital in Trondheim.

      All participants will complete an initial four week general group exercise class (1 hour once
      a week) prior to randomisation. This intervention will focus on strength exercises (lower
      limb and upper limb), endurance training, balance training and thorax mobilising exercises.
      All participants will be examined and complete questionnaires at two occasions; after the
      initial four weeks general exercise/before intervention, and at 16 weeks post-randomisation.

      Participants will be randomised to either Intervention group A (pelvic floor muscle training
      group), Intervention group B (cough-suppression group) or a control group who will receive
      brief written information about pelvic floor muscle training and cough-suppression, but no
      other form of regular follow-up or intervention throughout the intervention period.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline score at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cough symptoms will be measured using the Norwegian version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, which is in the process of being translated from English to Norwegian and tested for reliability and validity. The Leicester Cough Questionnaire is used to measure physical, psychological and social factors related to cough</description>

    <description>Participants in the pelvic floor muscle training group will receive group exercise sessions (1 hour) at the physiotherapy out-patient department of the hospital once a week for 16 weeks with guidance from an experienced pelvic floor physiotherapist. The group exercise sessions will focus on pelvic floor muscle training, relaxation and breathing techniques. Participants in the pelvic floor muscle training group will also receive an individually adapted pelvic floor muscle training program for daily home use.</description>
