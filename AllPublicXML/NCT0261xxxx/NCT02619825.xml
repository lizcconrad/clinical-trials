      First, investigators must determine the physiological standards across age classes of
      myocardial stiffness estimated by Elastography in ultrafast (estimated right ventricular
      stiffness [VD] and left ventricular [LV]). This will be done in groups of children without
      heart condition, age group (10 children per group, four age groups [0-1mois, 1 month-1 year 1
      year-5 years, 5 years-15years]).

      Secondly, investigators will evaluate myocardial stiffness Elastography (RV and LV) on
      different groups of children (same age group) with cardiomyopathy and examine correlations
      with the conventional parameters of systolic and diastolic function of both ventricles and
      with myocardial strain values. The total population of the study will be 120 children (40
      healthy, 80 patients).

      Monocenter Prospective, open-label, non-randomized. All patients included in the study have a
      specific consultation built around a clinical examination and echocardiography, in two
      stages, with estimates of the stiffness of the myocardium ShearWave Elastography (Aixplorer®)
      and measures of all echocardiographic parameters estimated in children with a clinical
      ultrasound machine (Philips and General Electric).

      Following this consultation, clinic and electrocardiographic monitoring period will be
      observed for 30 minutes, to ensure the safety of our procedure.

      Required subjects: 40 healthy volunteers + 80 = 120 persons
