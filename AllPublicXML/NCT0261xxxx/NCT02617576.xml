      To determine if patient satisfaction, participation, and image quality improves with flavored
      oral contrast for MR enterography.

    <textblock>
      Volumen is an oral contrast agent used in MR imaging of the bowel. It has an unpleasant taste
      which makes it difficult for pediatric patients, especially sick pediatric patients, to
      drink. There are other contrast materials used in the department that are flavored to
      improved patient participation. The investigators hope to determine a way to flavor Volumen
      to improve patient participation. In doing so, the investigators hope to also improve patient
      satisfaction as well as imaging quality.
