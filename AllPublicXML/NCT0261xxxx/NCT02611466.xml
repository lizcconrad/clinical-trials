      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ASP7962 relative to
      placebo.

      This study will also evaluate the efficacy of ASP7962 relative to placebo on pain on walking,
      function and stiffness; the time course of efficacy of ASP7962 relative to placebo; the
      improvement in overall patient status of ASP7962 relative to placebo as well as the safety
      and tolerability of ASP7962 relative to placebo.

    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used and validated tool to assess joint pain related to OA. The questionnaire is self-administered and assesses pain, disability and joint stiffness in knee Osteoarthritis (OA). The total score on the WOMAC is based on the following 3 subscales: Pain; Stiffness and Physical functioning. Each item will be based on an 11 point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), 0 = no pain and 10= pain as bad as you can imagine.</description>
