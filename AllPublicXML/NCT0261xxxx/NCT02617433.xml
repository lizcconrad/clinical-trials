  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rocuronium block neuromuscular transmission at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis
      of the affected skeletal muscles. There have been several studies reported positive
      relationship between muscle mass and amount of neuromuscular junction. The purpose of this
      study is to find relationship between muscle mass and muscle relaxation time.

    <textblock>
      Rocuronium block neuromuscular transmission at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis
      of the affected skeletal muscles. There have been several studies reported positive
      relationship between muscle mass and amount of neuromuscular junction. Until now, dose of
      rocuronium has been judged by patient's weight and height. However, height and weight do not
      represent exact muscle mass. The purpose of this study is to find relationship between muscle
      mass and muscle relaxation time. Measurement of muscle mass will be obtained using
      bioelectrical impedence analysis.
