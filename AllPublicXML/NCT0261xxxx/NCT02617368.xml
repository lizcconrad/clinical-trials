  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective of this study was evaluate the diagnostic capacity of fourier analysis of
      keratometric data in differentiating moderate KC and FFK from healthy corneas.

      Study participants were recruited from the Cornea Outpatient service in a consecutive if
      eligible basis. Two study groups were formed: a)KC group included patients those were
      diagnosed and classified for moderate keratoconus according to the Amsler-Krumeich
      classification system, b) FFK group (FFKG) that included patients diagnosed with FFK, and c)
      Control group (CG) was formed by refractive surgery candidates. Pentacam (Pentacam HR, Oculus
      Optikgerate GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany)measurements were performed by the same experienced
      operator in a consistent way.
