    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a simple text message reminder sent to the
      parent of an child/adolescent with Type 1 Diabetes(or parent and adolescent) is effective in
      helping the individual(or parent) become more compliant with self-managing the Type 1
      Diabetes (T1D). There will be 5 arms: text message sent to parents of children age 8-12 years
      old with T1D, text messages sent to parents of adolescents ,age 13-18 years old, with
      T1D,text messages sent to parents of adolescents with T1D as well as the adolescent with
      T1D,no text message sent to parents of children age 8-12 years, and no text message sent to
      adolescents or parents of adolescents age 13-18 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Managing Type 1 Diabetes requires daily checks of blood glucose and medication adjustments.
      Children and adolescents are known to have more difficulty with this than adults.
      Parents/legal guardians also face the task of helping with this self-management. A weekly
      text message regarding Type 1 Diabetes, sent to the parent or the parent and adolescent, may
      help to remind and motivate an individual to perform the daily tasks needed to manage their
      Type 1 Diabetes.
