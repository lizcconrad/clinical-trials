    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this retrospective registry study is to investigate the burden-of.illness
      in atrial fibrillation (AF) in Denmark. Several Danish registries will be utilized to collect
      information on the diseases epidemiology including incidence and prevalence of AF and stroke
      as well as a stroke risk stratification of the Danish AF-population, the clinical and
      economical burden (in terms of direct and indirect cost) of AF and stroke to Danish patients,
      healthcare providers / healthcare system and society as well as describing treatment patterns
      with anticoagulant agents and their consequences in terms of stroke, bleeds, death and
      according cost in a real-life setting.
