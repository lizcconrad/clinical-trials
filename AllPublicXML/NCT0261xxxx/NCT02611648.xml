  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the most effective way to sterilize duodenoscopes (&quot;scopes&quot;) used
      at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). Right now, BIDMC uses the standard method of
      high level disinfection to sterilize scopes. Because infections have been passed by scopes at
      other institutions in the U.S., the investigators are exploring whether or not adding two
      different sterilization processes will reduce this risk of contamination.

      Bacteria may be passed from a patient's intestines to the scope. Or, if the scope is
      contaminated, bacteria may be passed from the scope to the patient. In order to understand
      how bacteria are passed, the investigators will be taking samples of the patient's intestinal
      bacteria to compare to the bacteria, if any, found on the scope.

      Study Design

      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of supplementing standard high-level
      disinfection with additional high level-disinfection or sterilization procedures on the
      frequency of duodenoscopes contamination. Duodenoscopes will be randomly assigned to one of
      three arms:

        -  Standard high-level disinfection currently performed at BIDMC (standard HLD)

        -  Standard high-level disinfection with an additional exposure time to disinfectant
           (double HLD)

        -  Standard high-level disinfection followed by ethylene oxide (HLD/ETO)

      The study will be conducted with the following elements:

        1. All duodenoscopes will be randomly assigned to a study arm before the duodenoscope is
           used for an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) procedure included in
           the study, including duodenoscopes introduced during the study.

        2. All duodenoscopes used for ERCP will have the following cultures obtained in a sterile
           fashion

        3. Patient study consent for obtaining patient rectal surveillance and clinical cultures
           will be obtained at the time of ERCP procedure consent among all patients undergoing
           ERCP. Patients will be blinded to duodenoscope disinfection/sterilization assignment.

        4. The ERCP procedure will be performed according to standard clinical practice. Among
           patients consenting to specimen collection, a duodenal aspirate will be obtained during
           the procedure.

        5. Among consenting patients, a rectal surveillance swab will be collected
           post-procedurally by ERCP staff.

        6. After ERCP completion, current BIDMC-employed trained technicians will perform the
           assigned disinfection/sterilization procedure.
