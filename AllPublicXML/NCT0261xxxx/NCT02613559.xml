  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and
      tolerability of single ascending doses of TK001(Recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal
      antibody) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in neovascular wet age-related
      macular degeneration (wAMD) subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-comparative, non-randomized, single-center phase 1 study
      evaluating pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single intravitreal injections of
      TK001 in the patients with AMD.TK001 is a full-length recombinant humanized anti-VEGF
      monoclonal antibody. Compared with Avastin(a similar marketed product), the findings of
      preclinical studies suggested that TK001 might be more effective in inhibiting pathological
      angiogenesis, or to achieve equivalent effect with less dosage and better safety. In this
      study, participants will be administrated a single dose of TK001.Every subject will only
      accept one dose. In addition to safety and preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics and
      immunogenicity of TK001will be evaluated as well.
