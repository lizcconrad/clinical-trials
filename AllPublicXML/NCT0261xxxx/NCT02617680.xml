  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence that inappropriate depth of anaesthesia is associated with
      increased risk of postoperative complications including risk of death. The aim of this study
      was to identify factors determining the effective end-tidal concentration (EEtC) of
      desflurane, duration of wash in and wash out phase, and to estimate the risk of perioperative
      awareness in patients undergoing elective neurosurgical procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III scheduled
      for elective neurosurgical procedure under general anaesthesia are studied. In each
      individual, the manufacturer recommended age-corrected end-tidal concentrations of desflurane
      is set and achieved initially. Individual effective end-tidal concentration (EEtC) of
      desflurane is then defined according to entropy parameters and maintained in the targeted
      range of static and response entropy 40-50. Effective analgesia is maintained according to
      surgical plethysmographic index (SPI) and dose of muscle relaxants according to neuromuscular
      transmission monitoring (TOF). Comorbidity, regular intake of alcohol and medication,
      smoking, sex, weight, height, and age are recorded. Postoperative questionnaire is used to
      reveal the intraoperative awareness.
