  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are asked to participate in a research study of the effect of a sleep
      intervention on improving sleep habits and reducing their risk of breast cancer.

      Participants are asked to participate in this research study because they have been
      identified as being at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to compare women who get a sleep intervention to women who do
      not get a sleep intervention. This study team will compare these two groups of women to see
      if the sleep intervention improves their sleep and if it lowers markers of inflammation that
      have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

      Objective 1: To test the effectiveness of the GO! To Sleep program at improving the sleep
      duration and sleep quality in women at high risk of breast cancer.

      Objective 2: To test the effectiveness of improvements in sleep quality and/or duration due
      to the GO! To Sleep program on biomarkers of inflammation in women at high risk of breast
      cancer.

      Objective 3: To evaluate the effectiveness of improvements in health-related quality of life
      after the GO! To Sleep in women at high risk of breast cancer.
