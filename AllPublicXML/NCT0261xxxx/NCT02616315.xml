      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of naltrexone hydrochloride(HCL) and
      bupropion hydrochloride extended release combination (NB) compared with placebo on weight
      loss in obese participants post bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called naltrexone hydrochloride/bupropion
      hydrochloride (NB). NB is being tested to determine its effect on weight loss in obese
      participants post bariatric surgery.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Naltrexone HCl 32 mg/bupropion HCl 360 mg extended-release tablet

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will start on 1 tablet a day and will increase their dose by 1 tablet per
      week for 4 weeks to reach the optimal dose.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 59 weeks maximum. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, plus a final visit 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>The IWQOL-Lite, is a validated 31-item, self -reported, obesity-specific measure of health-related quality of life that consists of a total score and scores on each of 5 scales (physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work) that exhibits strong psychometric properties. Participants rate items within the scales as: 5=always true, 4=usually true, 3=sometimes true, 2=rarely true, or 1=never true. Scale scores are obtained by adding item scores, and the total score is obtained by adding scale scores. Higher scores indicate poorer quality of life.</description>
