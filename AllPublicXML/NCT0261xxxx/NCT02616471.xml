  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the present research project is to examine whether consumption of high
      daily amounts of cheese, both high-fat and low-fat, affects risk markers of disease in a
      study population of men and women with metabolic syndrome risk factors.

      It will be explored whether high-fat and/or low-fat cheese consumption can be regarded
      healthy to consume for at-risk populations (assessed by within-group comparisons from
      baseline values) and if low-fat or non-fat alternatives to high-fat cheese should continue to
      be recommended (assessed by between-group comparisons).

      In addition, it will be assessed if cheese consumption affects women and men differently as
      suggested by observational data. The present research project will examine the health effects
      of cheese as a food product per se and not as a sum of single nutrients, knowing that the
      single components of cheese cannot be adequately placebo-matched. A relatively high daily
      intake of high-fat cheese will be compared to a similar intake of low-fat cheese and with a
      carbohydrate control.

    <description>The subjects in the HFC group will be supplied with equal amounts of two types of regular/high fat cheeses. The cheeses are normal-fat Danbo (Riberhus, 25% fat, Arla, DK) and normal-fat Cheddar (Sharp Cheddar, 32% fat, Cabot, US).
No further dairy and cheese consumption is allowed</description>

    <description>The subjects in the LFC group will be supplied with equal amounts of two types of reduced/low fat cheeses. The cheeses are reduced-fat Danbo(Cheasy, 13% fat, Arla, DK) and reduced-fat Cheddar (Sharp Light Cheddar, 16% fat, Cabot, US). No further dairy/cheese consumption is allowed.</description>

    <description>For subjects in the CTR group, cheese is replaced by simple and starchy carbohydrates in jam and white bread, which will be supplied by the department. The daily energy and sodium contents will be matched to those of the cheese in the HFC group. No dairy/cheese consumption is allowed.</description>
