  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can induce angiogenesis and
      improve impaired organ function. HBOT was also recently suggested as a possible therapy for
      ED due to surgical injuries. However, the effect of HBOT on non-surgical related ED has not
      been investigated to date.

      The objective in this study was to assess the effect of HBOT on patients with ED by means of
      sexual function questionnaires and novel imaging techniques.

      A prospective analysis of men, age 18 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of erectile
      dysfunction, reporting decreased and weakened nocturnal penile tumescence of six months
      duration or longer.

      Patients were treated at The treatment comprised 40 daily hyperbaric sessions, 5 days a week,
      in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber (HAUX-Life-Support GmbH). Each session consisted of 90
      minutes of exposure to 100% oxygen at 2 ATA with 5 minutes air breaks every 30 minutes and 1
      meter per minute compression and decompression.

      Sexual function Efficacy of the treatment was assessed using the International Index of
      Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire which was filled by all patients at baseline and
      within 2 weeks of the last HBOT session. In addition, assessing efficacy was the global
      efficacy question (GEQ) (&quot;Did the treatment improve your erections?&quot;), with a response of yes
      or no.

      Six patients underwent two MRI scans 1-2 weeks prior to and after HBOT. Imaging was conducted
      in using a 3Tesla system (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Solutions, , Germany). The MRI
      protocol included anatomic T1 and T2 sequences and DCE. The MRI DCE sequence parameters are
      detailed in supplementary section.

    <description>Efficacy of the treatment was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Primary outcome was measured by questions 3 and 4 (Q3 and Q4). Question 3 asks 'Over the past four weeks, when you have attempted sexual intercourse how often were you able to penetrate (enter) your partner?'. Question 4 asks 'Over the past four weeks, during sexual intercourse, how often were you able to maintain your erection after you have penetrated your partner?'</description>

    <description>Imaging was conducted in using a 3Tesla system (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Solutions, , Germany). The MRI protocol included anatomic T1 and T2 sequences and DCE.
K-trans calculations were performed in four specific axial sections located in each CC at the level of the penis base for better localization and reduced variability (Figure-1). Another control K-trans measurement was performed at the psoas muscle at the point in pass at the groin. The relative change in penile K-trans values (in %) was calculated as (post HBOT value - pre HBOT value) / pre HBOT value * 100.
MRI includes Gadolinium contrast injection which has allergy related issues.</description>
