  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Computed Tomography (CT) scans make detailed pictures of the body in seconds. CT scans make
      pictures by passing x-rays through a person. CT scans are common. In 2011, around 85.3
      million of them occurred in the United States. Researchers think CT images can be made better
      using new techniques. Higher resolution images can be derived from the original scan.

      Objective:

      To learn if new ways of obtaining and processing pictures of the body from a regular CT scan
      can produce images with higher resolution (pixels) and more information than standard
      methods.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who are scheduled to have a CT scan and are not pregnant

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.

      Participants will have their scheduled CT scan.

      The CT scanner used in this study provides enhanced images of inside the body. Researchers
      may use the CT scanner in a research mode to test and improve the pictures.

      Images from the CT scan will be reviewed.

      Any clinical findings from the CT test will be shared with the participant s doctor.

      Participants will continue to receive their medical care from their regular doctor.

      The CT images will be entered into an NIH research database. In the future, they may be used
      for research purposes.

      Computed Tomography (CT) images the body. Different methods of creating CT pictures are
      avilable on a research basis that enables higher resolution imaging using the same
      aquisition. The purpose of this research study is to learn wheteher these new high resolution
      images derived from the original CT scan provide similar or perhaps more information than the
      current standard clinical method.
