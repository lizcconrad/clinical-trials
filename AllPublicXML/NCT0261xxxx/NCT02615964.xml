  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to UIC rheumatology clinic with Raynaud's disorder and scleroderma will
      be asked to participate. 10 hands of patients with both Raynaud's disorder and scleroderma
      will be studied. This research study is being done to better understand Raynaud's disease and
      to assess the role of blood flow measurement in diagnosing the disorder, specifically,
      through data collected by an MRI procedure called NOVA FLOW. NOVA is a blood flow measurement
      software system owned by the study's sponsor, VasSol, Inc.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to obtain volumetric flow data on 10 hands of patients with
      Raynaud's disorder and scleroderma at UIC rheumatology clinic and compare these results with
      previously established volumetric flow data for non-Raynaud's patients. Through this
      analysis, the invstigators will be able to better understand and correlate subjective and
      objective measures of both disease presentation and progression. Collection of cross
      sectional data will allow us to better address the following questions Is it possible to more
      precisely diagnose patients with Raynaud's disorder based on NOVA analysis as well as
      clinical findings

      Is it possible to stratify patients with Raynaud's disorder into categories which may allow:

      i. Prediction of disease course and prognosis ii. Prediction of response to specific
      treatment modalities (vasodilators vs anti-coagulation vs surgical or chemical denervation)
      The investigators propose to collect measurements of disease severity as well as functional
      assessment of patients Raynaud's and scleroderma in order to address the following questions
      c. Does NOVA flow and volume data correlate with measures of Raynaud's and scleroderma
      disease severity index d. Does NOVA flow and volume data correlate with OT assessment of hand
      functionality.

    <description>There will be two visits in the study. Each of those visits will take about one hour.
First visit will consist of: NOVA flow procedure, Medical history, Digital photographic assessments, Nail bed capillaroscopy and questionnaires.
Second visit will occur one month after the first visit and consist of: Follow up for any adverse events due to the study. Review any changes with the hands that received the NOVA procedure. Complete any follow up questionnaires needed for the study.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the diagnosis, and stratification of the severity of Raynaud's disorder in patients with scleroderma based on clinical and imaging data will allow creation of more precise diagnostic criteria as well as disease classification which may guide treatment practices. The study results will likely have no immediate benefit to the patients participating in the study, however may have a future impact diagnosis, stratification and ultimately treatment of patients with Raynaud's disorder. In addition, data collected in this study may provide insight into disease process and leading to future research endeavors.</description>
