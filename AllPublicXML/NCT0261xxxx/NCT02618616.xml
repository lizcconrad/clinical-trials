  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in 129 subjects
      with moderate to severe psoriasis with a PASI score of at least 10. Following run-in,
      subjects were randomized and received either oral 30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily or placebo
      once daily for 12 weeks.

      This was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in 129 subjects
      with moderate to severe psoriasis with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of at
      least 10 and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of 3 (0-4 scale). Following run-in
      subjects received either oral 30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily or placebo once daily for 12
      weeks. Subjects attended the clinic at Baseline (Day 0) when they were reviewed and confirmed
      they met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects were then randomized and received either oral
      30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily or placebo once daily for 12 weeks.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Assessment of Severity Index (PASI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is an assessment routinely used for evaluating and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. PASI divides the body into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities (arms) and lower extremities (legs). Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration and scaling; these symptoms are scored on a 5-point scale from 0-4, where 0 = no symptoms and 4 = very marked. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 75 response represents a reduction of at least 75% from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PASI-50 and PASI-75 responders at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-75 and PASI-50 are defined as a 75% and 50% reduction, respectively, from baseline in PASI score at Week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An overall assessment of the severity of psoriasis was made, by the investigator, using the IGA at each visit. IGA scores take values on a 5-point scale from 0-4, where 0 = clear to 4 = severe disease.
Responder is defined as a score of clear or almost clear, or a reduction of â‰¥2 levels. Success is defined as a score of clear or almost clear. Subjects with discontinued and missing data categories at Week 12 were considered non-responders.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the NRS for pruritus (worst itch) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used to assess the subject's worst itch as a result of psoriasis in the last 12 hours. The subjects completed the NRS each morning on (or soon after) rising and evening prior to retiring to bed. The subjects completed the NRS each morning on (or soon after) rising and evening prior to retiring to bed. They were asked the following question: On a scale of 0 (no itching) to 10 (itching as bad as you can imagine), please rate the worst itching that you felt over the last 12 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) a week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of treatment (Week 12) or early termination visit, the subject was asked to rate their degree of improvement (or worsening) of their psoriasis compared to before the start of treatment with study drug, using a 7-point scale, standardized PGIC.
Since the start of the study (dosing), my overall status is:
Very much improved
Much improved
Minimally improved
No change
Minimally worse
Much worse
Very much worse</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in body surface area (BSA) and percentage change from baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the percentage of a subject's BSA affected by psoriasis was made by best estimates of the investigator at each visit. Hand-size measurement was considered to be the &quot;best estimate&quot; to measure the BSA by the investigators.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the daytime and night time NRS for pruritus (worst itch) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects completed the NRS each morning on (or soon after) rising and evening prior to retiring to bed. They were asked the following question: On a scale of 0 (no itching) to 10 (itching as bad as you can imagine), please rate the worst itching that you felt over the last 12 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the NRS for sleep disturbance at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>In the morning subjects were asked the following question to determine the level of sleep disturbance due to itching: On a scale of 0 (no sleep disturbance) to 10 (awake all night), please rate how much your sleep was disturbed by itch last night.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in total, daytime and night time duration of itching at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked the following question to determine their duration of itching: Over the last 12 hours approximately how many hours, if any, did you itch?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) for pruritus at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to rate their itch over the last 12 hours using a list of adjectives describing different levels of symptom intensity: Over the last 12 hours how would you rate your itch? No itch; Mild; Moderate and Severe;Pruritus was evaluated by the subject, using the eDiary, twice daily for 1 week prior to the start of study treatment (run-in period) and during treatment (baseline to Day 84).</description>
