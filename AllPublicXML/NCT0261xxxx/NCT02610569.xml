  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease progressing through flare-ups. The
      therapeutic objective, which was originally based on clinical remission, is currently
      evolving with the development of biotherapies towards the achievement of endoscopic
      remission. Current recommendations for therapeutic management advocate the achievement of
      endoscopic mucosal healing (EMH), with an observed decrease in the necessity for colectomy in
      the case of EMH. Endoscopic evaluation of the severity of UC is performed during a digestive
      endoscopy (colonoscopy for a complete colonic exploration, or recto-sigmoidoscopy for a
      partial exploration of the colon) from endoscopic activity scores adapted for UC.

      Currently, the score the most commonly used is the MAYO endoscopic score. This is a global
      score of increasing intensity from 0 to 3, taking into account the following basic lesions:
      vascular pattern, granularity or/and friability of the mucosa, spontaneous bleeding, erosion
      and ulceration. However this score has limits: it does not distinguish deep cavitating
      ulcerations with mucous detachment from simple ulcerations which have a better prognosis.

      A new endoscopic score specific for UC has been developed and is currently being validated.
      It is termed Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS). This evaluation takes
      into account the three most reproducible factors - the vascular pattern, the presence of
      bleeding, and erosions or ulcerations including cavitating ulceration - in the total score.

      To ensure optimal patient care and an adaptation of the therapeutic medical care to the
      endoscopic severity of the disease, endoscopic exploration should be performed recurrently.
      However, this exploration is an invasive procedure, requires general anaesthesia for
      colonoscopy, and can lead to potential complications such as perforation. This explains the
      poor acceptance by patients, resulting in a sub-optimal therapeutic support.

      For each patient, the study will be conducted in accordance with the following schedule:

      Information/inclusion visit: D-30 (± 30 days)

        -  Full information about the trial

        -  Verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria

        -  Acquisition of informed consent (either the same day or after a period of reflexion)

        -  Medical and surgical history

        -  Clinical examination

      Endoscopic visit: D0 On two consecutive days or within a maximum of seven days but
      obligatorily before the anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha treatment

        -  Faecal sample (calprotectin)

        -  Clinical examination

        -  Endoscopic examination by PillCamCOLON (C2) then by conventional endoscopy (colonoscopy)

           -The endoscopic examinations will each be analyzed by a different endoscopist working in
           a blinded evaluation. An UC activity score will be calculated depending on two scores:
           MAYO and UCEIS.

        -  Notification of Adverse Event (AE) / Serious Adverse Event (SAE)

      Follow-up visit: W12 (12 weeks ± 5 days after D0)

        -  Faecal sample (calprotectin)

        -  Clinical examination

        -  Endoscopic examination by PillCamCOLON (C2) then by conventional endoscopy (coloscopy)

           -The endoscopic examinations will each be analyzed by a different endoscopist working in
           a blinded evaluation. An UC activity score will be evaluated depending on two scores:
           MAYO and UCEIS.

        -  Notification of AE/SAE

      End-of-study visit (possibly by telephone) W14 (± 5 days)

      *Notification of AE/SAE
