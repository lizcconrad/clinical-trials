  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of induction treatment
      with obinutuzumab, polatuzumab vedotin, and venetoclax in participants with relapsed or
      refractory FL, and with rituximab, polatuzumab vedotin, and venetoclax in participants with
      DLBCL. Participants with FL who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or
      stable disease (SD) at the end of induction therapy will receive post-induction treatment
      with obinutuzumab and venetoclax, and participants with DLBCL who achieve CR or PR at the end
      of induction (EOI) will receive post-induction treatment with rituximab and venetoclax.
