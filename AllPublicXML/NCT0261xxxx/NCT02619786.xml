    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether inhaled colistin is effective in the
      treatment of ventilator associated tracheobronchitis due to gram negative organism
      susceptible to colistin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis due to gram negative organism are
      included to the study.The patients will be received colistin inhalation 75 mg every 12 hours
      at least 5 days.

      The primary objective is to evaluate clinical outcome of inhaled colistin. The secondary
      objectives are microbiological clearance and toxicity of inhaled colistin.

      The sample size was estimated to 62 patients.
