  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel (Efient®-Effient®) and ticagrelor (Brilique®-Brilinta®)
      have shown promising results in the respective TRITON and PLATO trials making of prasugrel
      and ticagrelor recommended first line treatments for acute coronary syndrome ACS (ESC
      Guidelines: Class 1 LOE B). These two drugs showed superiority over clopidogrel in ACS
      patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), by the dramatic diminution of
      stent thrombosis, the reduction in death or Myocardial Infarction (MI) as well as the
      reduction in death in a meta-analysis.

      The field of elective PCI (stable patients) has not been studied with these 2 new drugs and
      clopidogrel remains the standard of care. However, off-label use of prasugrel and ticagrelor
      is increasing in patients undergoing high risk elective PCI (left main, diabetics, multiple
      stenting, high risk of stent thrombosis, no clopidogrel pretreatment…) but is not supported
      by scientific evidence. More than half of PCI patients undergo elective stenting for proven
      ischemia and/or stable angina, a relatively safe procedure with the use of the latest
      generation of stents. However complications remain either frequent when considering
      PCI-related myonecrosis/myocardial injury that have been linked to the prognosis of patients
      or rare but serious when considering stent thrombosis, Q wave MI or stroke, leaving room for
      improvement with these two newest drugs.

      The investigators propose to perform a multicenter international study in stable patients
      undergoing elective PCI with a randomization between clopidogrel and ticagrelor. The
      investigators hypothesize that this study will show superiority of the new P2Y12 inhibitor
      over clopidogrel in elective PCI on the primary ischemic endpoint (peri-procedural MI and
      myocardial injury) without significant excess bleeding (BARC definition).

    <description>Ticagrelor is an oral antiplatelet agent which was approved for use in the European Union by the European Commission on December 3, 2010. The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on July 20, 2011. It is available as round, yellow tablets (90 mg). The standard dose is 90 mg twice a day during the maintenance phase and 180 mg once for the loading dose. It is approved for duration of 12 month in ACS patients and will be used for duration of one month in the ALPHEUS Study.</description>

    <description>Clopidoprel is an oral antiplatelet agent which was approved for use in the European Union by the European Commission in 1997 and available as generic since 2007. The standard dose of clopidogrel is one 75 mg tablet once a day. The dosage for the loading dose is normally 300 mg but 600 mg is also used. Clopidogrel is the standard of care for PCI at the moment.</description>
