    <textblock>
      Fruits and vegetables are an important source of many different phytochemicals that may
      affect health and accurate dietary assessement tools to quantitate dietary intake are
      essential. This study will evaluate the correlation of dietary carotenoid intake estimated
      from two common and one novel food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with estimated carotenoid
      intake from 3 day diet records as well as measured blood and skin concentrations of
      carotenoids. This study will be conducted in healthy adults. These tools may be effective in
      estimating the level of these compounds in an average diet.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the relationship between estimated intakes of dietary carotenoids using three
      different FFQ's and comparing them with estimated carotenoid intake from 3 day diet records
      and blood and skin measurements.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete the Willett FFQ, the Fred Hutchinson FFQ, and the newly developed
      Clinton Carotenoid Assessment Tool (CCAT), in random order over a 3 to 4-month period of time
      with 4-6 weeks between each visit. Prior to each visit, participants also complete a 3-day
      diet record, a daily sun exposure diary, and a 3-day activity record. Blood samples are
      collected for plasma carotenoid assessment and and skin carotenoid content is assessed using
      a resonance Raman spectroscopy.

    <description>After consenting to participate in this study, participants will visit the Clinical Research Center (CRC) on 3 occasions. One of the three FFQ's will be completed at each visit and there will be 4 to 6 weeks between visits. Participants will also complete a blood draw and assessment of skin carotenoids at this CRC visit. Prior to each visit, participants will complete a 3-day diet record, a daily sun exposure diary, and a 3-day activity record.</description>
