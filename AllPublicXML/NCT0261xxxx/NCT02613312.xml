    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and overall survival in patients
      that have been diagnosed with mesothelioma and will undergo chemotherapy, surgery and
      intensity modified radiation therapy (IMRT) as part of their standard of care.

      The investigators will consent patients that have been diagnosed with mesothelioma and will
      undergo chemotherapy followed by surgery and then IMRT as their standard of care. The
      investigators will collect data from past and future medical records as well as data
      regarding their health status for their lifetime by reviewing life status, treatment status
      and CT scans.
