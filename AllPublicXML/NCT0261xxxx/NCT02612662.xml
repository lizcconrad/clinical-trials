         13. Prolonged QTcF &gt; 450 ms or shortened QTcF &lt; 340 ms or family history of long QT
             syndrome

         14. PR(PQ) interval shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there
             is no evidence of ventricular pre-excitation)

         15. PR (PQ) interval prolongation (&gt; 240 ms) intermittent second (Wenckebach block while
             asleep is not exclusive) or third degree AV block, or AV dissociation

         16. Persistent or intermittent complete bundle branch block (BBB), incomplete bundle
             branch block (IBBB), or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) with QRS &gt; 110 ms.
             Subjects with QRS &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 115 ms are acceptable if there is no evidence of, for
             example, ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation

         17. Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the investigator

         18. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the 3 months
             prior to screening

         19. History of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol, as judged by the investigator

         20. Positive screen for drugs of abuse or cotinine (nicotine) at screening or admission to
             the unit or positive screen for alcohol on admission to the unit prior to the
             administration of IMP

         21. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically significant
             allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the investigator or history of hypersensitivity
             to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD4076 tetracosasodium

         22. Excessive intake of caffeine containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea), as judged
             by the investigator

         23. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks
             prior to the administration of IMP

         24. Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medication including antacids, analgesics
             (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of
             20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the two weeks prior to
             the administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long half-life

         25. Plasma donation within one month of screening or any blood donation/blood loss &gt; 500
             mL during the 3 months prior to screening

         26. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) within 3 months of the administration of IMP in this study.
             The period of exclusion begins three months after the final dose or one month after
             the last visit whichever is the longest.

             Note: Subjects consented and screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous
             phase I study, are not excluded.

         27. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order

         28. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca, PAREXEL or study site employee or their close
             relatives

         29. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements

         30. Subjects who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions

         31. Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator

             In addition, any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the
             genetic research:

         32. Previous bone marrow transplant

         33. Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of the date of the
             genetic sample collection
