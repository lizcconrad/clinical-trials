  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is recruiting two groups of women over the age of 18; those who are pregnant and
      who have pre-eclampsia; and those who are pregnant but do not have pre-eclampsia. The aim is
      to test a new method of diagnosing and monitoring pre-eclampsia and thus prevent the
      long-term damage it can cause to the baby's health. Untreated, pre-eclampsia can lead to
      seizures in pregnancy (eclampsia) and may prove fatal for mother and child.

      Currently the only effective treatment for pre-eclampsia is control of the mother's blood
      pressure until it is safe to deliver the baby. The timing of delivery is kept under constant
      review by the medical team, who must balance the risk to the mother of developing eclampsia
      against the risk to the baby of being born too early (premature).

      If pre-eclampsia can be diagnosed early, there is a greater chance of being able to treat it
      effectively. We know that women with pre-eclampsia often have exaggerated reflexes in their
      limbs (hyperreflexia) and that this may be linked to the risk of seizures. Measuring these
      reflexes might therefore be a useful way to diagnose and monitor pre-eclampsia, but doing
      this is not easy, so we want to assess whether measuring other reaction times might similarly
      help assess the risk of seizures. One possibility is by measuring the reaction time as we
      flick our eyes to follow a moving target, using an instrument called a saccadometer, which is
      worn on a head-band, a little like a head-torch.

      By comparing the results between these groups and the non-pregnant women, we will be able to
      see if reaction times from the saccadometer are altered in women with pre-eclampsia, and, if
      so, whether saccadometry might be useful in helping doctors decide the best time for safe
      delivery.

      Prospective feasibility study with two arms; (i) case-control comparisons of saccadic
      reaction time distributions between patients with preterm pre-eclampsia, age- and
      gestation-matched pregnant controls and age-matched female non-pregnant controls
      [cross-sectional analysis]; (ii) intra-individual comparisons of antenatal and postnatal
      saccadic reaction time distributions of patients with preterm pre-eclampsia [longitudinal
      analysis].
