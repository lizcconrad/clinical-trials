      The study objectives are described below:

        1. Obtain matched serum, plasma [(K2 EDTA, Sodium Heparin (NaH), Lithium Heparin (LiH)] and
           urine specimens collected from a minimum of 50 healthy subjects. Specimens will be used
           to determine a reference range for C-peptide and insulin assays, used as an aid in the
           assessment of C-peptide and insulin in adults.

        2. Obtain serum and urine specimens collected from a minimum of an additional 200 healthy
           subjects. Specimens will be used to determine a reference range for C-peptide and
           insulin assays, used as an aid in the assessment of C-peptide and insulin in adults.

        3. To store any remaining specimens for use in future assay development and to evaluate as
           yet undetermined assays for the development of IVDs, including additional C-peptide or
           insulin assays.

      The primary object of this study is to obtain a series of blood and urine specimens from
      women and men who are healthy with no history of abnormal blood sugar levels. The specimens
      will be used to evaluate new C-peptide and insulin assays (tests). Participants are being
      asked to voluntarily take part in this study because they are a healthy individual without a
      history of abnormal blood sugar levels.

        A minimum of 250 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Healthy women and men greater
        than or equal to 18 years of age having donated a single blood draw, a random urine
        specimen, and a 24-hour urine collection specimen will be eligible.

        Each site will evaluate and select patients for enrollment using the inclusion and
        exclusion criteria listed below. Study subjects should be selected from all available
        patients at the site. Each patient may be entered into the study only once.
