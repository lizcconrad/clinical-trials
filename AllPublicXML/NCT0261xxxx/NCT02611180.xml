  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cells (DCs) serve as sentries for the immune system. DCs recognize foreign
      compounds (antigens) in the body, which they internalize and process. When DCs uptake foreign
      antigens, they migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, where the processed antigens are
      presented to T cells.

      Various DC subsets with unique cell lineages, surface protein markers, and tissue
      localization determinants have been identified. For example, Langerhans cells (LCs) and
      interstitial dendritic cells (intDCs) are DCs found in stratified epithelia, such as the
      skin. Though both are expressed in the skin, they differ with respect to their origin and
      surface protein content and can activate distinct types of immune responses. They may also
      have different specificities for the capture of antigens and presentation to circulating T
      cells.

      To date, it is unknown what role, if any, the different DC populations that reside or
      repopulate in the skin play in the development and progression of skin graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) following bone marrow transplant.

    <description>Both GVHD affected and unaffected skin sections will be analyzed by immunostaining and the types of cells and strains of skin microbiota present will be analyzed
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells or other lymphocyte populations will be isolated from peripheral blood by fluorescence activated cell sorting. The DC subsets purified from the skin tissue will be used to stimulate these T cell populations. This will be followed by thorough characterization of the charged T cell populations by a variety of methods. These will include assays to measure proliferation, gene array analysis cytokine secretion and other functions of the charged T cells.</description>

    <description>When clinically indicated, patients will undergo a skin biopsy to confirm a suspected diagnosis of acute or chronic GVHD, or to assess the status of their previously diagnosed acute or chronic GVHD. After the necessary samples are obtained for optimal medical care of the patient, two 6 mm punch biopsies (or four 4 mm punch biopsies) will be performed for research purposes, one (or two) of the affected area and one (or two) of a non-affected area (normal skin).
Patients who have clinical resolution of their acute or chronic GVHD will undergo one additional 6 mm punch biopsy (or two additional 4 mm punch biopsies) of the previously affected area. This additional biopsy should occur within 10 cm of the previous affected area sample.
With each skin biopsy, peripheral blood will be obtained by venipuncture or cannulation of an indwelling venous access device.</description>
