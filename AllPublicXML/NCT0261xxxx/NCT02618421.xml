      The research question for this study pertains to assessing prevalence and symptom specific
      bother of LUTS and its impact on HRQL, work productivity, mental and sexual health across

      The research is a cross sectional population-representative internet survey among general
      population of males and females aged 40 years or older. The research would be an
      internet-based self-administration survey across China, Taiwan and South Korea.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of lower urinary tract

        -  To explore the differences in prevalence of LUTS across males and females, across age
           groups, across different socioeconomic strata and across China, Taiwan and South Korea

        -  To examine the extent of overlap of voiding and storage symptoms among the study
