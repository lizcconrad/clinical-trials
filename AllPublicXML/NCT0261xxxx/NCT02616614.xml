      This is a randomized, double blind, three-arm, parallel group, placebo control bioequivalence
      study with clinical endpoint, at multiple study sites, designed to establish bioequivalence
      of clindamycin 1.2% and benzoyl peroxide 3.75% gel of Actavis and Onexton® (clindamycin 1.2%
      and benzoyl peroxide 3.75%) gel in the treatment of subjects with Acne Vulgaris.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a generic of clindamycin 1.2% and
      benzoyl peroxide 3.75% gel to Onexton® in the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris.
