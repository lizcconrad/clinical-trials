    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether an early metabolic response, measured by PET/CT
      scan after the first cycle of chemotherapy, is able to predict which patients with advanced
      CRC have a better prognosis.

          -  patients eligible for standard first-line treatment medical therapy (chemotherapy, and
             when indicated in association with EGFR inhibitor and/or antiangiogenic) for advanced
             disease, at diagnosis or after primary surgery.

          -  At least one target or non-target lesion according to RECIST revised version 1.1.
