    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of the combined exercise training (aerobic more resistance)
      and of the aerobic exercise training isolated compared to control group, which performed only
      stretching and relaxation, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The two exercise
      interventions and the control procedure are performed in aquatic environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fact that aquatic training can provide similar benefits to land training has important
      clinical implications, because the aquatic environment provides some interesting advantages
      to this population, such as no impact on walking and running in deep water or reduced, as in
      water-based exercises. This minor impact and consequent reduced chance of injury allows
      consider the aquatic environment favorable to the principle of continuity with progression of
      physiological stimuli and metabolic benefits.

      From these peculiarities of the training in aquatic environment, and of the association
      between T2DM with obesity and hypertension, conditions that create difficulties for
      individuals performing exercise supporting their own body mass and need both benefits from
      aerobic and resistance training, is believed to be necessary to carry out physical training
      programs of the same duration, differing in training mode (aerobic or combined) in the
      aquatic environment in order to answer of in a adequated duration of training, the diabetes
      control through training differs between the different mode of exercise.
