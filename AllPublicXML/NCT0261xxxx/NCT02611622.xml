  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction is an important metric currently used to rate quality of healthcare in
      hospitals. Maximizing patient satisfaction scores is therefore significantly beneficial to
      any hospital establishment. Recent studies have shown patient satisfaction depends on
      multiple factors, including patient involvement in treatment decision-making processes and
      patients' knowledge of treatment options. Internal review of departmental patient
      satisfaction survey scores revealed deficits in the aforementioned areas of patient
      satisfaction, with the domains of &quot;how well concerns were addressed&quot;, &quot;explanation of tests
      and procedures&quot; and &quot;effort to include patients in decisions&quot; having the lowest scores on
      patient satisfaction surveys. This highlights the gap in patient satisfaction that the
      Otolaryngology department seeks to improve on, so as to maximize patient satisfaction, and in
      turn, the quality of healthcare provided.

      The aim of this study is to assess the improvement in patient satisfaction scores that can be
      obtained by incorporating LUMA ENT™, a disease-specific multimedia patient education
      software, into the treatment decisions for thyroid disorders. LUMA ENT™ is a leading patient
      education software that provides visual anatomic animations of disease processes, disease
      progression and treatment options to improve patients' knowledge. Thyroid disorders have been
      chosen for study due to their high frequency of occurrence in the patient population and
      generalizability to a wide medical audience.

      The investigators will perform a single-blinded randomized-controlled study of patients
      visiting the physician practices of the Department of Otolaryngology for management of
      thyroid disorders. Participants will be randomized into control and intervention groups. Upon
      completion of the routine physician-patient clinical encounter, the intervention group will
      view a 5- minute LUMA ENT™ video discussing their specific thyroid condition, its natural
      progression history, and treatment options. They will have an opportunity to ask the
      physician any further questions that arise from viewing the video. The control group will not
      view the LUMA ENT video. Patient satisfaction surveys will then be provided to both groups at
      the end of the visit as is routinely done and scores subsequently compared.

    <description>Participants will be presented with envelopes labeled with a unique block-randomization code and asked to pick one
Once the participant selects an envelope, the research coordinator will verify whether the code assigns the patient to the control or the intervention group, without the knowledge of the otolaryngologist who will be blinded to participant randomization at this point.
Participants in the control group will proceed to filling out Demographic Survey and Patient Satisfaction Survey
Once completed, they will be given the opportunity to discuss any further questions or concerns about their thyroid condition with their otolaryngologist</description>

Once the participant selects an envelope, the research coordinator will verify whether the code assigns the patient to the control or the intervention group, without the knowledge of the otolaryngologist who will be blinded to participant randomization at this point.
Participants in the intervention group will proceed to viewing the LUMA ENT™ videos pertinent to their thyroid condition using either of the two iPADS (the videos should not last longer than 10 minutes)
Once video viewing is complete, participants will be given the opportunity to discuss any further questions or concerns about their thyroid condition with their otolaryngologist, especially as relates to questions that arise as a result of viewing the video
Subsequently, the participants will proceed to filling out Demographic Survey and Patient Satisfaction Survey</description>
