  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millennium has developed TAK-228, which is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable
      adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred
      to as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). TAK-228 (formerly INK128 or MLN0128)
      targets 2 distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. TAK-228 selectively and
      potently inhibits mTOR kinase (IC50 = 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents
      cellular proliferation.

      The mTOR complex (mTORC) is an important therapeutic target that is generally stable (i.e.,
      low tendency to mutate) and is a key intracellular point of convergence for a number of
      cellular signaling pathways. Inhibiting mTOR may inhibit abnormal cell proliferation, tumor
      angiogenesis, and abnormal cellular metabolism, thus providing the rationale for mTOR
      inhibitors as potential agents in the treatment of a number of indications including solid
      tumor and hematological malignancies, as either monotherapy or in combination with other
      chemotherapeutic agents. Like rapamycin, several newly approved rapalogs (temsirolimus and
      everolimus) are specific and allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, and only partially inhibit
      mTORC1 signaling pathways. They do not directly inhibit mTORC2, which has shown to be an
      emerging target in cancer research. TAK-228 was developed to address the incomplete
      inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapalogs.

      Eligible subjects will have a research biopsy and baseline blood and urine studies done
      within two weeks prior to start of study treatment. Subjects will then be treated with
      TAK-228 for 10 days, and a repeat biopsy and pharmacokinetics will be done on day 11.

      The subject will then be treated with the combination of TAK-228 and letrozole for an
      additional 110 days, before undergoing resection of the primary tumor. Subjects will be
      treated at the recommended Phase II dose of TAK-228 of 3 mg once daily, and a dose
      deescalation to 2 mg daily will be performed if dose-limiting toxicity is seen in 1/3 or more
      of the subjects at the first dose level. The maximum tolerated dose cohort will be expanded
      to include six to ten subjects.
