  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical aspects of patients with BPPV associated
      with migraine. It is our purpose to clarify weather migraine is a risk factor for BPPV if the
      clinical aspect and the therapeutic outcome is different.

      Two hundred and sixty-three patients with BPPV were enrolled in this retrospective study. All
      patients' charts were reviewed by independent observer. The type of BPPV and associated
      problems were noted. Patients with migraine were investigated in terms of age, gender,
      symptoms, affected side and the cure rate. Their data were compared with those having no
      migraine. Mean values and standard deviations (Â± SD) were calculated. One way ANOVA test was
      used for the analysis. Significance was set at p &lt; 0.005.

    <description>Every patient with BPPV who had positional nystagmus during Dix-Hallpike and head-roll provocative maneuvers will be treated with Epley or barbeque particle re-positioning maneuvers. Balance (positional nystagmus) of patients 7 days after re-positioning maneuvers will be assessed.</description>

    <description>Two hundred and sixty-three patients with BPPV (2009-2014), confirmed by videonystagmography (VNG), were enrolled in the study. Patients' charts were reviewed. They were grouped as those with or without migraine. Distribution of gender, age, duration of symptoms and affected side were reviewed. Two hundred and thirty-one patients with no migraine were identified.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>BPPV with migraine</arm_group_label>
    <description>Thirty-two patients (11.4%) with migraine were identified. Diagnosis and classification of migraine and its differentiation from other type of headaches was based on third edition of International classification of headache disorders (ICHD-III beta) by international headache society (IHS). All patients with migraine had migrainous headache with or without aura and they all were diagnosed in our institution and followed by our neurology staff.</description>

    <description>Patients with posterior canal BPPV (PC-BPPV) were treated with Epley maneuver. Patients with superior canal (SC-BPPV) were treated with Li or reverse Epley maneuver. Patients with lateral canal (LC) apogeotropic or geotropic nystagmus were treated with Barbeque, Semont's or Gufoni maneuvers. If geotropic or ageotropic type nystagmus is equal intensity on both sides. The involved side was determined according to the patient sense of disturbance or lying down positioning test. If the patient has involvement of both sides according to Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Therapeutic maneuver was applied to the more severe side. All patients were re-evaluated at maximum 7 days.</description>
