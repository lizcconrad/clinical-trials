  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pump therapy is gaining popularity as a treatment mode for patients with type 1 diabetes.
      Utilizing pump therapy requires the development and application of a new spectrum of
      theoretical knowledge and practical skills by the patient. Furthermore, occasionally there is
      a need to tailor the pump settings, i.e. the insulin correction factor, carbohydrate ratio,
      basal plan and insulin activity time, in order to optimize and improve glucose control. These
      adjustments are based on collected information including insulin delivery, blood glucose
      measurements, continuous glucose monitoring data, meals and so on. Analyzing this multitude
      of information and data is overwhelming for many of the patients, caregivers and health care
      providers. Unfortunately, not all physicians have the needed expertise to fully fulfill this
      task, and for those who do, it is time consuming. Thus, a summary of the data with insulin
      dose adjustment suggestions is missing. An automated tool for pump setting adjustments will
      improve glycemic control without escalating the burden on patients and the health care
      system. Such advisor can assist the professional team during routine follow-up and the
      patients between visits.

      To address this challenge, the investigators developed the MD-Logic Pump Advisor (MDPA),
      which automatically analyses treatment information, learns patient's needs and accordingly
      suggests adjustments in insulin dosing. The MDPA uses information gathered from glucose
      monitoring, insulin dosing and meal data during daily routine home care. Following a 5 minute
      data collection and analysis, the algorithm learns and suggests pump-setting changes for
      optimization of glucose control.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Advisor Pro. The study will
      include three segments:

      Segment A - a randomized controlled parallel study, Segment B- a clinic prospective study
      during which the Advisor Pro will be evaluated during routine clinical visits as an added
      tool for physicians and Segment C- a clinical prospective parallel study for patients treated
      with pump therapy and SMBG only.
