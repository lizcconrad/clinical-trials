      The present study was designed to explore the effectiveness of PRF combined with 1.2% ATV gel
      in treatment of mandibular degree II furcation defects in comparison to PRF and open flap
      debridement (OFD) alone.

      Background: A variety of regenerative materials have been tried since many years for the
      treatment of furcation defects. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), a pool reservoir of platelet
      concentrate with growth factors and Atorvastatin (ATV), a potent member of statin group are
      known to promote periodontal tissue regeneration. The aim of the present study is to explore
      the effectiveness of PRF combined with 1.2% ATV gel in treatment of mandibular degree II
      furcation defects in comparison to PRF and open flap debridement (OFD) alone.

      Methods: Eighty two mandibular furcation defects were treated with either OFD alone (Group
      1), OFD with PRF (Group 2), and OFD with PRF+1.2% ATV gel (Group 3).Clinical parameters like
      probing depth (PD), relative vertical clinical attachment level (RVCAL), relative horizontal
      clinical attachment level (RHCAL), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI) and site specific
      plaque index (PI) were recorded at baseline and 9 months post-operatively. The radiological
      assessment of bone defect fill was done at baseline and 9 months, using computer-aided
      software.
