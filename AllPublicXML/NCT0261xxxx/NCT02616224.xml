      This observational disease registry is a prospective, national, non-interventional study
      designed to enroll participants who have received an initial diagnosis of unresectable,
      locally advanced (LA) or metastatic breast cancer (mBC), up to 6 months prior to registry
      enrolment. These participants will be prospectively followed for at least 5 years after study
      enrolment to evaluate their anti-cancer treatments. Data on participants' previous
      anti-cancer treatments for breast cancer will be collected retrospectively at study entry.
