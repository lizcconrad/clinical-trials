  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies show that many Type 1 diabetes patients have remaining endogenous insulin
      production, albeit at low levels. Finding means to increase this production would be of
      tremendous interest, since residual C-peptide concentrations &gt;0.1 nmol/l previously have been
      shown to markedly lower HbA1c, decrease blood glucose fluctuations and diminish the risk of
      ketoacidosis. It also substantially reduces the risks of severe hypoglycemic events and late
      complications. Liraglutide may through its incretin effect directly potentiate beta-cell
      function, but also holds the potential to be mitogenic for these cells.

      The hypothesis of the present trial is that treatment with liraglutide will not only have a
      direct effect on beta-cell function, which is more or less immediately observed, but also
      progressively improve C-peptide concentrations over time.
