      Before 2007, the disability evaluation was based on the medical model in Taiwan. According to
      the People with Disabilities Rights Protection Act announced on 11 July 2007, the assessment
      of a person's eligibility for disability benefits has to be determined as suffering one of
      eight malfunction categories based on the International Classification of Functioning,
      Disability, and Health (ICF) framework. People with disabilities want to issue a disability
      identification and other welfare &amp; services need processes of evaluation &amp; assessment based
      on the ICF framework for the evaluation report and result of living need by the committee
      composed of professionals from medicine, social work, special education and employment
      counseling and evaluation.

      In this year, investigators planed the project with the Taiwan Society of ICF to develop the
      evaluation form. The experts from various disciplines of the ICF Office convened internal
      integration meetings to reach a consensus for developed the ICF evaluation form, add the code
      of pain and sleep and the items from Short-Form 12 for quality of life to the questionnaire.
      The results were used to analysis other relevant factors affecting the disability evaluation.
      And then add the core set from World Health Organization to both physical and mental
      disorders linked coding group, compared the new disability evaluation system and evaluate the
      living need of people with disability to provide suggestion for core set.
