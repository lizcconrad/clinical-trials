    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, oral single dosing, two-way crossover clinical trial
      to evaluate the effects of food on the bioavailability of CKD-397 after a single oral dose in
      healthy male subjects

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To healthy male subjects of sixteen(16), following treatments are administered dosing in each
      period and wash-out period is a minimum of 10 days.

      Treatment A: CKD-397 1T under Fasting condition Treatment B: CKD-397 1T under Fed condition
      (high fat meals). Pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected up to 72hrs. Safety and
      pharmacokinetic are assessed.
