      The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical performance of two highly
      viscous encapsulated GICs (EquiaFil and Riva SC) covered with two different coatings (Equia
      Coat and Fuji Varnish) over 6-year using modified United State Public Health Service (USPHS)
      criteria.

      A total of 256 restorations were made with EquiaFil and Riva SC. Equia Coat or Fuji Varnish
      was used randomly on the surface of the restorations. The restorations were evaluated at
      baseline, 6, 12, 18 months and 6 years after placement using modified USPHS criteria. The
      results were evaluated with Pearson Chi-Square and Mann Whitney U-test (p&lt; 0.05).

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical performance of two highly
      viscous encapsulated GICs (EquiaFil and Riva SC) covered with two different coatings (Equia
      Coat and Fuji Varnish) over 6-year using modified United State Public Health Service (USPHS)
      criteria.

      Fifty-four patients having Class I and II restorations/caries were included in the study. A
      total of 256 restorations were made with EquiaFil (GC Corp, Japan) and Riva SC (SDI,
      Australia). Equia Coat or Fuji Varnish was used randomly on the surface of the restorations.
      After cavity preparations, the teeth were randomly restored with one glass ionomer cement and
      coated with Equia Coat or Fuji Varnish. The restorations were evaluated at baseline, 6, 12,
      18 months and 6 years after placement using modified USPHS criteria. Two evaluators checked
      color-match, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, caries formation, anatomical form,
      postoperative sensitivity and retention rate and photographs were taken at each recalls. The
      results were evaluated with Pearson Chi-Square and Mann Whitney U-test (p&lt; 0.05).

      The 18-month results were presented at the CED IADR congress iheld in Barcelona in 2010
      (Turkun LS, &amp; Kanic O ,Clinical evaluation of new glass ionomer coating combined systems for
      18-months Journal of Dental Research 89 (Special Issue B) Abstract #402.) Gurgan S et al.
      also mentioned our 18-month results in their published manuscript ( Gurgan S,Kutuk ZB, Ergin
      E, Oztas ZZ &amp; Cakir FY (2015) Four-year randomized clinical trial to evaluate the clinical
      performance of a glass ionomer restorative system Operative Dentistry 40(2) 134-143).

    <measure>Evaluating differently coated glass ionomer cements on posterior teeth with United State Public Health Service criteria regarding marginal adaptation by 2 independent evaluators</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal adaptation was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C and D score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1: Harmonious outline Alpha 2: Marginal gap (max 100µ) with discoloration (removable) Bravo: Marginal gap (&gt; 100µ) with discoloration (unremovable) Charlie: The restoration is fractured or missed</description>

    <measure>Evaluating differently coated glass ionomer cements on posterior teeth with United State Public Health Service criteria regarding marginal discolouration by 2 independent evaluators</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal discolouration was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha: No discoloration anywhere along the margin between the restoration and the adjacent tooth.
Bravo: Slight discoloration along the margin between the restoration and the adjacent tooth.
Charlie: The discoloration penetrated along the margin of the restorative material in a pulpal direction.</description>

    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Retention rate was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C and D score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1:Clinically excellent Alpha 2: Clinically good with slight deviations from ideal performance, correction possible without damage of tooth or restoration Bravo: Clinically sufficient with few defects, corrections or repair of the restoration possible Charlie: Restoration is partially missed Delta: Restoration is totally missed</description>

    <measure>Evaluating differently coated glass ionomer cements on posterior teeth with United State Public Health Service criteria regarding anatomic form by 2 independent evaluators</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Anatomic form was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha 1: Continuous with existing anatomical form Alpha 2: Slightly discontinuous due to some chipping on the proximal ridge Bravo: Discontinuous with existing anatomical form due to material loss but proximal contact still present Charlie: Proximal contact is lost with ridge fracture</description>

    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Colour changes was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed . A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced. Alpha: The restoration matches the adjacent tooth structure in color and translucency.
Bravo: Light mismatch in color, shade or translucency between the restoration and the adjacent tooth.
Charlie: The mismatch in color and translucency is outside the acceptable range of tooth color and translucency.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of resin coating on the performance of glass ionomer cements according to the United State Public Health Service criteria regarding marginal adaptation, marginal discolouration, retention rate, and colour changes by 2 independent evaluators</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of different coatings on the clinical performance of the different glass ionomers tested was evaluated with United State Public Health Service criteria at baseline, 6-12-18 months and 6-years. For the evaluation 2 independent evaluators using dental problem and mirrors evaluated the resin coatings according to their retention, marginal adaptation, marginal discolouration, and colour match. There were 4 evaluation scores. Alpha meaning a perfect resin coating, Bravo meaning a coating partially effective but still clinically acceptable and Charlie and Delta meaning that the coating was partially to totally missed.</description>
