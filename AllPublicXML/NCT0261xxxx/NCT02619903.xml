      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and gastric ulcer both get infected via or from
      the oropharyngeal tissues and have antibiotics in their treatment regimen of both diseases.
      This proposal suggests that the oral microbiome, in particularly dental plaque, is a
      plausible source of reinfection of COPD and gastric ulcer.

      Subjects with COPD or gastric ulcer are randomized to an adjunctive dental cleaning or no
      dental treatment. Both groups undergo the regular treatment for their respective diseases.
      Both groups have a full dental examination and have salivary microbiota as well as dental
      plaque harvested.

      The primary outcome variables is COPD exacerbations and new gastric ulcer event, and the
      secondary outcome variable re-colonization of the stomach and lung.

      Given that the study shows that additional dental cleaning does have an impact on reinfection
      of gastric ulcer and COPD it implies that dental cleaning should be subsidized when treating
      these diseases. This would have a significant impact on restricting antibiotic resistance as
      both H. pylori infections and COPD are treated with antibiotics. Both diseases also cause
      personal suffering and consequently disables the person to work, which causes financial
      consequences, and of course healthcare expenses.

    <textblock>
      Recurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations and Helicobacter pylori
      infected gastric ulcers cause pain and discomfort, healthcare resources and an increased
      usage of antibiotics. COPD and gastric ulcer have two things in common - (i) they are
      infected via or from the oropharyngeal tissues and (ii) antibiotics is included in the
      treatment regimen of both diseases. This proposal suggests that the oral microbiome, in
      particularly dental plaque, is a plausible source of reinfection of COPD and gastric ulcer.
      The rational is that the concentration of antibiotic needed for inhibiting the growth of
      bacteria within a dental biofilm is estimated to be 250 times greater than for planktonically
      growing bacteria, hence the antibiotics used for eradicating the disease leaves behind
      opportunistic pathogens in the dental plaque that are able to re-infect the stomach and
      lungs. There are smaller studies (n ≈ 20) indicating that adding advanced dental cleaning to
      the established respective treatment regimens for COPD and gastric ulcer lower the risk of
      reinfection and recurrence of both H. pylori infections as well as COPD, but larger
      conclusive randomized studies are needed.

      Aim The overall aim of this project is to investigate if the treatment of H. pylori
      infections and lung exacerbations can be optimized by adding advanced dental cleaning to the
      established antibiotic treatment regime and thereby eliminate a source of reinfections.

      A. To investigate if the adding of advanced dental cleaning to H. pylori eradication can
      lower the risk of gastric H. pylori recolonization, reinfection and affect gastric symptoms.

      - To analyze if adding of advanced dental cleaning to H. pylori eradication generates a
      different oral microbiota compared to only established eradication treatment.

      B. To investigate if adding of advanced dental cleaning to COPD exacerbation treatment can
      lower the number of exacerbations the coming 6, 12 and 24 months.

      - To analyze if adding of advanced dental cleaning to COPD treatment regime generates a
      different oral microbiota compared to only COPD exacerbation treatment.

      A. Project description H. pylori project At the Department of Gastroenterology The H. pylori
      project will be conducted in Örebro and Malmö. In Örebro in collaboration with Jonas
      Halfvarsson and Lakis Vravossinos at the Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital
      of Örebro, and the dental specialist clinic of Örebro. In Malmö in collaboration with Ervin
      Toth at the Department of Gastroenterology at Skane University hospital and Folktandvarden
      Skane dental clinic at the Skane university hospital (sjukhustandvarden). Both patients with
      gastric as well as duodenal ulcer have two biopsies taken from the diseased site to test for
      presence of (i) H. pylori using Campylobacter-like organism test (CLO-test) and (ii)
      clarithromycin resistance. Any patient that is generally healthy, has gastric ulcer (gastric
      or duodenal) and has a H. pylori test will be asked to participate in this study by a nurse
      in the clinic. If they agree to participate, a consent form is filled out. The patient is
      handed a saliva collection tube from DNA GenoTek, which they are asked to spit into before
      they start their medication for eradication and they are also asked to bring the saliva tube
      with them when they come to the dental office.

      The information brochure the recruited subject is handed includes a phone number to the
      dental office to allow them to make an appointment. However, by the end of the day the nurse
      at the Endoscopy Department informs the dental clinic of the patients that have signed a
      consent that day.

      COPD project At the lung clinic The COPD project will be conducted at Region Skane lung
      clinic and in collaboration with the COPD clinic in Ystad (both Region Skane in collaboration
      with Dr. Hanan Tanash) and at Folktandvarden Skane in two corresponding dental clinics, one
      in Ystad and one in Malmö by experienced dental hygienists. In Örebro the subjects will be
      recruited from the lung clinic in collaboration with Dr. Josefin Sundh and the dental
      cleaning will be performed at the dental specialist clinic, folktandvarden Örebro. When a
      patient contacts the COPD team due to COPD exacerbation and is classified as having moderate
      or severe COPD (Gold stage II or IV) they will be informed about the current study by a
      nurse. The patient will be asked to sign a consent and handed the written information
      including the number to the dental clinic. The patient is also handed a GenoTek tube for
      saliva collection that they are informed to spit into before they start their medication and
      bring to the dental clinic. Subjects that agree to participate in the study are also given an
      appointment to a physiotherapist for sputum mobilization which is collected in an
      Omnigene-SPUTUM tube for DNA GenoTek.

      H. pylori project and COPD project intervention At the dental clinic The dental clinic
      receives a phone call from the person who just signed a consent; alternatively, a nurse at
      the dental clinic calls the patient. At the dental clinic the patient is randomized to,
      either the advanced dental cleaning group, or the no dental treatment group by the dentist at
      the dental clinic. When the patient comes to the dental visit, both groups undergo a
      periodontal examination and microbiological sampling.

      Questionnaire - Upon arriving at the dental clinic, the participant is asked to fill out a
      questionnaire that includes medical history and validated questions on
      gastrointestinaldisease [13].

      The microbiological sampling is done by collecting the GenoTek tube that the subject has spit
      into before starting the medication, as well as by sampling the dental plaque samples.

      Periodontal examination is performed on 6 sites per tooth including the third molar.
      Periodontal pockets ≥ 4mm are registered as well as bleeding upon probing, plaque index and
      attachment loss.

      Intervention - The oral biofilm will be disrupted and removed on the sub- as well as
      supragingival surfaces of the teeth. Supragingival surfaces will be cleaned using the
      prophylactic paste RDA 250 supplemented with curettes and ultrasonic debridement. Subgingival
      surfaces will be cleaned using curettes and ultrasonic debridement when indicated based on
      the periodontal examination. The tongue will be cleaned using a tongue scraper. Finally, the
      patient will be asked to rinse 10 ml of 2 mg/ml chlorhexidine mouth rinse for one minute.

      Follow up H. pylori project The subjects will be followed up after 12 months. The subject
      visit the dental clinic for new microbiological sampling (saliva sample and index teeth
      plaque) as well as an UTB test to check for recolonization. The subjects will also be handed
      a fecal sampling tube and an envelope for H. pylori antibody test. The participants will also
      be asked to fill out a questionnaire, including any changes in general health, usage of
      antibiotics for any other reason and a validated form for evaluating gastrointestinal
      symptoms [13] and note if there have been any recurrences of gastric ulcers. If we are not
      able recruit a specific person for the 12 month follow-up we will check the medical records
      for recurrence of gastric ulcers.

      Follow up COPD project After 12 months the participants are called up and asked how many
      exacerbations that needed medical attention they have had since they joined the study, his is
      double checked in their medical records. They are also asked they have taken antibiotics for
      any other reason or changed their medications in any way. They are given an appointment to
      the COPD team for sputum mobilization and collection of saliva using DNA GenoTek's tubes.

      Microbiological analysis The subsequent microbiological analysis will be executed using deep
      sequencing, as well as qPCR.

      Time schedule 2016-2017 - Participants are recruited, randomized and the treatment group is
      treated. 2017-2018 - Participants are followed up. 2018-2019 - Data analysis and publication.

      disease in 2009 and 2010 at Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. Became a specialist in
      periodontics in 2014 and currently positioned at Malmö University and Region Skane, Lund. Dr.
      Jönsson will start a part time position in Örebro in 2016.

      Folktandvarden Skane - two dental hygienists have been recruited for the project.

      Folktandvarden Örebro - a post-graduate student is being recruited for the dental cleaning as
      well as managing the logistics of the project. Daniel Jönsson will be the supervisor of the
      student.

      Power analysis The COPD study superiority power analysis is based on the pilot study of
      Kucukoskun et al. [3] . Based on their data we have 80% power to detect a difference of 1.3
      exacerbations per year in a sample of 105 subjects in each group with a p-value of &lt;0.05.

      For the H. pylori study the power analysis is binary as the subjects either get re-infected
      or have a relapse of their symptoms or not. Because the pilot study by Zaric et al [2] was
      conducted in Serbia where clarithromycin resistance is much more common, and consequently
      successful eradication is less frequent than in Sweden, we cannot base the current study on
      their results. Therefore, a proper power analysis will be generated when the first 50
      subjects (25 vs 25) have been recruited.

      Significance Given that the study shows that additional dental cleaning does have an impact
      on reinfection of gastric ulcer and COPD it implies that dental cleaning should be subsidized
      when treating these diseases. This would have a significant impact on restricting antibiotic
      resistance as both H. pylori infections and COPD are treated with antibiotics. Both diseases
      also cause personal suffering and consequently disables the person to work, which causes
      financial consequences, and of course healthcare expenses.
