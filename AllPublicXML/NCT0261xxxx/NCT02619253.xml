      Primary objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with
      vorinostat in patients with advanced renal or urothelial cell carcinoma in order to select
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      Secondary objectives: (1) To evaluate the overall safety profile of pembrolizumab in
      combination with vorinostat; (2) To assess the anti-tumor activity (i.e. objective response
      rate, progression-free survival) of pembrolizumab in combination with vorinostat in patients
      with advanced renal or urothelial cell carcinoma; (3) To characterize PD-L1/2, immune cell
      subsets, and miRs in tumor and/or blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib, open-label, safety, and pharmacodynamics study of pembrolizumab in
      combination with vorinostat in patients with advanced renal or urothelial cell carcinoma.
      This clinical study will be composed of a Dose Finding Phase and an Expansion Phase. The Dose
      Finding Phase will estimate the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) in patients with advanced
      renal and urothelial cell carcinoma patients. The Dose Finding Phase will lead to the
      identification of an Expansion Test Dose for pembrolizumab in combination with vorinostat.
      The Expansion Test Dose will be the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) (i.e. the highest tested
      dose that is declared safe and tolerable by the Investigators and Sponsor). Patients will be
      treated with oral vorinostat every day for 14 days, and with pembrolizumab at the fixed dose
      of 200 mg IV. Each cycle is every 21 days. Two dose levels of vorinostat will be tested in
      2-patient cohorts according to the 3 + 3 standard design (100 mg and 200 mg). 200 mg dose
      represents 50% of the recommended vorinostat dose as single agent.

      For the Dose Finding Phase (Combination Phase), the starting dose level of vorinostat will be
      100 mg by mouth (PO) every day for 14 days, with 7 days break. The first dose level will have
      a minimum of 3 patients treated (unless the first 2 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) before the 3rd patient is enrolled).

      Once the RP2D is identified, the Dose Expansion Phase will be opened. During the Dose
      Expansion Phase, the study will have a run-in phase with sequential single-agents and then
      the combination phase. The reason for the run-in phase during dose expansion is to obtain
      data on the immunomodulatory effects of vorinostat separately from pembrolizumab. Thirty
      patients with prior treatments will be enrolled in two expansion cohorts: 15 anti-PD1 naive
      patients and 15 anti-PD1 resistant patients (defined as patients with transient clinical
      response or without clinical response to prior immune-checkpoint inhibition).

         11. Subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus must have HgbA1c level of _&lt;7% upon study
             entry.

        Subject Exclusion Criteria

        The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          3. Has active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          4. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          5. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e. ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due
             to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e. ≤ Grade 1 or at

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         10. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

         11. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         15. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent (only
             Cohort A).

         16. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         17. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.
