  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU system is expected to be effective in reducing pain intensity
      and/or reducing analgesic use in patients with painful uncomplicated bone metastases. No
      serious adverse effects are expected to result from this treatment.

      The objective of this study is to determine if MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound
      (MR-HIFU) is an effective technique for alleviating the pain associated with bone metastases
      in paediatric cancer patients. This technique meant to be an adjunct therapy to the
      standard-of-care, which includes radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Safety of the technique
      will be assessed through evaluating non-targeted heating using MRI-based temperature mapping,
      and inspecting patients post-treatment for skin burns. or other signs of serious adverse
      events. Efficacy of the technique will be assessed by evaluating/recording patients observed
      pain, quality of life, and pain medication usage both before and up to 3 months following
      treatment.
