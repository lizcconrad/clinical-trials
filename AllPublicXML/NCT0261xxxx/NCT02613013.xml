  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-centre randomized controlled clinical trial to explore whether laser peripheral
      iridoplasty (LPIP) plus laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is more effective than single LPI to
      control the progression of primary angle closure with multi-mechanism based on the UBM
      classification.

    <description>LPI was performed with a VISULAS diode laser of 532 nm (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). 30 minutes prior to the procedure, a drop of 2% pilocarpine will be instilled into the eye every 15 minutes, Topical anaesthesia will be administered. The treatment site was selected in the superior nasal iris or in a crypt, where present. Treatment was initiated with a pulse of 3-5mJ, the power was increased until patency was achieved, the opening of iris &gt;0.1mm. and patency was determined by direct visualization of the posterior chamber.</description>

    <description>LPIP was applied with a VISULAS diode laser of 532 nm (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). 30 minutes prior to the procedure, a drop of 2% pilocarpine will be instilled into the eye every 15 minutes, Topical anaesthesia will be administered. Twenty to 30 spots of 250-300 mW power with 300-500 microns of size and duration of 400-500 ms were applied. Power was modified arbitrarily until an effective iris contraction was obtained. Effective iris contraction was considered as a concentric movement around the laser spot, with minimal iris pigmentation and immediate angle opening observed through the lens mirrors using a Goldmann lens. Power was lowered if there was any bursting sound perceived, pigment dispersion, air bubbles or considerable pain. LPI was performed after LPIP procedure</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of primary angle closure (PAC), with IOP≤30mmHg and PAS≤270°.

          2. PAC with multi-mechanism based on UBM examination (multi-mechanism is defined as
             primary angle closure is caused by pupil block plus at least one kind of non-pupil
             block factors like (relative anterior position and thick of the ciliary body, the big
             volume of the iris, the anterior location of the iris insertion into the ciliary
             body)or any two or more kinds of combination.
