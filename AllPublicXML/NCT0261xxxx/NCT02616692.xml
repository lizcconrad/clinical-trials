      This non-interventional cross-sectional online survey will evaluate preferences among
      patients with self-reported HCC. The survey will ask patients to express their preferences
      regarding descriptions of HCC treatments, which will include sorafenib (which will be
      described as 'oral anti-cancer therapy'), repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE),
      and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). Please note that all interventions that
      patients may have received before completing this online survey were given regardless of
      their participation in this survey. Questions also include asking patients to rank various
      treatment characteristics (e.g., mechanism of action, risk of adverse effects, etc.) relative
      to each other. The ultimate goal is to better understand patient perceptions of these
      treatments and to provide evidence to help in patients' and physicians' treatment
      decision-making in HCC.
