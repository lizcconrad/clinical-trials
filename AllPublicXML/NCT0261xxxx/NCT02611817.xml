    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of vedolizumab subcutaneous (vedolizumab
      SC) as maintenance treatment in participants with moderately to severely active Crohn's
      disease (CD) who achieved clinical response following administration of vedolizumab
      intravenous (vedolizumab IV) induction therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab SC. Vedolizumab SC is being tested
      to treat people who have moderate to severely active CD. This study will look at clinical
      remission, as well as enhanced clinical response and corticosteroid-free remission in
      participants with CD who receive vedolizumab SC maintenance therapy after having achieved a
      clinical response to vedolizumab IV induction therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 824 participants. All participants will enter a 6 week
      Induction Phase where they will be administered open-label vedolizumab IV 300 mg via IV
      infusion at Week 0 (Day 1) and Week 2 (Day 15), and will then be assessed for a clinical
      response at Week 6. Participants who achieve a clinical response at Week 6 will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab SC 108 mg Maintenance Arm

        -  Placebo SC Maintenance Arm

      Participants who do not achieve a clinical response will not be randomized into the
      Maintenance Period, and instead will receive a third infusion of vedolizumab IV 300 mg at
      Week 6.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 71 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final
      visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants will
      also participate in a long-term safety follow-up, by phone, at 6 months after the last dose
      of study drug.
