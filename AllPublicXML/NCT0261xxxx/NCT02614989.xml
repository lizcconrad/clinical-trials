      This project goal is to explore the option of (MRgFUS) as a treatment for tremor in MS
      patients with disabling refractory tremor.

      This study is designed as a prospective, single site, single arm, nonrandomized study.
      Assessments will be made before and after MRgFUS for clinical symptom relief, quality of life
      (QoL) improvements, and safety of MRgFUS in the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients with
      severe medication refractory tremor.

      This study will be performed on the 3T MR scanners. The ExAblate system is a medical device
      that involves a focused ultrasound system and an MRI scanner. During MRgFUS a pulse of
      focused ultrasound energy, or sonication,are delivered to the targeted tissue. In this
      particular study the targeted tissue is a unilateral thermal lesion created in the ventralis
      intermedius nucleus of the thalamus.

      The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic MR images to identify the location
      and shape of tumor to be treated. The computer uses the physician's designation of the target
      volume to plan the best way to cover the target volume with small spots called &quot;sonications&quot;.
      These treatment spots are cylinder shaped. Their size depends on sonication power and
      duration. During the treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to identify
      changes in tissue temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to confirm the
      therapeutic effect. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in progress, and confirm
      that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the therapy loop.

      MRgFUS uses a transcranial operated helmet-shaped transducer positioned above the subject
      head. The transcranial system includes means to immobilize the subject head, cool the
      interface water, and software for CT analysis and phase correction computation.

      MRgFUS transcranial system to relieve tremor in multiple sclerosis patients is being
      investigated in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, age 18 years and older

          -  Patients who are able and willing to give informed consent and able to attend all
             study visits

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of Multiple sclerosis (MS) as confirmed from clinical
             history and examination by a neurologist.

          -  The patient must have disabling tremor from MS as indicated by a score of at least 2
             on the Tremor Rating Scale (TRS) baseline global assessments by the examiner and the
             patient. Or Disabling is defined as significant impairment of the normal functions of
             daily life as indicated by a score of at least 5 on the Clinical Global Impression
             (CGI)-Severity scale.or ETRS

          -  The MS patient must have disabling and medically refractory unilateral or bilateral
             upper extremity tremor. Patients with associated ipsilateral lower extremity tremor
             are not excluded.

          -  The patient must have a history of an unsatisfactory response to medical management.
