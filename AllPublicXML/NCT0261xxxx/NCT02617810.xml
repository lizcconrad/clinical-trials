    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effect of multiple-dose administration of
      JNJ-42847922 on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam and single-dose
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of (R)- and (S)-warfarin after oral administration of
      racemic warfarin.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      fixed-sequence, study of JNJ-42847922 in healthy participants. The study consists of 3
      Phases: Screening Phase (28 Days), open-label treatment Phase (40 Days) and follow up visit
      (7 to 14 Days after last study procedure). The duration of participation in the study for
      each participant is approximately 82 Days. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.

          -  If a woman, must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted
             reproduction for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug

          -  If a man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had
             a vasectomy, must agree to use an adequate contraception method as deemed appropriate

             receiving the last dose of study drug

             not less than 50 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not
             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease,
             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), syncope,
             hypotension, hypertension or vascular disorders, lipid abnormalities, significant
             pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus,
             hepatic or renal insufficiency, kidney or urinary tract disturbances, thyroid disease,
             neurologic disease, significant psychiatric disorder, epilepsy, or fits of unexplained
             black-outs, infection, or any other illness that the Investigator considers should
             exclude the participant or that could interfere with the interpretation of the study
             results

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis,
             or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at Screening or at Day -1 of the first treatment
             period as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. In addition, participants must have
             coagulation test results [(prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio
             (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)] within clinically acceptable
             limits at Screening as deemed appropriate by the Investigator

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs, or 12 lead

          -  Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication (including vitamins and herbal
             supplements), except for acetaminophen, within 14 days before the first dose of the
             study drug is scheduled until completion of the study. In addition, participants will
             be excluded if they have used medications known to affect coagulation or modulate
             CYP2C9 or VKORC1 within 28 days of study admission
