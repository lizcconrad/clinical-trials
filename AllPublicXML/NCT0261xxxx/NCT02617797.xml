      Urinary stress incontinence ( SUI ) is defined as an involuntary loss of urinary Complaint no
      effort According to the Consensus of the International Continence Society (Society Continene
      International - ICS) . SUI Prevalence of adult female Population and 25 % to 30 %.However,
      despite the high prevalence, many women who have symptoms of SUI or not seek treatment remain
      without resolution of symptoms.Then there is the possibility of using non-invasive
      radiofrequency and non-ablation in external urethral meatus in order to stimulate collagen
      production, as one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of stress urinary incontinence is the
      collagen deficit in the urethral wall. It is a randomized clinical trial and the group
      experimental will utilize radiofrequency and cinesioteraphy ( clinical and in home) and the
      group control utilize turn off- radiofrequency and cinesiotherapy(clinical and in home). The
      protocol f the cinesiotherapu is the same both the group, and the protocol radiofrequency the
      group experimental will 5 sessions (one per week) with temperature 38ºC during 2 minuts. The
      group control will 5 sessions (one per week) but the radiofrequency will off but glycerin is
      heated, for masking for the patient, during 2 min. The result of the treatment is assessed by
      pad test 1 hour and have others outcomes ( quality of life- Sf-26 ans King Health- and sexual
      function- FSFI questionaire)
