    <textblock>
      Arterial Hypertension (HBP) has a high prevalence and low rates of control, is considered a
      major modifiable risk factors and one of the most important public health problems. Mortality
      from cardiovascular disease increases progressively with increasing blood pressure (BP) in a
      linear, continuous and independent. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the
      pathogenesis of hypertension exhibit metabolic abnormalities, which are related to
      endothelial dysfunction. Resveratrol, a polyphenol stilbene derived from various species of
      plants, but in our food, mainly present in red wine and grapes, has shown protective effects
      in cardiovascular diseases, such as preventing the damage caused by oxidative stress,
      decreased plasma lipids with inhibiting the formation of atherosclerotic plaque; protective
      effect of vascular endothelium, with increased release of nitric oxide and decreased
      production of free radicals in animal models, but human studies are limited and insufficient
      to clarify the possible effects of trans-resveratrol (biologically active form) on
      endothelial function, blood pressure and central aortic pressure in treated hypertensive
      individuals.The aim of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of trans-resveratrol
      supplementation on endothelial function in treated hypertensive patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The patient lay comfortably in the supine position with slightly abducted right arm. After located the brachial artery, the transducer was placed on the anteromedial face of the right arm, perpendicular to the axis of the arm, 5-10 cm above the antecubital crease on the artery. The basal diameter of the brachial artery (BBAD) and post occlusion brachial artery diameter (POBAD) were measured manually between the intima-lumen interfaces at end-diastole. After BBAD, the site of contact of the probe was marked on the skin, so that the measurement of POBAD occur at the same site. The occlusion is maintained for five minutes through cuff on the arm, which print pressure slightly above the systolic blood pressure, confirmed by no pulse Doppler. The POBAD was measured 30, 60 and 90 seconds after releasing the flow. At baseline, after checking the criteria for inclusion and exclusion and signing the informed consent, the selected patient performs the DMF fasting and after 90 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of central aortic pressure (Sphygmocor)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Noninvasive test, conducted in peaceful environment, temperature controlled, patient lying supine, using his right arm to measure blood pressure and central aortic pressure.
The analysis of radial artery pulse wave by applanation tonometry is performed to derive central artery pressures and other hemodynamic parameters using Sphygmocor system (Atcor, USA). After measuring the BP in the brachial artery pulse wave of the radial artery on the same side were obtained for at least 10 seconds using a tonometer (SPC-301 - Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas), calibrated according to the brachial BP. The resulting radial pulse waves are processed using specific software (Sphygmocor v7 AtCor, USA) to derive the corresponding central aortic pressure through a previously validated transfer function. At baseline, after checking the criteria for inclusion and exclusion and signing the informed consent, the selected patient performs the SphymoCor fasting and after 90 minutes.</description>
