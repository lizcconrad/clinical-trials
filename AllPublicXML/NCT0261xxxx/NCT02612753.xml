  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is a frequent symptom after a left hemisphere stroke. It has serious impacts on
      social, family and professional lives. Aphasic patients need to be rehabilitated. To date, no
      pharmacological treatment being available only speech and language therapy (SLT) can improve
      patients, but its efficiency is moderate. Several studies have investigated the link between
      the recovery of language and neural reorganization. tDCs, a noninvasive technology for
      modulating neural excitability, could potentiate the effects of the SLT. About 25 studies in
      literature have described beneficial effects of tDCs coupled with SLT on aphasic patients.
      However to the investigator knowledge the feasibility of tDCs and speech therapy in clinical
      pathways has never been investigated. That is why the investigator propose to study in real
      care conditions how SLT proves more efficient on the recovery of language in a discursive
      assessment when coupled with active stimulation than with placebo stimulation.

      This is a multicenter, cross-over, randomized, controlled and double blind study. 24 patients
      will be included between November 2015 and November 2017.

      During each session of speech and language treatment, aphasics will receive a weak 2 milli
      amperes (electric) current delivered by a tDCs device for 20 minutes. The stimulation will be
      either active or placebo. Each stage of the cross over will last three weeks. Patients will
      be administered the usual number of SLT sessions, no particular therapy being imposed. To
      evaluate the long-time effects of the therapy, three follow-up measures will be proposed.

    <description>The participant must answer a simple question &quot;explain me your job or your study&quot;. Their production will be recorded and analyzed.
For evaluate the stability of participant performances before the stimulation period three based line will be propose. The third base line corresponds to the start of the first stimulation period. After the three week of tdcs coupled with the SLT a new assessment will be realized. One week later begin the new stage of cross over. An assessment will be administered just before and just after the second stimulation period. Then, three follow-up assessments (one all two weeks) will be proposed during one and half month.</description>
