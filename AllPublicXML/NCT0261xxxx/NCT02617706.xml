      Anorectal procedures more often lead to surgical site infections. Such infections are
      unfortunately frequent and can be difficult for the patient and the treating physician. Wound
      hypoxia has been identified as a pathogenic mechanism behind wound infection and poor
      healing. Transdermal oxygen delivery (EPIFLO) is intended to promote the healing process in
      chronic wounds as an adjunct to standard wound care in wound management and treatment

    <description>Transdermal continuous oxygen therapy is oxygen delivery to the wound site directly. Ogenix makes a small portable oxygen concentrator (Trade Name: EPIFLO) that makes continuous transdermal delivery of oxygen possible. It is a 3 ounce oxygen generator that continuously delivers 3 ml of pure oxygen to the wound site.</description>
