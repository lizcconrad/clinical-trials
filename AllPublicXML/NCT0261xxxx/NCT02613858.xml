      The Preempt study is likely to help determine the frequency of patients suffering from
      Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy (MHE) and are cirrhotics. It will also enable us to know about
      the Quality of life of these patients.

    <measure>Frequency of MHE in Cirrhotic patients</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous variables with normal and non-normal distributions would be reported as mean (SD) and median [inter-quartile range (IQR)], respectively. Prevalence of MHE in cirrhotic patients with 95% confidence Interval (CI) will be calculated. Continuous variables between group will compared by using Independent sample t test, and categorical variables will compare by using the chi-square test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The predisposing factors that might be associated with MHE in all enrolled patients with cirrhosis</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Odds Ratios (OR) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) will be estimated using Logistic Regression. The likelihood ratio test used to assess the association between the explanatory variables and the risk of the MHE. Invariable analyses will perform to examine the effect of each variable on the risk of MHE. In multivariate analysis all insignificant variables (p &gt;0.05) will check for their confounding and interaction effects before their removal from the final model.</description>
