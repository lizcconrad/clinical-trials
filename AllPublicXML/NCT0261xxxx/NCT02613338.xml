  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A better understanding of knee joint kinematics is important to explain the premature
      polyethylene wear failures within total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) and to help design a
      prosthesis that most closely approximates the normal knee. Specifically, posterior
      stabilizing (PS) knees have been found to be associated with lower amounts of posterior
      femoral rollback, higher occurrence of reverse axial rotation and increased amount of
      condylar lift-off. The DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction's Attune PS fixed bearing (FB) knee
      system has incorporated subtle changes in its design to address restoration of kinematics
      that more closely resemble those of a normal knee. To understand if this design is able to
      effectively restore kinematics in the implanted knee, further in vivo analysis is necessary.
      This continuation of the study will analyze 30 subjects with the Attune PS FB 3 months
      post-operatively using the University of Tennessee's mobile fluoroscopy unit while performing
      three daily activities, level walking, ramp down and deep knee bend.
