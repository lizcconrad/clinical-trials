  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of SFX-01 in
      Subarachnoid Haemorrhage, with exploratory evaluations of efficacy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group design comparing SFX-01 (300 mg)
      taken orally as capsules or as a suspension via a nasogastric tube (NG) twice-daily for up to
      28 days versus placebo in 90 patients who have had SAH and present within 48 hours of ictus.

      Subjects will receive SFX-01/Placebo in order to review potential outcomes investigating the
      long-term complications of SAH such as Delayed Cerebral Ischaemia, as reflected by
      Trans-Cranial Doppler (TCD) readings. The objective is to demonstrate safety and search for
      signals of efficacy in patients that have had SAH.

      A sub-study will be conducted in up to 12 patients where an External Ventricular Drain (EVD)
      fitted; serial CSF samples will be taken pre- &amp; post-dose on two occasions to determine
      pharmacokinetics of Sulforaphane in CSF in comparison with plasma pharmacokinetics. Sub-study
      patients will undergo all other procedures (with the exception of lumbar puncture).

      Treatment duration is up to 28 days; follow up duration is 28 days, three and six months. The
      planned trial period is 24 months.
