  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are seeking to understand the acceptability of an online yoga class for individuals with
      mood disorders. MoodNetwork members who are 18 years old or over who have experienced
      depression, mania, or hypomania are invited to participate. About 200 MoodNetwork
      participants will take part in this study.

      Yoga practitioners view yoga as a way to promote good physical and mental health, rather than
      as a treatment for poor health. This world view may be appealing to patients, especially
      those concerned with the stigma of conventional mental health treatment, or with the narrow
      focus on decreasing symptoms (instead of a broader focus on living to one's full potential)
      that defines much of conventional mental health treatment. Yoga classes are widely available
      and relatively inexpensive compared to other depression treatments. Yoga can be practiced at
      home with the aid of video recordings or books. We propose to examine the acceptability and
      feasibility of online yoga practice for individuals with depression, mania, or hypomania.
