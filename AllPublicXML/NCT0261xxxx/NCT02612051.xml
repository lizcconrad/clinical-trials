  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3008348 is an investigational drug, being developed by GlaxoSmithKline Research and
      Development Limited (the Sponsor, a pharmaceutical company based in the UK) for the treatment
      of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a rare and poorly understood disease that
      causes scarring of the lungs. The main symptoms are shortness of breath and a dry cough.
      Symptoms generally worsen over time and in some subjects may prove fatal. The cause of IPF is
      unknown.

      This is a First Time in Human, Phase 1, 3-part study which is being carried out on behalf of
      the Sponsor by Quintiles. The primary purpose of Part A is to examine the safety and
      tolerability of single nebulised (a medicated spray) doses of GSK3008348 following inhalation
      in healthy volunteers. The secondary objective is to determine how and at what rate the body
      absorbs, distributes, breaksdown and eliminates the drug.

      Parts B and C of this study will be in-patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The
      purpose of Part B and C is to examine the safety and tolerability, and how much of the drug
      binds to its target, following single nebulised (a medicated spray) doses of GSK3008348
      following inhalation in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The secondary
      objective is to determine how and at what rate the bodies of these patients absorbs,
      distributes, breaksdown and eliminates the drug.

      The total duration of Part A will be 65 - 87 days, Part B 62 days and Part C 43 days.
