  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      So far, the impact of sarcopenia has been analysed only in patients undergoing traditional
      surgical procedures (laparotomy) or those with metastatic spread. As the ERAS protocol
      combined with minimally invasive access decreases postoperative metabolic disorders, it seems
      possible that it can limit the deleterious impact of sarcopenia as well. The aim of this
      study was to investigate whether the use of ERAS protocol in colorectal cancer patients
      influences the postoperative risk due to sarcopenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective observation with post-hoc analysis of 171 consecutive colorectal cancer
      patients was performed. In all patients 16-item ERAS protocol was applied.

      Contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed preoperatively. From each scan one CT image at the
      level of L3 vertebra was transferred in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format
      (DICOM) and anonymised. Firstly, the threshold range between −29 and +150 Hounsfield units
      was set to semi-automatically outline muscle areas, - 150 to - 50 was used for visceral
      adipose tissue areas, and -190 to -30 was used for subcutaneous and intermuscular adipose
      tissue areas. Secondly, the software calculated the surface area (cm2) of each tissue. The L3
      skeletal muscle area (rectus abdominis, external and internal obliques, transversus
      abdominis, quadratus lumborum, psoas, erector spinae) normalized for patient height was used
      to calculate skeletal muscle index (SMI) (cm2/m2).

      According to Martin et al. sarcopenia was defined as a SMI &lt;41 cm2/m2 in women, &lt;43 cm2/m2 in
      men with a BMI &lt;25 kg/m2, and &lt;53 cm2/m2 in men with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m2 (10). To assess for
      myosteatosis the mean radiodensity of a L3 psoas muscle was measured. The cut-off for
      patients with BMI &lt;25 kg/m2 was &lt;41 Hounsfield units and &lt;33 Hounsfield units for patients
      with BMI ≥25 kg/m2.

      For the purposes of further analysis the entire group of patients was divided into subgroups
      depending on the presence of sarcopenia or myosteatosis.

        The analysis included prospectively collected data from consecutive patients electively
        operated for colorectal cancer in the years 2014-2015. All patients were operated using
        laparoscopic surgery, and the perioperative care was based on pre-established ERAS protocol
        consisting of 13 items
