  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, much of sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria and other resource-limited
      countries, are without ready access to CPT, due to factors including the lack of PT devices,
      which are expensive and require consistent electric power to operate. NHB is a significant
      cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, but preventable when appropriate treatment is
      initiated. We have shown that FS-PT is safe and efficacious for the treatment of
      mild-moderate NHB. The major goal of this study is to demonstrate that FS-PT is efficacious
      for the treatment of significant/severe NHB, generally defined as TB of ≥12-14mg/dL (but more
      specially as defined as needing phototherapy per American Academy of Pediatric 2004
      guidelines). It will be done at 3 sites in Nigeria (2 in Lagos, Nigeria and 1 in Ogbomoso,
      Nigeria). The rationale for conducting the study is that in Nigeria, and other countries that
      cannot afford effective commercial light devices and/or have no reliable electric power to
      operate them, filtered sunlight phototherapy might offer a safe and effective treatment for
      neonatal jaundice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NHB) and its progression to kernicterus is a leading
      cause of deaths and disabilities among newborns in the developing world, particularly in
      sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. Many infants live in villages/towns far from clinical
      facilities capable of providing conventional artificial blue light phototherapy (CPT) which
      is the standard treatment for NHB in the industrialized world. Hence, more babies succumb to
      this preventable tragedy principally on account of lack of electricity and/or
      available/affordable CPT.

      To make treatment of NHB more readily available, we designed and tested a novel, yet simple,
      practical alternative device to deliver blue light PT in underserved areas from filtered
      sunlight. The investigators pilot study demonstrated that appropriately filtered sunlight
      phototherapy (FS-PT) not only offers safe and affordable treatment for infants with
      mild-moderate NHB, but is also no less efficacious than CPT. Other studies have shown faster
      decline at higher bilirubin (TB) levels and with higher irradiances. The next logical step to
      move this urgently needed and exciting therapy forward is to test FS-PT in infants with
      significant/severe NHB as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) criteria for
      high-risk infants. In doing so, the investigators will potentially be preventing acute
      bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and kernicterus in many of these infants.
