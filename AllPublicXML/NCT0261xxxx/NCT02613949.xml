    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of a noninvasive cortical
      electrostimulation therapy known as &quot;Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical
      Electrostimulation&quot; (RINCE) in the treatment of pain associated with fibromyalgia. Patients
      who meet the 2010 American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia will receive up
      to 24 RINCE treatments delivered by a medical device called &quot;NeuroPoint&quot;. Approximately 45
      fibromyalgia patients will be randomized into one of three study groups. One of these groups
      will receive sham treatment, meaning they will receive no treatment at all. A second group
      will receive active RINCE treatment at a nominal signal amplitude level (treatment mode 1). A
      third group will receive active RINCE treatment at a higher than nominal signal amplitude
      level (treatment mode 2). The study's primary outcome measure will be the difference between
      active and sham treatment groups in the mean change from baseline in patients' 24-hour recall
      average pain scores. The study's hypothesis is that there will be a difference between
      treatment groups in primary outcome measure.
