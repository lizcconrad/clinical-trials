      The purpose of this study is to determine whether systematically performing computed
      tomography (CT) venography (i.e a CT acquisition of the pelvis and of the lower limbs, during
      the venous phase of opacification) in addition to thoracic CT angiography in women with
      suspected postpartum pulmonary embolism (PE) results in a gain in venous thromboembolism
      detection rate.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading cause of maternal death during postpartum in
      developed countries; Thoracic computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the first-line
      diagnostic test for PE suspicion, but has a 20 to 35% rate of inconclusiveness during
      pregnancy and postpartum, 2 to 3 times higher than that of the general population. CT
      venography (CTV) consists in a delayed CT acquisition of the abdomen, pelvis and lower limbs,
      3 minutes after starting contrast administration. It can be used for detecting deep venous
      thrombosis (DVT), the source of emboli in most PEs. The investigators hypothesized most
      postpartum PEs are due to pelvic vein thrombosis and that detecting such pelvic DVT by
      performing systematic CTV could increase the overall venous thromboembolism (VTE) detection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) during the first 6 weeks
             postpartum, without any sign of severe PE (shock, hypotension), referred for CT
             angiography

          -  Absence of contraindication to iodinated contrast medium injection

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Health insurance

          -  Possibility to have 3-month follow-up

          -  Obtention of written informed consent (ability to give consent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anticoagulation at therapeutic dosage for another reason than the suspicion of PE for
             more than 72 hours

          -  New pregnancy (In case of any doubt after medical history review, βHCG blood test must
             be realized to ensure patient's pregnancy status)

          -  Contrast medium extravasation during injection

          -  CTA or CTV not performed according to the study requirements
