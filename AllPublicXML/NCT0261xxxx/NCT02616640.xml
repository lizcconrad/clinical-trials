  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b study to determine the recommended dose and
      regimen of durvalumab either as monotherapy or in combination with POM with or without low
      dose dex in subjects with RRMM. The study will consist of a dose-finding portion as well as a
      parallel dose-expansion portion to determine the optimal dose and regimen.

      On 05 Sep 2017, a Partial Clinical Hold was placed on this study by the United States (US)
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The decision by the FDA was based on data related to
      risks of anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody, pembrolizumab, in combination with
      IMiDs® immunomodulatory drugs in patients with multiple myeloma. As a result, enrollment into
      this study has been discontinued. Subjects who are receiving clinical benefit, based on the
      discretion of the investigator, may remain on study treatment after being reconsented.
