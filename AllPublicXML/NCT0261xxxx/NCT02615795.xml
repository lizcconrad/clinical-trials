      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of monitoring patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after a hospitalization for COPD exacerbation or
      pneumonia. The patients are randomized to receive either standard treatment and follow up, or
      standard treatment and follow up, plus tele monitoring of key clinical parameters and
      symptoms for six months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine is a relatively new approach for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) disease. Telemedicine, for monitoring disease exacerbation, is the focus area
      of our research. The patient monitoring offers the possibility of early initiation of
      treatment of patients who has evidence of COPD exacerbation or pulmonary infection. The
      self-monitoring of potential exacerbation is started after a hospitalization, and is done by
      the patient on a daily (not on weekends) basis initially. After one month the monitoring is
      made at least three times weekly during the rest of the intervention period of six months.
      With the help of the monitoring equipment, the patient answers a short series of health
      related questions, and makes simple measurements of oxygen saturation, heart rate, lung
      function and weight. Data is sent to the hospital, and here the staff can assess the data and
      respond to them the same day, with a phone call to the patient, if the patient's condition
      has changed. The selected telemonitoring-equipment, consists of a monitoring systems for the
      assessment of key clinical parameters and symptoms. All patients, in the intervention group
      as well as in the control group, are trained in the use of a standardized self-treatment
      plan. It is expected that the monitoring of symptoms and signs will support patient
      empowerment.

      The investigation is planned to assess the clinical and economic effects of the intervention.

    <description>Monitoring of symptoms and physiological parameters at home, using Tunstall Healthcare telemedicine equipment. Patients perform physiological measurement. In addition, they correspond to a standardized questionnaire regarding disease specific symptoms. Data is assessed by the medical staff the same day. If the data indicates worsening in the patient's condition, the patient is contacted by phone. The assessment of the patient is made either on the specialist nurse level, or at a conference between the specialist nurse and a senior pulmonary doctor. There is no call center service.</description>
