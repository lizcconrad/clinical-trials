  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects presenting with probable acute coronary syndromes scheduled for cardiac
      catheterization will be enrolled in this study. Consented subjects will be randomized to
      receive ticagrelor started with a loading dose immediately after enrollment versus receiving
      a loading dose of ticagrelor during cardiac catheterization after diagnostic angiography but
      prior to stenting. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be performed after stenting and
      the volume of thrombus within the new stent will be measured and compared between the groups.

         15. Cardiac catheterization scheduled within 4 hours of randomization or more then 72
             hours after randomization.

        Lesion Specific Exclusion Criteria. These exclusion criteria apply to the target lesion to
        be imaged by OCT.

          1. Lesions located in the left main coronary artery

          2. Lesions that are heavily calcified

          3. Lesions where OCT cannot be performed due to technical difficulties

          4. Other lesions that the investigator deems inappropriate for the procedure such as
             sites with excessive tortuosity or low flow by TIMI grade.
