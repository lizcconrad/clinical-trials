    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and tolerability of PF-06412562 given orally to healthy
      volunteers. To determine the optimal dose for future studies, the concentration of the drug
      over time will be determined by periodic blood samples. The rate of eye blinks will be
      measured as an indicator of PF-06412562 action on the receptors of interest in the brain.

    <description>AUC = Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time. It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <time_frame>0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

    <description>Single doses, given by oral solution, starting at 0.5 mg up to a possible maximum of 150 mg. The subject will have been fasted for 10 hours prior to the single dose. Two doses, 120 mg and 150 mg, will be split into 3 doses such that the total dose is given over 8 hours (i.e. t = 0, 4, and 8 hours). For each dosing period, 2 subjects will be given a placebo as a comparator. One dose will be given in the fed state.</description>

    <description>It is believed that for increasing doses of this compound the eye blink rate (EBR) will also increase. This arm will use EBR measurement technology to verify this hypothesis. In each dosing period, 4 subjects will be given a placebo as a comparator.</description>
