  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease among children and
      is closely associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD increases risk of
      mortality and natural history studies of adults show that NAFLD is an independent risk factor
      for cardiovascular disease. Pediatric NAFLD is particularly concerning from a public health
      standpoint, as it represents an early and possibly more aggressive form of the disease.
      Currently there is no effective treatment for pediatric NAFLD.

      Losartan is an orally-administered angiotensin II receptor antagonist which is currently on
      the market to treat high blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system has
      been shown to be important in many disease states including renal disease, cardiovascular
      disease, and NAFLD. Angiotensin antagonists are a class of medications that has been proposed
      as a novel treatment of NAFLD in part because they would treat both the factors increasing
      cardiovascular (CVD) risks as well as potentially improve steatosis, fibrosis and hepatic
      inflammation.

      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate
      whether 8 weeks of Losartan will decrease inflammatory markers among children ages 12-19 with
      a current diagnosis of NAFLD. Efficacy will be assessed by improvement in alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) from baseline. Secondary endpoints will include aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), cytokeratin 18 levels, and fasting triglyceride levels among others.
      Safety will be assessed by the recording of adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters,
      vital signs and physical examinations.

    <description>The principal objective of this blinded, placebo controlled, crossover pilot study is to evaluate whether 8 weeks of losartan in children with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will decrease inflammation as measured by ALT.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cholesterol Levels From Baseline to End of Treatment (8 Weeks of Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0 and 14), End of treatment (Week 8 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>For children, a cholesterol level of less than 170 is considered acceptable, 170-199 is borderline high, and 200 and over is high.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Triglyceride Levels From Baseline to End of Treatment (8 Weeks of Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0 and 14), End of treatment (Week 8 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>For children aged 10 to 19, triglyceride levels of less than 90 is considered acceptable, 90 to 129 is borderline high, and greater than or equal to 130 and over is high.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fatty Acid Levels From Baseline to End of Treatment (8 Weeks of Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0 and 14), End of Treatment (Week 8 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>In human studies, losartan has been shown to decrease serum free fatty acids, thus any decrease in this measurement indicates a positive response to losartan.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) Between Baseline and End of Treatment (8 Weeks of Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0 and 14), End of Treatment (Week 8 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is an equation which indicates the degree of insulin resistance, where higher scores equate to greater insulin resistance. HOMA-IR is calculated as fasting glucose (mg/dl) × insulin (mU/L)/405. A HOMA-IR value &gt;2.0 in prepubertal children and &gt;2.6 in pubertal children, may be considered a warning sign for pediatricians to further investigate insulin resistance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) Concentrations Between Baseline and End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Week 14, Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>PAI-1 is an acute-phase protein that is associated with both injury and inflammation, and has been found to be elevated in adolescents with significant hepatic steatosis. The reference range for PAI-1 in fasting adults is 3-72 ng/mL</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) From Baseline to End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Week 14, and Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>The normal range for AST in children is 0 - 60 IU/L. AST can respond rapidly to treatment so decreases between Baseline and subsequent measurements indicate positive effects of treatment.</description>

        <description>The principal objective of this blinded, placebo controlled, crossover pilot study is to evaluate whether 8 weeks of losartan in children with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will decrease inflammation as measured by ALT.</description>

        <population>In this blinded, crossover treatment, study participants received losartan or a placebo for 8 weeks, then completed a 6 week washout period before crossing over to the other treatment for 8 weeks. The placebo results for four participants in the losartan followed by placebo arm were not usable due to carry over effects from the active treatment.</population>

        <title>Changes in Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) Between Baseline and End of Treatment (8 Weeks of Treatment)</title>
        <description>Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is an equation which indicates the degree of insulin resistance, where higher scores equate to greater insulin resistance. HOMA-IR is calculated as fasting glucose (mg/dl) × insulin (mU/L)/405. A HOMA-IR value &gt;2.0 in prepubertal children and &gt;2.6 in pubertal children, may be considered a warning sign for pediatricians to further investigate insulin resistance.</description>

        <population>The placebo results for four participants in the losartan followed by placebo arm were not usable due to carry over effects from the active treatment. An additional participant is missing HOMA-IR data from the placebo phase of the study.</population>
