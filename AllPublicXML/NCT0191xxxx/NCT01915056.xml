  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether information regarding GA and GA-driven
      interventions improves outcomes in older cancer patients receiving first-line or second-line
      chemotherapy by comparing rates of chemotherapy toxicity, hospitalizations, dose delays and
      early termination of treatment in patients with and without GA-driven interventions. The
      investigators will identify information that will be useful based on questionnaire responses
      and blood tests. These results will be used to better understand which recommendations and
      interventions will benefit older cancer patients. It is our hope that these tools, which are
      well-established at identifying areas of risk, will provide meaningful opportunities for
      intervention to promote your safety during cancer management. The investigators will be able
      to use this information to teach others on how to best care for adults aged 70 and older with
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although cancer is very common in older patients, the optimal treatment for cancer for this
      subset of patients is not well established. As a result of lack of knowledge on the safety
      and efficacy of chemotherapy in older adults, a significant proportion of older patients
      receiving chemotherapy have toxicity. There is also little information regarding how to best
      make decisions for and implement interventions to improve outcomes of older patients with
      cancer who are to receive treatment. Additionally, there is marked heterogeneity in the
      geriatric population, and patients of similar chronologic age may have wide disparity in
      their overall health status. Geriatricians utilize a tool called the Geriatric Assessment
      (GA) to gauge an older patient's overall health status and identify potential areas of
      deficits. The GA is a comprehensive tool, incorporating the assessment of physical function,
      co-morbid conditions, social support, nutritional, psychological, and cognitive status and
      medication review. A small number of studies in the oncology literature have demonstrated the
      value of GA in guiding cancer-directed treatment plans for older patients. GA can identify
      potential areas of deficits in an older patient's overall health status that have been shown
      to predict chemotherapy toxicity and guide interventions to improve outcomes for older
      patients. Studies of interventions in community-dwelling older adults have demonstrated
      efficacy at improving deficits identified on GA. However, in older patients with cancer,
      there is currently limited data regarding how GA can affect decision-making for treatment and
      impact overall clinical care.

      In a two-arm, randomized pilot study, we will evaluate the effect of GA and GA-driven
      interventions on the outcomes of older cancer patients receiving first-line or second-line
      chemotherapy.

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study is to determine if GA-driven interventions improve outcomes in older cancer patients receiving first-line or second-line chemotherapy by comparing rates of chemotherapy toxicity, hospitalizations, dose delays and early termination of treatment. The primary analysis will be a comparison of the proportion of patients who developed grade &gt;3 toxicity over 3 months time using the likelihood ratio test.</description>

    <description>Control Arm = Standard of Care. Patients who are randomized to the control arm will only have abnormal results on Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and cognitive evaluation communicated to their primary oncologist, as is customary. These results will be communicated to the primary team via electronic medical record and/or email communication. No other summary will be provided to oncologist.</description>

    <description>Treatment Arm = Standard care plus GA results and recommendations. For patients assigned to the treatment arm, individuals will be offered the option of completing the GA during a visit with their primary oncologist, or attending an additional visit at the multidisciplinary geriatric oncology clinic (GA-driven intervention). The intervention consists of providing results of geriatric assessment in a summary to oncologists.</description>
