      The purpose of this randomized, controlled, open-label pilot study is to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of a novel intense pulsed light (IPL) device for removal of unwanted fine body
      hair.

      Subjects will have a designated treatment area on one forearm divided into four equal-size
      quadrants. One quadrant will serve as the un-treated control area and the other 3 quadrants
      will be treated with the Cutera Prowave LX IPL. Subjects will receive 3 IPL treatments,
      spaced 8 weeks apart, on the designated area and will be followed at 12-weeks post-final
      treatment.
