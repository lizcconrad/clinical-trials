          -  Clinically significant neurological, metabolic (including type 1 diabetes), hepatic,
             renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, carcinoma, and/or
             urological disorder that would pose a risk to the subjects if they were to participate
             in the study or that might confound the results of the study.

        Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or well-controlled are not exclusionary if
        they do not affect risk to the subject or the study results. In cases in which the impact
        of the condition upon risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the Medical Monitor
        should be consulted. Any subject with a known cardiovascular disease or condition (even if
        controlled) must be discussed with the Medical Monitor during screening.

          -  Has a history of malignancy &lt; 5 years prior to signing the informed consent.

             investigator to pose a health concern to the subject while on study.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values or abnormal vital sign values/findings.

        Note: If any laboratory results are outside the normal range, the site may have the subject

        this value must be discussed with the Medical Monitor for enrollment consideration.

          -  A history or presence of abnormal ECG, which in the investigator's opinion is
             clinically significant. Abnormal screening ECGs will be centrally over-read, and
             eligibility will be determined based on the over-read.

          -  Presence or history (within the last year) of a medical or surgical condition (eg,
             gastrointestinal disease) that might interfere with the absorption, metabolism, or
             excretion of orally administered lurasidone.

          -  Clinically significant alcohol abuse/dependence or drug abuse/dependence based on
             DSM-IV-TR criteria within the last 6 months prior to screening.

                  opiates, phencyclidine, cannabinoids, and methadone). A positive test for
                  amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines or methadone may not result
                  in exclusion of subjects if the investigator determines that the positive test is
                  as a result of taking prescription medicine(s) as prescribed. In the event a
                  subject tests positive for cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol) or alcohol, the
                  investigator will evaluate the subject's ability to abstain from prohibited
                  substances during the study. If in the investigator's clinical judgment the
                  subject will abstain, the subject may be enrolled after consultation with the
                  Medical Monitor.

               2. Pregnancy test.

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, or likely to become pregnant during the study.

      <time_frame>Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with a start date on or after the date of first dose through 7 days after study drug discontinuation (14 days for serious adverse events and deaths) for subjects who complete the double blind study but do not enter into the extension study or early discontinue during the double blind study), or through the last study day of the doubleblind period for subjects continuing into the extension study.</time_frame>
      <desc>AEs were collected from the time the informed consent is signed to the end of the study. Non-leading questions were used to ask subjects about the possible occurrence of AEs. The investigator then established a diagnosis of the event based on signed, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Please note that two subjects from the lurasidone 80mg (originally 106) group transferred to the lurasidone 40 mg (originally 108) group</desc>
