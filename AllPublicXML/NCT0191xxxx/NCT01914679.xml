    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mechanisms of noninvasive cortical
      electrostimulation therapy known as &quot;Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical
      Electrostimulation&quot; RINCE)in the management of fibromyalgia. Patients who meet the 1990
      American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia will receive up to 24 RINCE
      treatments delivered by a medical device called &quot;NeuroPoint&quot;. Approximately 20 patients will
      receive a combination of active and inactive (sham) therapy treatments over a 16-week period
      followed by a 4 week post-treatment evaluation. Patients will also undergo three (3)
      functional brain imaging scans while participating in the study: the first prior to the
      commencement of treatment, another mid-treatment; and the third at the completion of the
      treatment period.

      The study's primary outcome measure will be the change from baseline in self-reported 24-hour
      average pain intensity. The study's hypothesis is that there will be a change in pain
      intensity as well brain functioning. We do not expect there to be a statistically significant
      improvement in pain intensity due to the small sample but do expect to see statistically
      significant changes in cortical function as measured by EEG and fMRI

             diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia.

          -  Patients must have a 24-hour recall pain intensity score at both the screening and
             baseline visits between 40 and 90 inclusive on a 100 mm VAS scale.
