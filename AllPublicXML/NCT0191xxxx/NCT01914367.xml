  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Six identical female twins aged 9-13 years will participate. One sib of each twin pair will
      be given Cervarix according to the 0, 1, 6 month vaccination scheme, while the other sib will
      be given Gardasil according to the 0, 2, 6 month vaccination scheme. Three blood samples will
      be taken (the first prior to vaccine administration, the second and third 7 days after dose 2
      and 3, respectively). The blood samples will be used to determine: 1) the magnitude the
      anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody responses, 2) as well as the cross-reactive pattern of
      these responses towards related, non-vaccine HPV strains (HPV-31 and -33, and HPV-45). 3)
      plasmablast isolated from blood taken 7 days after the 3rd dose in the first place (and
      eventually after the 2nd dose also) will be examined for for the usage of VDJ and VJ segments
      in the immunoglobulin heavy (VH) and light (VL) heavy and light chains. Gene useg in B cells
      induced by Cervarix and Gardasil will be compared. Finally the cross-reactive potential of
      monoclonal antibodies obtained by eukaryotic expression of a series of heavy (VH) and light
      (VL) chains from single ASC isolated after the 3rd dose of a three-dose schedule of either
      Cervarix or Gardasil will be examined.

      The duration of the study is approximately 187 days. Five study visits will take place, over
      a time period of 6.5 months, followed by a telephone call after 12 months.

      The purpose of the study is to learn more about the molecular mechanisms underlying the
      cross-neutralizing capacity of AS04-adjuvanted HPV vaccine (Cervarix®) in comparison with the
      aluminiumhydroxyphosphate sulphate adjuvanted HPV vaccine (Gardasil®).
