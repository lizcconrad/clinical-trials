  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective study of an in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay planned to
      enroll 632 subjects. The study will be conducted in two stages: Stage A is aimed at
      identifying individual biomarkers and constructing a multi-parametric diagnostic model,
      whereas Stage B is aimed at testing the multi-parametric diagnostic model using a fresh
      cohort of patients.

      A collection of clinical, radiological and laboratory data will be gathered in order to
      establish a final diagnosis. Blood samples will be analyzed and the levels of approximately
      700 and 250,000 biomarkers will be determined using immunoassays and molecular measurements
      respectively.

      A final diagnosis will be determined based on a majority decision of a panel of three or more
      independent physicians. Based on the final diagnosis, the accuracy of individual biomarkers
      and combined sets of biomarkers for differentiating between distinct groups of patients will
      be evaluated.

        Eligible subjects aged one month of age and older from both genders that attend the
        hospital or the emergency room (ER) due to a suspected acute infectious disease or due to a
        non-infectious disease (e.g. Trauma).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who are at least one month old and are willing (either the subject or his legal
        guardian) to sign an informed consent will be eligible for inclusion. For the infectious
        and non-infectious disease groups, additional inclusion criteria have to be met. These will
        include:

        In the Infectious disease group:

          -  Peak fever &gt;37.5°C (99.5°F)

          -  Clinical suspicion of an acute infectious disease

          -  Symptoms duration ≤ 12 days

        In the Non-infectious disease control group:

        - A non-infectious disease or healthy individuals

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who will meet one or more of the following criteria will be excluded from the
        study:

          -  Evidence of another episode of acute infectious disease in the last two weeks

          -  Diagnosed congenital immune deficiency (CID)

          -  Current treatment with immunosuppressive therapy such as: Active
             chemotherapy,Post-transplant drugs,High dose steroids (&gt;1 mg/kg/day prednisone or
             equivalent).

          -  Active radiotherapy

          -  Immune-modulating/suppressive drugs including monoclonal antibodies, intravenous
             immunoglobulin (IVIG), cyclosporine, and anti-TNF agents

          -  Current treatment with immune stimulants such as: Interleukin (IL)-2,
             Granulocyte-Monocytes/Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM/G-CSF),Interferon.

          -  An active hematological malignancy

          -  A diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disease

          -  A proven or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, hepatitis B virus (HBV),
             or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
