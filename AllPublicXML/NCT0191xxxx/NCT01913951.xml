  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of vosaroxin when given
      together with azacitidine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as vosaroxin and azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

          -  Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome and one of the following:

               -  Cytopenias requiring red blood cell and/or platelet transfusions or neutropenia
                  (ANC &lt;1 X109/L)

               -  IPSS score of INT-1 or higher at screening

               -  MDS with excess blasts in transformation as defined by FAB criteria (20-29% bone
                  marrow blasts) or

               -  Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

               -  serum creatinine within normal institutional limits or estimated creatinine
                  clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the Cockcroft-Gault equation

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her
             treating physician immediately.

          -  Patients may have received up to 3 prior cycles of hypomethylator therapy (i.e.
             decitabine or azacitidine) prior to enrollment and may have received supportive care
             measures (growth factors, erythropoietin stimulating agents, transfusion, etc.

          -  Either enrolled in HRPO# 201011766 (&quot;Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of Genetic
             Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases&quot;), which facilitates collection of blood,
             bone marrow, and skin for correlative studies, or consents to collection of blood,
             bone marrow, and skin as part of this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with four or more cycles of hypomethylator therapy.

             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are
             seropositive because of hepatitis B virus vaccine are eligible. Patients who are
             seropositive for HCV, but have a negative viral load are also eligible. Documentation
             that the patients have completed a course of therapy for HCV is required and will be
             obtained.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
