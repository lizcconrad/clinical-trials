  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) represent a significant
      subgroup of pediatric urology patients, comprising up to 30 percent of some out-patient
      clinics. These children present with urinary tract infections (UTIs), abnormal voiding habits
      and various other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTs) such as incontinence, urinary urgency
      and urinary frequency. Furthermore, the effects of NLUTD on a child's physical health, mental
      health and its potential negative clinical sequelae, which includes upper or lower urinary
      tract damage, must be taken into account when treating these children. These patients have
      complex needs requiring a significant amount of health teaching and it is imperative to
      determine the effectiveness of the various modes of delivering urotherapy. To determine the
      best modality to deliver urotherapy, this trial will compare the effectiveness of a 7 minute
      bladder training video to the effectiveness of standard urotherapy provided at a pediatric
      urology clinic at improving NLUTD/DES symptoms and quality of life in children between 5-10
      years of age.
