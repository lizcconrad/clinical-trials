  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the second most incident cancer among male population worldwide. Radiation
      therapy by itself or along with surgery and chemotherapy are the main treatments for prostate
      cancer however prostate cancer cells are only modestly responsive or even unresponsive to the
      cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy. Recently some in vitro and in vivo studies showed
      radiosensitizing and radioprotective effects for curcumin. No clinical trial has been done in
      this area and it is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective with or without
      curcumin supplements in treating patients with prostate cancer.

    <description>To assess this outcome the results of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)will be compared between the 2 groups 1 week before radiation therapy and 3 months after radiotherapy completion. Also prostate specific antigen (PSA)rebound will be compared between the 2 groups after 1 year. Side effects of treatment during 1 year after treatment completion will be compared between the 2 groups using questionnaires and physical examination</description>
