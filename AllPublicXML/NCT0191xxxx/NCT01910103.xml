      Diagnostic performance of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) would be not inferior to the
      that of breast ultrasound in women with dense breast.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Patients with dense breast will be examined for the detection of breast cancer by
           imaging studies.

        2. The imaging including digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), physician-performed bilateral
           whole breast ultrasonography will be performed according to a standard
           protocol.Interpretation will be conducted independently and classified according to the
           Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) by experienced radiologists.

        3. Definitive information about the presence of malignancy will be obtained by biopsy
           directed by the imaging method best depicting the lesion with 14-g or 11-g needle
           devices or needle localized excision. The absence of breast cancer was determined by
           means of biopsy, the absence of positive findings on repeat imaging and clinical
           examination, or both at follow-up.

        4. The diagnostic yield of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) compared to ultrasonography
           will be assessed.

    <measure>Diagnostic performance (AUC: area of under ROC curve) of DBT and US</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be an analysis of the diagnostic performance of DBT to that of US for detecting breast cancer in the screening and diagnostic setting. The hypothesis is that DBT is not inferior to US for detecting breast cancer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnostic sensitivity, sensitivity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of DBT and US for detecting breast cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate diagnostic sensitivity (%), sensitivity (%), negative predictive value (%), and positive predictive alue (%) of the DBT and US for the detection of breast cancer on a per-patient basis by using a BI-RADS score of 4 or 5 considered as test-positive and a BI-RADS score of 1, 2, or 3 considered as test-negative.
Cases of women undergoing biopsy with malignant disease results were considered disease-positive. Cases of women with concordant benign biopsy results and women not undergoing biopsy with no evidence of breast malignancy after 1 year of clinical follow-up were considered diase-negative.</description>
