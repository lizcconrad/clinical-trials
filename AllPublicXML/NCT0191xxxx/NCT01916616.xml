  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD) is characterized by involuntary closure of the vocal cords while
      inhaling. Children and adolescents with VCD may experience multiple symptoms, including
      difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, neck tightness, and voice changes. There is limited
      information on optimal management of VCD. In our proposed study, we will use
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to change how patients respond to their VCD
      symptoms. Measurements of airflow during breathing as well as symptom frequency and intensity
      will be examined prior to and following a series of four therapy sessions with a clinical
      psychologist that are focused on teaching patients strategies to decrease symptom reactivity.

    <intervention_name>Four therapy sessions with a psychologist utilizing cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques</intervention_name>
    <description>At the four therapy sessions, subjects will work with the psychologist to identify the triggers of their VCD episodes, learn to self-monitor symptoms and reactions, and be taught breathing retraining/relaxation techniques. The goal is to decrease patterns of subjects' thinking or behaviors that exacerbate distress from VCD symptoms.</description>
