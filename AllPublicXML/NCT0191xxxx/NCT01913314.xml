    <textblock>
      This type of study is called a radiolabeled study. For this study, LY2835219 (study drug) has
      been specially prepared to contain radiolabeled carbon [14C]. [14C] is a naturally occurring
      radioactive form of the element carbon. This study will help understand how the drug appears
      in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered.

      In addition, this study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of
      LY2835219 when given to healthy participants. Information about any side effects that may
      occur will also be collected.

      This study will last about 3 weeks for each participant, not including screening.
