  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is associated
      with reductions in quality of life, functional status, cardiac performance, and overall
      survival.1 Catheter ablation, which is centered on electrical isolation of triggering foci
      within the pulmonary veins (PVI) through circumferential lesions around PV ostia, has been
      shown to result in sustained improvements in quality of life, decreased hospitalizations and,
      potentially, improved survival.2-4 PVI can be accomplished by percutaneous catheter-based
      thermo-coagulation (burning) with radiofrequency (RF) energy delivery or alternatively by
      thermo-cooling (freezing) with a cryoballoon catheter.5 Cryothermal ablation with a
      cryoballoon catheter offers an efficacious means to achieve PVI that is safer than the
      established technique. Although cryoballoon ablation has been used in clinical practice for
      sometime, the optimal duration of cryoballoon ablation has not been determined. Moreover, the
      biophysics of cryo-lesion formation suggests that repeated short freezes
      (&quot;freeze-thaw-freeze&quot; cycles) may be more efficacious in achieving deep homogenous lesion
      when compared to prolonged freezing durations. This grant proposal is to verify if repeated
      short freezing cycles are more efficacious (i.e., fewer recurrence of AF), and safer, than
      the established standard of long, single freeze cycles.
