      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a chronic disorder occurring in 2-3% of the
      population. BPD is accompanied by high levels of co-existing psychiatric and physical
      disorders. One key predictor is persistent and recurring major depressive disorder.

      Since BPD is most closely linked with mood disorders and depression in particular, the use of
      antidepressant medications to treat the disorder is logical. However, to date, there are no
      FDA approved treatments for BPD. The American Psychiatric Association's Treatment Guidelines
      for Borderline Personality Disorder recommend antidepressants as a primary treatment of the
      disorder.

      Earlier trials using antidepressants that increase certain brain chemicals, such as,
      serotonin and noradrenalin have shown efficacy in controlling the mood swings of the illness
      for many people. These studies also document efficacy in controlling physical disorders,
      including headaches, migraines, irritable bowel, neurodermatitis (skin rash), fibromyalgia,
      premenstrual syndrome, and tempomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ).

      group of antidepressants known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have also been shown
      to be effective in BPD patients. The oral form of these medications was accompanied by
      dietary restrictions, potential drug interactions, blood pressure changes and weight gain.

      Selegiline, a MAOI antidepressant, was put into a skin patch delivery system (transdermal)
      that reduced the side-effect profile. Trials without placebo control showed many individuals
      with BPD benefit from the selegiline skin patch. This trial will look at individuals on the
      selegiline and placebo to make sure the selegiline is or is not effective in treating BPD.

    <description>The study subject will complete the SCL 90-R questionnaire at each visit on arrival at the office prior to meeting with the research staff. This will serve as the primary efficacy measure of outcome for the study. This instrument has been utilized in clinical trials since the early 1960s, and has a good ability to measure overall levels of psychological and physical functioning in this patient group.</description>

    <description>Study subjects will be monitored for safety throughout the study beginning at the Screening Visit (V1). At each visit, subjects will have various clinical, laboratory and safety measurements conducted. Results will be assessed by the clinical team and will be monitored, at each visit, until the term of their participation. A 2 week, post-study, follow-up will be conducted by the study staff.</description>
