      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy and tolerance of intra-hepatic administration
      of Yttrium 90-labelled microsphere (Theraspheres®, Nordion) in association with intravenous
      chemotherapy with Gemcitabin and Cisplatin for the treatment of intra-hepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.
