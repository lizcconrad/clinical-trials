  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to determine whether comprehensive cardiac
      rehabilitation is superior to usual disease management in the treatment of patients with
      heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFpEF) recently discharged after an acute
      heart failure event.

      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of bi-weekly structured exercise training and
      interaction with medical personnel will lead to a greater reduction in all cause
      hospitalization and mortality while providing additional functional and clinical benefits
      such as exercise capacity, quality of life and well-being.

      Furthermore the investigators seek to establish clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic
      predictors of hospital readmissions and cardiovascular events in the predefined HFpEF
      population.

  <detailed_description>

      Our primary objective is to test the hypothesis that comprehensive multi-disciplinary cardiac
      rehabilitation program is superior to usual care in the treatment of patients with HFpEF
      discharged after an acute heart failure event, and will result in a 25% reduction in the
      composite outcome of all cause hospitalizations and all-cause mortality after 1-year of
      follow-up. This objective represents both safety and efficacy end-point in a patient
      population with a high rate of co-morbidities, which may be affected as well. Previous
      observation has shown that these patients have a high rate of non-cardiac death in comparison
      with HFrEF, thus enhancing the importance of all-cause hospitalization and mortality as a
      primary end-point.

      Secondary end-points that will be recorded include separate components of the primary
      end-point, time to first hospitalization, functional capacity measured by NYHA class,
      6-minute walk test (6MWT), blood pressure during rest and exercise, fasting glucose and Hb
      A1C levels, BNP values and quality of life EQ5-D questionnaire.

    <description>Patients randomized to the multidisciplinary cardiac management program at the cardiac rehabilitation center will undergo evaluation by a trained rehabilitation physician and physiologist. The evaluation will include medical history, physical examination, vitals, review of post discharge graded exercise stress test and nursing staff consultation. Exercise prescription will be based on a pre-specified protocol in accordance with ESC position paper on cardiac rehabilitation of patients with heart failure.</description>

    <description>Patients will participate in a 6-month cardiac rehabilitation program, consisting of structured, 60-minutes, bi-weekly exercise training sessions according to a predefined protocol. Institutional activity will be complemented by 120 minutes weekly home exercise prescribed by specialist in cardiac rehabilitation. Exercise prescription will be based on a symptom limited exercise test when clinically feasible and according with the patients' functional capacity, medical history and physiological values obtained prior to exercise. Target heart rate will be set initial as 50-60% of heart rate reserve and gradually increased up to 80% of HRR. Aerobic exercise will be complemented by resistance training of low intensity.</description>
