    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to assess whether selecting mature sperm using PICSI (selecting
      for sperm that bind hyaluronan) can optimize the IVF outcome of ICSI .

      Aim

        1. Primary outcome: To compare routine sperm selection using ICSI with sperm selection
           using PICSI plates in terms of implantation and fertilization rates for couples with
           male factor fertility

        2. Secondary outcome : To compare live birth rates ,ongoing pregnancies and miscarriage
           rates for couples with male factor infertility using routine sperm selection with ICSI
           compared to using PICSI plates for sperm selection

      Hypothesis:

      Sperm selected for ICSI using (PICSI) will reveal increased implantation rates in comparison
      to sperm selected for conventional ICSI

    <description>PICSI dish ( MidAtlantic Diagnostics Inc) has been developed to select the specific sperm to be used for the ICSI procedure using the same principles as the Sperm Hyaluronan Binding Assay. HA-mediated ICSI sperm selection( PICSI) uses Falcon Petri dishes that feature three microdots of hyaluronan hydrogel attached to the interior bottom: mature, biochemically competent spermatozoa bind to hyaluronan, where they can be isolated and used for ICSI</description>

    <description>If the oocytes are randomized to ICSI during the retrieval they will be ordered by the 1,4,5 8th best oocyte and PICSI to the 2,3, 6 7th best oocytes or the reverse if PICSI is selected. If one cohort is superior that cohort should be chosen by the blinded physician and the alternate cohort frozen or discarded based on their quality. This will ensure that the couple will always have the opportunity to have good quality embryo transferred regardless of how they are randomized. If there are no good quality embryos in the selected cycle we will consider it a failed transfer for that cycle and we will transfer the good quality embryos from the non- selected group as a fresh embryo transfer. For example if a couple is randomized to ICSI and all the ICSI embryos are poor quality but the PICSI embryos are good quality we will consider it a failed ICSI transfer and transfer the PICSI embryos as a fresh embryo transfer.</description>
