      To quantitatively analyze the T2* values of the head, body, and tail of normal pancreas, and
      observe the value of GRE T2*-weighted MRI in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and the
      relationship between the T2* value and the severity of AP.

  <detailed_description>

      1. We design a prospective study about &quot;Magetic Resonance Imaging Study of Acute
           Pancreatitis&quot;.

        2. We apply for an account and register our study on the clinicalTrials.

        3. In patients with acute pancreatitis, imaging is recommended to confirm the clinical
           diagnosis, investigate the etiology, and grade the severity of the disease . MR had the
           excellent resolution of soft tissue，and it has earned an ever more important role in the
           diagnosis of AP. With the continuous development of MR scanning techniques, the sequence
           of a multi-echo gradient recalled echo (GRE) T2*-weighted imaging (T2*WI), which
           acquires a spin echo signal, T2* relaxation acquires a gradient echo signal, is a
           relatively new MRI technique. The sequence of a GRE T2*WI requires high uniformity of
           the magnetic field, plus it can provide the T2* value, which can indirectly reflect
           changes in tissue biochemical components, thus it can be used for the early diagnosis
           quantitative diagnosis of some diseases .

        4. This calculation process for T2* value is completed using post-processing software on
           the workstation(Advantage workstation 4.4; GE Halthcare) directly after scanning.

        5. AP is a process of inflammation diffusion, in which cell edema will lead to hydrogen
           proton increase. In the inflammatory exudation process, T2* value will change. So we
           conduct our research. In this study, we will observe pancreas in the normal pancreas and
           AP, and discuss the relationship between T2* value and that of AP graded by the MR
           severity index (MRSI) and Acute Physiology And Chronic Healthy Evaluation II (APACHE II)
           scores.

        6. However, until now, there is no research on the sequence applied in the patients with
           AP.
