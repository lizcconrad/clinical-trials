      1. To examine whether Ritalin has analgesic properties in healthy subjects.

        2. To examine if Ritalin analgesic effect is a pain specific phenomenon or a part of a
           broader, non-specific effect on high mental functions.

    <description>The study will include two sessions which will be conducted at the same time of the day, one week apart from each other. Each session will last approximately 6 hours. In each session subjects will be exposed to baseline experimental pain models and auditory tests. Then they will receive either one MP SR 20 mg tablet or an identical looking placebo.</description>
