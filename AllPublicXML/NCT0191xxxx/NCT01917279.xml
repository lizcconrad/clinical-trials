    <textblock>
      It is a phase III trial to explore the efficacy and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with
      Capecitabine versus intermittent Capecitabine as maintenance therapy following first-line
      Capecitabine plus Docetaxel chemotherapy in treatment of HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer(mBC).
