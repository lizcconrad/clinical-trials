  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the potential of semi-quantitative pregnancy tests as part of assisted fertility care,
      the investigators would like to document the feasibility and acceptability of a
      semi-quantitative pregnancy test as an adjunct to or replacement of current monitoring
      protocols to offer women and health care providers a new choice of diagnostic tools to
      confirm early pregnancy. The pilot will help us to better understand how this tool
      complements existing monitoring protocols. If a suitable addition or replacement to repeat
      blood draws for serum hCG assessment, the SQPT could also contribute to efforts to make
      assisted fertility treatments more patient-friendly. This study seeks to test this innovation
      by asking women assigned to perform a Quanti5 Multilevel hCG Pregnancy Test (Athenium
      Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Nashville, TN) at home on a weekly basis for up to 4 weeks after egg
      retrieval/embryo transfer or intrauterine insemination.

      The investigators hypothesize that the test, which can be used at home by women, will provide
      confirmation of the presence of a pregnancy compared with standard serum hCG testing because
      1) it has sensitivity and specificity that correlates well with serum testing, and 2) it can
      be used at home and thus earlier to determine presence of hCG.

    <measure>Feasibility of women using this test at home</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of women using this test at home on their own as a potential future substitute or complement to standard sequential clinic-based visits to monitor pregnancy after embryo transfer or IUI. Forms given to document their results at home will include questions on feasibility. Exit interview will also include questions regarding feasibility.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of using semi-quantitative pregnancy at home instead of tests standard clinic-based monitoring after embryo transfer or IUI. Forms given to document their results at home will include questions on acceptability. Exit interview will also include questions regarding acceptability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effectiveness of written instructions and provider's counseling</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assess if written instructions and provider's counseling enable women using the semi-quantitative pregnancy test at home to understand how it should be used and to correctly interpret the test result. Forms given to document their results at home will include questions on whether the oral and written instructions helped interpret the results. Exit interview will be conducted to determine how the additional information made the participant feel about conducting the test (i.e. more relaxed, less relaxed, or no difference).</description>
