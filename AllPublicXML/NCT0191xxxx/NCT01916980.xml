  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of up to 12 weeks of desloratadine in Japanese
      participants with eczema/dermatitis and dermal pruritus. The primary hypothesis of this study
      is that the sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores for both the
      eczema/dermatitis group and the dermal pruritus group will be significantly improved at Week
      2 compared to Baseline.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus/Itch Score (Sum of Daytime and Nighttime Scores) Assessed by the Investigator at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Week 2 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of participant pruritus/itch during the daytime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot relax because of constant itching) and nighttime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot sleep because of itching). The sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores could range from 0 to 8, with a higher sum score indicating greater severity. The change from Baseline in the sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores at Week 2 clinic visit was calculated.</description>

    <description>An AE is any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug is also an AE.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Day 3 Visit, Week 1 Visit, Week 4 Visit, Week 6 Visit, Week 8 Visit, Week 12 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of participant pruritus/itch during the daytime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot relax because of constant itching) and nighttime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot sleep because of itching). The sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores could range from 0 to 8, with a higher sum score indicating greater severity. The changes from Baseline in the sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores at the Day 3, Week 1, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 12 clinic visits were calculated.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Moderate or Remarkable Improvement in the Global Improvement Rate of Pruritus/Itch Assessed by the Investigator at Day 3, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Day 3 Visit, Week 1 Visit, Week 2 Visit, Week 4 Visit, Week 6 Visit, Week 8 Visit, Week 12 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The global improvement judgment criteria were used to assess overall improvement in pruritus/itch. The Investigator assessed the degree of severity of pruritus/itch based on 5 grades (1=Remarkably improved to 5=Aggravated) at Baseline and subsequent clinic visits. The percentages of participants who were remarkably improved (Grade 1=Pruritus/itch disappeared) or moderately improved (Grade 2=Pruritus/itch was greatly improved) at the Day 3, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 12 clinic visits were calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Day 3 Visit, Week 1 Visit, Week 2 Visit, Week 4 Visit, Week 6 Visit, Week 8 Visit, Week 12 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed the degree of their pruritus using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS; 0mm=No itch, 100mm=Worst imaginable itch) at Baseline and subsequent clinic visits. Pruritus/itch VAS scores could range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more severe pruritus/itching. The changes from Baseline in the VAS scores for pruritus/itch at the Day 3, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 12 clinic visits were calculated.</description>

The sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores could range from 0 to 8, with a higher sum score indicating greater severity. Baseline values were assessed based on the participant diary for two days before the Baseline clinic visit and on the participant interview at the Baseline clinic visit.</description>

          <title>Participant-assessed Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Baseline</title>
          <description>Participants assessed the degree of their pruritus using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS; 0mm=No itch, 100mm=Worst imaginable itch) at Baseline. Pruritus VAS scores could range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more severe itching. Baseline was defined as the participant evaluation at the day before the Baseline clinic visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pruritus/Itch Score (Sum of Daytime and Nighttime Scores) Assessed by the Investigator at Week 2</title>
        <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of participant pruritus/itch during the daytime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot relax because of constant itching) and nighttime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot sleep because of itching). The sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores could range from 0 to 8, with a higher sum score indicating greater severity. The change from Baseline in the sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores at Week 2 clinic visit was calculated.</description>

        <description>The global improvement judgment criteria were used to assess overall improvement in pruritus/itch. The Investigator assessed the degree of severity of pruritus/itch based on 5 grades (1=Remarkably improved to 5=Aggravated) at Baseline and subsequent clinic visits. The percentages of participants who were remarkably improved (Grade 1=Pruritus/itch disappeared) or moderately improved (Grade 2=Pruritus/itch was greatly improved) at the Day 3, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 12 clinic visits were calculated.</description>
