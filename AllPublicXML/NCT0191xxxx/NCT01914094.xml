  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low levels of physical fitness increase the risk of death in patients with cardiovascular
      disease. Although cardiac rehabilitation programs improve the health of patients after heart
      surgery, most patients are not referred until after surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study was to determine if an exercise &quot;pre-habilitation&quot; (i.e., Prehab) program before heart
      surgery would improve the health of patients before surgery and whether these improvements
      would be maintained after surgery.

      The investigators hypothesized that Prehab would promote the health of patients before heart
      surgery, and these improvements would be maintained three months post-operatively, as
      compared to patients who received standard care.

      This was a single-centre, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted in Canada to
      determine the feasibility and efficacy of an exercise and education &quot;pre-habilitation&quot; (i.e.,
      Prehab) program before elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). We recruited 17
      patients who were scheduled to undergo elective CABG surgery from February 2011-May 2012.
      Enrolled patients were assessed at baseline, one week pre-operatively, and three months
      post-operatively.
