      This study is to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture for alleviating the upper
      abdominal pain of cancer patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurolytic celiac plexus block (NCPB) is a commonly performed procedure in patients with
      intractable pain due to malignancies involving the upper and mid abdomen. Recently,
      acupuncture is used as one of alternative interventions to treat cancer-related pains. This
      pilot study aims to investigate the effectiveness of pain-relief of acupuncture via comparing
      acupuncture plus NCPB with NCPB alone. Total 14 cancer patients with NCPB will be randomized
      into two groups of acupuncture and control.

    <description>The patients will be required to document 100mm pain VAS, where '0' represents 'no pain' and '100', 'unbearable pain'. The change of pain will be reported by comparing the mean VAS before treatment, after 1 week, after 2 week, and 1 week follow-up.</description>
