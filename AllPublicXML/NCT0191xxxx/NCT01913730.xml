             ligation; partner's vasectomy; Additional Effective Methods: Latex condom; Diaphragm;
             Cervical Cap) for 4 weeks prior to beginning study drug therapy, during study drug
             therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of
             therapy.

          5. Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or
             abstinence) during study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks
             after discontinuation of bortezomib therapy.

          6. Patient was previously diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on standard criteria.

          7. Patient is relapsed or refractory after one to three lines of treatment and the last
             one must be a bortezomib-containing regimen, without evidence of progressive disease.

          8. Patient had previously received at least 4 cycles of a salvage treatment containing
             bortezomib, before enrolment, without evidence of progressive disease.

          9. Patient must be enrolled and start therapy within 45 days from the completion of the
             last salvage cycle containing Bortezomib.

         10. Before the salvage treatment with bortezomib-based regimens, patient must have
             measurable disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness that
