      The goal of this research study is to better understand if taking part in physical activity
      might help smokers quit.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will visit the Windsor Village United Methodist
      Church 9 times. You will also receive help to quit smoking. You may or may not also be
      enrolled in an exercise program.

      Visits to the Windsor Village United Methodist Church:

      These visits will be 3, 2, and 1 week(s) before you quit smoking, on your quit day, and 1, 2,
      3, 4, and 8 weeks after you quit smoking. Each visit may last about 1 hour to 1 ½ hours.

      During these visits:

        -  You will complete questionnaires about your feelings, moods, smoking habits, and
           behaviors (such as physical activity). The questionnaires should take about 45 minutes
           total to complete.

        -  You will complete a breath test. The breath test is used to find the amount of tobacco
           smoke that a person consumes. For this test, you will blow air through a tube into a
           measuring device.

        -  At 3 of these visits, your heart rate will also be tested. For this test, you will put
           on a wrist watch and a belt band and sit quietly for 5 minutes while the equipment
           measures your heart rate.

        -  At 4 of these visits, your height, weight, and waist and hip circumference will also be
           measured. To measure your waist and hip circumference, you may be asked to lift your
           shirt to expose your stomach area and lower your pants to expose your mid-hip area.
           Height, weight, and waist and hip circumference measurements take about 10 minutes and
           are performed in a private area.

      Quitting Smoking:

      You will receive help to quit smoking, including counseling about quitting smoking and a
      6-week supply of the nicotine patch. The counseling will be over the phone about 1-2 weeks
      before your scheduled quit day.

      Study Groups for Physical Activity:

      In addition to the visits listed above, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice)
      to be in 1 of 3 groups. You will have an equal chance of being in any group.

        -  Group 1 will not include any physical activity.

        -  Group 2 will start a walking program 2 weeks before their quit day and finish it 2 weeks
           after their quit day.

        -  Group 3 will start the walking program on their quit day and finish it 4 weeks after
           their quit day.

      All participants (Groups 1, 2, and 3) will wear an accelerometer for 5 weeks during the
      study. An accelerometer is a small device that you wear on a belt clip or an elastic belt
      near the hip during the day. It records how active you are.

      You will receive an accelerometer at your study visit 3 weeks before you quit smoking. You
      will wear it during the following times:

        -  For 14 days in a row beginning 3 weeks before you quit smoking.

        -  For 7 days beginning on the quit date.

        -  For 7 days beginning on the visit 2 weeks following your quit date.

        -  For 7 days beginning on the visit 4 weeks following your quit date.

      You should bring the accelerometer to each study visit so it can be recharged and the
      information can be downloaded. You will be given a prepaid envelope to return the
      accelerometer after the last recording.

      Physical Activity Groups 2 and 3:

      If you are in Group 2 or 3, you will take part in a walking program for 5 weeks. You will
      walk about 150 minutes (about 2 ½ hours) a week.

      You will receive a Walking Guide with instructions about how to do the exercises, which will
      also contain other tips for the walking program.

      Final Visit:

      All participants will take part in a final focus group. This focus group will take place
      sometime after the study visit 8 weeks after you quit smoking. This will take about 1 hour.
      You will be asked what you think about the program, including what you liked, did not like,
      and how you think it could be improved. If you want to provide this feedback but you cannot
      come to the focus group, you may provide feedback in another way (such as a phone interview
      or you could meet the study staff at the church). These focus groups/interviews will be audio
      recorded. Your name and identifying information will be deleted from the recording before
      being transcribed (typed out) by an outside party.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after the final focus group visit.

      Additional Information:

      Study staff may call you on your home and/or cell phone or contact you by e-mail to remind
      you about your study visits and/or to do your walking activity.

      If the accelerometer is lost or stolen, you will not be responsible for the replacement cost,
      but you should tell the study staff right away.

      If you do not come to the study visits listed above, researchers may call and ask about your
      smoking status. They may also schedule a visit to your home or office to take a breath
      sample.

      Your home address may be used to access public information about the area where you live.
      This is to help researchers learn about how your neighborhood encourages physical activity.
      The results from this study will only be reported as a group and you will not be identifiable
      from any products resulting from this study (such as research papers). Your home address will
      never be released or published in any form. Your address will be stored separately from other
      study data, and only the study chair will be able to see the data after the neighborhood
      information has been collected.

      Other Information:

      If the study staff thinks that any of your responses while on the study suggest signs of
      severe depression or show you are expressing suicidal ideation, a qualified member of the
      study staff will be contacted to review your risk of suicide. Based on that review, study
      staff will take steps to protect your safety, which can range from giving you a list of
      resources for mental health services to the contacting the police if they feel you are in
      immediate danger.

      Plan for Data Destruction:

      After the study is complete, the data are analyzed, and the manuscript/s are written, access
      to the de-identified data files will be limited to the study chair and research staff, who
      will keep the files on the MD Anderson computer server in case there are any questions about
      the data. Your data will be kept for 10 years after the study is completed but no later than
      1/01/2025. After that time, data will be completely deleted.

      This is an investigational study. The nicotine patch used in this study is FDA approved and
      commercially available.

      Up to 45 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
