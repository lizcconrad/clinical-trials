    <textblock>
      This study is looking at differences in metabolism and functional imaging between pulmonary
      hypertension subjects with normal right ventricular function and persistent right ventricular
      dysfunction. We will also measure right ventricular metabolic and structural changes using
      serial 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG PET/CT and cardiac MRI as response to treatment with
      ranolazine. Subjects undergo imaging procedures at week 0 and week 26 (optional for normal
      function patients). This is a companion imaging trial for patients who are eligible for the
      treatment trial entitled &quot;A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study
      to assess the effect of ranolazine on outcomes in subjects with pulmonary hypertension and
      right ventricular dysfunction accompanied by a comparative study of cellular metabolism in
      subjects with pulmonary hypertension with and without right ventricular dysfunction&quot;.
      Subjects must enroll in companion treatment protocol to qualify for the imaging protocol.
