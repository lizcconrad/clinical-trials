      This aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of endometrioma and laparoscopic cystectomy
      on ovarian reserve as measured by serum antimullerian hormone and to study the different
      effects of levels of serum antimullerian hormone between laparoscopic cystectomy and the
      non-ovarian pelvic surgery.
