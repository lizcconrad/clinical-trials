      The purpose of this study is the evaluation and comparison of blood pressure variability
      indices and ambulatory arterial stiffness index obtained by ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring as prognostic indicators in the functional outcome of acute ischemic stroke.

    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients admitted with acute (within 24 hours after stroke onset) ischemic
      stroke in three University Hospital of Northern and Central Greece will be included.

      Blood pressure measurements are being obtained with ambulatory 24-hour BP monitoring (ABPM)
      every 20 minutes within 24 hours of admission using automated oscillometric device (TM2430,
      A&amp;D Company Ltd) during day-time (7:00-22:59) and night-time (23:00-6:59).

      Several clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters are prospectively registered. Also,
      patients' medical history, previous medical treatment and cardiovascular risk factors are
      registered.

      Functional outcome is assessed by the modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months. Also, stroke
      recurrence and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality will be assessed.
