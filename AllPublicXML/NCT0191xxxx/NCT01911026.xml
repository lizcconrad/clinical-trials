  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective bowel preparation is important for examination of the entire colon adequately and
      for identifying colonic lesions during colonoscopy. However, it is well known that bowel
      preparation of inpatients is much poorer than that of outpatients. Our goal is to improve
      bowel preparations with reinforcement of nurse education that explains the steps required for
      bowel preparation for inpatients undergoing colonoscopies. The education will focus on
      explaining the purpose of a screening colonoscopy, the rationale for bowel preparation, the
      pre-colonoscopy diet, and the instructions for completing the laxative. Patients in the
      control group will receive the standard written bowel preparation instructions, while
      patients in the intervention group will receive standard written instructions plus a
      explanation from reinforcement-educated nurse. The investigators hypothesize that patients
      received a explanation from reinforcement-educated nurses will lead to improved patient
      compliance and a better bowel preparation. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that a
      better quality bowel preparation will improve detection of colonic polyps and patients'
      satisfaction for colonoscopy.
