      The purpose of this research study is to: test the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      (PK testing, the study of how the body absorbs, distributes, breaks down and eliminates a
      drug) of a single dose of the investigational study drug NBI-98854 in subjects with normal
      hepatic function or mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.
