    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, balanced, single center, single dose, trial to assess the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of OCA, glyco-OCA and tauro-OCA on an empty stomach (fasted
      condition) and following a high fat, high calorie meal (fed condition) in a 2-period,
      2-sequence, crossover manner.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are required to meet the following criteria in order to be included in the trial.

          1. Male or female subjects from 18 to 55 years

          2. Contraception: Female subjects must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or if
             premenopausal, be prepared to use more than 1 effective (≤ 1% failure rate) method of
             contraception during the trial and until at least 30 days after the last dose of OCA.
             Effective methods of contraception are considered to be:

               1. Double barrier method, ie, (a) condom (male or female) with spermicide or (b)
                  diaphragm with spermicide

               2. Intrauterine device (IUD)

               3. Vasectomy

          3. Good general health as determined by medical history, and by results of physical
             examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests
             obtained within 14 days prior to Day 0

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 28; BMI is determined by the following equation: BMI =
             weight/height2 (kg/m2).

          5. Willing to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and xanthine-containing food and beverages
             for 72 hours prior to each period check in and during participation of the inpatient
             periods of the trial

          6. Willing and able to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting the following criteria will be excluded from the trial.

          1. Prior participation in a clinical trial of OCA (INT-747; 6-ECDCA)

          2. History or presence of any disease or condition known to interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs including bile salt
             metabolism in the large intestine, eg, inflammatory bowel disease

          3. History of gastrointestinal surgeries or gall bladder removal (cholecystectomy)

          4. History or presence of a clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, diabetic,
             gastrointestinal, metabolic, neurologic, pulmonary, endocrine, psychiatric, or
             neoplastic disorder(s)

          5. History of known or suspected clinically significant hypersensitivity to any drug,
             aside from penicillin

          6. Ingestion of a prescription medication within 14 days prior to Day 0 or ingestion of
             an over the counter medication within 7 days prior to Day 0

          7. Participation in radiologic examinations involving parenteral administration of
             iodinated contrast materials within 2 weeks prior to screening, or subsequently,
             through the end of trial participation

          8. History or presence of alcohol abuse (defined as consumption of more than 210 mL of
             alcohol per week; or the equivalent of fourteen 4 ounces (oz) glasses of wine, or
             fourteen 12 oz cans/bottles of beer or wine coolers per week)

          9. History or presence of substance abuse within the past 2 years or positive drug screen
             tests

         10. Smoker or user of tobacco or nicotine products

         11. Any screening laboratory test for which the results are not within the normal
             reference range and considered clinically significant

         12. Participation in another investigational drug trial within 30 days prior to Day 0

         13. History of noncompliance to medical regimens, or subjects who are considered to be
             potentially unreliable

         14. Blood or plasma donation within 30 days prior to Day 0

         15. Mental instability or incompetence

         16. Presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B
             virus (HBV) at screening
