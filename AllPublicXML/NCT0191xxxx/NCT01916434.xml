      Consumption of fish can help to prevent cardiovascular disease. The precise way in which fish
      is beneficial is not fully understood. This is important to find out as fish consists of a
      complex mixture of fatty acids and micronutrients such as vitamin D and selenium that could
      individually, or collectively, be responsible for the beneficial effects.

      Fish farming in Scotland is playing an increasingly important role in the provision of fish
      for human consumption. But issues with sustainability of raw materials are requiring fish
      farming to reformulate fish diets, which may affect the levels of beneficial omega-3 fatty
      acids and other components in fish.

      In this study we will be comparing the long-term health effects of eating two portions a week
      of Scottish salmon raised on a traditional fish diet versus eating two portions a week of
      Scottish salmon raised on a more sustainable fish diet. In addition, we will be looking at
      differences in health outcomes when eating two portions a week of either Scottish salmon,
      compared with eating no fish at all.

      Aquaculture has the potential to take the pressure off wild fish stocks whilst meeting the
      dietary needs of the population for omega 3 fatty acids and other key nutrients such as
      vitamin D. The industry is working hard to improve sustainability - between 1995 and 2006 it
      has been estimated that the input to output ratios for salmon improved from 7.5 to 4.9 and
      trout from 6.0 to 3.4- but there is a need to do more. Reductions in fish stocks and catch
      quotas, in addition to sustainability considerations, mean that farmed fish may have to be
      raised on vegetable oils for example but this may reduce the omega 3 content and may affect
      the content of other nutrients. Fish are an important component of the diet and there is a
      need to understand the effect of pressures from sustainability on methods of production and
      the health giving properties of fish. We have now been commissioned by the Scottish
      Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS) to do
      research on the health effects of Scottish farmed fish fed different feeding regimes in the
      Scottish population, and assess how differential effects in measured health outcomes could be
      related to fish composition.

      Consumption of fish or omega-3- fatty acids from fish reduces coronary heart disease
      mortality, the leading cause of death in developed nations. The precise way in which fish
      provides benefit is not fully understood. This is important as fish and fish oils consist of
      a complex mixture of fatty acids and micronutrients that could individually, or collectively,
      be responsible for the beneficial effects. Aquaculture in Scotland is playing an increasingly
      important role in the provision of fish for human consumption, but issues with sustainability
      are requiring aquaculture to replace traditional fish oil and meal in formulated fish diets
      by oil from more sustainable sources, which may affect the levels of beneficial omega-3 fatty
      acids (EPA and DHA) and other components in fish. We will investigate the health effects of
      consuming two portions oily fish (Scottish farmed salmon) per week (current UK
      recommendation) using fish raised on different feeding regimes.

      HYPOTHESIS

      The health effects of consuming two portions oily fish (Scottish farmed salmon) per week
      (current UK recommendation) will be different for fish raised on different feeding regimes,
      primarily in terms of improving the omega-3 index.

      OBJECTIVE

      The main objective of this proposed study is to determine 1) whether the health benefits of
      consuming two portions of Scottish farmed salmon per week that have been fed a diet high in
      fish oil and fish meal significantly outweigh the health benefits of consuming two portions
      of Scottish farmed salmon per week that have been fed a diet with more sustainable levels of
      fish meal and fish oil, and 2) whether the difference in health benefits could justify the
      use of less sustainable dietary regimes for farmed fish.

    <measure>Change in the omega-3 index</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 18 weeks salmon consumption</time_frame>
    <description>The Omega-3 index will be measured by GC-MS. An optimal target level of the Omega-3 Index is 8%, and an undesirable level is less than 4%, with 4-8% being an intermediate-risk zone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cardiovascular risk markers</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 9 weeks and after 18 weeks salmon consumption</time_frame>
    <description>This study will include the measurement of standard risk markers of cardiovascular disease at the start, middle and end of the intervention period, including lipoprotein metabolism (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol) and metabolic markers (glucose, insulin, triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids to calculate HOMA-IR and revised QUICKI). We will also measure 24-hrs ambulatory blood pressure.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding time as measured by the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 18 weeks salmon consumption</time_frame>
    <description>The PFA-100 simulates high shear platelet function in citrated blood within disposable test cartridges with membranes coated with either collagen/epinephrine (CEPI) or collagen/ADP (CADP). The presence of these platelet activators and the high shear rates under the standardised conditions result in platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation resulting in formation of a platelet plug within the aperture. Platelet function is thus measured as a function of the time it takes to occlude the aperture.</description>

    <measure>Markers of coagulation and endothelial activation.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 18 weeks salmon consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Fibrinogen is a principle plasma glycoprotein involved in blood clotting. Plasma clottable fibrinogen levels will be measured by Clauss method on a semi-automated coagulometer using Fibrinogen assay thrombin reagent from Helena Biosciences, England. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is another plasma glycoprotein involved in coagulation and an established marker of endothelial activation or damage. Plasma levels of vWF will be measured by an in-house ELISA using polyclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody from DAKO Ltd, Denmark. P-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule present in platelet granules and (to a lesser extent) in endothelial cells. sP-selectin levels in fasted blood plasma will be measured in duplicate by ELISA (Bender Med Systems)</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Markers of inflammation.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 18 weeks salmon consumption</time_frame>
    <description>CRP is an acute phase protein synthesised by the liver in response to inflammatory stimuli, especially the cytokine IL-6. hsCRP will be measured in duplicate by an ultra sensitive, double antibody ELISA. Soluble -ICAM is a marker of endothelial activation and inflammation, during which it promotes leucocyte adherence to the endothelium. Plasma soluble I-CAM levels will be measured in duplicate by ELISA (Bender Med Systems). Epoxyeicosatrieonic acids (EETs) are anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective compounds. Their availability and metabolism are regulated by the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which in turn is affected by EPA. EETs will be measured in platelets using LC-MS/MS.</description>

    <measure>Markers of micronutrient availability</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 18 weeks salmon consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Selenium in incorporated into proteins within the body, many of which are antioxidants that protect the body against oxidative damage. Selenium is transported across the body within the protein, selenoprotein P (SEPP-1). Selenium status will be measured by assaying plasma selenium levels (by ICP-MS) and by quantification of plasma SEPP-1 levels (by an in-house ELISA). Iodine status will be measured by assaying urinary iodine levels (by ICP-MS) and vitamin D status will be assessed by measuring plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D (using HPLC and LC/MS/MS).</description>
