  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the NatroxTM Topical Oxygen
      device versus a placebo in patients with non-healing leg ulceration in conjunction with
      standard best practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened for two weeks before enrollment to assess whether their ulcers are
      &quot;non-healing&quot;, defined as a reduction in wound surface of &lt; 25% after two weeks of standard
      best practice wound care . On enrolment and randomisation to active or placebo treatment the
      patient will be treated for six weeks or until 100% epithelialisation, whichever is the
      sooner, and then treatment will revert to standard best practice, defined as moist wound
      healing plus compression where appropriate. The reference ulcer will be followed up at two
      weeks and then at six weeks after the end of the active treatment period.

    <description>Effectiveness of the NatroxTM Topical Oxygen Device will be established vs. Placebo in patients with non-healing leg ulceration in conjunction with best practice.

    <time_frame>Study End at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Statistical information on use of Natrox device and effectiveness on patients. Wound surface area will be measured in square centimetres as defined by wound mapping software. The wound surface area reduction between six weeks and baseline will then be calculated. Wound surface area will be measured at weekly intervals for the 6 weeks of active treatment and then at weeks 8 and 12 for follow up. The primary analysis will be an intent-to-treat analysis. A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used for all analyses. A general linear model taking into account the treatment groups and centres (surgical and dermatology clinics) as fixed effects and a baseline wound surface area as a covariate will be used to test the null hypothesis of similar effects in surface area reduction between treatment groups.</description>

    <description>The placebo comparator is a placebo version of the active device which is a system to deliver oxygen from an oxygen generator topically to the wound bed via a proprietary device.
The device will be applied to the wound and attached to the placebo oxygen generator and the generator switched on at the time of enrolment. Secondary dressings will then be applied. The device will be removed and reapplied at each dressing change for a treatment period of 6 weeks.</description>
