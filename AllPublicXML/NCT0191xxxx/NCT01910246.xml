  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that asymptomatic obese adolescents can demonstrate abnormal regional
      myocardial contraction, with preserved global cardiac function. Metformin has been shown to
      decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance,
      but the mechanism of cardiovascular protection is unknown.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the reversibility of subclinical cardiovascular
      abnormalities in obese adolescents with insulin resistance after a six-month course of
      Metformin. The investigators hypothesized that the beneficial effects of Metformin will be
      progressive and sustained after six months of therapy.

    <measure>Left Ventricular Circumferential Strain change after a six-month course of Metformin.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Circumferential strain will be measured by cardiac MRI before and after the treatment. Change in circumferential strain (measured as percentage from end-diastolic wall thickness) from baseline is the main outcome of this study. We hypothesize that abnormal baseline circumferential stain will increase and reach normal values after Metformin treatment. We hypothesized that the beneficial effects of Metformin will be progressive and sustained.</description>
