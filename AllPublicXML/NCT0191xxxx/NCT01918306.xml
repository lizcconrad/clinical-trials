      This phase I/II trial study evaluates the tolerability and best tolerated dose of the PI3K
      inhibitor GDC-0941 when given with the chemotherapy cisplatin. This study will also examine
      how well the combination of GDC-0941 and cisplatin work in treating patients with androgen
      receptor negative triple negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to
      receive cisplatin alone or cisplatin with GDC-0941 in the phase II portion. Those receiving
      cisplatin alone can receive GDC-0941 upon progression of their disease. Cisplatin is a
      chemotherapy which has been shown to be effective in treating triple negative breast cancer.
      Preclinical studies show that adding a PI3K inhibitor such as GDC-0941 to cisplatin may be a
      more effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of GDC-0941 when given in combination with
      cisplatin in patients with androgen receptor-negative (AR-) triple negative (TN) metastatic
      breast cancer (MBC): assessment of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 4 weeks
      of treatment (cycle 1); determination of the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      phase II dose of GDC-0941 given in combination with cisplatin. (Phase IB)

      II. To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by the overall response rate (ORR), of cisplatin +
      GDC-0941 versus cisplatin alone in patients with AR- TN MBC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of cisplatin + GDC-0941 in patients with AR-
      TN MBC.

      II. To determine the time to disease progression (TTP) of cisplatin + GDC-0941 versus
      cisplatin alone in patients with AR- TN MBC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize pharmacokinetics of GDC-0941 when administered in combination with
      cisplatin.

      II. To explore predictors of response and mechanisms of resistance based on exploratory
      analysis of tumor tissue obtained through biopsies.

      III. To assess the prognostic effects of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase,
      catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutations and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss on
      TTP and CBR.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-deescalation study of PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 followed by a
      randomized phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-6, 9-13, 16-20, and 23-27.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may
      crossover to Arm II upon disease progression.

      ARM II: Patients receive cisplatin as in Arm I and PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 PO QD on days 2-6,
      9-13, 16-20, and 23-27. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>GDC-0941 dose will start at 260 mg (maximum dose). De-escalation of the intensity of the dose (if necessary) will proceed among cohorts of 3 patients according to a standard 3+3 algorithm beginning at the highest dose level of GDC-0941 260mg.
MTD is defined as the highest dose at which a DLT is experienced &gt;= 1 out of 6 patients.
A cohort of 3 patients was initially enrolled in the GDC-0941 arm at dose 260mg PO days 2-6, 9-13, 16-20, 23-27 of 28 day cycle
If no patient in the first cohort of 3 experiences a DLT, an additional cohort of 3 patients will be treated at the same dose level.
If 1 patient experiences a DLT in the first cohort, an additional cohort of 3 patients will be treated at the same dose level.
If ≤1 patient has a DLT in 6 treated at this same dose, this will be considered a tolerable dose to move to phase II.
If 2 or more patients in 3 or 6 patients treated at a given dose experience DLT, the dose will be de-escalated to the next lower dose level.</description>

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) of cisplatin + GDC-0941 versus cisplatin alone in patients with AR- TN MBC. ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) as their best response by RECIST version 1.1 for targeted lesions and assessed by CT, MRI scan.
Objective responses, was estimated by the overall tumor burden at baseline (targeted lesions) in which subsequent measurements were performed every 8 weeks using the Solid Tumor Response Criteria (RECIST) v1.1 were compared. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

MTD is defined as the highest dose at which a DLT is experienced &gt;= 1 out of 6 patients.

If no patient in the first cohort of 3 experiences a DLT, an additional cohort of 3 patients will be treated at the same dose level.
If 1 patient experiences a DLT in the first cohort, an additional cohort of 3 patients will be treated at the same dose level.
If ≤1 patient has a DLT in 6 treated at this same dose, this will be considered a tolerable dose to move to phase II.

        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) of cisplatin + GDC-0941 versus cisplatin alone in patients with AR- TN MBC. ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) as their best response by RECIST version 1.1 for targeted lesions and assessed by CT, MRI scan.
Objective responses, was estimated by the overall tumor burden at baseline (targeted lesions) in which subsequent measurements were performed every 8 weeks using the Solid Tumor Response Criteria (RECIST) v1.1 were compared. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
