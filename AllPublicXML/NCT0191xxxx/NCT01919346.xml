  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Eculizumab in the prevention of
      Delayed Graft Function following deceased donor kidney transplantation. Based on experimental
      data and supportive observations in humans associating complement gene upregulation with
      ischemic reperfusion (IR) injury, it is hypothesized that C5 cleavage is a key step in the
      pathogenesis of ischemic reperfusion injury following transplantation. It is further
      hypothesized that Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks C5 cleavage in
      humans will be an effective prophylactic agent to prevent IR injury in high risk recipients.
      This trial is a prospective, randomized study to test the efficacy of eculizumab vs. placebo
      given once at the time of transplantation and once again 24 hours later in preventing delayed
      graft function in first adult recipients of deceased donor kidneys.
