      Patients suffered from severe sepsis or septic shock have a mortality of 20~54%. It is major
      healthcare problems, affecting millions of individuals around the world each year. An
      international group of experts in the diagnosis and management of infection and sepsis,
      representing 11 organizations, published the first internationally accepted guidelines that
      the bedside clinician could use to improve outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock in
      2004, and further outcome was reported in 2008. Lots of medical centers have joined the
      Surviving Sepsis Campaign and follow the latest guideline. Many reports have shown that
      Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline can reduce patient mortality.

      In surgical intensive care units of National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), the Surviving
      Sepsis Campaign Guideline was conducted since 2009. Our purpose is to investigate the
      characteristics and outcomes of severe sepsis patient in surgical intensive care units of
      NTUH by retrospective review of medical chart.
