  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the effect of a targeted preoperative
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) detection by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) on either endogenous or exogenous postoperative MRSA infections in a high risk
      population undergoing gastroenterological surgery. The primary endpoint was to investigate
      whether the potentially high incidence of MRSA infections in patients with MRSA nasal
      colonization before surgery can be prevented with a PCR-based strategy. The second endpoint
      was to investigate the impact of acquisition of MRSA colonization after surgery on the
      occurrence of MRSA infections. Investigators hypothesize that postoperative MRSA infection is
      prevented by a targeted screening strategy in preoperative MRSA carrier, and there is limited
      effect in patients with postoperative MRSA acquisition.

      Target screening for nasal carriage of MRSA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
      before or on admission. In order to identify MRSA nasal acquisition while on the ward, all
      patients who were negative before surgery were re-screened every 7 days until discharge. The
      inclusion criteria for screening were patients undergoing inflammatory bowel disease surgery
      on ward A, and those undergoing major hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery on ward B.
      Investigators classified enrolled patients into preoperative MRSA nasal carriage,
      postoperative nasal acquisition in patients who were negative for PCR assay before surgery,
      and non-nasal MRSA carriage during hospitalization. Development of postoperative infections
      caused by MRSA was assessed according to the nasal MRSA carriage status. MRSA infections rate
      was also compared between the 2-years of the intervention period and the previous 2-year
      control period on each ward.

      Control measures in identified MRSA carriers consisted of contact precautions, antibiotic
      prophylaxis with a single dose of vancomycin 1g in addition to cephalosporins, and topical
      decolonization of MRSA (application of 2% mupirocin ointment twice daily to nares for 5 days
      and a bath with 4% chlorhexidine daily for 3-5 days). Although contact precautions were used
      when caring for MRSA-colonized patients, isolation/cohorting was not routinely practiced.
