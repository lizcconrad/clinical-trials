  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive bacterial infection is a dangerous but relatively uncommon disease where bacteria
      spread deep into the body causing diseases like blood poisoning ('bacteraemia'), pneumonia,
      meningitis and others. The various bacteria of the streptococcus family are an important
      cause, often leading patients to require intensive care despite which, for some strains, one
      in five patients die. One notable form is called necrotising fasciitis, a condition where
      bacteria rapidly spreads through and destroys the layers of tissue just under the skin.

      As individuals vary greatly in their risk of developing such serious infections,
      investigating how the genome, the inherited blueprint of our bodies, of these patients
      differs from that of healthy volunteers can help to explain why the disease develops in some
      and not others. For some streptococcal bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae this
      approach is already proving successful; for others such as the &quot;Group A&quot; strain
      (Streptococcus pyogenes) it has yet to be explored but carries excellent potential.

      The investigators have secured the support of the Lee Spark Necrotising Fasciitis Foundation
      to recruit from their membership survivors of streptococcal infections and some of their
      family members. The investigators will also ask infection specialists from NHS hospitals to
      invite patients they have looked after. The investigators also have a small existing
      collection. Taking part would involve registering information on a website, discussing the
      study on the telephone and then providing us with a sample of saliva from which the
      investigators can isolate DNA. The investigators would prepare the sample for analysis of the
      genome and compare the patients with both their family and an existing reference collection
      from healthy volunteers using technology that reads the DNA code.

      Our study will be a first key step in renewing efforts to understand the determinants of
      invasive streptococcal infection, which is important for developing better treatments and
      vaccines.

    <description>This is an observational study comparing genetic data from cases (inclusion criteria 1) vs unaffected family members (inclusion criteria 2-4) and publically available genetic data from health volunteers in existing reference databases (e.g. UK10K - http://www.uk10k.org/). The case's illness (as defined in inclusion criteria 1) may have occurred anytime between 1st January 1980 and enrolment. The outcome is measured by genetic testing using a sample collected on enrolment. There is no follow-up period.</description>

      Primarily we will collect saliva from which DNA will be isolated. Secondly, from a subset of
      individuals, we will request follow-up blood samples from which we will extract RNA and
      separate leukocytes for studies of function.

        Participants will be identified through an invitation sent to the Lee Spark Necrotising
        Fasciitis Foundation and by infection specialists at NHS hospitals who will invite patients
        whose care they have been directly involved in. In addition, a small collection of existing
        samples held at Imperial College London will be used.

        Participants for the genetics study are divided into cases/survivors and family members
        (relatives and parents).

        To participate as a survivor, the individual must meet criteria 1A. Their illness can have
        occurred anytime from birth up until enrolment, providing it happened after 1st January
        1980. Family members can only take part if invited to do so by the survivor from their
        family at the request of the research team.

        In families in which two or more survivors are identified, all the remaining first- and
        second-degree relatives of the survivors will be eligible to participate. The recruitment
        team subdivide those relatives on enrolment into healthy (Criteria 2) or intermediate
        (Criteria 3) phenotype.

        In families in which there is only a single survivor, the recruitment team will assess
        whether the survivor meets criteria 1B. If so the parents of that survivor are eligible to
        participate if they have a healthy phenotype (Criteria 4).

          1. Cases/Survivors
