    <textblock>
      It is well-known that preterm delivery can be accompanied by complications. One of these
      complications is Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH). There are four degrees of IVH, according
      to severity. It is known that IVH Grades 3-4 can cause severe neurodevelopmental outcomes,
      including cerebral palsy (CP), hemiplegia, lower motor and cognitive skills and social
      difficulties. It is not known whether IVH Grades I-II have any of these effects and the aim
      of this study is to determine whether they do have any neurodevelopmental outcomes.

    <description>Retrospective study of preterm infants born in the years 2007-2011 and suffered IVH Grades 1-2 who have undergone a general neurodevelopmental assessment in the Institute for Child Development in Hillel Yaffe Medical Center at ages 1-7. This assessment will indicate whether IVH Grades 1-2 has any neurodevelopmental effect on these children.</description>
