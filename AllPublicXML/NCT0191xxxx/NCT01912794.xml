  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To maintain stable body balance in daily activities, the ability to respond to external
      perturbations is an essential factor. Such capacity is limited in pathological conditions,
      such as in stroke, in which postural control is impaired due to lesions to the central
      nervous system. Impairment to postural control increases body sway during upright posture and
      leads to augmented frequency of falls. In this sense, the identification of mechanisms
      involved in body balance disorders after stroke is particularly important in situations of
      postural perturbation. The purpose of this project is to evaluate reactive postural responses
      to unpredictable external perturbations, analyzing postural dysfunctions caused by lesion to
      different brain areas as a result of stroke, and test principles of dynamic body balance
      rehabilitation.

    <measure>Displacement amplitude of the CP to the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure quantified by the difference between the maximum values of the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral after the start of trial and average position in the axis anteroposterior and mediolateral, respectively, in the 200 ms prior to the onset of the trial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coordination between the hip and ankle joint</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Coordination between the hip and ankle joints, which is evaluated by adjusting the angle displacement data, hip and ankle angle within 95% of an ellipse surrounding the values of the disturbance moment until the end of the trial. Will be carried out a regression analysis to identify the slope of the fitted ellipse. Slopes greater indicate a greater share of the ankle in relation to the hip</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle activation latency</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is time between the time of release and the first load value 3 standard deviations above the mean magnitude in the 200 ms prior to postural disturbance, with subsequent values increasing.</description>
