  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite their importance, health-related behaviors are hard to change. Among behaviors,
      physical activity is associated with protection from multiple diseases. People who are
      physically active have lower risk for heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, depression, and
      some cancers with associated dose-dependent reductions in cardiovascular and all-cause
      mortality. However, most US adults do not meet CDC physical activity guidelines. Sedentary
      work behavior in industrialized nations is likely a contributor to this problem.

      Current low-technology strategies for encouraging lifestyle change are disappointingly
      ineffective and are highly resource intensive. Systematic reviews of the literature show
      mixed evidence for using activity trackers (i.e., pedometers) and a limited body of evidence
      for text messaging in preventive health care. However, prior studies have not integrated
      digital activity tracking with mobile phone text messaging feedback.

      Given 91% of adults in the United States now use a mobile phone, and 56% a smartphone, this
      represents a potentially widely applicable avenue for therapeutic intervention. There is
      growing interest in leveraging mobile health (mHealth) technologies to improve health
      behaviors in the general population. The investigators propose to conduct a blinded,
      randomized mHealth trial of digital activity tracking and smart texting to promote physical
      activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using an innovative, convenient, mHealth trial design, this pilot study aims to test the
      feasibility of a seamless model of information flow integrating digital activity tracker
      information with a mobile phone texting system to deliver a technology-enhanced intervention
      that does not require in-person follow-up.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. individuals overestimate their physical activity, especially that done at work.

        2. biofeedback from an activity tracker can increase physical activity via increasing
           self-awareness.

        3. &quot;smart&quot; text message feedback can increase physical activity via personalizing health
           coaching.

      Digitalized activity tracking will use the Fitbug Orb, which syncs via Bluetooth with one's
      smartphone. It is a display-free triaxial accelerometer, allowing one to blind participants
      to numeric feedback. Text messaging will use Reify Health's &quot;smart&quot; platform for
      personalized, interactive texting by an automated and repeatable algorithm. Texting will be
      informed by real-time activity information.

      Potential advantages of the trial strategy include elimination of attendance at in-person
      sessions, personalization of health coaching, more continuous patient contact; inexpensive
      intervention, the ultimate ability to scale our intervention to larger target populations.

      After initial pilot trial completion, additional study will include long-term physical
      activity follow-up of participants and focus groups.
