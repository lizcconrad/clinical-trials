  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI) is the largest and most rigorous genetic
      investigation of eating disorders ever conducted. Researchers in the United States, Sweden,
      Australia, and Denmark will collect clinical information and blood samples from over 13,000
      individuals with anorexia nervosa and individuals without an eating disorder.

      ANGI represents a global effort to detect genetic variation that contributes to this
      potentially life-threatening illness. The goal of the research study is to transform
      knowledge about the causes of eating disorders to work toward greater understanding and
      ultimately a cure.

      If you have suffered from anorexia nervosa at any point in your life, you can help us achieve
      this goal. Your contribution would include a brief questionnaire and a blood sample. If you
      have never had anorexia nervosa, but still want to contribute, we invite your participation
      as well.

      Participation in this genetics study requires participants to answer some questions online,
      about eating behaviors (about 15-30 minutes) and to provide a single blood sample that should
      take only a few minutes.

      To obtain the blood sample, investigators will mail you a kit which participants would take
      to their primary care provider or your local laboratory to have them draw a small sample of
      blood (about 40 mL, which is less than three tablespoons). The study is also working with a
      mobile phlebotomy company that can come to your home or location of your choice to draw your
      blood and ship it at no cost to you. Once the sample is drawn, participants or the mobile
      phlebotomist will place it in a box and contact FedEx for pick up. There is no cost for the
      FedEx shipment. Participants will also fill out the reimbursement form and send it and the
      receipt to our office. Investigators will reimburse participants for the cost of the blood
      draw. The samples will be studied directly or reprogrammed prior to further study.

      The blood sample participants provide will be used to identify biological characteristics and
      other biological &quot;markers.&quot; Some analyses will include genetic analyses which are measured
      using DNA and can look at places in DNA, and others can analyze most of the genome. Other
      analyses measure a large number of proteins. Still others assess the messenger substance
      (called RNA) that transfers information from DNA to protein. Investigators plan to store the
      blood specimens and data indefinitely.

      Investigators will be collecting DNA to permit immediate and future genetic analyses and
      analyses of immune, endocrine, and proteins. All blood will be biobanked indefinitely to
      allow for assays that may become available in the future analyses.
