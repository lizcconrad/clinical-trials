  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy, an essential modality in cancer treatment, frequently induces a fibrotic
      process in the skin which can lead to increased risk of malignancy, poor wound healing, pain
      and limitation of movement, and permanent loss of skin appendages with
      hyper/hypopigmentation, decreased sweating and xerosis, posing significant cosmetic and
      quality of life issues. Advances in laser therapy has led to the use of fractional laser
      treatment (FLT) to treat fibrosis associated with in hypertrophic scars and morphea, leading
      to tissue repair, scar remodeling. The investigators propose a pilot clinical study to test
      the hypothesis that FLT can normalize the fibrotic process and induce normal scar remodeling
      in patients affected by chronic radiation injury. Understanding and correcting this
      underlying fibrotic process can help restore normal skin functions in patients affected with
      chronic radiation dermatitis (RD) and other debilitating fibrotic diseases in dermatology
      such as scleroderma, morphea, or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

      We propose to treat 22 patients with significant radiation induced fibrosis (RIF) and skin
      changes. Each patient will receive fractional treatment (FLT) using the Lumenis Ultrapulse
      Carbon Dioxide (CO2) laser as well as control (no treatment) randomized to site. Patient age,
      type of cancer, method/dosage of radiation, latency between radiation treatment and start of
      study, and characteristics of skin changes will be recorded, including fibrosis surface area,
      depth, color, and compliance. Assessments will be conducted before each treatment, after each
      treatment, and 3-12 months after the last treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy males and females between 18 and 70 years of age with radiation-induced
             fibrosis and depigmentation. The fibrosis must have occurred at least 1 year prior to
             the date of enrollment.

          2. Having suitable areas of treatment: All wounds in the area of interest must be closed
             for at least two months. The scars must be deemed stable for a period of 3 months or
             have a suitable contralateral control before initiation of treatment. This will be
             determined by objective measurements of scar erythema, pliability, induration,
             thickness at enrollment and again at 3 months;

          3. Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI;

          4. Able and willing to comply with all visit, treatment and evaluation schedules and
             requirements;

          5. Able to understand and provide written informed consent;

          6. Pregnant woman can be included because study involves local intervention, no new
             drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active tanning, including the use of tanning booths, during the course of the study;

          2. Prior skin treatment with laser or other devices in the treated area within three
             months of initial treatment or during the course of the study;

          3. Adverse reactions to compounds of any external agent (e.g., gels, lotions or
             anesthetic creams) required for use in the study, if no alternative to the said agent
             exists;

          4. History of collagen vascular disease;

          5. Active Herpes Simplex or Zoster at the time of treatment or having experienced more
             than three episodes of Herpes Simplex / Zoster eruption within a year of study
             enrollment;

          6. History of immunosuppression/immune deficiency disorders (including human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or
             use of immunosuppressive medications;

          7. Having any form of active cancer at the time of enrollment and during the course of
             the study;

          8. Significant concurrent illness, such as uncontrolled diabetes (with a hemoglobin A1C
             of more than 8) (i.e., any disease state that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             interfere with the anesthesia, treatment, or healing process); Mentally incompetent,
             prisoner or evidence of active substance or alcohol abuse;

          9. Any condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would make it unsafe (for the
             subject or study personnel) to treat the subject as part of this research study;

         10. If it is determined that the contracture is due to a deeper process involving the
             muscles, ligaments or bones.

         11. Patient on chemotherapy (but not tamoxifen or other things that affect wound healing)
             and also active XRT

         12. Participation in another interventional study with potential exposure to an
             investigational drug within past 30 days
