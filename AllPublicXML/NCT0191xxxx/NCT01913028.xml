      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      immunogenicity of MEDI9929 following administration of single ascending doses in healthy male
      Japanese subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single centre, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single
      ascending dose parallel study in healthy male Japanese subjects. Up to 3 dose levels of
      MEDI9929 will be investigated.

      Primary object is to assess the safety and tolerability of single ascending subcutaneous (SC)
      doses of MEDI9929 in healthy male Japanese subjects. Secondary objectives are to characterize
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MEDI9929 in healthy male Japanese subjects and to evaluate the
      immunogenicity (IM) of MEDI9929 in healthy male Japanese subjects.

      Up to 24 healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years will participate in a maximum of 3 cohorts.

      Eight subjects will participate in each cohort. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio
      (active: placebo) and will receive a single dose of either MEDI9929 or placebo. Each subject
      will only participate in one cohort.

      The first cohort will receive Dose 1 MEDI9929 (n=6) or placebo (n=2), the second cohort will
      receive Dose 2 MEDI9929 (n=6) or placebo (n=2), and the third cohort will receive Dose 3
      MEDI9929 (n=6) or placebo (n=2).

      Following a screening period of a maximum of 28 days, subjects will stay at the study
      facility for eight nights starting from the day before dosing (Day -1) to Day 8. The follow
      up period after the dosing will be 84 days (112 days for cohort 3). Subjects will receive a
      single dose of MEDI9929 or placebo subcutaneously on Day 1 and safety monitoring and serial
      collection of blood samples for PK evaluation will be followed throughout the study period.

    <description>To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MEDI9929 after single SC dose in healthy male Japanese subjects. Where possible, the following PK parameters will be determined: Apparent SC clearance [CL/F], apparent SC volume of distribution [Vz/F], maximum observed serum concentration, [Cmax], time at which maximum concentration is observed [tmax], area under the serum concentration time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC0-inf] and to last observation [AUC(0-t)], elimination half-life [tÂ½, z]</description>

             parasitic disease

          4. Clinically relevant abnormalities in physical examinations, vital signs, clinical
