  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, phase II and open label study.75 patients are expected to be
      randomized in 35 centers. The main objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of Afatinib
      -cetuximab combo versus cetuximab alone in treatment of patients with refractory wtKRAS
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Patients who will sign the inform consent will be enrolled into one of two groups. Group A
      will receive Afatinib ( 40mg per day) and Cetuximab (500mg/m2)every two weeks until
      progression. Group B will receive Cetuximab (500mg/m2) alone every two weeks until
      progression and after progression,patients from group B will receive afatinib (group A
      treatment) until progression. The criteria for evaluation will be tumor response and
      progression documented by CT scan and according to RECIST criteria version 1.1.

      Patient will also sign a inform consent before participating in biological study. The aim of
      this translational study is to collect tumor and blood sample in order to determine, the
      biological factors which are predictive of the response to treatment.
