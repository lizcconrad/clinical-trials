  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to define the precision, accuracy and variability of the NBM-200
      system in non invasive blood Hemoglobin (Hb) measurements relative to the laboratory blood
      analyzer by comparing two consecutive Hb values obtained by the NBM system to venous values.

      Each subject will be placed in a comfortable position in a temperature regulated room.
      Participants will have two consecutive non invasive (NBM) measurements taken which involves
      inserting the thumb into a ring shaped sensor. After each non invasive measurement the sensor
      will be removed. Each measurement takes approximately 85 seconds and involves the finger cuff
      inflating (to over systolic pressure) and deflating several times in quick successions in
      order to measure and calculate the Hb values. The two non invasive measurements will be
      performed using the same finger. After the NBM system testing is complete and recorded, the
      subject will have a venous (venipuncture) blood sample collected in order to provide two
      blood tests performed on two different models of routine automated complete blood count or Hb
      blood analyzers.
