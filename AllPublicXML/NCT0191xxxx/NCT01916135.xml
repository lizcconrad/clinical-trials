  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first time that a new experimental drug called [18F]-SKI-249380 is being
      used in people. [18F]-SKI-249380 is not a therapeutic drug. [18F]-SKI-249380 is a drug that
      will be used with PET scanners to 'see' where [18F]-SKI-249380 goes in the body, after its
      injected. The researchers believe that scans with [18F]-SKI-249380 might be able to find
      tumors in patients.

      This study is being done to see how long [18F]-SKI-249380 stays in the blood, when it is
      given to people in tiny amounts by an injection into a vein in their arm, and to see where
      [18F]-SKI-249380 goes in the body. If the results of this trial are good, then the study
      doctors plan to use [18F]-SKI-249380 in another trial to see if scans with [18F]-SKI-249380
      are better for finding tumors compared to the standard types of scans that doctors use.

    <description>Patients will receive an injection of up to 7.5 (0.5-7.5) mCi of [18F]-SKI- 249380, followed by serial PET/CT scanning and blood draws, over a period of 3.5 hours, on a single day. PET scans will be performed immediately, at approximately 90 minutes, and optionally at approximately 3 hours after injection of the radiotracer. Each patient will be offered the opportunity to repeat the 18F-SKI-249380 injection and subsequent set of post-injection PET-CT scans, once, on a separate date. Each patient may or may not be receiving treatment with dasatinib therapy at the time of 18F-SKI-249380 PET, for their first PET study, as well as repeat PET study, at the discretion of their oncologist according to best clinical judgment.</description>

    <description>PET scans will be performed immediately, at approximately 90 minutes, and optionally at approximately 3 hours after injection of the radiotracer. This includes an initial 30-minute PET scanning period, performed. At each subsequent time-point, a 30 minute axial body image is acquired. Images will be acquired on a state-of-the-art PET-CT scanner. A 30-45 minute scanning time-period is typical for clinical PET studies. A low-dose CT will be obtained immediately-prior to PET imaging, at each time-point.</description>

    <description>Blood will be drawn at the multiple time points for pharmacokinetic &amp; metabolite analyses of 18F-SKI-249380. We anticipate these time points to be approximately 1, 5, 15, 30, and 90 minutes and 3 hours (optional), post-injection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with history of histologically-confirmed neoplasm of any of the following
             classifications: solid malignancy, myeloid neoplasm, lymphoid neoplasm.

          -  Histology confirmed by MSKCC Department of Pathology.

          -  Disease that is either:

               -  Radiologically-measurable or evaluable as defined by tumor response criteria from
                  an MSKCC-IRB approved clinic research protocol.

               -  Detectable by biopsy (eg, bone marrow) and/or peripheral blood assays obtained
                  within 6 weeks of study enrollment

          -  Age between 21-90

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for females of child-bearing age (11-55 years) and
             potential (ie, women who were not postmenopausal before the start of ongoing
             treatment, if applicable; and who have not had a surgical intervention whose intent or
             effect is sterilization, such as tubal ligation or hysterectomy.)

          -  Not breast-feeding, if applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal or inability to discontinue medications or other substances (eg, foods or
             dietary supplements) that may affect [18F]-SKI-249380 metabolism. Notably, as
             dasatinib metabolism is CYP3A4-dependent, the metabolism of [18F]-SKI-249380 may be
             altered by inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. The
             acceptability of medications and other substances used by the patient will be
             determined by the study investigators.

          -  Inability or refusal to have at least one peripheral intravenous line for intravenous
             access (as applicable to the day of [18F]-SKI-249380 injection and blood draws.)

          -  Refusal or inability to tolerate the scanning procedure (e.g., due to claustrophobia)

          -  Hepatic: from assays obtained &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Albumin &lt; 2 g/dl

          -  GGT &gt; 2.5 x ULN IF Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN.

             &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  Acute major illness (e.g., unstable cardiovascular condition, etc.)
