    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a program to increase the
      physical activity of hypertensive patients using medical services and sports facilities of
      the Mexican Social Security Institute. The primary hypothesis to be proven is: The
      intervention will increase the proportion of hypertensive patients complying the physical
      activity minimum at week to get benefits on health in 20%, compare to patients in control
      group.

      Secondary Hypothesis:

      The intervention achieved a significant change in the group of hypertensive patients in the
      following variables:

        1. Decreased levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, biochemical markers such as
           total cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting blood glucose and increased HDL
           cholesterol.

        2. Increase muscular endurance and cardio-respiratory capacity according to the categories
           of risk stratification.

        3. Decreased body weight, body mass index and waist circumference.

    <description>The length of the intervention is 24 weeks, the control group will be followed for 24 weeks also. The outcome measure is a composite at three moments of the study. Basal measurement, 24 weeks and 36 weeks, this last moment to assess sustainability of the intervention.
The intervention will be effective if the difference in the percent of population (complying the minimum recommended of physical activity) among control and intervention groups is at least of 20%.</description>

    <description>Overall the intervention involves a medical reference in primary care (PHC) to hypertensive patients (during routine consultation) to assist the sports facilities of the same Institute, to develop a group program of physical activity which will last 24 weeks. Led by the trained staff in physical activity to patients with chronic diseases.</description>
