      This open label phase Ib trial aims to determine the safety, tolerability, the
      pharmacokinetic profile, and to identify a dose of dacomitinib in combination with
      pemetrexed.

      Three sites in Austria will participate in this study. Six to nine patients will initially be
      enrolled to receive the target dose of 45 mg qd dacomitinib (starting from day 2 of first
      cycle) in combination with pemetrexed (500 mg/m² 10 min infusion, once every 3 weeks). One
      cycle is defined as 21 days.

      The first 3 subjects will be enrolled at a rate of ≤ 1 subject per week. If the target dose
      regimen is safe based on the incidence of DLT another 3 subjects will be enrolled.

      If the dose of 45 mg qd is not safe alternate lower doses will be explored (dose level -1,
      dose level -2) to identify the MTD of dacomitinib in combination of pemetrexed. Six to nine
      patients per dose level will be enrolled.
