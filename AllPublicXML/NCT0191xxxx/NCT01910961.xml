    <textblock>
      To investigate the influence of limb remote ischemic preconditioning (LRIP) on mortality,
      hospitalization costs and quality of life in patients undergoing open infrarenal abdominal
      aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischaemic preconditioning may confer the cytoprotection in critical organs. The
      investigators have revealed that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would reduce
      intestinal and pulmonary injury in patients undergoing open infrarenal abdominal aortic
      aneurysm (AAA) repair.Few groups have investigated the long term influence of limb remote
      ischemic preconditioning.Therefore, the investigators evaluated the impact of limb remote
      ischemic preconditioning on mortality, hospitalization costs and quality of life during
      elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single
      blind setting.

    <description>limb RIPC protocol was applied after anesthetic induction and before the start of surgery. The limb RIPC was induced by placing a blood pressure cuff on the left upper arm of patient for three inflating-deflating cycles: 5 min inflating to 200 mmHg followed by a 5 min reperfusion with deflating the cuff.</description>
