             (oxycodone equivalent of ≥10 mg/day and ≤50 mg/day) who are likely to benefit from WHO
             step III opioid therapy for the duration of the study

          -  Patients who have been already treated with NSAIDs at least 2 weeks before enrolment
             are also eligible, but they should rate their pain (Pain Intensity Scale -&quot;average

             evidenced by providing written informed consent

          -  Subjects taking pre-study, non-opioid analgesics, and all other concomitant
             medications, including those medications for the treatment of depression and are
             considered necessary for the subject's welfare, and are anticipated to remain stable
             throughout the double-blind period of the study, and are to be continued under the
             supervision of the investigator, are eligible.

               -  Patients who have been already treated with NSAIDs at least 2 weeks before
                  enrolment are also eligible, but they should rate their pain (Pain Intensity
                  Scale -&quot;average pain&quot; over the last 24 hours) as ≥4 on 0-10 scale.

        Criteria for entry to the Double-Blind phase:

          1. Subjects continue to satisfy screening criteria outlined in the protocol

          2. Subject's OXY dose is between 10-50 mg/day

          3. Subjects who rate their pain (Pain Intensity Scale -&quot;average pain&quot; over the last 24
             hours) as≤4 on 0-10 scale with less than or equal to two doses of Morphine Sulfate
             tablets rescue medication per day for either the last three consecutive days or four
             of the last seven days

          4. Subjects who have constipation induced, or worsened by their opioid study medication,
             as shown by:

               1. The subject's medical need for regular intake of laxatives to have at least 3
                  bowel evacuations per week, or having less than 3 bowel evacuations per week when
                  not taking a laxative, respectively and

               2. The subjects' constipation was considered to be induced, worsened or maintained
                  by their current study opioid medication and

               3. BFI value &gt; 30.

          5. Subjects demonstrate compliance with laxative use, and completing appropriate and
