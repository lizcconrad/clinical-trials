  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) affects nearly 600,000 persons each year around
      the world. This type of tuberculosis is very difficult to treat, and many patients die from
      it. Drugs of the fluoroquinolone class are very important for treating MDR-TB, but the best
      dose of one of the most effective fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin, is not known. This
      application proposes a study to determine the best dose of levofloxacin to use in treating
      MDR-TB. 120 patients will receive their usual treatment, plus levofloxacin at one of four
      doses. The study will be performed in Peru and in South Africa, where MDR-TB is common.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MDR-TB is a growing threat to international health. A recent report from WHO estimated that
      over 440,000 new cases of MDR-TB occurred in 127 countries in 2008, causing 150,000 deaths;
      this represents a 55% increase in the number of cases since 2000. Current treatment regimens
      have only a 58-67% success rate, and as many as 20% of those who fail to respond to treatment
      die of tuberculosis; those who do not die become chronic carriers and spread MDR-TB to
      others.

      Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are an essential part of regimens for the treatment of MDR-TB;
      substantially better outcomes have consistently been seen in patients with MDR-TB who are
      treated with FQ, and newer FQ (levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin) are the most
      potent antituberculosis agents available for MDR-TB treatment. However, gatifloxacin has been
      taken off the market because of dysglycemic reactions and moxifloxacin produces marked QT
      prolongation, increasing risk of fatal arrhythmia. In contrast, QT studies of levofloxacin
      have found minimal prolongation at doses up to 20mg/kg. Levofloxacin is currently given for
      TB at doses of 11-14 mg/kg/day and has been well tolerated at doses up to 20 mg/kg. Although
      the efficacy of levofloxacin increases as exposure increases both in animal studies of TB and
      in human studies of gram-negative bacteria, its efficacy at higher doses against TB in humans
      has not been studied. Thus, determination of the most efficacious and well-tolerated dose of
      levofloxacin is an important research priority. In this Phase 2 study, we will determine the
      levofloxacin dose and exposure that achieve the greatest reduction in mycobacterial burden
      with acceptable tolerability by studying 120 adults with smear- and culture-positive
      pulmonary MDR-TB at sites in Peru and South Africa. Levofloxacin will be administered with an
      optimized background regimen (OBR) to address the following Specific

      Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the levofloxacin AUC/MIC that provides the shortest time to
      sputum culture conversion in solid medium.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the highest levofloxacin AUC that is both safe and associated
      with fewer than 25% of patients discontinuing or reducing their dose of levofloxacin.

      Specific Aim 3: To develop a dosing algorithm to achieve the levofloxacin AUC associated with
      maximal efficacy and acceptable safety/tolerability.

      This clinical trial will increase our ability to cure MDR-TB and prevent the emergence of
      resistance to new TB drug classes by optimizing dosing and improving the effectiveness of an
      existing antimycobacterial agent, using a novel and versatile study design which more rapidly
      and efficiently identifies advances in this critical area. Construction of an algorithm to
      predict the optimal levofloxacin dose will allow more effective use of levofloxacin,
      particularly in areas with limited resources, where the burden of MDR-TB is the greatest.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the time to sputum culture conversion from positive to negative for M. tuberculosis growth on solid medium. This is defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the first of two successive negative cultures one study visit apart that are not followed by a culture-positive specimen within 28 weeks of treatment initiation. To ensure that each subject will be evaluable for the primary endpoint, bi-weekly sputum cultures will be collected for 12 weeks, then every 4 weeks through 24 weeks of treatment.</description>
