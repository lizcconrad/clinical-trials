  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to examine the effects of high intensity aerobic interval training
      (AIT) versus moderate continuous training (CON) in heart transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically stable heart transplant recipients &gt; 12 month or more after HTx, age &gt; 18 years,
      willing and capable of giving written informed consent for study participation and
      anticipated to be able to participate in the study for 12 months were included from the Heart
      Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital.

      Patients were excluded due to unstable condition or postoperative complications, recent
      severe rejection episodes (&gt;H1R &lt; 3 month), physical disabilities which prevent participation
      and re-transplantation or multi-organtransplantation.
