    <textblock>
      Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid with antinociceptive properties in inflammatory and
      neuropathic pain, and displays a unique mechanism: it enhances slow inactivation of Nav1.3,
      Nav1.7, and Nav1.8.

      Nav1.7 is expressed predominantly in nociceptive and sympathetic neurons. Gain-of-function
      mutations have been described in Nav1.7 that result in extreme pain disorders such as
      SCN9A-associated small fiber neuropathy. In the disease states genetically linked to a
      gain-of-function of Nav1.7, the sodium channel is mutated to increase the sodium influx
      resulting in a hyperexcitable sensory neuron, and a resultant sensation of pain.

      The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of lacosamide, a sodium
      channel blocker, in patients with pain due to SCN9A-associated small fiber neuropathy.

      Indication Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid with antinociceptive properties in
      inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and displays a unique mechanism: it enhances slow
      inactivation of Nav1.3, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8.

      Rationale A significant body of evidence implicates sodium channels in mediating the
      pathophysiological components of both neuropathic and nociceptive pain. This is supported by
      clinical evidence suggesting that local anaesthetics, anticonvulsants and tricyclic compounds
      that block voltage-gated sodium channels may act as useful therapeutics for managing and
      treating pain. The use of these sodium channel blockers has, however, been limited by the
      lack of selectivity for different sodium channel subtypes with often additional central
      nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular side effects. Therefore, a key to improvement on the
      limitations of most existing sodium channel blockers is to selectively target those that are
      involved in pain mechanisms whilst sparing those channels involved in cardiovascular
      function.

      Nav1.7 is expressed predominantly in nociceptive and sympathetic neurons. The role of this
      channel in nociceptive neurons has been characterized by human genetics, which indicates an
      essential and non-redundant role in pain transduction and conduction following noxious
      stimuli. Gain-of-function mutations have been described in Nav1.7 that result in extreme pain
      disorders such as inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD)
      and SCN9A-associated small fiber neuropathy. In the disease states genetically linked to a
      gain-of-function of Nav1.7, the channel is mutated to increase the sodium influx resulting in
      a hyperexcitable sensory neuron, and a resultant sensation of pain.

      Lacosamide is a functionalized aminoacid that was synthesized during the development of
      anticonvulsant drug candidates and has displayed antinociceptive properties in inflammatory
      and neuropathic pain. Lacosamide displays a unique mechanism of action in that it seemingly
      selectively stabilizes channels into the slow- inactivated state. Lacosamide inhibited
      currents from Nav1.3, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8, but only after prolonged depolarizations,
      consistent with an enhancement in slow-inactivation with no effect on fast inactivation.
      Furthermore, lacosamide was better able to discriminate between resting and inactivated
      channels compared to lidocaine or carbamazepine, thus likely allowing for improved
      selectivity over neurons with a depolarized membrane potential, with little tonic block.

      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a relatively common disorder of peripheral nerves, primarily
      affecting small somatic fibers, autonomic fibers, or both. In a proportion of patients with
      SFN, no underlying cause can be identified; these cases are termed idiopathic SFN.
      Gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A have recently been reported to be present in 28% of
      patients with idiopathic SFN, suggesting an underlying genetic basis for a proportion of
      patients with this disease. Electrophysiological analysis demonstrated multiple
      gain-of-function changes in the mutant channels with each of the mutations resulting in
      hyperexcitability in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Moreover, most of these mutations
      showed impaired slow inactivation of Nav1.7, a finding that provides a rationale to evaluate
      the possible pain reduction potential of lacosamide in this condition.

      Study Rationale and Objectives The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy and
      safety of lacosamide, a sodium channel blocker, in patients with pain due to SCN9A-associated
      SFN. The proposed study plans to recruit patients with clinically diagnosed SFN, where a
      mutation in SCN9A has been confirmed genetically, and where possible, has been demonstrated
      on functional testing, to cause hyperexcitability of DRG neurons. This small, precision
      medicine population provides an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide
      in treatment of pain due to SCN9A-associated SFN.

             intra-epidermal nerve fiber density evaluation (IENFD) and/or Quantitative Sensory
             Testing (QST) and a mutation in the SCN9A gene, confirmed by sequencing. Where
             possible, in vitro confirmation of the functionality of the mutation should have been
             performed and documented.

          4. Presence of pain due to SFN for at least 3 months prior to Screening and an average
             self-reported pain score of at least 3 during this time.

          5. If on analgesic medication to manage pain due to SFN, subject must have stable
             analgesic medication for a minimum of 30 days prior to the start of the study and
             should continue with the same regimen throughout the study.

          6. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legal representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of
             the study.

          7. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with predominantly signs of large nerve fiber involvement, clinically
             significant abnormal nerve conduction studies.

          2. History or presence of illnesses known to cause SFN (excluding diabetes mellitus).

             pain due to SFN.

          4. Any condition possibly affecting drug intake and absorption.

          5. History of known alcohol, analgesic or illicit drug abuse within 12 months of
             Screening.

          6. Subjects taking medications with activity at sodium channels. These medications are
             prohibited until the end of the study period and require a washout period of at least
             5 half lives (90 days for capsaicin patches) prior to the Screening visit.

          7. 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF (Fridericia's correction) &gt;450 or a QRS interval &gt;120
             msec at Screening. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should
             be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTcF values should be used to
             determine the subject's eligibility.

          8. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance â‰¤ 30 mL/min).

          9. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives preceding the
             first dose of study medication.

             has planned surgery during the course of the study.

         11. Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; females of childbearing potential not using
             effective contraception or not agreeing to continue effective contraception for at
             least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product.

         12. Other clinically significant or unstable, or severe acute or chronic medical or
             psychiatric/psychological condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

         13. In the case of incidental findings the patient and his/her treating physician will be
             informed and asked to undertake action if necessary. If a patient does not want to be
             informed about possible incidental findings, nor wants his treating physician to be
             informed, he or she cannot participate in this study.
