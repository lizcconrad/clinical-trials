  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The registry aims to evaluate the safety, performance and efficacy of the Everolimus-eluting
      bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) system following rotational atherectomy in patients
      with complex de novo native coronary artery lesions in all-day clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bioresorbable scaffolds are transient implants. They act like drug-eluting metallic stents
      (DES) during the first 3 months by supporting the vessel wall thereby keeping the artery
      patent. Subsequently, resorption of the scaffold begins and its structure loosens. As a
      result of everolimus release, neointimal growth is inhibited similar to DES. Finally the
      implant is reabsorbed completely in about 2-3 years. BVS in terms of late stent thrombosis
      may be safer than DES. Transiently scaffolded vessels may regain their natural curvature and
      angulation as well as response to nitroglycerine and endothelial function.

        The recommendation to implant BVS in an individual patient in whom rotational atherectomy
        of a complex target lesion has been conducted, is purely based on clinical grounds. These
        are determined by the instructions for use (IFU) of the BVS and by the clinical experience
        accumulated so far from clinical studies.These studies suggest that the BVS should be
        implanted under certain conditions, which are determined by the patient and the coronary
        lesion treated:

        Eligible:

        Regarding to patient

             heart disease (chronic, NSTEMI and unstable angina) due to one or more complex de novo
             native coronary artery lesions
