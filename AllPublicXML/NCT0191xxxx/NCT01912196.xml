    <time_frame>assessed from baseline to week 8 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Based on historical data, the standard deviation is assumed to range between 9 and 12. With a standard effect size of 0.367 a total of at least 120 evaluable patients per group are needed to provide 80% power with a two-sided 5% significance level. HAM-D17 will be derived from the Combined HAM-D28-MADRS Instrument.</description>

    <description>for the MADRS, the number and proportion of patients who are responders at the end of the study and the number and proportion of patients who are in remission at the end of the study will be summarized by treatment group, along with the difference and 95% confidence interval for the difference (based on the Wilson Score method).</description>
