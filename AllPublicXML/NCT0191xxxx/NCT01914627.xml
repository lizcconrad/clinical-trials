      The study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a topical dimeticone
      formulation (Loion®) compared to 10% salicylic acid in octyl-dodecanol with 15%
      Macrogol-4-laurylether for the removal of scaling in patients with chronic psoriasis capitis
      (scalp psoriasis).
