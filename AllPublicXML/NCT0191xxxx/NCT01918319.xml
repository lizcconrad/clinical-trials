    <textblock>
      Children born to obese women are at risk of increased adiposity and later adverse metabolic
      outcomes. We have conducted a follow-up study on an existing clinical trial, called the LiP
      study (Lifestyle in Pregnancy), registration number NCT00530439,in which 360 obese pregnant
      women were randomized to either lifestyle intervention or routine obstetric care. This
      present study follows the children until 3 years of age. We have the hypothesis, that the
      intervention during pregnancy results in a lower degree of adiposity and metabolic risk
      factors in the offspring. Clinical examination is taking place at age 2.5-3 years including
      anthropometric measurements, Dual energy x-ray (DXA) scans and blood samples measuring
      metabolic markers.

    <description>Energy requirements for each participant were individually estimated according to weight and level of activity during pregnancy. Women in the active intervention group were encouraged to be moderately physically active 30-60 minutes a day.Women in this group also had free full time membership in a fitness center for six months. In the fitness centers they had closed training classes with trained physiotherapists for one hour each week.</description>
