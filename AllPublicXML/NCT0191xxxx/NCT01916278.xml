        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female and male subjects aged 18 to 65 years.

          -  Subjects with the intention to undergo lip augmentation treatment (vermilion mucosa
             and, if applicable, vermilion borders).

          -  Subjects with LFGS score of 0 (very thin), 1 (thin) and 2 (moderately thick) (scores
             may differ between upper and lower lip), and lip appearance judged by the treating
             investigator to be suitable for optimal correction (≥ 1 grade improvement on the LFGS
             per lip) with maximum 1.5 mL study product per lip.

          -  Subjects with signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant anticoagulant therapy and therapy with inhibitors of platelet aggregation
             (e.g. aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), Omega-3 or
             vitamin E within 10 days before study treatment, or a history of bleeding disorders.

          -  Prior surgery or tattoo to the upper or lower lip or lip line.

          -  Presence of any abnormal lip structure, such as a scar or lump or severe lip
             asymmetry, as judged by the investigator. Tendency to form keloids, hypertrophic scars
             or any other healing disorders.

          -  Previous tissue augmenting therapy in the lip area (including lips, oral commissures,
             nasolabial folds, marionette and perioral lines) with HA or collagen filler, or laser
             treatment, within 12 months before study entry.

          -  Permanent implant or treatment with non-HA or non-collagen filler in the lip area
             (including lips, oral commissures, nasolabial folds, marionette and perioral lines).

          -  Previous toxin treatment below the lower orbital rim within 9 months before study
             entry.

          -  History of herpes labialis with an outbreak within 4 weeks of study entry or with 4 or
             more outbreaks in the 12 months before study entry.

          -  Active skin disease, inflammation or related conditions, such as infection, psoriasis
             and herpes zoster near or on the area to be treated.

          -  History of angioedema.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to HA, lidocaine or other amide-type anaesthetics or history of
             severe multiple allergies or anaphylactic shock

          -  Cancerous or precancerous lesions in the area to be treated.

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, treatment with biologics or systemic
             corticosteroids within 3 months before study treatment.

          -  Any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would make the subject
             unsuitable for inclusion (e.g. a chronic, relapsing or hereditary disease that may
             affect the general condition or may require frequent medical treatment).

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          -  Participation in any other clinical study within 30 days before inclusion.

          -  Other condition preventing the subject to entering the study in the investigator's
             opinion, e.g. subjects not likely to avoid other facial cosmetic treatments below the
             level of the lower orbital rim and chin, subjects anticipated to be unreliable or
             incapable of understanding and complying with the study assessment or unrealistic
             expectations of treatment result.

          -  Study site staff or close relatives to study site staff and employees at the sponsor
             company or close relatives to employees at the sponsor company. Close relatives are
