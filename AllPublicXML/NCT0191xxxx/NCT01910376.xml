  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a disease of the elderly. Cancer incidence is 11-fold higher in persons over the
      age of 65, than in younger ones. Approximately 60% of all cancers and 70% of cancer mortality
      occurs in people older than 65 years. Moreover, due to the aging of the population in the
      Western world the number of elderly people is expected to increase and therefore the number
      of older cancer patients is expected to rise. Despite this rapid increase in cancer incidence
      and cancer-related mortality with age, our knowledge about ageing and cancer and about
      optimal treatment for older cancer patients is still far from adequate. Therefore, it is
      clear that cancer in the elderly is a major and increasing health problem. A key problem in
      geriatric oncology research is the important selection bias because very old/frail patients,
      are very rarely included in clinical trials.

      Changes in the patterns of health care delivery have shifted the care of the elderly from
      acute care settings to the community and long-term care facilities. As the European
      population ages, more and more people will become nursing home residents, many of whom will
      have a suspicion of, or be diagnosed with, and eventually die from, cancer. Although cancer
      is very common in elderly nursing home residents, it is poorly studied. This lack of
      information may impact on clinical decision making and the appropriateness of treatments
      offered and therefore collection of this information is needed.

      This project has two main objectives. The first objective is to report on demographics,
      referral patterns and motives for non-referral, anti-cancer treatments and outcome of
      patients in nursing homes with suspected or diagnosed active invasive cancer where a
      diagnostic or treatment decision has to be taken. The second objective is to develop better
      prognostic tools (for survival) including biological markers of ageing to help treatment
      decisions in the elderly.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All individuals:

          -  Age ≥ 65 years

          -  Residents in a nursing home in the Armonea network in Belgium.

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, or sociological condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol; those conditions should be discussed
             with the patient/proxy before registration in the study.

          -  Written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local
             regulations.

          -  The treating general practitioner (GP) is willing to provide medical information
             required by the study.

        Cancer patient cohort:

        Patients must have a new cancer event defined as one of:

          -  A strong clinical suspicion (based on physician's judgement) of a new cancer where a
             diagnostic or therapeutic decision needs to be taken.

          -  A strong clinical suspicion (based on physician's judgement) of progression of a
             previously known cancer where a diagnostic or therapeutic decision needs to be taken.

          -  Diagnosis of a new cancer where a diagnostic or therapeutic decision needs to be
             taken.

          -  Diagnosis of progression of a previously known cancer where a diagnostic or
             therapeutic decision needs to be taken.

        All invasive cancer types and all histologies are eligible. All lines of treatment are
        eligible. Patients who are diagnosed with cancer during routine medical examinations for
        some other medical condition

        Control cohort:

        • Absence of known active invasive cancer, or strong clinical suspicion of cancer (based on
        physician's judgement) at baseline.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients who were not suspected to have cancer (progression) in the nursing home, but are
        hospitalized for other (medical) reasons, are then diagnosed with cancer during
        hospitalization.
