      Patients who empty their stomach slowly may have what we call &quot;Slow gastric emptying&quot; or
      &quot;gastroparesis&quot;. These patients can have some changes in the thickness of their stomach wall.
      In addition, they may have loss of some important nerve cells in their stomach muscles. The
      loss of these cells can cause slow emptying of the stomach. Obtaining a sample from the
      stomach wall to examine the loss of these cells can help in diagnosing gastroparesis. Up to
      now, the only way to obtain a tissue sample from the stomach muscle was to undergo an
      operation in the surgery suite and be hospitalized for several days after the procedure.
      Usually, we obtain this sample while these patients are having a surgery for another purpose
      such as placement of a gastric stimulator (a machine which is inserted in the stomach wall to
      control the stomach rhythm and thus help the stomach to empty faster). Endoscopic ultrasound
      is an endoscope (a tube with a source of light and ultrasound installed in the tip of the
      tube) that can measure how thick the stomach wall is and can provide sample &quot;biopsies&quot; of the
      stomach wall which can be studied for the loss of these specialized muscles and cells.

      We are proposing that samples obtained by the endoscopic ultrasound can be sufficient to
      diagnose &quot;gastroparesis&quot; and can replace the need for obtaining samples by surgery.
      Endoscopic ultrasound is an outpatient procedure which is not as invasive as surgery.

    <description>After the subjects meet the criteria for enrollment in the study, gastroparetic patients will undergo linear EUS examination of the stomach wall one day prior to their surgery to obtain single or multiple core biopsies of the stomach body wall using the 19-gauge core biopsy needle under EUS guidance. The pathologist will be in the room to assess the adequacy of the sample after each pass. Once the pathologist deemed that the obtained sample is sufficient, the procedure will be terminated</description>
