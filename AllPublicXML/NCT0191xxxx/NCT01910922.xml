      The main purpose of this research is to compare the effectiveness of two mechanisms (mere
      exposure, flavour-flavour learning) in the short and medium term (up to six months after the
      learning phase) on 2-3 year-old children's vegetable acceptance. the research is conducted on
      children aged 2 to 3 years in daycares.
