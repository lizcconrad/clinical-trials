  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the extension phase of this study is to determine whether Drisapersen is
      effective in the treatment of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a mutation
      thought to be corrected by exon 51 skipping.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Regulatory approval was not obtained for drisapersen, hence BioMarin is stopping the
    development of all exon skipping oligonucleotides in DMD.
