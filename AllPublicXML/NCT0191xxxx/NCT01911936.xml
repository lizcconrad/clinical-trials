      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to establish the MTD and/or RDE of
      LJM716 as single agent in Japanese patients that have advanced solid tumors. The study
      consists of a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with the following indications:

             i) (Dose escalation part only): HER2 overexpressing locally advanced/ metastatic
             breast cancer or gastric cancer for which no effective treatment option exists:

               -  For breast cancer: documented 3+ by immunohistochemistry, or amplification by in
                  situ hybridization

               -  For gastric cancer (including GE junction tumors): documented 3+ by
                  immunohistochemistry, or 2+ by immunohistochemistry and amplification by in situ
                  hybridization OR, ii) (Dose escalation part only): Recurrent or metastatic SCCHN
                  regardless of HER2 status for which no effective treatment option exists OR, iii)
                  Recurrent or metastatic ESCC regardless of HER2 status for which no effective
                  treatment option exists

          2. ECOG Performance Status of 0-2

          3. Must have recovered from the adverse effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy or
             other antineoplastic therapy. Alopecia and CTCAE Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy is
             acceptable.

          5. Written informed consent obtained prior to any screening procedures

          6. During dose expansion part of the study, patients must have at least one measurable
             lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria
