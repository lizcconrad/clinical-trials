  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal will determine if blocking carbohydrate intake in the small intestine
      with Acarbose can be a possible therapy for older adults with (PPH) Post Prandial Hypotension
      (a drop of blood pressure after eating), which can result in falls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blocking the absorption of carbohydrates at the brush border of the small intestine with
      acarbose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) seems a promising possibility as a potential
      therapeutic agent. Although designed as a second-line diabetes drug, this medication has very
      little risk of hypoglycemia in older adults. In fact the risk of hypoglycemia is extremely
      low even in patients concurrently taking concurrent hypoglycemia agents (including insulin),
      and there is almost no risk of hypoglycemia in subjects not on other diabetes medications.
      Acarbose suppresses postprandial glycemia by slowing small intestinal digestion and
      absorption of carbohydrate, and has been shown to slow gastric emptying Acarbose has yet to
      be examined in a prospective fashion in older adults, despite the prevalence of PPH in this
      patient population. Preliminary, pilot work done in our laboratory on older adults with PPH
      has demonstrated that the hypotensive response over 90 minutes to a standardized meal was
      significantly reduced by the administration of acarbose

    <description>Starting the day following each meal test, each subject with PPH will take either acarbose 25 mg po tid (prior to each meal) or placebo po tid for one day. During this 24 hour period, each subject will undergo 24 Hr-ABPM (starting at 7 ante meridian (AM) the following day). Each subject will have ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Welch-Allyn, ABPM 6100S) performed for 24 hours. Each subject will carry a logbook to record time of activity and all meals. Each subject will be given a watch synchronized to the 24-hour blood pressure monitor.</description>
