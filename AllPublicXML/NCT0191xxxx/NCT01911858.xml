      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that Askina® Calgitrol® Paste is safe to use on
      III degree burns by quantifying the concentration of silver in the blood during treatment and
      thus to show that the amount of silver absorbed will be no greater than those reported in the
      literature.

    <description>Data will not be recorded at specific time points due to individual changing patterns. The investigator will make a subjective description of the wound bed covered by necrosis, slough/fibrin, granulation tissue and epithelialisation and by the condition of the peri-wound skin.</description>

    <description>Data will not be recorded at specific time points due to individual changing patterns.
The presence and intensity of clinical signs of infection will be assessed at the start of the study and at each dressing change using clinical judgment and a scoring system modified from the one published by Trial and al.</description>
