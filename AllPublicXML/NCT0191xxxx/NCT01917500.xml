  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical trial is to validate a S/W application to compare the
      calculations of Hemodynamic parameters like Continuous blood pressure (BP) and Continuous
      cardiac output (CO). This Hemodynamic parameters are computed from Pulse Oximeter
      (PhotoPlethysmograph or PPG) signal with results obtained by NIBP intermittent measurements
      and Echocardiography. The first phase of the study will be done on 10 patients of the
      Cardiology dept.- Cardiac ICU, that have routine measurements of BP and CO using
      Echocardiography.

      The HeartBeat system combines an FDA/CE approved watch-like Pulse Oximeter for acquiring the
      data and a Smartphone S/W application that serves as the Hemodynamic calculator. The S/W
      application performs POST-PROCESSING of the PhotoPlethismoGraphic (PPG) signal (Normally the
      PPG signal in Pulse Oximeters is used only to compute heart rate and SpO2). The raw data is
      transferred from the watch oximeter to the smartphone using a standard Bluetooth protocol.

      The Post-processing uses wavelet signal processing to estimate and display certain
      Hemodynamic parameters like (Blood Pressure) BP and CO in a continuous and graphical way on a
      standard Android Smartphone. In addition to the standard heart rate and SpO2, the application
      displays the measured PPG signal and estimated continues BP and CO.

      HeartBeat is the only device that can non-invasively estimate Continuous BP and its Cardiac
      Output component and the resistance component in a mobile wearable device. Differentiating
      between these 2 components can play a major role in helping the doctor to understand the
      effect of cardiovascular medications and Lifestyle interventions.
