    <measure>Percentage of patients who prefer Genuair® (Pressair™) versus Breezhaler® (Neohaler™) at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to answer which device they prefer after 2 weeks of daily practice recorded via PASAPQ (Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire) a self-administered, 15-item measure of respiratory inhalation device satisfaction and preference. The PASAPQ 15-item instrument includes 13 satisfaction items [using a Likert-type scale from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 7 (very satisfied)], a preference item, and a question on willingness to continue using the device.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to rate the overall satisfaction with each device using a Likert-type scale (from 1 [very dissatisfied] to 7 [very satisfied]) after 2 weeks of daily practice recorded via PASAPQ (Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire) a self-administered, 15-item measure of respiratory inhalation device satisfaction and preference. The PASAPQ 15-item instrument includes 13 satisfaction items [using a Likert-type scale from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 7 (very satisfied)], a preference item, and a question on willingness to continue using the device.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients making at least 1 critical error with Genuair® (Pressair™) and Breezhaler® (Neohaler™) at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The correct use of each device will be assessed measuring the errors made by patients when using each device after 2 weeks of daily practice
Critical errors for each inhaler device are defined as those that compromise the potential benefit of the treatment such as impeding drug deposition in the lungs or the delivery of a sufficient dose</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male or female patients aged ≥40 years with stable moderate-to-severe COPD
             according to the GOLD Guidelines classification (grades II and III): forced expiratory
             volume in 1 second (measured between 10 to 15 minutes post-inhalation of 400 μg of
             salbutamol) is 30%≤FEV1&lt;80% of the predicted normal value

          -  Patients naïve to both study inhaler devices, Genuair® and Breezhaler®, for at least 2
             years

          -  Agreement to participate and voluntarily sign the informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to read product package instructions and answer patient reported
             questionnaires (PASAPQ)

          -  Patients with any other serious or uncontrolled mental health problems

          -  Patients currently participating in other randomised clinical studies

          -  Patients with COPD exacerbation within 6 weeks before Visit 1 and patient hospitalised
             for COPD exacerbation within 3 months prior to Visit 1

          -  Patients with any other conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, might indicate
