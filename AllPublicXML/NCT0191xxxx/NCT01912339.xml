      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Rezūm System and assess its effect on urinary
      symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, controlled, randomized single blind clinical trial of subjects
      with benign prostatic hyperplasia, which will allow for an interim analysis for sample size
      adjustment. Subjects first will be randomized in a 2:1 proportion in favor of the Treatment
      arm. Subjects in the Control arm will be allowed to crossover to have the Rezūm treatment
      after the 3-month follow-up examination.

    <measure>Efficacy: Change From Baseline in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 3 Month Follow-Up</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Month Follow-up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the change in BPH symptoms as measured by IPSS change between the Treatment and Control arm at 3 months post-treatment. The IPSS is a well-validated, highly reliable and responsive American Urological Association symptom score (AUASS) assessment to identify the severity of BPH Symptoms. The first seven questions of the IPSS Questionnaire address frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, hesitancy, intermittence, incomplete emptying and urgency each on a scale of 0 to 5. The total score, summed across the seven items measured, ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 35 (most severe symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Safety: Device Related Serious Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>This safety endpoint will be to demonstrate that the composite observed rate of post-procedure device related serious complications in the Treatment Arm are is less than or equal to 12% at 3 months.
Composite device related serious complications for this endpoint are 1) De Novo (new) severe urinary retention lasting more than 21 consecutive days post treatment, 2) Device related formation of fistula between the rectum and urethra, and 3) device perforation of the rectum or GI tract. Twelve percent was a pre-specified performance goal for the safety endpoint.</description>

    <description>The Rezūm System uses sterile water vapor (steam) to treat BPH by delivering targeted, controlled doses of stored thermal energy directly to the transition zone of the prostate gland.
A narrow sheath, similar in shape and size to a cystoscope, is inserted transurethrally and positioned within the prostatic urethra between the bladder neck and the verumontanum.
A thin needle is deployed through the urethra into the transition zone, and a very short (8-10 second) treatment of water vapor is delivered directly into the hyperplastic tissue and immediately disperses through the tissue interstices.
Upon contact with the tissue, the vapor condenses, or phase shifts, into its liquid state, releasing the stored thermal energy contained within the vapor. This thermal energy is released directly against the walls of the tissue cells within the treatment zone, gently and immediately denaturing the cell membranes, thereby causing instantaneous cell death.</description>

          <title>Treatment</title>
          <description>Rezum is a transurethral needle ablation procedure to treat BPH that can be performed in a clinic or out-patient setting. Rezum uses the stored thermal energy in water vapor (steam) to treat the extra prostate tissue that is causing symptoms such as frequency, urgency, irregular flow, weak stream, straining and getting up at night to urinate.
Inside a hand-held device, radiofrequency energy is applied to a few drops of water to create vapor (steam). The water vapor is injected into the prostate tissue that is blocking the flow of urine from the bladder, where it immediately turns back to water, releasing the energy stored in the vapor into the cell membranes. At this point, the cells are gently and immediately damaged, causing cell death. Over time, your body will absorb the treated tissue through its natural healing response.</description>

        <title>Efficacy: Change From Baseline in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 3 Month Follow-Up</title>
        <description>Comparison of the change in BPH symptoms as measured by IPSS change between the Treatment and Control arm at 3 months post-treatment. The IPSS is a well-validated, highly reliable and responsive American Urological Association symptom score (AUASS) assessment to identify the severity of BPH Symptoms. The first seven questions of the IPSS Questionnaire address frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, hesitancy, intermittence, incomplete emptying and urgency each on a scale of 0 to 5. The total score, summed across the seven items measured, ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 35 (most severe symptoms).</description>

            <description>Rezum is a transurethral needle ablation procedure to treat BPH that can be performed in a clinic or out-patient setting. Rezum uses the stored thermal energy in water vapor (steam) to treat the extra prostate tissue that is causing symptoms such as frequency, urgency, irregular flow, weak stream, straining and getting up at night to urinate.
Inside a hand-held device, radiofrequency energy is applied to a few drops of water to create vapor (steam). The water vapor is injected into the prostate tissue that is blocking the flow of urine from the bladder, where it immediately turns back to water, releasing the energy stored in the vapor into the cell membranes. At this point, the cells are gently and immediately damaged, causing cell death. Over time, your body will absorb the treated tissue through its natural healing response.</description>
