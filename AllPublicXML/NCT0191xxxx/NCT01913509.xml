    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate this research will shed light on metric properties of outcome
      measures of pain and fatigue and the effects of the combined therapy for stroke patients. The
      overall findings will contribute to guide the choice of proper assessment tool and the
      development of effective rehabilitation programs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemiplegic shoulder pain affects from 16%-84% of stroke patients and fatigue occurs among
      39%-72% of stroke victims, which can have an adverse impact on rehabilitation outcomes by
      interrupting treatment process, daily functions, and quality of life (QOL) for stroke
      patients. Considering the high prevalence and detrimental effects of poststroke shoulder pain
      and fatigue, it is vital for monitoring these symptoms and therapeutic interventions to be
      developed for those suffering from poststroke pain and fatigue. Therefore, to validate
      existing assessments of pain/fatigue, and to evaluate the efficacy of potential pain/fatigue
      interventions are needed.

      A vertical Numerical Rating Scale with Faces Rating Scale (NRS-FRS) could be used by all
      stroke patients as pain and fatigue measurement. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Brief
      Fatigue Inventory (BFI) measure pain/fatigue intensity and pain/fatigue interference, which
      might provide more information regarding pain/fatigue symptoms. The first aim of this
      research is to examine the psychometric properties of the vertical NRS-FRS, BPI, and BFI.

      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) appears to offer benefits in relieving painful
      hemiplegic shoulder. Previous studies have shown that therapeutic electrical stimulation of
      the posterior deltoid and supraspinatus muscles significantly reduces shoulder subluxation,
      but inconsistent results on pain reduction, pain-free range of motion of the affected
      shoulder joint, and arm function. Conventional rehabilitation usually applies transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to relieve pain. Bilateral arm training (BAT) is one of
      the novel interventions in stroke rehabilitation to improve motor recovery of the affected
      arm, especially proximal part of the upper-limb.Therefore, the second aim of this research is
      to investigate whether the combined therapy of FES and BAT (FES-BAT) could reduce hemiplegic
      shoulder pain and improve motor function of the affected arm as compared with TENS plus BAT
      (TENS-BAT). Whether interventions could further lead to better functional performance and
      higher QOL would be of interest.

      This 3-year project is implemented in three stages and recruit 80 patients with chronic
      stroke. At the first stage, investigators conduct a test-retest study to investigate the
      reliability and validity of outcome measures on hemiplegic shoulder pain and poststroke
      fatigue in 80 patients. At the second stage, investigators conduct a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) to investigate the relative effects of the FES-BAT versus TENS-BAT for 40 stroke
      patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain and moderate-to-mild motor impairment. Treatment
      regimens are designed to ensure that patients in the 2 groups receive an equivalent intensity
      of treatment (1 hour/day, 3 days/week for 4 weeks). At the third stage, investigators will
      determine clinimetric properties of the primary outcome measures, such as responnsiveness,
      minimal detectable change, and minimal clinical important change.

    <measure>Vertical Numerical Rating Scale with Faces Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS supplemented with the Wong-Baker FRS is a combination of the 0- to 10-point vertical NRS with word anchors and the six facial expressions of the FRS facilitating scoring the intensity of participants' pain/fatigue. The question for measuring pain/fatigue will be: &quot;How much hemiplegic shoulder pain/poststroke fatigue do you feel today? Please point to the number that best reflects your current level of hemiplegic shoulder pain/poststroke fatigue&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI includes four ratings of the intensity of pain (items 3-7), and seven that cover the impact of pain. Since pain can be quite variable over a day, the BPI asks patients to rate their pain at the time of responding to the questionnaire (pain now), and also at its worst, least, and average over the previous day, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The pain now, worst, least, and average rating will be combined to give a composite index of pain severity. Interference of pain is to estimate the degree to which pain limits patients' functions in the past one week, with 0 being &quot;no interference&quot; and 10 being &quot;interferes completely.&quot; The BPI asks for ratings of the degree to which pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The mean of these scores will be used as a pain interference score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The BFI was developed to measure the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on daily functioning in cancer populations. The BFI uses a 0-10 numeric rating scale to measure fatigue severity (worst fatigue, usual fatigue, fatigue now) and interference with life activities (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relationships to others, sleep, and enjoyment of life) in the past 24 hours, with 0 (no fatigue/no interference) to 10 (fatigue as bad as you can imagine/completely interferences). A composite fatigue severity score is the average of the three severity items and a composite fatigue interference score is the average of the six interference items. A global fatigue score will be obtained by averaging all the items on the BFI.</description>

          2. self-reported at least mild intensity of hemiplegic shoulder pain and poststroke
             fatigue in the past 7 days (the NRS score ≥ 2);

          3. Brunnstrom stage III or above and an initial Fugl-Meyer Assessment score of 56 to 79
             or 65-100 indicating moderate or mild movement impairment for Stage 2;

          5. no participation in any experimental rehabilitation or drug studies during the study
             period; and (6) willing to provide written informed consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. history of ventricular arrhythmias, or with a cardiac pacemaker, especially those with
             cardiac failure with conduction problems;

          2. previous contralateral stroke with persistent neurological deficit;

          3. a shoulder pathology not related to the stroke (tumor, infection, scapular

             more than one week;

          7. acute pain after operation; and

          8. auditory, visual, physical, or mental disabilities that would interfere with patients'
