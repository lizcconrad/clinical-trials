  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently it is unknown how the human brain reorganizes its network organization to generate
      conscious experience and cognitive activity after a period of unconsciousness. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to assess how cognitive activity is reconstructed after general
      anesthesia. The investigators hypothesize that the brain's transition from unconsciousness to
      consciousness and full cognition is a complex process that occurs over an extended period of
      time. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize the following order of cognitive
      reconstitution: responsiveness to command, attention, complex scanning and visual tracking,
      working memory, and executive function.

      Volunteers will be healthy participants who are anesthetized with commonly used anesthetic
      drugs as well as a non-anesthetized group to control for circadian influences. A total of 60
      subjects will be recruited for this study. All subjects (male and female) will perform basic
      tests for cognition on a laptop computer at 30-minute intervals during this study. The
      testing battery to be administered was assembled to assess multiple cognitive functions in
      order to determine whether and how cognitive processes return to baseline function.
      Electroencephalogram (measuring brain electrical activity) data will be monitored and
      recorded during both anesthesia and cognitive testing, for subsequent analysis.

      This study is significant because it could lead to a better understanding of the neural
      correlates of human consciousness, as well as normal and abnormal conscious state transitions
      (including barriers to such transitions).
