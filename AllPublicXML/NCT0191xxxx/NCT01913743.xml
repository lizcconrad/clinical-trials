  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that obese individuals exhibit greater reward-related brain
      activity in response to food cues than lean individuals and our group has shown that
      successful weight loss maintainers who were previously obese and now maintain a healthy
      weight have increased control-related activity when viewing food cues. These findings suggest
      key roles for both reward-related brain areas and inhibitory control regions in eating
      behavior. However, no studies to date have examined (a) whether the response to food cues
      (i.e., cue-reactivity) can be changed in obese individuals, (b) which strategies are most
      effective at altering brain response to food cues, or (c) the neural mechanisms that support
      such change.

      Given the omnipresent environmental cues to eat and the association between heightened
      reward-responsivity and obesity, it is critical to investigate ways to potentially alter food
      cue-reactivity in the obese. The most widely employed approach for behavioral weight loss
      treatment is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which incorporates strategies to control and
      change cognitions (e.g., avoid desire to eat tempting foods by focusing on something else).
      This approach is sometimes described as &quot;change- focused&quot; because modifying negative thoughts
      is assumed to thereby change associated maladaptive emotions and behaviors. Alternatively,
      emerging evidence suggests Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which teaches
      participants to recognize and accept their cravings as feelings that need not be acted upon,
      may also be effective in treating obesity. A third strategy often employed in smoking
      cessation and substance abuse treatment is to focus on the long-term consequences of
      behaviors, however this form of treatment is not typically used in behavioral weight loss
      therapy. Thus although each approach is potentially effective, these treatment approaches
      differ greatly in the cognitive strategies they employ.

      The primary aim of the proposed research is to compare a cognitive strategy used in CBT
      (ʻCHANGEʼ), a cognitive strategy emphasized in ACT (ʻACCEPTʼ), and a cognitive strategy used
      in smoking cessation (ʻLATERʼ) relative to a control condition (ʻNOWʼ), in their
      effectiveness in altering reward and inhibitory control responses to food cues among obese
      individuals.

        The recruited sample will include both males and females between the ages of 25-55 years
        with BMIs between 25-40. This age range reflects the modal ages for obese participants
        presenting for behavioral weight loss, and individuals with BMIs greater than 40 typically
        do not fit comfortably within the scanner bore. As with previous studies at the WCDRC, all
        participants will be weight stable (defined as within +/- 5 lbs. for the past two months).
