      The purpose of the study is to add to the knowledge of mechanisms of immune health.
      Parameters of the immune system will be followed over time in volunteers allergic to dust
      mites and bee sting after receiving immunization therapy. This information will be compared
      to healthy volunteers without allergy. We aim to bring new understanding of immune processes
      by this comparison.

      The process of immunization as a treatment for allergic disease brings about changes that are
      not all well understood and the understanding about them is developing constantly. In our
      study we plan to check a large number of immunological parameters to broaden the scope of
      knowledge of evaluating individuals for immune health across multiple sub fields of medicine
      and for advancing a basic understanding of immune cell signaling.

      The study will involve 70 participants between ages 18-45 of both sexes. Persons enrolled to
      the study will have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis caused by dust mite or persons who
      developed a systemic reaction following bee sting who are candidates to be treated by
      immunization.

      After verification of diagnosis of allergic condition and decision to start immunizations,
      blood samples will be drawn from participants before immunization weekly for 24 weeks. Blood
      samples will be analyzed in order to identify immune cell subset differences that change in
      response to allergy immunotherapy. Comparisons will be made of baseline and
      stimulation-induced status of protein phosphorylation individuals over the time-series course
      in which they receive allergy immunotherapy to pinpoint molecular mechanisms underlying
      desensitization. Evaluations will be made of cellular mechanisms of allergy immunotherapy by
      comparing over time and between groups, through serum cytokine profiling and blood gene
      expression of individuals undergoing allergy immunotherapy shots.

        house dust mite.

        Or A history of a bee sting event that resulted in a systemic allergic reaction with
        evidence of bee venom-specific immunoglobulin E by skin testing 18-45 years, inclusive at
        time of initial enrollment General good health and ambulatory at time of enrollment Willing
        and able to sign Informed Consent Available for follow-up for the planned duration of the
        study Acceptable medical history by screening evaluation and brief clinical assessment

        Allergy to multiple allergens Active systemic or serious concurrent illness, including
        febrile illness on the day of blood withdrawal History of immunodeficiency Known or
        suspected impairment of immunologic function, including, but not limited to clinically
        significant liver disease, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, moderate to severe renal
        disease, blood pressure &gt;150/95 at screening, or any other chronic disorder which, in the
        opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the
        protocol.

        medication such as Plaquenil, methotrexate, prednisone, Enbrel) which, in the opinion of
        the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the protocol.

        follow up or hospitalization during the preceding year Use of any anti-coagulation
        medication such as Coumadin or Lovenox, or anti-platelet agents such as aspirin, Plavix,
