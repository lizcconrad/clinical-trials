  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the potential clinical benefit of refametinib in patients with
      unresectable or metastatic HCC carrying a RAS mutation. The study will be conducted in 2
      stages. Approximately 95 patients (15 at Stage 1/ 80 at Stage 2) will be accrued to this
      study to receive treatment. Stage 2 of the trial will only be conducted if at least 5 out of
      15 patients at Stage 1 show at least confirmed partial response (PR) according to modified
      response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) assessed by central image review.

      Refametinib is an oral (i.e. taken by mouth) protein kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor
      targets certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. By
      specifically targeting these proteins, refametinib may stop cancer growth. The growth of the
      tumor may be decreased by preventing these specific proteins from functioning.

      The primary endpoint (the most meaningful result to be tracked) of this study is based on the
      rate of response, i.e. the disease getting smaller. The aim is to show that the therapy with
      refametinib improves the response rate in this RAS mutation patient population.

Radiological progression as determined by RECIST (Version 1.1) or mRECIST criteria or clinical progression (e.g. Eastern Cooperative Oncology group performance status - ECOG PS ≥3) patients may continue to receive study treatment if identified as having continued clinical benefit as judged by the treating physician.</description>
