  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label dose-escalation study with an extension phase will evaluate the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of lumretuzumab in combination with pertuzumab and paclitaxel in
      participants with metastatic breast cancer expressing HER3 and HER2 protein. Cohorts of
      participants will receive escalating doses of lumretuzumab intravenously (IV) every three
      weeks (Q3W) in combination with pertuzumab 840 milligrams (mg) IV initial dose followed by
      420 mg IV Q3W and paclitaxel 80 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) IV weekly. After
      completion of dose-limiting toxicity period (21 days), the study will be conducted in two
      extension phase cohorts: Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Enrollment in Extension Phase Cohort 2 will
      occur only upon completion of Extension Phase Cohort 1. Anticipated time on study treatment
      is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
