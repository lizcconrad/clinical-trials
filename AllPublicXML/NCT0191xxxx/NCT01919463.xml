      The primary aim of this study is

      - to explore the usefulness of abdominal compression on intubation.

      Other aims include

        1. to investigate the effectiveness and the efficacy of different manners of abdominal
           compression and to analysis the reasons of their success and failure

        2. to get the knowledge of the formation of colon loops and its frequency

        3. to clarify the impact of intubation with loops on adenoma detection rate

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Intubation Time (MIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>MIT refers to the mean of intubation time. Intubation time refers to the time spent on the intubation procedure. Intubation is defined as the procedure during which the tip of the colonoscope reaches the cecum from the anus.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cecal Intubation Rate (CIR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>CIR refers to the proportion of the subjects who receive the whole colon examination. The whole colon examination means the tip of the colonoscope reaches the cecum during the procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Score (PS)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the procedure, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>PS is measure by the numerical rating scale during the intubation process. Numerical rating scale contains 11 ranks from 0 to 10, in which 0 means no pain and 10 means the extreme pain cannot be borne.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severe Adverse Event Rate (SAER)</measure>
    <time_frame>The day of the procedure, 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SAER refers to the proportion of the subjects to whom severe adverse events happens. Severe adverse events include perforation, massive hemorrhage, lethal arrhythmia, death and so on.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>ADR refer to the rate of adenoma detection, calculated as the proportion of subjects with at least one adenoma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Polyp Detection Rate (PDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>PDR refer to the rate of polyp detection, calculated as the proportion of subjects with at least one polyp.</description>

    <description>Colonoscopy is completed with abdominal compression by GI assistants. Live image of magnetic endoscopic imaging system is shown to investigators for study but not to the colonoscopist for facilitating the intubation process. The colonoscopist directs GI assistants to conduct compression by his subjective judgement.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Colonoscopy is completed with abdominal compression by GI assistants. Live image of magnetic endoscopic imaging system is shown both to investigators for study and to the colonoscopist for facilitating the intubation process. The colonoscopist directs GI assistants to conduct compression according to the guidance of magnetic endoscopic imaging system.</description>
