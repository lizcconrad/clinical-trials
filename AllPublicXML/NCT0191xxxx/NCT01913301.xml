      The purpose of the study is to gather information regarding the safety and effectiveness of
      an investigational drug called Alagebrium when used treating Heart Failure in relation to
      exercise tolerance after 6 months in the trial.

          8. Stable doses of heart failure medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARB's,
             beta-adrenergic antagonists, aldosterone antagonists) for at least 1 month prior to
             randomization.

          4. History of stroke, any sequelae of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), or reversible
             ischemic neurological defect (RIND) within 6 months prior to screening.

             exception of basal cell carcinoma.

          9. Any significant systemic illness(es) or medical condition(s) that could lead to
             difficulty complying with the protocol; or any concurrent condition(s) which, in the
             investigator's opinion, would prohibit the subject from completing the study, or would
