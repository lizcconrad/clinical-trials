  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pooled analysis will assess data from the Phase 3 belimumab registration studies
      BLISS-52 (aka BEL110752) and BLISS-76 (aka BEL110751). The analysis was pre-planned and
      agreed prior to the unblinding of either study. The primary objective is to evaluate the
      impact of belimumab treatment on a more severe subpopulation of systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE) subjects from BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 to aid physicians and payers in decision making.
      Subjects are from the modified Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population defined as randomized
      subjects who received at least 1 dose of study agent. This more severe subpopulation will
      have renal, neurological, haematological, or cardiovascular/respiratory organ domain
      involvement (as defined by a British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) domain score of A,
      B or C in at least one of the domains) at baseline AND anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic
      acid (anti-dsDNA) positive (≥ 30 IU/mL) at baseline OR low C3 and/or C4 complement relative
      to the normal range at baseline.
