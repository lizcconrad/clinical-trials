  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a major cause of genital herpes. It can also cause
      serious infection in newborns and in people with weakened immune systems. It increases the
      risk of getting an HIV infection and of spreading HIV to someone else. Therefore, a vaccine
      that could prevent genital herpes could improve the general health of the world s population.
      Researchers want to study whether a new vaccine, HSV529, which may be used in the future to
      prevent herpes infections, is safe.

      Objectives:

      - To test whether a new herpes vaccine is safe.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults 18 40 years old.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have 3 vaccination visits, 7 follow-up visits, and 3 follow-up phone
           calls over 1 year.

        -  Each vaccination visit will last about 4 hours.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.

        -  Participants will have a blood sample taken.

        -  Participants will be given the vaccine or a placebo, by injection from a needle. They
           will be monitored for 30 minutes to check for any allergic reaction.

        -  Participants will be given a diary card to record any symptoms they may feel later.

        -  At follow-up visits, participants will give a blood sample and answer health questions.

        -  In the phone calls, participants will answer health questions.

      Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes genital herpes and increases the risk of acquisition
      and transmission of HIV. An HSV-2 vaccine is not available. We will study a
      replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine, HSV529, that is deleted for 2 essential viral proteins,
      that can infect, but not replicate in normal cells. The goals of the study are to determine
      (a) the safety of HSV529 vaccine in persons with or without HSV infection, and (b) the
      ability of the vaccine to elicit immune responses to HSV-2 including virus-specific
      antibodies and T cell responses to the virus. Three groups of 20 subjects each will be
      randomized and will receive 3 doses of HSV529 (15 subjects per group) or saline placebo
      injection (5 subjects per group). Each subject will be followed for 6 months after the last
      dose of vaccine. The 3 groups will be (a) subjects who were infected with HSV-2 in the past
      but may or may not have been infected with HSV-1 (HSV-1+/-/HSV-2+), (b) subjects who have
      been infected only with HSV-1 (HSV-1+/HSV-2-), and (c) subjects who have not been infected
      with HSV-1 or HSV-2 (HSV-1-/HSV-2-). Vaccine or placebo will be administered on Day 0 and
      approximately 1 month and 6 months after enrollment.

             sexually active with a male partner, she must be willing to use a highly effective
             method of contraception (e.g., intrauterine device (IUD); oral contraceptives
             diaphragm or condom in combination with contraceptive foam, jelly or cream; Norplant,
             DepoProvera, contraceptive skin patch or cervical ring) for at least 30 days prior to
             vaccination and until 30 days after final vaccination or be in a monogamous
             relationship with a male partner who has undergone a vasectomy at least 6 months prior
             to first dose of study agent.

          6. Willingness to attend all scheduled visits and able to comply with all trial
             procedures (e.g., blood draws, completion of diary cards, return for follow-up visits,

             preceding each dose of vaccine or in the 30 days following each dose of vaccine. The
             inactivated flu vaccine can be used greater than or equal to 14 days before or greater
             than or equal to 14 days after administration of study vaccine, if this is felt to be
             necessary.

         10. Persons who have close contact with infants or immunocompromised individuals agree to
             avoid such contact for 3 days after each injection.

         11. Subject must be either HSV-1 IgG antibody positive or negative and HSV-2 IgG antibody

         12. Subject must be willing to allow storage of blood, swabs of skin or mucosa, biopsies
             of skin lesions, or, for female subjects, cervicovaginal secretions (if collected) for
             future research.

        Participation of Women:

        Contraception: The effects of HSV529 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
        reason, females subjects must be of non-childbearing potential i.e. either surgically
        sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy) or, if of child-bearing potential and
        sexually active with a male partner, she must be willing to use a highly effective method
        of contraception (e.g., intrauterine device (IUD); oral contraceptives diaphragm or condom
        in combination with contraceptive foam, jelly or cream; Norplant, DepoProvera,
        contraceptive skin patch or cervical ring) for at least 30 days prior to vaccination and
        until 1 month after final vaccination or be in a monogamous relationship with a male
        partner who has undergone a vasectomy at least 6 months prior to first dose of study agent.
        Females must have a negative urine pregnancy test result prior to injection with HSV529 or
        placebo. During the course of the study, if a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is
        pregnant, she should inform the study staff and her primary care physician immediately.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials is restricted, other than
        enrollment into observational studies or into the screening protocol. Study staff should be
        notified of co-enrollment as it may require the approval by the Principal Investigator.

        An individual fulfilling any of the following criteria is to be excluded from trial
        enrollment:

          1. Subject is pregnant or lactating OR planning to become pregnant timeframe that begins
             30 days prior to the first vaccination and ends 30 days after the third vaccination.

          2. Body Mass Index greater than 40.

          3. Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device,
             or medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or or
             planned participation during the study period up to 6 months after the last dose of
             vaccine or placebo. The non-interventional follow-up for an earlier study (e.g.,
             long-term surveillance) will be allowed.

          4. Severe active infection or serious HSV-2 related or unrelated medical conditions that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent study completion.

          5. Subjects with 6 or more symptomatic recurrences of genital herpes disease within the
             year prior to Day 0.

          6. A history of HSV infection of the eye (e.g., herpes simplex interstitial keratitis or
             uveitis).

          7. A history of herpes gladiatorum, herpetic whitlow or eczema herpeticum.

          8. A history of lesions caused by HSV on either arm.

          9. A history of herpes-associated erythema multiforme.

         10. A history of a clinically significant autoimmune disorder.

         11. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency

         12. Receipt of anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6
             months.

         13. Subjects using corticosteroids (excluding topical, inhaled or nasal) or any
             immunomodulating drugs within 42 days prior to the first vaccination. An
             immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids is defined as greater than or equal to 10 mg
             prednisone equivalent per day for greater than or equal to 14 days.

         14. Subjects without a spleen.

         15. Subjects receiving immunoglobulin within the past 6 months or anticipated receipt of
             immunoglobulin during the 28 days following vaccination.

         16. Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would interfere with the subject s participation in the trial.

         17. Prior vaccination against herpes simplex virus.

         18. Known allergy or intolerance to vaccine components [e.g., potassium glutamate
             (possible cross-reaction to monosodium glutamate), sucrose] or to a vaccine containing
             any of the same substances.

         19. Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,
             or hospitalized involuntarily.

         20. Current alcohol abuse or drug abuse or addiction.

         21. Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might
             interfere with trial conduct or completion.

         22. Employee of the NIH or contractor working at the NIH, with direct involvement in the
             proposed study as well as family members (i.e. immediate, husband, wife and their
             children, adopted or natural) of the employee or of the investigators of this study.

         23. Any condition that the PI thinks might compromise the person s ability to comply with
             the requirements of the study.

        Justification for Exclusion of Women and Children:

        Exclusion of Women:

          -  Pregnancy: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of HSV529
             on the developing human fetus are unknown with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects.

          -  Breast-feeding: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to vaccination of the mother with HSV529, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother will be vaccinated with HSV529.

        Exclusion of Children:

        Because there are insufficient data regarding dosing or adverse events available in adults
        to judge the potential risk in children, children are excluded from this study.
