      Randomized,double-blind,multicenter,multinational,parallel-group,Phase III study to
      demonstrate the superiority of the triple fixed combination of
      Beclometasone+Formoterol+Glycopyrrolate (BDP/FF/GB) administered via pMDI over the equivalent
      dose of Foster® in COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) patients after 52 weeks of

      This 52-week randomised 2 parallel groups study aimed at evaluating the superiority of fixed
      triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA compared to ICS/LABA in severe to very severe COPD
      patients.

      Patients' eligibility was checked during the screening visit including the review of medical
      history, spirometry assessments, routine labs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs
      measurement. This visit was followed by a 2-week open-label run-in period under Foster®
      (BDP/FF 400/24 µg total daily dose). Eligible patients were then randomised to either fixed
      triple therapy BDP/FF/GB or BDP/FF. During the 52-week treatment period, completing patients
      did have 5 subsequent visits post randomisation scheduled respectively after 4 (Visit 3), 12
      (Visit 4), 26 (Visit 5), 40 (Visit 6) and 52 (Visit 7) weeks of treatment.

      During these, pre-dose and post-dose spirometry, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, dyspnea
      assessments were performed. Rescue medication use, compliance with the treatment and
      EXACT-PRO questionnaire were recorded daily (via an electronic diary) during the run-in and
      randomised treatment periods.
