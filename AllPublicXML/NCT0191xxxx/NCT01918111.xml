      1. (RENEWAL-EXERCISE trial) The investigators hypothesize that the increased sympathetic
           nervous system activation that is associated with resistant hypertension is a major
           contributor in the pathogenesis of exercise diastolic dysfunction and that modulation of
           the sympathetic nervous system activity with radiofrequency ablation of the renal artery
           sympathetic nerve fibers delivered via a treatment catheter, will have a significant
           effect on the diastolic function that is beyond BP-lowering effect.

        2. (RENEWAL-REGRESSION trial) The major cause of mortality and morbidity in hypertension is
           atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. the significant decrease in the sympathetic
           nervous system activation after renal sympathetic denervation will contribute to
           regression over and beyond it's effect of blood pressure reduction.

        3. (RENEWAL-PREDICT trial) No data exists regarding the tests or methods predicting the
           successful renal denervation causing the effective reduction of BP. For these, the
           investigators sought to perform the new tests such as adenosine infusion test during
           procedure and skin sympathetic activity measurement before and immediate post-procedure
           (detailed explanation provided in section of Methods) and then evaluate the association
           between these tests and reduction of BP following procedures.
