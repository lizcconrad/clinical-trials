      This is a study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Micro-Serum/Micro-Blood (finger
      Stick) Specimen Collection as compared to samples obtained by standard venipuncture (blood
      taken from the arm vein). The information and data obtained will be used to finish
      development of a convenience kit that allows doctors to provide their patients a method to
      have their blood tested for clinical laboratory tests in the convenience of their home
      without having to visit the doctor's office or clinic.
