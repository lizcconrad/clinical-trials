      The present study will assess the feasibility of using endoscopic radiofrequency ablation
      (RFA) to treat the gastric pouch and stoma with the intent to cause tissue contraction and
      decreased compliance after a failed Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, with approximately
      300,000 related deaths per year. The most commonly performed bariatric surgical interventions
      are Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band placement.
      Despite the overall initial success of RGB to induce significant EBWL in the majority of
      patients, significant weight regain occurs in about 25% of patients at 2+ years following
      surgery. Given the preliminary success of endoscopic, non-surgical salvage interventions for
      the failed (uncomplicated) RGB patient, the present study will assess the feasibility of
      using endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat the gastric pouch and stoma with the
      intent to cause tissue contraction and decreased compliance. A reduction of size and
      compliance may, as others have reported, result in re-establish weight loss and achieve an
      acceptable EBWL with minimal patient morbidity.

             excess body weight was 50 kg prior to RGB, patient must have lost at least 20 kg after
             RGB, then regained at least 5 kg to be eligible for the present study

          5. Subject is able to tolerate endoscopy and sedation

          6. Subject agrees to participate, fully understands content of the informed consent, and
             signs the informed consent form (ICF)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any bariatric surgery other than RGB, including lap band

          2. History or presence of a gastrogastric fistula or gastric pouch / jejunal ulceration

          3. Gastrojejunostomy &gt; 4 cm in diameter (size estimated at time of endoscopy)

          4. Perceived inability of the patient by the Investigator to comply with a post-treatment
             diet or medication regimen

          5. History of alcohol, tobacco and/or controlled substance dependency that would impair
             the patient from complying with protocol requirements

          6. Pregnancy

            <description>If eligible for enrollment, patients receive initial RFA treatment at 0 month. Patients return to the study site at 3.5 months to review weight data since initial RFA. If the patient has not reached ideal body weight, the patient is scheduled for endoscopy with RFA at 4 months. All patients are seen at 7.5months and if the patient has not reached ideal body weight, the patient is scheduled for endoscopy with RFA at 8 months. All patients are seen at the study site at 12 months for final clinic weight.
RFA treatment: If eligible for enrollment, a focal ablation device is selected as an intervention(size according to physician preference) and mounted on the end of the endoscope and introduced via the mouth into the esophagus and gastric pouch. The gastric pouch is treated from the top of the gastric folds to and just through the stomal anastomosis.</description>
