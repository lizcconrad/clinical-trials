  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a reduction in bone density that increases the risk of fractures;
      particularly of the spine, hip and wrist. Osteoporosis is estimated to affect 200 million
      women worldwide - approximately one tenth of women aged 60, one-fifth of women aged 70,
      two-fifths of women aged 80 and two-thirds of women aged 90. Treating osteoporosis and the
      associated fractures costs the NHS more than two billion pounds per annum.

      Teriparatide is a drug currently prescribed for some osteoporosis patients by their doctor to
      be taken by injection. It is currently the only drug available which promotes the deposition
      of new bone as opposed to preventing resorption. This is the drug treatment we will be
      studying in this clinical trial.

      The drug is of a type that cannot normally be taken as a swallowed pill. This type of drugs
      tends to be delivered by injection, as is currently the case for teriparatide. Injections
      have numerous limitations and are disliked by patients.

      This trial will assess how well the nasal spray devices work, how long the drug stays in the
      nose and also how well the drug enters the bloodstream.

      This study aims to look at how teriparatide spreads through the nose and into the blood
      stream when it is given as a liquid with a nasal delivery system called CriticalSorbâ„¢.
      CriticalSorb has been developed by Critical Pharmaceuticals to improve the absorption of
      drugs through the nose into the blood stream in the hope that it will replace injections. For
      part of the study a radioactive compound (routinely used in the nuclear medicine clinic for
      diagnosis) will be added to the formulation in order to investigate how the formulation
      spreads through nose after it is sprayed.

      The study is being carried out in postmenopausal females aged greater than 55 years of age as
      osteoporosis commonly affects these women. The study will involve 8 visits.

      The first visit will be to assess eligibility. On visit 2 the participants will receive an
      injection of the teriparatide. On visits 2-6 the participants will receive a nasal dose of
      teriparatide via nasal devices at different dose levels, blood samples will be taken to
      measure drug levels following dosing.

      For visits 5 and 6 the nasal dose will have a radioactive marker added and gamma camera
      imaging will also be carried out. These visits will also compare two different nasal devices.

      Visit 7 will be a follow up visit. There will be one further visit during the study to
      acquire a MRI scan of the head that will assist analysis of the scintigraphic images.
