      The study is designed as non interventional to collect data on the safety especially, severe
      hypoglycemia or documented symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes and effectiveness of
      acarbose/metformin fixed-dose combination under real-life treatment condition in large sample
      of type-2 diabetes patients in India. The study objective is to evaluate severe hypoglycemia
      or documented symptomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycemic events reported as adverse events. The
      study will begin after the study approval by ethics committee. All patients with type 2
      diabetes on acarbose or metformin monotherapy and prescribed Glucobay M will be included in
      study after taking the informed consent. Patients will be observed for up to 24 weeks (2
      weeks).The study involves general examination of patients, collection of data like history of
      disease, concomitant medication, drug dose etc. The study is planned to enroll 10000 subjects
      from multiple study centers spread across India. The study data will be analyzed with
      appropriate statistical methods.
