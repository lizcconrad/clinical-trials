        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for enrollment, the subject must:

          1. Be female, ≥ 18 years of age

          2. If the subject is a female of childbearing potential, have a pregnancy test evaluated
             as negative prior to surgery, per the site's standard of care

          3. Have a nicotine test evaluated as negative prior to surgery and agree not to smoke for
             the duration of the study

          4. Be willing to undergo mastectomy with healthy, well-vascularized skin flaps
             anticipated by the surgeon

          5. Be eligible to enroll in one of the following three cohorts:

        1. Subject had radiation therapy (XRT) prior to direct-to-implant (DTI) reconstruction, but
        will not have XRT following reconstruction;

        2. Subject did not have XRT prior to DTI reconstruction and will not have XRT following
        reconstruction;

        3. Subject did not have XRT prior to DTI reconstruction, but will have XRT following
        reconstruction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for enrollment, the subject must not:

          1. Have collagen-vascular, connective tissue, or bleeding disorders

          2. Have any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes, which is clinically known to impact
             wound healing ability

          3. Have an autoimmune disease, an immune deficiency, or is on immune-suppression drugs
             for reasons other than current treatment for breast cancer

          4. Have a BMI that is ≥ 32

          5. Have a nicotine test evaluated as positive prior to surgery or unwilling to quit
             smoking for the duration of the study

          6. Currently have an alcohol/substance abuse problem or have had a relapse within 1 year
             prior to screening visit

          7. Be pregnant, lactating, or expecting to be within the next 24 months

          8. Have concomitant unrelated condition of breast/chest wall/skin (e.g. significant chest
             wall abnormalities including pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum)

          9. Require the use of any additional implant for soft tissue support of the contralateral
             non-study breast, except in bilateral breast reconstructions, where the use of SERI®
             Surgical Scaffold is allowed

         10. Have had a prior soft tissue support implant

         11. If enrolled into the Pre-Radiated cohort, have had recent radiation (&lt; 1 year) to the
             breast/chest wall

         12. If enrolled into the Post-Radiated cohort, radiation to the breast/chest wall is
             planned more than 1 year from the time of SERI® Surgical Scaffold placement

         13. Have clinical evidence of severe radiation tissue damage (e.g. pigmentation,
             indentation, atrophy, no elasticity to skin of radiated breast) from previous XRT to
             the breast/chest wall

         14. Have large or multiple scars on the breast(s) that may interfere with blood supply to
             the mastectomy flaps
