    <textblock>
      Patients with the symptom complex syncope or near-syncope are quite often in the emergency
      department. Most patients with syncope have a positive prognosis. However some types of
      syncope are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. It is a challenge to detect
      these patients reliably at an early stage. The current guidelines contain exact definitions
      concerning the characteristics of patients with syncope and recommendations on how to
      diagnose and treat these patients following standardized pathways. Due to the fact that
      near-syncope is poorly defined and therefore seldom evaluated in clinical trials, data
      concerning near-syncope are rare.

      Our aim was to characterize patients presenting with syncope or near-syncope to the emergency
      department regarding their risk profile, comorbidities and prognosis. First we evaluated if
      there is a difference between the two groups syncope and near-syncope concerning type and
      frequency of adverse events. Furthermore we analyzed the routinely measured cardiac
      biomarkers NT-proBNP and hs cTnT in patients with syncope or near-syncope. Then we determined
      both their prognostic accuracy in predicting adverse events and their diagnostic accuracy in
      finding the underlying etiology. Finally we analyzed a special patient collective, patients
      aged ≥ 65 years. It is assumed that elderly patients are suffering from comorbidities and
      age-related physiological and cognitive disabilities. We therefore hypothesize that elderly
      patients, in contrast to patients aged &lt; 60, display an increased risk of adverse events and
      that they have a poorer prognosis.
