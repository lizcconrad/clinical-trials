    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the amount of compound present in the blood (relative
      bioavailability) after a single administration of GLPG0634 as a tablet versus a capsule in
      fasted conditions in male healthy subjects.

      Also, the effect of food on the bioavailability of the tablet formulation will be studied as
      well as the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of GLPG0634 given either as capsule
      or tablet.

    <measure>The amount of GLPG0634 and metabolite in plasma after a single dose of GLPG0634 as capsules or tablets</measure>
    <time_frame>From predose (before first study drug administration) up to 144 hours post last study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize and compare the amount of GLPG0634 and metabolite in plasma (relative bioavailability) in male healthy subjects after a single administration of either a capsule or tablet formulation in a fasted condition. For the tablet formulation, also the amount of GLPG0634 and metabolite in plasma will be evaluated after fasting and in fed condition.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GLPG0634 after a single oral dose as capsules or tablets, either fasted or fed, in male healthy subjects in terms of adverse events (AEs), abnormalities in laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG)</description>
