  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Android obesity</measure>
    <time_frame>6weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective was to evaluate the change in the % fat in the android region as measured by DEXA during 6 weeks of HULA as compared to WALK</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>metabolic parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>6weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objectives included the comparison of differences in waist circumference (cm), relative and absolute trunk and limb muscle mass as measured by DEXA (% and kg), fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l), fasting serum insulin (mU/l), liver enzymes (U/l), fasting plasma LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (mmol/l). Gene expression was analyzed in adipose tissue biopsies collected before and after each exercise intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>adipose tissue inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>6weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the effects of HULA compared to WALK on adipose tissue inflammation, a needle aspiration biopsy of abdominal s.c. adipose tissue was taken under local anesthesia with lidocaine before and after each exercise intervention. The adipose tissue sample was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80°C until analysis. Total RNA from s.c. AT was isolated.Relative quantification for the genes of interest (see list below) was carried out using normalization to the 36B4 and β-actin mRNA values.
ABCA1 Adiponectin ANGPTL8 CHOP CD4 CD8 CD68 ETFDH FOXP3 GLUT4 MCP-1 MRC-1 PGC-1α VEGF-A β-actin</description>
