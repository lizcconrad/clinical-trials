  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial aim of this study will be to assess current methods of heart failure (HF) patient
      education in terms of patient satisfaction, level of preparedness for home, and care provider
      satisfaction. The second aim will be to design and create a &quot;living with HF at home&quot;
      simulation session. The third aim will test the hypothesis that hospitalized HF patients who
      receive education in a simulation room in addition to usual HF education will have improved
      qualitative and quantitative outcomes as compared to those who do not receive the additional
      education support.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients requiring ICU monitoring

          3. Cardiac transplant candidate/recipient

          4. Confusion

          6. Terminal illness (other than HF) with expected survival of less than 1 year

          7. Enrollment or planned enrollment in another randomized clinical trial during this
             hospitalization

          8. Inability to comply with planned study procedures

          9. Active illicit drug use

         10. Participation in any other clinical trials involving investigational or marketed
             products within 30 days prior to entry in the study.

         11. Other conditions that in the opinion of the Primary Investigator may increase risk to
             the subject and/or compromise the quality of the clinical trial.
