  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of desloratadine (MK-4117) in Japanese
      participants with chronic urticaria. The primary hypothesis is that the efficacy of
      desloratadine 10 mg and 5 mg is superior to placebo as based on the change from Baseline in
      the sum score of pruritus/itch and rash as assessed by the Investigator at Week 2.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Sum Score of Pruritus/Itch and Rash Assessed by Investigator at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Week 2 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of participant pruritus/itch during the daytime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot relax because of constant itching) and nighttime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot sleep because of itching). The score used for pruritus/itch was the higher of the day or night scores (0=Asymptomatic to 4=Severe). The Investigator also assessed the severity of participant rash using the overall rash score (0=No rash to 3=Looks very bad). The sum of the pruritus/itch score (0-4) and rash score (0-3) could range from 0 to 7, with a higher sum score indicating greater severity. The change from Baseline in the sum of the pruritus/itch and overall rash scores at the Week 2 clinic visit was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks (Up to 2 weeks after last dose of study drug)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Day 3 Visit, Week 1 Visit, Week 2 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of participant pruritus/itch during the daytime and nighttime (0=Asymptomatic to 4=Severe). The sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores could range from 0 to 8, with a higher score indicating greater severity. The changes from Baseline in the sum of the daytime and nighttime scores at the Day 3, Week 1 and Week 2 clinic visits were calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Day 3 Visit, Week 1 Visit, Week 2 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of participant rash (erythema: 0=no symptom to 3=intensive redness, and wheal: 0=no symptom to 3=significant ridge). The sum score for erythema plus wheal could range from 0 to 6, with a higher score indicating greater severity. The changes from Baseline in the sum score for erythema plus wheal at the Day 3, Week 1 and Week 2 clinic visits were calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Moderate or Remarkable Improvement in the Global Improvement Rate of Both Pruritus/Itch and Rash (Erythema and Wheal) Assessed by the Investigator at Day 3, Week 1 and Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Day 3 Visit, Week 1 Visit, Week 2 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The global improvement judgment criteria were used to assess overall improvement in pruritus/itch and rash. The Investigator assessed participant global improvement according to 5 grades (Grade 1=Remarkable improvement to Grade 5=Aggravated). The number of participants with moderate or remarkable improvements was calculated. Remarkable improvement (Grade 1) was defined as both pruritus/itch and rash (erythema and wheal) disappeared, or pruritus/itch disappeared and rash (erythema and wheal) was apparently improved. Moderate improvement (Grade 2) was defined as both pruritus/itch and rash (erythema and wheal) were greatly improved.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score Reported by Participants at Week 1 and Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit and Week 1 Visit, Week 2 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures how much participant skin problems have affected their life. Responses to questions about the effect of participant skin problems on life ranged from 0=Not at all to 3=Very much. The DLQI is broken down into 6 subscales: Symptoms and feelings (range 0-6), Daily activities (range 0-6), Leisure (range 0-6), Work and school (range 0-3), Personal relationships (range 0-6), and Treatment (range 0-3). DLQI subscales were summed to yield the DLQI total score, which could range from 0 to 30. For both DLQI subscales and DLQI total score, a higher score indicated a greater negative impact on life. Participants &gt;=16 years of age completed the DLQI questionnaire about the condition of their skin over the previous week. The changes from Baseline in the DLQI total score at the Week 1 and Week 2 clinic visits were calculated.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Sum Score of Pruritus/Itch and Rash Assessed by Investigator at Week 2</title>
        <description>The Investigator assessed the severity of participant pruritus/itch during the daytime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot relax because of constant itching) and nighttime (0=Virtually no itching to 4=Cannot sleep because of itching). The score used for pruritus/itch was the higher of the day or night scores (0=Asymptomatic to 4=Severe). The Investigator also assessed the severity of participant rash using the overall rash score (0=No rash to 3=Looks very bad). The sum of the pruritus/itch score (0-4) and rash score (0-3) could range from 0 to 7, with a higher sum score indicating greater severity. The change from Baseline in the sum of the pruritus/itch and overall rash scores at the Week 2 clinic visit was calculated.</description>

        <description>The global improvement judgment criteria were used to assess overall improvement in pruritus/itch and rash. The Investigator assessed participant global improvement according to 5 grades (Grade 1=Remarkable improvement to Grade 5=Aggravated). The number of participants with moderate or remarkable improvements was calculated. Remarkable improvement (Grade 1) was defined as both pruritus/itch and rash (erythema and wheal) disappeared, or pruritus/itch disappeared and rash (erythema and wheal) was apparently improved. Moderate improvement (Grade 2) was defined as both pruritus/itch and rash (erythema and wheal) were greatly improved.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Pruritus/Itch Score Reported in Participant Diaries at Day 3, Week 1 and Week 2</title>
          <description>Participants assessed the severity of their pruritus/itch during the daytime and nighttime (0=asymptomatic to 4=severe). The sum of the daytime and nighttime pruritus/itch scores could range from 0 to 8, with a higher score indicating greater severity. The changes from Baseline in the sum of the daytime and nighttime scores at the Day 3, Week 1 and Week 2 clinic visits were calculated.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score Reported by Participants at Week 1 and Week 2</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures how much participant skin problems have affected their life. Responses to questions about the effect of participant skin problems on life ranged from 0=Not at all to 3=Very much. The DLQI is broken down into 6 subscales: Symptoms and feelings (range 0-6), Daily activities (range 0-6), Leisure (range 0-6), Work and school (range 0-3), Personal relationships (range 0-6), and Treatment (range 0-3). DLQI subscales were summed to yield the DLQI total score, which could range from 0 to 30. For both DLQI subscales and DLQI total score, a higher score indicated a greater negative impact on life. Participants &gt;=16 years of age completed the DLQI questionnaire about the condition of their skin over the previous week. The changes from Baseline in the DLQI total score at the Week 1 and Week 2 clinic visits were calculated.</description>
