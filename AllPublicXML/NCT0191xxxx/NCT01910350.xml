      1) To determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increases first time and
      appropriately timed breast cancer screening rates among Black, Latina and Arab women; 2) To
      determine if the Kin KeeperSM Cancer Prevention Intervention increase first time and
      appropriately time cervical cancer screening rates among Black, Latina and Arab women; 3) To
      measure functional cancer literacy over time at the individual and familial level and 4)
      Assess rates of healthcare utilization cost among women in the Kin KeeperSM intervention and
      control-comparison groups.
