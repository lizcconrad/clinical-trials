  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study where BAY1125976 is given to humans. Patients (all comers) will
      receive the study drug treatment in a dose-escalation scheme (no placebo group) to determine
      the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY1125976. The relative
      bioavailability of liquid service formulation and tablets will be determined.

      After the MTD is defined breast cancer patients with and without AKT1 mutation will be
      treated.

      The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics, biomarker status, pharmacodynamic parameters
      and tumor response of BAY1125976.

      BAY1125976 will be given daily as single oral application. Treatment will be stopped if the
      tumor continues to grow, if side effects, which the patient cannot tolerate, occur or if the
      patient decides to exit treatment.
