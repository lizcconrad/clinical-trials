      The primary objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women
      with multiple sclerosis who were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis
      product during the eligibility window for that product. The Registry-specified Biogen MS
      products being studied are dimethyl fumarate, Pegylated human interferon beta-1a, and
      Dalclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP).

      The Biogen Multiple Sclerosis Pregnancy Exposure Registry is a prospective, observational
      registry designed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who
      were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis product during the eligibility
      window for that product. Women of childbearing potential are a considerable segment of the
      patient population affected by MS and are likely to be exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen
      MS product around the time of conception and during pregnancy. Biogen completed pregnancy
      registries for Avonex and Tysabri; however, formal studies in pregnant women have not been
      conducted. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, in a global Pregnancy Registry, how
      exposure to a marketed Biogen MS product specified in this Pregnancy Registry may affect
      pregnancy and infant outcomes. Data will be collected on prospective pregnancies (i.e.
      enrollment prior to knowledge of outcome) at time of enrollment, 6 to 7 months gestation, and
      approximately 4,12, and 52 weeks after estimated date of delivery. The prevalence of
      spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and other pregnancy and infant outcomes will be
      calculated and compared to background rates from external sources such as the European
      Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies.

      <textblock>
        Within each product cohort, approximately 310 to 375 pregnant women exposed to a
        Registry-specified Biogen MS product will be enrolled in order to observe 300 prospective
        pregnancy outcomes. The infants born to these women will also be part of the population
        studied. Patients with prenatal testing prior to enrollment (with the exception of a first
        trimester ultrasound to date the pregnancy) will not be counted towards the 300 prospective
        pregnancy outcomes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient consent

          -  Patient has a diagnosis of MS.

          -  Documentation that the patient was exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen MS product
             during the eligibility window for that product.

          -  DMF: Exposure since the first day of her last menstrual period (LMP) prior to
             conception or at any time during pregnancy.

          -  Peginterferon beta-1a: Exposure since 14 days prior to the first day of her LMP prior
             to conception or at any time during pregnancy.

          -  DAC HYP: Exposure since 90 days prior to the first day of her LMP prior to conception
             or at any time during pregnancy

          -  Patient agrees to sign the Release of Medical Information Form, thereby permitting the
             Registry to contact her health care provider (HCP(s)) and the pediatric HCP for
             medical information.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The outcome of the pregnancy (i.e., pregnancy loss or live birth) must not be known at
             the time of enrollment.

          -  Initial maternal health assessment upon confirmation of pregnancy does not preclude
             participation in the Registry unless a patient tests positive for a medical condition
             associated with negative pregnancy outcomes (e.g., toxoplasmosis screen and syphilis
             [venereal disease research laboratory test and rapid plasma reagin test] blood screen)
             in the opinion of the healthcare provider (HCP).

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria may apply.
