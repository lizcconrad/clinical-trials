  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main clinical goal of NAC is to down-stage the primary tumor for BCS,yet BCS after NAC
      has been associated with significantly higher ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences.The
      accuracy of breast tumor excision in BCS can dramatically reduce IBTR.The main reseason of
      IBTR might be the uncertain shrinkage modes of the breast cancer after NAC.This clinical
      trial is firstly carried out to make clear the shrinkage modes of the primary tumor after 3
      cycles and whole cycles of NAC,respectively,with whole-mount serial section(WMSS) and
      three-dimensional(3D) pathological reconstruction of the residual tumor.The second objective
      is to investigate the predictive value of 3D MRI reconstruction for the shrinkage modes of
      the primary tumor after NAC.

    <description>Typically, the pretreatment tumor specimen will be a core needle biopsy. Because 15% to 28% of patients will have no residual tumor after NAT, it is important to have an adequate pretreatment sample in which an unequivocal diagnosis of invasive carcinoma is established and evaluation of hormone receptors and HER2/ neu status is completed before treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients,locally advanced breast cancer,age ≥18 years.

          2. Histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast.

          3. Primary palpable disease confined to a breast and axilla on physical examination. For
             patients without clinically suspicious axillary adenopathy, the primary tumor must be
             larger than 2 cm in diameter by physical exam or imaging studies (clinical T2-T3,
             N0-N1, M0). For patients with clinically suspicious axillary adenopathy, the primary
             breast tumor can be any size (clinical T1-3, N1-2, M0). (T1N0M0 lesions are excluded.)

          4. Patients without clearly defined palpable breast mass or axillary lymph nodes but
             radiographically measurable tumor masses are acceptable. Accepted procedures for
             measuring breast disease are mammography, MRI, and breast ultrasound. This will need
             to be re-evaluated after 3 cycles and prior to surgery.

          5. ECOG 0 or 2

          6. No distant metastasis, as documented by complete staging workup ≤6 weeks prior to
             initiation of study treatment.

          7. No previous treatment for breast cancer.

          8. Adequate hematologic function with:

             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500/μL. Platelets ≥100,000/μL. Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL.

          9. Adequate hepatic function with:

             Serum bilirubin ≤ the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). Aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 x institutional ULN. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x
             institutional ULN.

         10. Adequate renal function with serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN.

         11. Planned primary systemic (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and surgical resection of residual
             primary tumor (mastectomy or lumpectomy/breast conservation) following completion of
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. inflammatory breast cancer

          2. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.A negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to
             first study treatment (Day 1, Cycle 1) for all women of childbearing potential is
             required. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a birth control method
             that is approved by their study physician while receiving study treatment and for 3
             weeks after their last dose of study treatment. Patients must agree to not breast-feed
             while receiving study treatment.

          3. Concurrent treatment with an ovarian hormonal replacement therapy or with hormonal
             agents such as raloxifene, tamoxifen or other selective estrogen receptor modulator
             (SERM). Patients must have discontinued use of such agents prior to beginning study
             treatment.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including (but not limited to) ongoing or active
             infection.

          5. Concurrent treatment with any anti-cancer therapy other than those agents used in this
             study.

          6. Mental condition or psychiatric disorder that would prevent patient comprehension of
             the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study or that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.
