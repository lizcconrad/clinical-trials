  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of an anesthetic called articaine for
      dental treatment, comparing it with an anesthetic commonly used in dental clinic: lidocaine.
      Two types of local anesthesia (oral injection) in accordance with the solution used were
      performed. For patients anesthetized with articaine, an injection of anesthesia close to the
      tooth to be treated was used. For the anesthetic lidocaine an injection on the cheek at the
      bottom of the mouth was made. Differences between both techniques are mainly regarding the
      area of numbness. In the injection with articaine only a small part of the lip and the tooth
      was anesthetized. With lidocaine injection, the lower region of the entire side of the tooth
      and half of the tongue on the same side was numbed. The treatment was electronic randomized
      and there was equal chance to one or another treatment. The investigators are studying this
      new form of anesthesia (near the tooth that was treated) to see if it can numb the tooth to
      an emergency treatment, if it really decreases the feeling of numbness and discomfort during
      the service. Patients receiving articaine were submitted to cone beam exam at no cost.

      Aim: This randomized clinical trial compared the anesthetic efficacy of buccal infiltration
      (BI) with 4% articaine (AR) and inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) with 2% lidocaine (LI),
      both with 1:100,000 epinephrine, in symptomatic mandibular molars with irreversible pulpitis.
      Likewise, we compared the efficacy of the primary infiltration (BI or IANB) with one
      supplemental injection (intraligamentary infiltration with articaine for AR and BI with
      articaine for LI). The influences of buccal cortical bone thickness and root distances to
      buccal cortical bone on articaine performance (AR) were also evaluated using cone-beam
      tomography. methodology: Volunteers presenting symptomatic mandibular molars with
      irreversible pulpitis were randomly divided into two groups (30 for AR and 20 for LI).
      Success was recorded when complete pain-free treatment was achieved after primary injection
      or when one supplemental injection was needed for emergency endodontic procedures.
