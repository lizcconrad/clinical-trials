             allowed.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

             adequately treated in-situ carcinomas, basal or squamous cell carcinoma, or

             system dysfunction that, in the Investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's
             safety, or put the study outcomes at risk.

          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, unstable angina, or any Class 3 or 4 cardiac
             diseases as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional

             factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or
             thrombopoietin receptor agonists within 7 days (14 days for Aranesp) prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Have been treated with any chemotherapeutic agent within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives of
             the first dose of study drug, whichever is longer.

          -  Are being treated with systemic corticosteroids. Inhaled and topical steroids as well
             as intermittent dexamethasone for nausea or vomiting are permitted.

          -  Any disease(s), psychiatric condition, metabolic dysfunction, or findings from a
             physical examination or clinical laboratory test result that would cause reasonable
             suspicion of a disease or condition, that contraindicates the use of study drugs, that
             may increase the risk associated with study participation, that may affect the
             interpretation of the results, or that would make the subject inappropriate for this
