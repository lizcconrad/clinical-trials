  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of bismuth subsalicylate
      (Pepto-Bismol®) 524 mg versus placebo on gastrointestinal (GI)-related events reported in
      healthy volunteers receiving TECFIDERA™ (dimethyl fumarate [DMF]; also known as BG00012)
      twice daily (BID) The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are: To
      characterize the effect of bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol®) 524 mg versus placebo on the
      frequency, severity, and duration of GI-related events and to evaluate GI-related events that
      lead to discontinuation of DMF.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be in good health as determined by the Principal Investigator (PI) based on
             medical history and Screening evaluations (clinical laboratory evaluations, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital signs; see below for specific exclusion criteria).

          -  Must have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 34.0 kg/m2, inclusive.

             contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue contraception for
             90 days after their last dose of study drug.

          -  Male subjects must agree to not donate sperm for 90 days after their last dose of
             study drug.

          -  Must be naïve to dimethyl fumarate (DMF) or fumaric acid esters.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

        unsuitable for enrollment.
