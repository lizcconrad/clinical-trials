      The safety and tolerability of Bupropion in HD.

      The influence of Bupropion compared to placebo on the:

        -  change of apathy as quantified by the AES-C (clinician) or the AES-S (self),

        -  change of motor symptoms (UHDRS) and quantitative grip force motor assessment,

        -  change of cognitive symptoms (UHDRS and MMSE),

        -  change of psychiatric symptoms (UHDRS, HADS),

        -  change of activities of daily living (UHDRS),

        -  change of the NPI caregivers' distress score (NPI-D),

        -  change of ventral striatal and ventromedial prefrontal activation in response to a
           reward paradigm as quantified by fMRI.
