        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index within 18.5 to 30.0kg/m2

          -  Regular defecation pattern (minimum once per 2 days).

          -  Subject must be non-fertile, i.e., surgically sterilized or must practice an adequate
             contraceptive method to prevent pregnancies as defined in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to MDV3100, or any components of the formulation
             used.

          -  Any of the liver function tests above the upper limit of normal. A retest to confirm
             the result may be performed once.

          -  Any clinically significant history of asthma, eczema, any other allergic condition or
             previous severe hypersensitivity to any drug (excluding non-active hay fever).

          -  Abnormal pulse and/or blood pressure measurements at the pre-study visit as follows:
             Pulse &lt;40 or &gt;90 bpm; mean systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg ; mean diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;90 mmHg (blood pressure measurements taken in triplicate after subject has
             been resting in supine position for 5 min; pulse will be measured automatically).

          -  A QTc interval of &gt; 430 ms after repeated measurements (consistently after duplicate
             measurements), a history of unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, unexplained cardiac
             arrhythmias or torsades de pointes, structural heart disease, or a family history of
             Long QT Syndrome (LQTS).

          -  Use of any prescribed or OTC (over-the-counter) drugs (including vitamins, natural and
             herbal remedies, e.g. St. John's wort) in the 2 weeks prior to admission to the
             Clinical Unit, except for occasional use of paracetamol (up to 3 g/day).

          -  Regular use of any inducer of metabolism (e.g., barbiturates, rifampin) in the 3
             months prior to admission to the Clinical Unit.

          -  Positive serology test for HBsAg, anti HAV (IgM), anti-HCV or anti-HIV 1+2.

          -  Exposure to radiation for diagnostic reasons (except dental X-rays and plain X-rays of
             thorax and bony skeleton (excluding spinal column)), during work or during
             participation in a clinical study in the previous year.
