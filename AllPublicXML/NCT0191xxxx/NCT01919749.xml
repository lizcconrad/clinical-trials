        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Understand and provide written informed consent and HIPAA Authorization prior to
             initiation of any study-specific procedures

          -  Have a life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Have a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer with measurable disease (RECIST 1.1)

          -  Have progressed on ≥ 1 prior chemotherapeutic and/or hormonal regimen for advanced
             disease.

          -  Have documentation of progression (by RECIST 1.1) on the treatment regimen immediately
             prior to entering this study

          -  Be ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Have a ECOG score of 0-1

          -  Be a good medical candidate for and willing to undergo a biopsy or surgical procedures
             to obtain tissue, which may or may not be part of the patient's routine care for their
             malignancy. The requirements for the amount of tissue required for analysis are
             detailed in Section 6.2.2.

          -  Have been off their prior regimen for ≥ 3 weeks or 5 x half-life of drug, whichever is
             shorter and have recovered from the side effects (≤ grade 1) of that regimen

          -  Have adequate organ and bone marrow function

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and
             agree to use at least one form of contraception during the study and for at least one
             month after treatment discontinuation. For the purposes of this study, child-bearing
             potential is defined as: all female patients that were not in post-menopause for at
             least one year or are surgically sterile

          -  Male patients must use a form of barrier contraception approved by the investigator /
             treating physician during the study and for at least one month after treatment
             discontinuation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a tumor biopsy intended for use in the current study that was performed more than
             2 months prior to analysis

          -  Have metastatic lesion that is not accessible to biopsy

          -  Had &gt; 6 months treatment under the last line of therapy

          -  Have interventional cancer therapy conducted after the biopsy was collected prior to
             analysis

          -  Have symptomatic CNS metastasis. Patients with a history of CNS metastases who have
             been treated with whole brain irradiation must be stable without symptoms for 4 weeks
             after completion of treatment, with image documentation required, and must be either
             off steroids or on a stable dose of steroids for ≥ 2 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Have any previous history of another malignancy (other than cured basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin or cured in-situ carcinoma of the cervix) within 5 years of study entry

          -  Have uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             serious infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             unstable cardiac arrhythmias, psychiatric illness, or situations that would limit
             compliance with the study requirements or the ability to willingly give written
             informed consent

          -  Have known HIV, HBV, HCV infection

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding patients or any patient with childbearing potential not
             using adequate contraception.
