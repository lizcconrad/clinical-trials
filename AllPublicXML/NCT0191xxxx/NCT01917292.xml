      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of periodontal intervention on vascular
      dysfunction among Chinese prehypertensive adults with moderate to severe periodontal disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is one of the low-grade chronic diseases, and it is the principal cause of
      tooth loss among middle-aged and elderly. Recently, epidemiological data indicate that
      patients with periodontitis are associated with increases in blood pressure levels and
      hypertension prevalence. Furthermore, studies from cross-sectional investigations demonstrate
      that hypertensive patients with periodontitis may enhance the risk and degree of vascular
      damage. Therefore, periodontal therapy is a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent the
      occurrence of BP elevation and retard the development vascular injury.

      The term &quot;prehypertension&quot; indicates those with BPs ranging from 120 to 139 mm Hg systolic
      and/or 80 to 89 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure. Accumulating evidence suggests that subjects
      with prehypertension is associated with higher incidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease.
      However, until now there are no available data to investigate the influence of periodontitis
      on prehypertension and whether periodontal intervention may reduce the BP rise in subjects
      with prehypertension and improve the vascular function. We hypothesized that periodontitis
      leads to elevation in BP and periodontal therapy improves vascular function in subjects with
      prehypertension. To address these assumptions, The present study is designed to study the
      effect of periodontal intervention on blood pressure and vascular function and inflammatory
      biomarkers among Chinese prehypertensive adults with moderate to severe periodontal disease,
      and determine whether intensive periodontal therapy improves these measures over a 6-month
      follow-up period.
