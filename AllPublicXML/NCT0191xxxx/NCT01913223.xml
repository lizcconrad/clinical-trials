    <textblock>
      ESD (Endoscopic Sub-mucosal Dissection)is the first-intent method to treat superficial
      neoplasms of the digestive tract at it allows an en-bloc R0 resection. Following marking of
      the lesion margins, ESD comprises 3 steps: 1) liquid injection into the sub-mucosal space 2)
      circumferential (complete or partial) incision and 3) dissection of the submucosa. Several
      tools are necessary to perform ESD with the standard technique. Development of water jet with
      bi functional (injection and cutting) catheter allows time and significant reduction of
      perforation risk (due to multiple changes of instruments). For this purpose, Nestis
      introduced the Enki 2 pulsed jet technology with high pressure system to inject efficiently
      and at any time viscous solutions in direct viewing and retroflexion. Preliminary pig studies
      indicate that injection of glycerol, hyaluronate and hydroxyethlstarch with Enki 2 are
      possible. In addition, preclinical studies on living pig colon models using saline solutions
      have demonstrated that perforation rates and operating times are significantly reduced
      compared to a standard electrosurgical knife. The present clinical study is being performed
      to confirm this system capability to perform ESD in humans.
