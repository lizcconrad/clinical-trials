  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is a rare disease entity with aggressive clinical course and
      poor prognosis. Currently, there is no treatment option for relapsed or refractory extranodal
      NK/T-cell lymphoma. Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase inhibitor which was approved for
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A recent phase II study of romidepsin for relapsed/refractory
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma reported an overall response rate of 38% (95% confidence interval
      24%-53%). The median duration of overall response was 8.9 months. Considering the median
      number of previous treatments in these patients was three (range 1-11), romidepsin has single
      agent activity against relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma. Thus, if the single agent
      activity of romidepsin is demonstrated, it could be a therapeutic agent for combination with
      salvage treatment.
