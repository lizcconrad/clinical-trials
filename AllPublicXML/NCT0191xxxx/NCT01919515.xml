  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis to be tested is that NuSmile ZR esthetic primary molar crowns perform
      similarly to an established Stainless Steel primary molar crown (3M ESPE) for restoration of
      primary molar teeth.

      The aim of this study is to clinically evaluate the performance of a new NuSmile ZR esthetic
      primary molar crown, compared with 3M ESPE Primary Stainless Steel crowns (currently the most
      common full coverage crown for the restoration of primary molars when a crown is necessary)in
      the restoration of 50 paired, prepared primary first and second molar teeth in the deciduous
      dentition of child patients.
