  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether intake of a diet with a high content of
      butyrate (from dairy fat) can affect blood FIAF concentration compared to a control diet.
      Further to examine whether high intake of inulin (a prebiotic) can increase the proportion of
      butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut and thereby affect blood FIAF concentration. In
      addition, the correlation between FIAF blood concentrations and resting energy expenditure,
      blood lipid profile and gut microbiota composition will be investigated.

      Furthermore, this study will investigate whether the source of FIAF can be determined. To
      this end, adipose tissue biopsies will be analyzed and an in vitro experiment with fecal
      water samples will be carried out.

      The study is a crossover randomized controlled trials with 3 arms. Each arm has a duration of
      3 weeks. 20 overweight/obese subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized to the
      order of interventions. Before and after each intervention period, blood samples will be
      collected and the participants will have their resting metabolic rate measured. At the end of
      each intervention period, the participants will collect feces for 5 consecutive days. In
      addition, adipose tissue biopsies will be taken after each intervention period.
