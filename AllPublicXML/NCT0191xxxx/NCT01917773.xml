      The research study is designed to test how a medication called octreotide affects the
      motility (contraction or squeezing) of the colon (large intestine). Investigators are
      investigating whether octreotide can increase contraction and movement in the colon.

    <measure>Compared Colonic Motility Index From Fasting to Post Octreotide Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Average MI for all patients was calculated over 15-minutes, 30-minutes and 45- minutes before and after administration of octreotide.</time_frame>
    <description>Colonic motility was measured using a solid-state catheter. The catheter had 36 sensors spaced 5-cm apart for the first 15 sensors and 1-cm apart for the remaining sensors. Pressures were transmitted to a transducer and recorded on a personal computer system (Medical Measurement Systems USA, Dover, NH).
Motility index (MI) was calculated using the Medical Measurement Systems computer program. The MI represents the area under the curve of the pressure tracing for a certain period (21). The MI was calculated for each channel. The MIs from all of the channels were then averaged to give each patient 1 average MI for the particular period under study. In this study, MI was calculated for the periods of 15, 30, and 45 minutes before and after infusion of octreotide. MI is reported as millimeters of mercury (mmHg) per 15, 30, or 45 minutes.</description>

          <description>Fasting motility was recorded for at least 60 minutes.
Octreotide 1mcg/kg, maximum of 50mcg was administered subcutaneously (one hour after application of EMLA topical cream). Motility was then recorded for 45-60 minutes.
Patients were then offered a high-fat, high-energy meal as described elsewhere, and motility was recorded for 60 minutes.
Patients then received 1 to 2 doses of bisacodyl (0.2 mg/kg, maximum of 10 mg) through the motility catheter, and motility was recorded.</description>
