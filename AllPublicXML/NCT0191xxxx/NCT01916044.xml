  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of caesarians dramatically increased for 15 years. The main indication of caesarian
      became the iterative caesarian of principle because of a history of caesarian. Any attempt of
      reduction of the rate of caesarians should thus focus on the indications of iterative
      principal caesarean. Nevertheless, the main reason usually evoked to justify a reduction of
      the attempts of low way after caesarian is the concern generated by the risk of uterine break
      during the trial of labor. Yet, there is no reliable method to predict this risk of uterine
      break. A way of interesting research consists in estimating the potential profits of the
      echography of the scar lower segment. Indeed, the echography can be useful to determine the
      specific risk of uterine break of a patient by measuring the thickness of the lower segment
      of the womb.

      The strong negative predictive value of the echography of the lower segment on the risk of
      uterine break should encourage the women encircled to accept a trial of labor. That is why,
      this examination associated with a rule of decision could help to decrease the rate of
      iterative elective caesarians and especially to decrease the mortality and the foetal and
      maternal morbidity connected to the trial of labor among the patients having a history of
      caesarian.

      &quot;Lower Uterine Segment Trial (LUSTrial)&quot; Evaluation of the efficiency of the ultrasound
      measure of the thickness of the lower segment associated with a rule of decision to reduce
      the foetal and maternal morbidity and mortality in the coverage of the deliveries of the
      women having a history of caesarian: a pragmatic randomized trial

      Aim Evaluation of the efficiency of the ultrasound measure of the thickness of the lower
      segment associated with a rule of decision to reduce the foetal and maternal morbidity and
      mortality in the coverage of the deliveries of the women having a history of caesarian
      Methodology Randomized trial, multicentric, open, in two parallel arms.

      Evaluated treatments:

      Between 36+0 and 38+6 weeks of amenorrhea, the patients will be invited to participate in the
      study. After agreement, the patients respecting the criteria of inclusion and not inclusion
      will be randomized in two groups:

      GROUP A (experimental group) : The ultra sound measure of the thickness of the lower segment
      will be realized in a way standardized by expert sonographers. The patient will be informed
      that in case of measure:

        -  superior at the threshold of 3.5 mm, her will be considered &quot; a low risk &quot; by
           complications and will be encouraged to try a event of the work

        -  subordinate or equal at the threshold of 3.5 mm, her will be considered &quot; at risk &quot; by
           complications and will be encouraged to give birth by iterative elective caesarian.

      GROUP B (control group) : The ultra sound measure of the lower segment will not be realized.
      The mode of delivery will be decided according to the current clinical practice.
