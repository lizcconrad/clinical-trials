    <textblock>

      cognitive behavioral therapy, and stress education, a previously employed control condition,
      for patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

      We are currently conducting a treatment study to reduce stress and anxiety in people with
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This study will not use a medication, but instead will
      involve weekly stress reduction classes that use different strategies to reduce anxiety. The
      study involves having a formal psychiatric interview, filling out questionnaires, ECGs,
      saliva samples, a urine test for drugs of abuse, and study visits over 12 weeks. Each study
      visit will take a few hours. Qualified participants will be compensated for time and travel.

    <description>The yoga intervention will apply Kundalini Yoga practices as taught by Yogi Bhajan. This is a well-known, accessible style of practice in the U.S. that incorporates all of the traditional components of yoga including physical postures and exercises, breathing techniques, relaxation exercises and meditation practices. It is a safe style of yoga that is registered with the Yoga Alliance that is readily and routinely adapted for therapeutic purposes. The 12-week yoga intervention will consist of 12 group classes and assigned daily home practice led by qualified and certified yoga instructors. Each group yoga session will include physical postures/exercises, breathing techniques, meditation and deep relaxation practice that are all easy to learn and do not require extensive practice or athletic ability to perform.</description>

    <description>The 12 session CBT treatment will be based on the standardized protocol developed at one of our centers (CARD) and widely available [88]. This protocol is comprised of four primary treatment modules including cognitive restructuring, progressive muscle relaxation, worry exposures, and in vivo exposure exercises. The initial sessions describe the cognitive behavioral model of worry and GAD. Each session consists of a different &quot;lesson.&quot; These lessons initially cover basic information about the nature of the anxiety and worry, the possible function and negative consequences of worrying, the maladaptive and paradoxical effects of attempting to control and suppress one's thoughts, the basic cognitive errors of probability overestimation and catastrophic thinking, adaptive strategies to deal with worries, such as problem solving, worry exposure, which may involve exploring and exposing the patient to negative images and scenarios that might be behind some of the worrisome thoughts.</description>

    <description>SE will also include 12 weeks of group and home practice sessions. SE will control for attention from instructors, expectancy effects, and group support effects, Stress Education (SE) will be employed as an active control intervention. SE is currently used in NIH-funded protocols at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind-Body Medicine at MGH. In this condition, participants will be provided with detailed and extensive information about stress and health, but will not receive any CBT, yoga, or other mind-body training techniques.</description>
