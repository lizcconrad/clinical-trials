  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a serious medical condition associated with increased mortality, longer hospital
      stay, increased rates of institutionalisation, and declines in post-admission functionality.
      Despite the prognostic utility of diagnosing delirium and its utility as an important
      indicator of health quality in elderly patients in developed countries, it is not routinely
      screened for in many busy general medical in-patient settings, especially in developing
      countries. Unpublished data from a recent study of general medical in-patients in Groote
      Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, found that no patients admitted during an 8-week
      period received any formal cognitive testing or had documentation of the presence/absence of
      delirium in routine clinical notes. This under-recognition is largely the result of the
      length and complexity of available delirium diagnostic tools e.g. Mini-mental state exam
      (MMSE), although the perceived lack of clinical importance and conflicting results about
      specific treatment modalities also contribute.

      The investigators recently developed the simple 4-question &quot;RACY&quot; delirium screening tool for
      use in general medical in-patients. Preliminary data show the test to be simple and effective
      with a sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 85% respectively using a ROC-selected cut-point
      of RACY≤2. The investigators hypothesis that the RACY screening tool has the potential to be
      a simple and effective bedside delirium diagnostic instrument for use in non-geriatric, busy
      general medical in-patient settings. This study is a two-centre validation study to evaluate
      the diagnostic accuracy of this tool.
