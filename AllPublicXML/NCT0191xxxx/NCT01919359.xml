    <description>The Primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of nutritional supplements for the reduction of ecchymosis and erythema associated with aesthetic procedures.
Reduction in ecchymosis and erythema will be determined by evaluation of red, green and blue color values of 3D patient photography using the Canfield Vectra.</description>
