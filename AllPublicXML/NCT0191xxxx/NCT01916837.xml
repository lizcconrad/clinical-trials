  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study the investigators sought to evaluate the feasibility of using the
      genomic signature - Genomic Grade Index (GGI) - in routine clinical practice and its impact
      on treatment recommendations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing Genomic
      Grade Index (GGI) in community hospitals in Belgium for breast cancer patients with node
      negative and 1-3 node positive early breast cancer. GGI would be considered a feasible
      genomic test if results were obtained in &gt; 70% of evaluated patients.

    <measure>The impact of Genomic Grade Index results on adjuvant treatment decision</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of Genomic Grade Index on adjuvant treatment decisions for patients with early breast cancer. This was done by comparing physicians' treatment recommendations before having knowledge of the GGI test results to recommendations with a hypothetical GG-1 and GG-3 result and to the treatment ultimately administered after discussion with the patient.</description>

    <measure>The success rate of reporting Genomic Grade Index results</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To test the success rate of reporting GGI, a minimum sample size of 137 was calculated to have a power of 90% at a one-sided significance level of 5% using an empirical estimate of variance (null hypothesis H0: p ≤ 0.70 vs. alternative hypothesis HA: p ≥ 0.80).</description>
