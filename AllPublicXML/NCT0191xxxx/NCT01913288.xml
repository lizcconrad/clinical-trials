  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this RCT is to learn more about how sounds that we experience in the womb can
      affect early development in premature infants. The investigators are specifically interested
      determining whether and what types of maternal sensory stimulation can influence physical
      growth, brain maturation, respiratory stability and early vocalization during postnatal
      development. The investigators hypothesize that daily exposure to biological maternal sounds,
      such as mother's voice and heartbeat, will improve both short-term and long-term
      developmental in premature infants and will increase their potential to grow into healthy
      children.

      The purpose of this RCT is to learn more about how sounds that we experience in the womb can
      affect early development in premature infants. The investigators are specifically interested
      determining whether and what types of maternal auditory stimulation can influence physical
      growth, brain maturation, respiratory stability (including heart rate, respiratory rate and
      oxygen saturation levels) as well as early vocalization prior to 40 weeks gestation. The
      investigators hypothesize that daily exposure to biological maternal sounds, such as mother's
      voice and heartbeat, will improve both short-term and long-term developmental outcomes in
      premature infants and will increase their potential to grow into healthy children.
