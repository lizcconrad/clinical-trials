  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that around 40% of GCA patients are able to decrease the prednisone dose
      until 0.1 mg/Kg/d or less after 6 months of treatment. In this study, we hypothesized that
      adding 3 months of tocilizumab to prednisone could increase the percentage from 40 to 70%.

    <description>Remission: absence of symptoms attributable to Giant Cell Arteritis and normalization of inflammatory markers (CRP&lt;10 mg/L and ESR&lt;30 mm/h).
Relapse: recurrence of symptoms attributable to active GCA and/or increased levels of inflammatory markers (CRP≥10 mg/L and/or ESR≥30 mm/h). Elevation of inflammatory markers in the absence of GCA symptoms was considered relapse if it persisted at two time points at 1 week apart without any other obvious etiology than GCA.</description>
