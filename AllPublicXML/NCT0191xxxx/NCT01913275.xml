    <textblock>
      Periampullary carcinoma and carcinoma head of pancreas are common causes of obstruction at
      the lower end of the common bile duct. Whenever possible, surgical resection in the form of
      Whipple Pancreaticoduodenectomy (WPD) is the treatment of choice. However, this operation is
      associated with a substantial postoperative morbidity and mortality. With advances in
      surgical techniques and postoperative care there has been a decrease in the operative
      mortality. However, the postoperative morbidity remains high varying between 5%-64%. Of the
      various risk factors, the degree of jaundice as indicated by the serum bilirubin levels has
      been associated with an increased risk of complications. Preoperative biliary drainage has
      been tried to decrease the serum bilirubin levels and consequently decrease postoperative
      morbidity and mortality. Internal biliary drainage can be achieved by surgical
      cholecystojejunostomy or endoscopic bile duct stenting. Endoscopic stenting can be done as a
      day care procedure under conscious sedation, but involves insertion of a foreign body
      (stent), which results in introduction of bacteria into the bile and problems of
      postoperative infection. Also, endoscopic stenting before surgery may result in difficulty in
      dissecting around the common bile duct during the surgical procedure. While the surgical
      bilioenteric bypass has the advantage that no foreign body is inserted into the biliary tree
      and hence the likelihood of sepsis is low, it requires anesthesia and involves a surgical
      incision.

      There is no study comparing the outcomes of preoperative endoscopic and surgical drainage in
      patients undergoing pancraticoduodenectomy. We plan to compare the outcomes of preoperative
      endoscopic biliary drainage with surgical drainage in patients undergoing
      pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      Hypothesis preoperative biliary decompression by Cholecystojejunostomy will reduce infective
      complication by 23% as compared to endocopic stenting INTRODUCTION Pancreaticoduodenectomy
      has been associated with a substantial postoperative morbidity and mortality. Advances in
      surgical techniques and postoperative care have led to a decrease in the operative mortality.
      However, the postoperative morbidity has remained high varying between 5%-64%.1 Of the
      various risk factors, analyzed in the retrospective studies, the degree of jaundice as
      indicated by the serum bilirubin levels has been associated with an increased risk of
      complications.2-5 Preoperative biliary drainage has been tried to decrease the serum
      bilirubin levels and consequently decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality. However,
      its role remains controversial.

      External biliary drainage using percutaneous transhepatic insertion of a catheter has been
      used.6,7 The disadvantages of external bleary drainage include the risk of spontaneous
      catheter dislodgement, inflammation and pain at the puncture site, leak of ascitic fluid and
      bile around the catheter, and loss of fluid and electrolytes. Moreover, bile has an
      antibacterial action and its loss has been associated with sepsis and renal failure. Hence,
      internal biliary drainage is considered more appropriate.

      Internal biliary drainage can be achieved by surgical cholecystojejunostomy or endoscopic
      bile duct stenting. The internal drainage provides a more physiological route for drainage of
      bile into duodenum or jejunum, which prevents any loss of electrolytes and bile salts, and
      reduces the risk of endotoxemia. Two studies using endoscopic bilary drainage have shown
      benefit in terms of reduced postoperative morbidity and mortality.7,8 However, it involves
      the insertion of a foreign body (stent), which results in occurrence of bacteria in bile with
      its attendant problems of postoperative sepsis.

      Prior to the availability of the endoscopic and percutaneous methods, surgical bilioenteric
      bypass was the only method for preoperative biliary decompression. The disadvantage of this
      method is that it requires anesthesia and involves a surgical incision. However, its
      advantages are that no foreign body is inserted into the biliary tree and hence the
      likelihood of sepsis is low. Also, endoscopic stenting before pancreaticoduodenectomy may
      result in difficulty while dissecting the common bile duct. Historically, Whipple conceived
      pancreaticoduodenectomy as a two staged procedure. The first stage was surgical decompression
      of biliary tract to reduce the level of the hyperbilirubinemia to minimize mortality and
      morbidity after extirepative surgery and the second stage was a definitive surgical
      resection.

      There is no study comparing the outcomes of preoperative endoscopic and surgical drainage in
      patients undergoing pancraticoduodenectomy. We plan to carry out a randomized trial comparing
      the outcomes of preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage with surgical drainage in patients
      undergoing pancraticoduodenectomy.

      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

      To compare endoscopic bilary stenting with cholecystojejunostomy as a preoperative biliary
      drainage procedure in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with respect to

        1. Technical success

      examination, liver function tests and an ultrasound abdomen. Those patients who have liver
      function tests and an ultrasound suggestive of lower end block will be further evaluated with
      a contrast enhanced CT and side viewing endoscopy (biopsy whenever possible) to characterize
      the nature of block.

      Group A: Endoscopic stenting Group B: Cholecystojejunostomy

      Preprocedural preparation10

        1. Informed consent: The patient will be explained about the course and nature of disease,
           alternatives methods of treatment available, outcome with and without treatment. The
           procedure will be explained completely to the patient including the risks and
           complications involved and then consent will be taken.

        2. Investigations The following investigations will be done in all the patients

             1. Prothrombin time

             2. Liver function tests (LFTs)

             3. Baseline haematological, biochemical and radiological investigations done in all
                patients as follows:

           i) Haemogram ii) Kidney Function Test iii) Electrolytes iv) Blood sugar v) Chest X-ray
           vi) ECG

        3. Prophylactic antibiotics: All patients will receive prophylactic antibiotics (Inj
           cefaperazone + sulbactam 1 gm) 2 hours before the procedure and these will be continued
           upto 72 hours after the procedure. Patients will be kept nil orally for 8 hours prior to
           the procedure, and will be well hydrated with i.v. fluids.

      Procedure

        1. Endoscopic stenting (EBS)11 A therapeutic duodenoscope and a standard sphincterotome
           will be used for canulation of the bile duct. A hydrophilic guidewire (Terumo, 0.032&quot;
           dia or Jag wire 0.035&quot; dia, microvasive) will be used to cross the malignant stricture.
           After the stricture was crossed with the help of a guidewire, the wire will be removed
           and bile will be aspirated. A small sphincterotomy will be done with a wire-guided
           sphincterotome to facilitate the passage of the stent. The sphincterotome will be
           removed and a guide catheter will be passed over the guidewire and then a 10 F 7 cm long
           straight plastic stent will be inserted across the stricture over the guidewire. A
           maximum of three attempts will be allowed for insertion of the stent after which it will
           be categorized as procedural failure.

        2. Cholecystojejunostomy (CJ) Cholecystojejunostomy will be done under local anesthesia
           using a small subcostal incision made over the distended gall bladder. The anastomosis
           will be done in 2 layers using 3-0 vicryl and 3-0 silk sutures.

      Any complications related to both procedures and following them will be recorded.

      Follow up On day 5 following the endoscopic or surgical bypass, the patients will be
      reassessed clinically and with hematological and biochemical parameters with special
      reference to haemogram and LFTs to know whether the biliary drainage is effective. After 4
      weeks along with clinical, hematological and biochemical parameters, nutritional parameters
      will also be assessed.

      All patients will be considered for definitive procedure at least after 4 weeks after the
      biliary drainage procedure.

      The operative difficulty, amount of blood loss, number of transfusions required and operative
      time during definitive surgery will be recorded. Following pancreaticoduodenectomy, the
      postoperative complications will be evaluated in both groups.

      Outcome measures Primary

        1. Technical success: Passage of a stent across the stricture, along with flow of bile
           through the stent.

                peritoneal cavity

             3. Postoperative haemorrhage: Hematemesis, malena, blood los from the abdominal wound
                or drian site requiring 2 or more units of blood transfusion.

                leucocytosis, fistula or abscess.

             5. Bile leak: Clinical bile leak or elevated bilirubin level in drain fluid with
                normal serum level.

        4. Postoperative mortality: was defined as death within 30 days after surgery or before
           discharge from the hospital.

      Stastistical analysis Baseline characteristic will be expressed in mean (SD). The Pearson chi
      square test and Fischer exact test will be used for to compare the categorical data as
      appropriate. The Student t-test will be used to compare the continuous variables.
      Multivariate analysis will be done using logistic regression tests. Length of hospital stay
      will be compared using the log-rank test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. A pvalue of &lt;0.05
      will be taken as significant.
