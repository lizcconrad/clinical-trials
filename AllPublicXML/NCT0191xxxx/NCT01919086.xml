  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if researchers could get the same good results with less
      toxicity by using this new approach.

      We already know that the three drugs bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone given
      together at the same time are effective. Most physicians therefore treat patients with
      multiple myeloma with the 3 drug combination. However, the researchers also know that the
      three drugs given together result in more side effects than when only 2 drugs (bortezomib and
      dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone) are given. The researchers believe that all
      patients may not necessarily need the three drugs to have good results. In this study, the
      researchers will first treat your disease with bortezomib and dexamethasone. If the disease
      is not well controlled with these 2 drugs, only then the third drug, lenalidomide, will be
      added. By using this sequential approach we may reach the same good results with fewer side
      effects.

             Criteria. According to these criteria, patient must have

               -  Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow ≥ 10% and/or presence of a
                  biopsy-proven bony or extramedullary plasmacytoma and any one or more of the
                  following myeloma defining events:

               -  Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥ 60% (Note: clonality should be
                  established by showing kappa/lambda-light-chain restriction on flow cytometry,
                  immunohistochemistry, or immunofluorescence. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage
                  should preferably be estimated from a core biopsy specimen; in case of a
                  disparity between the aspirate, the highest value should be used)

             carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after
             curative therapy. Patients who have had prior malignancies within the past 2 years but
             are considered to be &quot;cured&quot; with a low likelihood of recurrence may be eligible at
             the discretion of the Principal Investigator.
