    <textblock>
      The waist circumference (WC) cut off levels of the Caucasian people may not represent the
      characteristics of different ethnic groups. The investigators aimed to determine sex specific
      WC cut off points to predict obesity, metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk in
      Turkish adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Waist circumference (WC) is an easy and reliable measure of visceral adipose tissue and a
      simple index of cardiovascular risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported sex
      specific WC cut off values for the Caucasian people, named as action levels 1 and 2, to
      define the overweight or obese people. These cut off values, originally established in a
      Dutch population, were later adopted by several medical organizations in order to define
      Metabolic Syndrome. However, these cut off levels may not necessarily represent the
      characteristics of the other populations. Therefore it is recommended that the sex specific
      WC cut off points should be established for different ethnic groups.

      The investigators aimed to investigate whether the suggested sex specific WC cut off points
      for the Caucasian adults are appropriate for the Turkish adult population. The secondary aim
      of the study is to search for better WC cut off points to predict obesity, metabolic syndrome
      and increased cardiovascular risk in Turkish adult men and women.

    <description>These cut off levels were determined by the receiver operating curve analyses. The sum of the highest sensitivity and specificity values of the WC levels to determine the overweight (Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 25kg/m2) and obese (BMI&gt;30kg/m2) adults were taken as the cut off points. The cut off points to determine the overweight, were also taken as the WC limits for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.</description>

    <description>The group was enrolled from the 24 provinces of the 7 regions of Turkey. At least 3 provinces were selected from each region by a random sampling method. The populations of these 7 regions were obtained from the records of the 2000 census. The study sample included males and non-pregnant females aged between 20 and 83 years. The populations of city centers, districts, and villages were classified by using the stratified sampling method and then were selected from the data collected from the household identification forms by random sampling. The geography of Turkey was classified into three groups according to altitude. Sea level was accepted as zero. 0-300 m was taken as coastal, 300-900 m as moderate</description>

        This cross-sectional study was conducted in 24 provinces from the 7 regions of Turkey.
        Turkish adult males and non-pregnant females were randomly enrolled from both the
        provincial district centers and villages, considering the demographics, economic, social,
        and geographical statuses.
