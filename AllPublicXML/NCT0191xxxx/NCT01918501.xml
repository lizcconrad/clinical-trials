      Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and multifactorial neurological disease
      characterized by infiltration of immune cells and progressive damage to myelin and axons.
      Remyelination, the generation of new myelin in the adult nervous system, is an endogenous
      repair mechanism that restores function of axons. Neurons require considerable energy for
      their activities, including synaptic neurotransmission, and hence have significant numbers of
      mitochondria. Unlike other cell types that are able to utilize glycolysis as an alternative
      energy source, glycolysis in fully differentiated neurons is basically suppressed to maintain
      their antioxidant status. This property makes neurons highly vulnerable to ATP deficiency,
      and may be a factor in the susceptibility of neurons to cell death. Mitochondria provide
      cellular energy by converting oxygen and nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP); and
      reflect local metabolic needs and via oxidative phosphorylation. Nervous tissues contain
      about 70% lipids of their dry weight, and around 40% of these lipids are polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFAs).

      Goal: Understanding the relationship between blood composition, mitochondria role and
      clinical status.

      Here, we will examine expression levels of different fatty acids in the blood and monitor
      mitochondrial transmembrane potential as marker for the mitochondria general function.

      Hypothesis: Remyelination efficiency in MS is likely mediated by many factors, besides
      reducing inflammation. Remyelination may not be achieved correctly /sufficient in MS patients
      due to nutrition low content causing mitochondrial dysfunction and/or due to fatty acid
      molecules deficit unable to create a new myelin layer.

      Methods: The study will be authorized by the Ziv Helsinki Committee. Informed consent and
      questionnaire will obtained from all subjects before study entry. We will examine 120
      volunteers in a blind fashion, including 60 MS patients diagnosed by a neurologist based on
      clinical, laboratory and MRI findings. Patients will be evaluated according to EDSS score.
      The control group will include 50 age and gender matched healthy volunteers and 10 more
      patients with unrelated neurological diseases. Inclusion criteria: Age 18-60; Exclusion
      criteria: Other diseases, pathologies, or immune system disorders. Here, we will examine
      expression of different fatty acids in the serum and in erythrocyte samples; Monitor
      mitochondrial transmembrane potential as marker for the mitochondria general function.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Upon enrollment, a single blood sample of approximately 20 ml will be taken. The interaction of antigen and lymphocytes induces a cascade of cellular events. We will measured responses in myelin antigen treated lymphocytes from all volunteers. After, we will utilized the fluorescence measurement of fluorescein diacetate and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE).</description>
