  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed to patients who have had reconstructive surgery of
      wounds on their face using skin grafts. But, it is not yet known whether antibiotics improve
      the healing of skin grafts and reduce the risk of infections after surgery in these patients.
      It is known that antibiotics, like all medications, have side-effects although these are
      rare. This research study is designed to show us whether antibiotics improve wound healing or
      not, so that we may determine if we should continue using antibiotics even if they have
      side-effects in some patients.

      Our hypothesis is that patients treated with post-operative, systemic antibiotics will
      demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the survival of their facial full
      thickness skin grafts compared to patients who are not treated with systemic antibiotics.

    <description>All patients will receive peri-operative antibiotics per standard practice. This consists of a single dose of cefazolin or, in penicillin allergic patients, clindamycin administered at the time of anesthesia administration prior to the surgical incision. In the cohort randomized to receive post-operative antibiotics, the first choice intervention will be oral cephalexin (500 mg, three times daily or four times daily, for one week). In patients who are penicillin or cephalosporin allergic, we will prescribe clindamycin (300 mg, three times daily or four times daily, for one week).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  all adult patients with a nasal or facial skin/soft tissue defect requiring

             both clindamycin and cephalexin, discovery of a persistent cutaneous malignancy at the
             site of the defect following the reconstructive procedure and previous reconstruction
             at the site of the skin/soft-tissue defect.
