  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of BEHHS is first to assess the baseline sub-clinical disease in a population of
      Baptist Health Employees who have Metabolic Syndrome, a known contributor to cardiovascular
      disease. Second, the investigators wish to encourage a healthy lifestyle through personalized
      nutrition and fitness advice, delivered as part of a web based program, which will in turn
      lead to increases in heart healthy behaviors such as increased consumption of heart healthy
      foods, increased exercise initiation, and more positive attitudes about health. To assess
      this, the investigators plan to randomize 200 employees with Metabolic Syndrome to either the
      new web-based diet and lifestyle program, or to care-as-usual, which is the currently offered
      MyWellnessAdvantage and WebMD websites. The investigators hypothesize that the web-based
      group will show greater improvements in physical health (such as weight loss, cholesterol
      reduction, etc.) as well as increased consumption of heart healthy foods, exercise
      initiation, and quality of sleep as measured by surveys administered at the 4,8, and 12 month
      follow-up appointments.
