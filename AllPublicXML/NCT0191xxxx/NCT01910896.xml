    <description>The POSA scale consists of two scales which need to be filled out by the observer and the subject, respectively. The scale will be rated for both scars of the same subject by observer and the subject independently in all planned visits.
Observer Scar Assessment: The observer assesses the following items on a scale from 1 (normal skin) to 10 (worst imaginable skin): Vascularization, Pigmentation, Thickness, Relief, Pliability.
Patient Scar Assessment: The subject answers the following questions on a scale from 1 (no, no complaints) to 10 (yes, worst imaginable): Is the scar painful?, Is the scar itching?; The subject answers the following questions on a scale from 1 (no, as normal skin) to 10 (yes, very different): Is the color of the scar different?, Is the scar more stiff?, Is the thickness of the scar different?, Is the scar irregular?</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has two or more newly formed post dermatological surgery scars of 1-10
             (inclusive) cm each, with comparable length, located on a comparable skin area (upon
             the discretion of the investigator, considering e.g. the skin thickness or body
             tension). Scars located at the upper back of the body will not be investigated due to
             a higher risk of wound dehiscence.

          -  The dermatological surgery takes place within the last 3 weeks prior to baseline visit
             and the baseline visit is on the day of post-surgery control with optional suture
             removal, the wound must be closed by then.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with known history of keloids or hypertrophic scars.

          -  Subject with derma resurfacing procedures or non-invasive skin-tightening procedures
             including medium/ deep chemical peeling, dermabrasion treatments or laser therapy in
             the skin area intended to be treated for less than 8 weeks prior to screening/
             baseline visit.

          -  Subject with any planned topical application containing active ingredients (e.g.
             self-tanning agents, however, hydration lotion is allowed provided the scars are left
             free) in the skin area intended to be treated.

          -  Subject anticipated spending excessive time in the sun (e.g. outdoor workers) or in
             the sun tanning bed during the investigation.

          -  Subject with any infection or wound in the area intended to be treated.

          -  Subject with known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of OIP (e.g. acrylic adhesive,
             extractum cepae or allantoin).

          -  Subject who is taking, or anticipated to take during the investigation, systemic
             corticosteroids or topical corticosteroids applied on the investigation skin area.

          -  Subject with eczema requiring treatment in the skin area intended to be treated.

          -  Subject with any ongoing severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (cardiac,
             respiratory, hepatic, renal or gastrointestinal), malignant tumor (except for
             basalioma), or known HIV infection.
