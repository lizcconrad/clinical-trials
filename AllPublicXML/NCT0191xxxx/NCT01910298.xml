      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, parallel design comparing a primary
      efficacy endpoint between subjects undergoing immediate post-mastectomy breast reconstruction
      with a breast implant and Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix (TM) and subjects
      undergoing immediate, two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, where the initially
      placed expander will be exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type of
      reinforcement.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of immediate single-stage
      post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with Strattice™ TM, otherwise referred to as direct to
      implant (DTI) as compared to immediate two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction where
      the initially placed expander will be exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type
      of reinforcement. The objective will be achieved by prospectively assessing the number of
      planned and unplanned post-mastectomy surgical interventions A within 12 months of the
      mastectomy.

      Two-stage breast reconstruction will include the initial placement of a tissue expander in a
      total or partial submuscular position. In the case of partial muscle coverage, this will be
      without the support of any mesh or autologous flap to reinforce the lower pole. The expander
      will be inflated over approximately the next one to six months, and then replaced with an
      implant.
