  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deep fried chocolate bar is a snack that the international community strongly associates
      with Scotland. It has previously been cited as being &quot;a symbol of all that is wrong with the
      high-fat, high-sugar Scottish diet&quot;. Despite the snack's reputation, no medical research has
      been performed to examine the effects of consuming a deep fried chocolate bar on the human
      body.

      In contrast to the deep fried chocolate bar, porridge has been shown to reduce the risk of
      cardiovascular disease, but its effect on cerebral blood flow has yet to be directly
      assessed.

      This study will focus on the potential (patho)physiological cerebrovascular effects of the
      deep fried chocolate bar and porridge. The research question to be addressed in this study is
      &quot;Does eating a deep fried chocolate bar or bowl of porridge induce changes in cerebral blood
      flow and cereborvascular reactivity in healthy adults?&quot;

      To assess the acute effects on eating either food on blood flow through the largest artery in
      the brain, the investigators will give healthy volunteers one regular-sized deep-fried
      chocolate bar or a bowl of porridge. Blood flow through the largest artery in the brain will
      be assessed using simple ultrasounds tests. The investigators aim to recruit 24 volunterrs
      who will visit twice, consuming a different food on each visit.
