    <textblock>
      This study will involve 10 visits to the clinical site over approximately 1.5 months. There
      will be a screening visit (7-28 days may pass between the screening visit and the first
      treatment visit), a baseline/treatment visit (first day of study drug treatment), followed by
      5 consecutive days of treatment visits. Follow-up visits will occur 6, 13, and 20 days after
      first receiving study drug.

    <measure>Change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - 6 Items (HAM-D-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 72 hours after initiating treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is completed with a structured interview guide by the clinician based on his/her assessment of the patient's symptoms. This structured interview has been validated for use with time frames shorter than one week. Scale items are assessed based on symptoms within the past 24 hours. A higher score indicates more depression symptoms. Total scores range from 0 (normal) to 22 (severe).
To better estimate the baseline, we did not use simply the cross-sectional assessment at baseline, but we estimated the average during the screening period as the true baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 72 hours and 20 days after initiating treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which measures depression severity (in past 3 days), was completed by clinicians using an MGH structured interview. Each item is measured on a scale from 0 to 6, and the items are summed to find the total score. The total minimum score is 0 units on a scale and the total maximum score is 60 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe depression.
To better estimate the baseline, we did not use simply the cross-sectional assessment at baseline, but we estimated the average during the screening period as the true baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 72 hours and 20 days after initiating treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S scale was administered by clinicians to measure depressive severity (CGI-S). Each item is rated on a seven-point scale (1=normal to 7=among the most severe), so a higher total score indicates greater depressive severity. Severity is assessed based on the last 24 hours.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours and 20 days after initiating treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I scale was administered by clinicians to measure improvement in depressive severity (CGI-I). Each item is rated on a seven-point scale (1=very much improved to 7=very much worse), so a higher total score indicates less improvement in depressive severity. Improvement is assessed based on the last 24 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 72 hours and 20 days after initiating treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This validated self-rating instrument has 44 items on a scale of 1-6, measuring multiple depressive symptom domains. Each item is rated based on a subject's perception of what is normal for the individual (score = 2), what is better than normal (score = 1), and what is worse than normal (scores = 3-6). This scale is rated based on the past 24 hours. A total score is calculated by summing the 44 item scores, for a range of 0-264.
To better estimate the baseline, we did not use simply the cross-sectional assessment at baseline, but we estimated the average during the screening period as the true baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 72 hours and 20 days after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10-item, validated, self-rated measure of perceived stress, that is of the degree to which the subjects perceives things to be stressful and overwhelming. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress. This scale is rated based on the past 24 hours.
To better estimate the baseline, we did not use simply the cross-sectional assessment at baseline, but we estimated the average during the screening period as the true baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive Affect Scale (PAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 72 hours and 20 days after initiating treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a validated, self-rated measure of positive affect uses 5-point scales (1 = very slightly/not at all to 5 = extremely). Higher scores represent higher levels of positive affect. The scale is rated based on the past 24 hours. The total score is the sum of 10 items, for a range of 10-50.
To better estimate the baseline, we did not use simply the cross-sectional assessment at baseline, but we estimated the average during the screening period as the true baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Satisfaction With Participation in Social Roles and Discretionary Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 72 hours and 20 days after initiating treatment</time_frame>
    <description>These are two well-validated 7-item self-rating scales that measure social health. A higher score represents higher satisfaction on each scale. The scales are rated based on the past 24 hours. Each item is rated 1-5 (1=Not at all, 2=A little bit, 3=Somewhat, 4=Quite a bit, 5=Very much). Each 7-item subscale score is the sum of each of the 7 items and ranges from 7-35.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 72 hours after initiating treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a low-burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior. It is a clinical interview providing a summary of both ideation and behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present. The C-SSRS will be performed to assess suicidal ideation and behavior. It contains a 5-item rating scale for suicidal ideation and a 7-item rating scale for suicidal behavior. Higher total scores indicate higher severity. Each item is coded 1=yes, 0=no, so a total score of 0 on each scale means that a no response was entered for each of the 5 suicidal ideation and for each of the 7 suicidal behavior questions, i.e., 0=lowest severity score. Total suicidal ideation score ranges from 0 (least severe) to 5 (most severe). Total suicidal behavior score ranges from 0 (least severe) to 7 (most severe).</description>

        <description>This instrument is completed with a structured interview guide by the clinician based on his/her assessment of the patient's symptoms. This structured interview has been validated for use with time frames shorter than one week. Scale items are assessed based on symptoms within the past 24 hours. A higher score indicates more depression symptoms. Total scores range from 0 (normal) to 22 (severe).
To better estimate the baseline, we did not use simply the cross-sectional assessment at baseline, but we estimated the average during the screening period as the true baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ)</title>
        <description>This validated self-rating instrument has 44 items on a scale of 1-6, measuring multiple depressive symptom domains. Each item is rated based on a subject's perception of what is normal for the individual (score = 2), what is better than normal (score = 1), and what is worse than normal (scores = 3–6). This scale is rated based on the past 24 hours. A total score is calculated by summing the 44 item scores, for a range of 0-264.
To better estimate the baseline, we did not use simply the cross-sectional assessment at baseline, but we estimated the average during the screening period as the true baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</title>
        <description>This is a 10-item, validated, self-rated measure of perceived stress, that is of the degree to which the subjects perceives things to be stressful and overwhelming. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress. This scale is rated based on the past 24 hours.
To better estimate the baseline, we did not use simply the cross-sectional assessment at baseline, but we estimated the average during the screening period as the true baseline.</description>

        <description>These are two well-validated 7-item self-rating scales that measure social health. A higher score represents higher satisfaction on each scale. The scales are rated based on the past 24 hours. Each item is rated 1-5 (1=Not at all, 2=A little bit, 3=Somewhat, 4=Quite a bit, 5=Very much). Each 7-item subscale score is the sum of each of the 7 items and ranges from 7-35.

        <title>Change in the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a low-burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior. It is a clinical interview providing a summary of both ideation and behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present. The C-SSRS will be performed to assess suicidal ideation and behavior. It contains a 5-item rating scale for suicidal ideation and a 7-item rating scale for suicidal behavior. Higher total scores indicate higher severity. Each item is coded 1=yes, 0=no, so a total score of 0 on each scale means that a no response was entered for each of the 5 suicidal ideation and for each of the 7 suicidal behavior questions, i.e., 0=lowest severity score. Total suicidal ideation score ranges from 0 (least severe) to 5 (most severe). Total suicidal behavior score ranges from 0 (least severe) to 7 (most severe).</description>

        <population>In the sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) analyses through 72 hours, placebo non-responder data is included from phase 2 and is pooled with phase 1 data. All placebo participants from phase 1 were non-responders based on HAM-D-6 reduction and MADRS criteria. 1 CERC-501 pt and 3 placebo pts are missing data on 72-hr change values.</population>
