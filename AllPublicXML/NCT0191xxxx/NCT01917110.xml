                    3. Any active anterior segment ocular disease that would contraindicate contact
                       lens wear.

                    4. giant papillary conjunctivitis of Grade 2 or worse

                    5. allergic or seasonal conjunctivitis (if the study investigator believes it
                       could significantly interfere with maintaining the specified contact lens
                       wearing schedule)

                    6. clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) abnormalities of the anterior segment,
                       lids, conjunctiva, sclera or associated structures.
