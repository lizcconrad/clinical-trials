  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a global epidemic with huge public health implications. Although clinical
      significant weight loss (WL) can be achieved by a combination of diet and behavioral
      modification, strong metabolic adaptations, with increased appetite and suppressed energy
      expenditure, are activated, which compromise WL maintenance and increase the risk of relapse.
      The aim of this project is to investigate the potential role of WL rate in modulating such
      responses. More specifically, the investigators want to determine if a similar WL achieved
      rapidly vs slowly induce the same compensatory responses to weight reduction. A secondary aim
      is to assess if speed of weight loss can influence motivation. A large battery of assessments
      will be performed before and after weight reduction including body composition, resting
      metabolic rate, substrate oxidation, exercise efficiency, fasting and postprandial release of
      several appetite-regulating hormones, subjective feelings of hunger and fullness and
      motivation. This project can bring large practical benefits concerning the design of weight
      loss programs to minimize weight relapse.

    <description>The rapid weight loss group will follow a commercial very-low calorie diet (VLCD) during 4 weeks. The participants allocated to this group will follow a 550 (women) - 660 (men) kcal/day diet. The VLCD products provide 110kcal/pack and include a variety of milkshakes, smoothies and soups. In addition to VLCD products, calorie-free drinks and some low-starch vegetables (maximum 2 cups/day) will be allowed. Drinking at least 2.5 liters of non-caloric liquids will be recommended.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The slow weight loss group will be prescribed an individualized low calorie diet (LCD) (1200-1500kcal/day), during 8 weeks, using meal replacements (such as smoothies, soups and cereal bars) and conventional foods. The macronutrient composition will be matched with that of the VLCD.</description>
