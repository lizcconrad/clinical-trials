    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate whether strength training or high intensity interval training is
      effective in improving insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular outcomes, body composition and
      reproductive outcomes in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

      Few studies have examined the effect of strength training alone on insulin sensitivity,
      reproductive outcomes and body composition in women with PCOS. Most previous studies on
      aerobic exercise in PCOS have applied moderate exercise intensity.

    <description>The subjects will attend for supervised training three sessions per week for 10 weeks (9-12). The strength training program involves dynamic contraction at intensities of 60 - 70 % of 1 repetition maximum (RM) to improve strength and muscle hypertrophy. Each session will contain 8 exercises on the major muscle groups. Each drill consists of 10-12 repetitions (reps) x 3 sets separated by one minute rest between sets.</description>

    <description>High intensity interval training (HIT) three times per week. The three weekly supervised HIT sessions will include two 4x4 min interval sessions and one 10x1 min session. The HIT consist of &quot;uphill&quot; treadmill running/walking.</description>
