    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of
      vemurafenib in Chinese participants with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or

          <description>Participants were entered into the study into one of two cohorts. Vemurafenib was administered orally as 960 mg twice daily until progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, decision by the investigator or Sponsor, or protocol/eligibility violation. The PK Cohort received treatment on Days 1 to 21 (morning dose only on Day 21), with a drug holiday from Days 22 to 27, and resumed treatment on Day 28. The Expansion Cohort received the same regimen from Day 1 onward, without a drug holiday.</description>

The AUC on Day 21 was divided by the AUC for Day 1. The resulting value was averaged among all participants and expressed as the accumulation ratio.</description>

Vemurafenib was administered orally as 960 mg twice daily until progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, decision by the investigator or Sponsor, or protocol/eligibility violation. The PK Cohort received treatment on Days 1 to 21 (morning dose only on Day 21), with a drug holiday from Days 22 to 27, and resumed treatment on Day 28. The Expansion Cohort received the same regimen from Day 1 onward, without a drug holiday.</description>
