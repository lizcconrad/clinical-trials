    <textblock>
      This is the first time finafloxacin was administered to humans intravenously. The principal
      aim of this study was to obtain safety and tolerability data when finafloxacin was
      administered intravenously as single and multiple doses to healthy subjects.

    <description>The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple intravenous (IV) doses of finafloxacin in healthy subjects.
The safety evaluation includes the descriptive display and analysis of adverse events after single and multiple doses for 7 days of intravenously administered finafloxacin.
The frequency of adverse events is evaluated for all casualties and for drug related adverse events. Comparisons between the placebo and verum groups are provided in descriptive manner.
In addition the evaluation of clinical laboratory data, vital signs, electrocardiography data, physical examination, local tolerability is provided.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic parameters of finafloxacin in plasma and urine samples from healthy subjects using non compartmental procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacokinetic parameters determined for single dose are:
AUC, Cmax, tlast, t½, CL, VZ, VSS, amount of drug excreted in urine, fraction of dose excreted in urine, renal clearance.
The pharmacokinetic parameters determined for multiple dose are:
AUC, Cmax, tmax, t½, observed accumulation ratio, predicted accumulation ratio, linearity ratio, CL, VZ, VSS, amount of drug excreted in urine, fraction of dose excreted in urine, renal clearance.
In addition, dose and body weight normalised values (norm) for AUC 0-τ, AUC0- tlast, AUC and Cmax were determined by dividing the original pharmacokinetic parameter by dose per kg body weight. Body weight normalised values [norm] for CL, VZ and CLR were calculated by dividing the original pharmacokinetic parameter by body weight.</description>
