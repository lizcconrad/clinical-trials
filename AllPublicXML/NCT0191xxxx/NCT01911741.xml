      A study to evaluate the bioavailability (BA) of a single oral dose of MDV3100 (enzalutamide)
      formulated as a solid spray dried tablet compared to oral liquid-filled capsules, and the
      safety and tolerability of oral formulations.

      Subjects are admitted to the clinic from days 1 to 5, followed by outpatient assessments up
      to Day 50. They return to the clinic for an end of study visit (ESV) 7-10 days after the last
      pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling or after early withdrawal.

             which must be a barrier method) starting at screening and continue throughout the
             study period and for 3 months after final study drug administration.

          -  Male subject must not donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study
