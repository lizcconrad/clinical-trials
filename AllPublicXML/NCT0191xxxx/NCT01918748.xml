  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Approx. 80% of acute stroke patients suffer from acute hemiparesis. Stroke
      patients have not reached their full potential when they are discharged from hospital. It is
      proven that extra training opportunities lead to further improvement. To date, new training
      possibilities, such as robotic techniques for rehabilitation, virtual reality training
      systems and tele-rehabilitation are being developed to aid in the training of stroke
      patients.

      Objective: To obtain preliminary evidence on the efficacy of an individualised, intensive
      6-week technology-assisted training regime, featuring a robotics-based self-adapting arm
      training system (I-TRAVLE) in a virtual context, focussed on improvement of arm function and
      arm skill performance in chronic stroke patients with low to moderate proximal (shoulder/arm)
      muscle strength.

      Study design: single arm prospective cohort study. Study population: 16 stroke patients in
      the chronic phase after their stroke, aged &gt;=18, diagnosed with a central paresis of the arm,
      having low to moderate proximal (shoulder and arm) muscle strength.

      Intervention (if applicable): Haptic feedback of the I-TRAVLE robot either supports or
      challenges the patient to perform movements of the arm, thereby training motor control and
      co-ordination of the affected arm. Also strength and endurance of arm muscle use may be
      trained. The I-TRAVLE based training will last 6 weeks. Each week participants will attend
      training sessions on 3 days, during which they will train 2x 30 minutes, interspaced by at
      least half an hour to avoid (general) fatigue and overuse.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Baseline measurements will be performed 3x prior to the
      start of the intervention, each interspaced by 1 week to assess baseline stability or any
      fluctuations in baseline values. In these chronic stroke patients spontaneous improvement is
      not expected. Also measurements will be performed at 0 weeks and at 12 weeks post training.
      Primary outcome measures: Wolf Motor Function Test, ABILHAND, and Goal Attainment Scaling.
      Secondary outcome measures are: motricity index, plate tapping task, active range of motion,
      perceived strength and fatigue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All tests and exercises are pain free, easy to perform, non-intrusive, and not high
      demanding. Subjects will have to undergo an assessment via a movement protocol as well as
      clinical outcome tests. In both cases the type of assessment does not differ from the normal
      assessment at a rehabilitation centre. The training is assisted using a robotic device called
      the Haptic Master (HM). The participant's arm is attached to the HM via a gimbal. The HM has
      a number of safety features to avoid overload on the participant's arm. Any potential risk
      for overload is minimised by a) careful build-up of the training regime; b) regular
      check-ups; and c) checking the participant's status prior to the next training session.
