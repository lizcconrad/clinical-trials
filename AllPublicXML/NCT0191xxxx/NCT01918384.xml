  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is inherited neuromuscular disorders due to mutation in the
      gene that encodes critical muscle protein called dystrophin. Currently, there is no effective
      treatment option for the disease. A pharmacological approach by promoting mRNA translation
      regardless of the presence of premature stop codons by nonsense mutation, called the
      readthrough strategy, has been developing recently for DMD with nonsense mutation. NPC-14 is
      a candidate compound for the readthrough strategy, since effective readthrough activities
      were demonstrated in nonclinical studies. This study is a phase II study designed to assess
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of NPC-14 in ambulant DMD patients with nonsense mutation
      that were confirmed by whole genome analysis. These goals will be accomplished by monitoring
      adverse events by physical examination, cardiac, pulmonary, auditory, balance, and laboratory
      tests as safety endpoints, and dystrophin expression in muscle biopsy as primary efficacy
      endpoint, muscle function (NSAA, timed test, muscle strength (QMT, MMT) , dairy activities by
      lifecorder), and biomarkers as secondary efficacy endpoints. The study is a randomized,
      double blind, placebo-controlled study in 21 DMD patients. After screening, eligible patients
      are allocated dynamically to weekly NPC-14 or a placebo (saline) in a 2:1 ratio and will
      receive study drugs for 36 weeks.
