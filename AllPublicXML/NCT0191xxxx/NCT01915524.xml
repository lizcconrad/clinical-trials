    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new RNActive derived lung cancer
      vaccine CV9202 in combination with local radiation therapy is safe, tolerable and immunogenic
      for the consolidation and maintenance treatment of stage IV non small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) after first-line chemotherapy or therapy with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase Ib study is the first clinical study with the new lung cancer vaccine CV9202. The
      vaccine is composed of 6 RNActive compounts, each encoding for a different antigen which is
      overexpressed in NSCLC compared to healthy tissue.

      In order to enhance the immunogenic effect of the cancer vaccine, the study treatment will
      include local radiation (4 x 5 Gy), which is a well-established palliative radiation regimen
      that can be safely applied to metastatic lesions in the lung, bone, and soft tissue, and is
      well tolerated.

      Patients will be enrolled into 3 strata based on histologic and molecular subtypes as
      follows:

      Stratum 1: Patients with metastatic stage IV NSCLC and non-squamous histology, without
      activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, who have achieved partial
      response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after at least 4 cycles of platinum- and
      pemetrexed-based first-line chemotherapy, and an indication for maintenance therapy with
      pemetrexed.

      Stratum 2: Patients with stage IV NSCLC and squamous cell histology, who achieved PR or SD
      after at least 4 cycles of platinum-based and non-platinum compound first-line chemotherapy.

      Stratum 3: Patients with stage IV NSCLC and non-squamous histology, harboring an activating
      EGFR mutation, who have achieved PR after up to 6 months or SD after 3 - 6 months of
      treatment with an EGFR TKI.

      In each patient, the vaccine will be administered until progression and the need to start a
      subsequent systemic second-line treatment, or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity requiring
      treatment discontinuation, whichever comes first.

    <description>Events are graded by the investigator using the NCI CTCAE Scale (version 4.0) which provides a grading scale for each AE term. Grade 3 = Severe Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling
Interim safety evaluations will be performed:
After treatment and observation of the first 6 patients until Day 43 in a given stratum.
- If &gt;= 2 out of 6 patients experience treatment-related &gt;= grade 3 AEs, enrollment in that stratum will be suspended.
After the first 6 patients (enrolled in stratum 1 or 2) have received radiation of thoracic lesions and have been monitored for toxicity until Day 57:
If &gt;= 2 out of 6 patients experience &gt;= grade 3 radiation pneumonitis, radiation of thoracic lesions will be suspended for further patients.
For strata 1 and 2, CV9202 administration and radiation of thoracic lesions will be considered safe for further evaluation if ≤ 20% of patients experience a &gt;= grade 3 radiation pneumonitis and no patients experience grade 4 radiation pneumonitis.</description>
