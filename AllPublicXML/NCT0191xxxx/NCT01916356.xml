  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess how a short, online educational video changes
      knowledge about fertility and infertility in couples attending an infertility clinic for the
      first time. Participants will complete a questionnaire testing knowledge about infertility
      and general demographic information (age, gender, previous information sources on
      infertility, etc.) will be collected. Participants will then be directed to a short video on
      infertility. One week later, participants will return to the site to complete the infertility
      test questions a second time in order to test memory retention. The focus of both the
      questionnaire and educational video will be basic reproductive biology, infertility risk
      factors, etiologies and treatments and fertility myths.
