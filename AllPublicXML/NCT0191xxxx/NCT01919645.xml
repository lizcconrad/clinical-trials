    <description>Combined Training - (strength + aerobics).
A combined training (CT)is performed, having aerobics exercises (AE)using a stationary bicycle and strength training in workout devices.
The strength training (ST) will be performed by isotonic exercises recruiting the main muscle groups. They exercises are: Chest Press, Leg Press, Vertical Traction, Leg Extension and Abdominal Crunch.</description>

    <description>The control group patients did not perform any intervention through physical exercises. They were oriented on Sleep Hygiene and were followed during the study. They were asked to come to the following visits (at weeks 8 and 16) and to 2 additional visits to get and then return the actigraph. During this period, they were followed through phone calls once a month and were asked for sleep hygiene and were reminded of their assessment dates.</description>
