  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The post discharge time is a vulnerable time for general medical in-patients, with high rates
      of adverse events that may cause unnecessary readmissions and even death. A recent study of
      415 patients discharged from the general medical wards at Groote Schuur Hospital,
      demonstrated a very high 12 month mortality of 35%. The majority of these deaths were
      classified as &quot;unexpected&quot;. The reasons for this were not further examined, but it was
      speculated, given the authors' knowledge of the public sector in Cape Town, that three
      related factors contribute significantly to this early mortality: i) a lack of continuity of
      care, with patients not necessarily accessing the primary care support treatment that they
      need or being able to access early post discharge follow-up (for example for anti-retroviral
      or anti-tuberculous care); ii) the inability of primary care to deal with the complex nature
      of the discharged patients, most whom have significant co-morbid disease; iii) A lack of
      optimisation of therapy for chronic disease after acute discharge.

      The investigators hypothesise that an integrated post-discharge transitional care package,
      which includes an early medical specialist follow-up in the first 3 months after hospital
      discharge will decrease the 6- and 12-month mortality and re-admission rate amongst general
      medical hospital admissions in Cape Town, South Africa. Our study will compare an integrated
      package, suitable to implementation if effective, with current standard discharge packages.
