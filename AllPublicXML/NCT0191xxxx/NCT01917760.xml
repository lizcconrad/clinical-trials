      The purpose of this study is to determine upon administering GABA orally to a person how it
      is absorbed, distributed, as well as the drug's pharmacological effects on the body such as
      glucose levels, serum C-peptide and/or insulin levels (referred to as
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics). We will conduct experiments in normal subjects to address
      these questions.

      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the progressive loss of pancreatic
      insulin-secreting beta-cells. This consequently leads to a lack of insulin and elevation of
      blood sugar, namely hyperglycemia, which is a major cause for the development of diabetes and
      its acute or chronic complications. The current treatment for type 1 diabetes requires a
      life-long dependency on daily insulin injections, causing inconvenience and burden to
      patients. Drug-induced hypoglycemia is also common as it presents a major challenge in
      insulin therapy. Furthermore, although insulin therapy is lifesaving, it is not a cure as it
      neither reverses the progression of the disease nor prevents the development of serious
      complications associated with this disease. New treatments are urgently needed.

      Recent studies have demonstrated that a natural chemical found in the brain,
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is also produced in large quantities by pancreatic
      beta-cells, has beta-cell regenerative and immunoregulatory effects. Importantly, GABA
      prevented and partially reversed diabetes in type 1 diabetes mouse models. It is important to
      address essential questions regarding the potential effects of GABA in diabetic patients in
      humans. Given the largely unknown mechanism of action of GABA in the pancreas, and the
      limited information on how GABA is absorbed, distributed and eliminated from the human body,
      we plan to examine these issues (referred to as pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) in normal
      subjects.

      The outcome of this study will provide useful information on the mechanism of action of GABA
      in human subjects.

      This is an open-labeled, 3-phase, self-control study. In phase 1, blood is sampled from
      volunteers who will take placebo to obtain the baseline value. In phase 2, volunteers will
      take a single oral dose of 2000 mg GABA. There are at least 7 days between the two phases. In
      phase 3, volunteers will take a repeated oral dose of 2000 mg GABA (thrice daily for seven
      days). There are at least 5-7 days between phase 3 and phase 3. In each phase, individuals
      will be observed for 24 hours to obtain the complete concentration time curve. 4 ml of blood
      will be sampled at the following time-point for predose and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,
      6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hour postdose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Volunteers in good health condition between 19 and 40 years of age (inclusive) at the
             time of signing the informed consent.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24 kg/m2 (inclusive), with weight greater than
             50 kg.

          3. Not on any medication 2 weeks before screening.

          4. No blood donation within 3 months before screening.

          5. Must sign the informed consent. Note: Blood and biochemical tests must be normal
             during the screening. However, if the participant's test-results were beyond the
             normal range, the individual can still be recruited as long as the results do not
             affect the experiment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Abnormalities of physical examination, laboratory tests, or ECG in screening, which
             may influence the results of the study.

          2. Previous or existing history of severe heart, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal, nervous
             system, mental, or metabolic abnormalities as well as other diseases which can affect

          3. History of alcoholism, smoking, or drug abuse within the past 1 year.

          4. Participation in any clinical drug study within the past 30 days.

          5. Any definite or suspected allergy or family history of allergy to GABA or any other
