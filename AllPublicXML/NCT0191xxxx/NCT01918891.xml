  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Stroke CTI study is a 3 arm randomized, controlled trial designed to assess the
      effectiveness of a nurse practitioner (NP) only and a NP and health coach (HC) community
      transitions intervention (CTI) in reducing secondary stroke risk by helping patients lower
      their systolic blood pressure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeted study participants are Black and Hispanic patients with a history of stroke and a
      current systolic blood pressure (BP) above JNC7 recommended range (&gt;=140 mmHg) who recently
      entered home care service. The NP only program will provide a 30 day intervention while the
      NP/HC team will provide 3 months of support via in-home and telephone encounters for patients
      randomized to one of these groups. In the first 30 days post-enrollment the NP will focus on
      medical case management and coordination with primary care providers and specialists, provide
      self-management coaching, and intervene if gaps in care are identified - all with a focus on
      BP reduction and preparing the patient for ongoing BP maintenance. As applicable, the HC will
      pick up the case after 30 days and follow up with the plan of care jointly established by the
      patient, NP and HC. The focus will be on ongoing self-management coaching, providing
      preparation support for physician visits, and linking patient to additional community
      resources, as needed.

    <description>Patients randomized to the NP only and the NP+HC transitional care interventions will have greater 3 and 12 month reduction in SBP than patients in Usual Home Care.</description>

    <measure>Influence on post-stroke patients' function and health-related quality of life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Both interventions will yield significant comparative improvements in function and health-related QoL; NP+HC will be more effective than NP-only.</description>

    <measure>Moderators and mediators that may affect treatment outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory aim to examine potential moderating/mediating variables which may include: moderators - race/ethnicity (i.e., Black/Hispanic differences), baseline HTN severity (Stage I vs. Stage II); mediators - 1) changes in health behaviors (i.e., diet, physical activity, weight loss, medication adherence); and 2) antihypertensive medication intensification (i.e., adding, changing dose, or changing class of medications).</description>

The HC will pick up the case after the initial 30 days and follow up with the plan of care jointly established by the patient, NP and HC. The focus will be on ongoing self-management coaching, providing preparation support for physician visits, and linking patient to additional community resources, as needed.</description>
