    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of Botulinum Toxin Type A (&quot;Botox&quot;) in treating
      Allodynic-type neuropathic pain in people with spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis.

      Neuropathic pain is pain initiated or caused by injury to or disease of the nervous system,
      and is common in spinal cord injury patients or people with multiple sclerosis.

      Allodynia is a type of neuropathic pain caused by something that normally would not cause
      pain, such as light touch, pressure from clothing, or bed sheets brushing against the skin.

      Botox has been used to treat the muscle overactivity that causes spasticity in spinal cord
      injured patients. It has been noticed to exert some analgesic(pain relieving) effect, and has
      recently been studied as a treatment for neuropathic pain.

      We want to see if Botox, injected intradermally, will relieve the symptoms of allodynic-type
      neuropathic pain.

      24 volunteers are to be enrolled, with 16 receiving active treatment, and 8 &quot;controls&quot;
      receiving placebo.

    12 SCI volunteers completed the study. As the data analysis was negative, the decision was made
    not to proceed with MS recruitment.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the self-reported average pain intensity from each morning's record in a diary. The average(self-reported) pain intensity will be measured at the screening visit, then the daily diary will be dispensed. The diary will ask for the average pain intensity of the last 24 hours using an 11-point numerical scale, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain imaginable</description>

    <description>200 units of Botulinum Toxin Type a will be administered intradermally to the allodynic area chosen for study.The allodynic area will be mapped, and the number of injections needed to cover the allodynic area without exceeding 40 injection sites will be determined.
All participants will receive a cream formulation of lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA) applied to the painful area 60 minutes before the injections to minimize any discomfort caused by the injections.</description>

    <description>Normal saline for intradermal injection will be prepared by the Investigational Pharmacy in a manner as to be indistinguishable from active drug. The allodynic area will be mapped so as to determine the number of injections needed to cover the whole allodynic area without exceeding 40 injection sites. All participants will receive a cream formulation of lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA) applied to the painful area 60 minutes before the injections to minimize any pain caused by the injections.</description>
