      Background: The cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the
      lymphatic system and can develop immediately after surgery / radiotherapy of breast cancer,
      or may appear months later. In the literature there are numerous educational recommendations
      to avoid the appearance BCRL, but there is a lack of adherence to these recommendations. With
      the increase of mobile technologies among adults, the mobile devices can be an effective
      method to meet their education.

      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of therapeutic adherence a brief educational
      intervention through a smartphone-based application in the prevention of lymphedema in women
      with mastectomies.

      Method: 100 women survivors of breast cancer will be randomized to a group that will receive
      lymphedema prevention education and an app specific for better adhesion compared to the
      control group will receive education only. They will be monitored for 28 weeks by specific
      measures of lymphedema onset, volume and perimeter arm and hand strength lymphedema
      disability questionnaire and other measures of fatigue, quality of life and mood related to
      cancer.

      Discussion: The lack of adherence to health education is the main cause of failure in
      maintaining these brief educational interventions, whether the program is beneficial, it
      could be successfully implemented in clinical practice.

    <description>Water Displacement (volume) Is performed by the water displacement method, a volumeter to reference point 16 cm proximal to the olecranon, with a Tª of 21ºC. The upper limit is 65% of the distance from the olecranon to the acromion.
Circumferential Measurement (Perimeter) The patient should be seated both arms on a table, shoulder in neutral rotation and in flexion of 45º, forearm in maximun supination, is measured at intervals of 5 cm along both arms, using elbow crease as starting point.</description>
