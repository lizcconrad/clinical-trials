  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV investigational trial is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a 2-week
      treatment of fluticasone propionate nasal spray (FPNS) vs. cetirizine on allergic nasal and
      ocular symptoms and quality of life in adult subjects with SAR. It is hypothesized that FPNS
      provides greater nasal symptom relief than cetirizine. The primary measure used to test this
      hypothesis is the change from baseline over two weeks in reflective total nasal symptom score
      (rTNSS) compared between FPNS and cetirizine. Approximately 648 subjects will be randomized
      into a 1:1:1:1 ratio of treatment allocation across approximately twenty-five to thirty-five
      sites in the US during the 2013 fall allergy season. All subjects will be outpatients. The
      total duration of study will be approximately 21 days including 7 days of screening period,
      and 14 days of treatment period.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline (CFB) in the Individual AM Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through the entire treatment period (2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The rTNSS score is the sum of the four individual symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing. Each symptom is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3; the rTNSS ranges from 0 (none) to 12 (severe). Each individual symptom was evaluated using a scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). The reflective assessment of the TNSS scores the four nasal symptoms over the previous 24 hours. The participants themselves scored nasal symptoms in an e-diary. Baseline is defined as the arithmetic average of the rTNSS recorded on the morning of randomization and on each of the six preceding days. A participant may have had as few as 4 days' worth of data contributing to the Baseline average. The 2-week symptom score was defined as the average of the values recorded on the day after randomization and the following 13 days. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Nocturnal Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (NRQLQ) Overall Score at Visit 3/Early Withdrawal.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Visit 3 (Study Day 14 +/- 2 days)/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The NRQLQ is a 16-item, validated, self-administered, disease (allergic rhinitis)-specific quality of life instrument that measures the functional problems most troublesome to participants with nocturnal allergy symptoms over a one-week interval. Each question is scored on a 7-point scale from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled). Items are grouped into four domains: sleep problems (4 items), sleep time problems (5 items), symptoms on waking in the morning (4 items), and practical problems (3 items). An overall score was calculated from the individual item scores. All items are weighted equally. A mean score is calculated across all items within each domain. The overall score is the mean across all items and ranges from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled). Higher scores reflect a lower quality of life. Change from Baseline was calculated as the 2-week average minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the AM Pre-dose Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through the entire treatment period (2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The iTNSS score is the sum of the four individual symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing. Each symptom is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3; the iTNSS ranges from 0 (none) to 12 (severe). The symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). The instantaneous assessment of the TNSS scores the four nasal symptoms at the time of the assessment, or at that &quot;instant.&quot; The participants themselves scored nasal symptoms in an e-diary once each morning prior to administering study drug. Baseline is defined as the arithmetic average of the iTNSS recorded on the morning of randomization and on each of the six preceding days. A participant may have had as few as 4 days' worth of data contributing to the Baseline average. The 2-week symptom score was defined as the average of the values recorded on the day after randomization and the following 13 days.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the AM Pre-dose Reflective Total Ocular Symptom Score (rTOSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through the entire treatment period (2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The rTOSS is an eye assessment that comprises the sum of the three symptom scores for tearing/watering, itching/burning, and eye redness. Each symptom is scored on a scale of 0 to 3: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The rTOSS ranges from 0 (none) to 9 (severe). The reflective assessment scores the participants' ocular symptoms over the preceding 24 hours. The participants themselves scored ocular symptoms in an e-diary. Baseline arithmetic is defined as the average of the rTNSS recorded on the morning of randomization and on each of the six preceding days. A participant may have had as few as 4 days' worth of data contributing to the Baseline average. The 2-week symptom score was defined as the average of the values recorded on the day after randomization and the following 13 days. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (CFB) in the Individual AM Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The rTNSS score is the sum of the four individual symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing. Each symptom is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3; the rTNSS ranges from 0 (none) to 12 (severe). Each individual symptom was evaluated using a scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). The reflective assessment of the TNSS scores the four nasal symptoms over the previous 24 hours. The participants themselves scored nasal symptoms in an e-diary. Baseline is defined as the arithmetic average of the rTNSS recorded on the morning of randomization and on each of the six preceding days. A participant may have had as few as 4 days’ worth of data contributing to the Baseline average. The 2-week symptom score was defined as the average of the values recorded on the day after randomization and the following 13 days. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Individual AM Reflective Nasal Symptom Scores for Rhinorrhea, Nasal Congestion, Nasal Itching, and Sneezing Over the Entire Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Each individual symptom was evaluated using a scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe).The reflective assessment scores the four nasal symptoms over the previous 24 hours. The participants themselves scored nasal symptoms in an e-diary. Baseline is defined as the arithmetic average of the individual AM reflective nasal symptom scores recorded on the morning of randomization and on each of the six preceding days. A participant may have had as few as 4 days’ worth of data contributing to the Baseline average. The 2-week symptom score was defined as the average of the values recorded on the day after randomization and the following 13 days. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Nocturnal Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (NRQLQ) Overall Score at Visit 3/Early Withdrawal.</title>
        <description>The NRQLQ is a 16-item, validated, self-administered, disease (allergic rhinitis)-specific quality of life instrument that measures the functional problems most troublesome to participants with nocturnal allergy symptoms over a one-week interval. Each question is scored on a 7-point scale from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled). Items are grouped into four domains: sleep problems (4 items), sleep time problems (5 items), symptoms on waking in the morning (4 items), and practical problems (3 items). An overall score was calculated from the individual item scores. All items are weighted equally. A mean score is calculated across all items within each domain. The overall score is the mean across all items and ranges from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled). Higher scores reflect a lower quality of life. Change from Baseline was calculated as the 2-week average minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the AM Pre-dose Instantaneous Total Ocular Symptom Score (iTOSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period</title>
          <description>The iTOSS is an eye assessment that comprises the sum of the three symptom scores for tearing/watering, itching/burning, and eye redness. Each symptom is scored on a scale of 0 to 3: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The iTOSS ranges from 0 (none) to 9 (severe). The instantaneous assessment scores the participants' ocular symptoms at the time of the assessment, or at that “instant.” The participants themselves scored ocular symptoms in an e-diary once each morning prior to administering study drug. Baseline is defined as the arithmetic average of the iTOSS recorded on the morning of randomization and on each of the six preceding days. A participant may have had as few as 4 days’ worth of data contributing to the Baseline average. The 2-week symptom score was defined as the average of the values recorded on the day after randomization and the following 13 days. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Combined Nasal and Ocular Reflective Total Symptom Score (rTSS = rTNSS+rTOSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The rTSS is the sum of the rTNSS and the rTOSS. The rTNSS score is the sum of the four individual symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing. Each symptom is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3; the rTNSS ranges from 0 (none) to 12 (severe). Each individual symptom was evaluated using a scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). The rTOSS assessment is comprised of the sum of the three symptom scores for tearing/watering, itching/burning, and eye redness. Each symptom is scored on a scale of 0 to 3: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; or 3, severe. The rTOSS ranges from 0 (none) to 9 (severe). The reflective assessment scores participants' symptoms over the previous 24 hours. The participants themselves scored nasal and ocular symptoms in an e-diary. Baseline is defined as the arithmetic average of the rTSS recorded on the morning of randomization and on each of the six preceding days.</description>
