      The objective of the study is to compare the results of a coordinated and interactive program
      for the treatment, monitoring and control of patients with a moderate-severe diagnosis of
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and treated with positive continuous pressure (CPAP), with the
      currently established situation.

      Methodology: Equivalence randomized comparative study . It will include patients with
      diagnosis of moderate-severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea Index &gt;=15) that should start treatment with
      (CPAP). Participating center is Hospital Santa María-Arnau de Vilanova in Lleida
      (Spain).These patients will be randomized to two monitoring groups (1: monitoring in the
      Sleep disorders unit, 2: monitoring in primary care consultations) once the OSAS diagnosis
      has been made and it was indicated that treatment with CPAP. Patients Will be carried out in
      both groups the same follow-up visits in two study arms: basal, 1 month, 3 months and 6
      months. Primary outcomes: number of hours of use per day (according to the accountant of the
      CPAP), so that use &gt;= 4h/day is defined as good adherence to the treatment. Secondary
      outcomes: daytime sleepiness, patient satisfaction, Adverse events related to CPAP treatment.
      It will be collected demographic ,clinics and anthropometric variables. At the end of
      follow-up primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between two groups.
