    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of an investigational drug
      called OTS167. OTS167 is a maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor which
      demonstrated antitumor properties in laboratory tests. It is being developed as an
      anti-cancer drug. In this first-in-human study OTS167 will be administered to patients with
      solid tumors which have not responded to treatment.

             no standard therapy is available.

          4. Patients with a malignancy that is currently not amenable to surgical intervention due
             to either medical contraindications or non-resectability of the tumor.

          5. Patients with measurable or non-measurable disease according to the response
             evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST , v1.1)

          6. Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of

          7. Patients, both male and female, who are either not of childbearing potential or who
             agree to use a medically effective method of contraception during the study and for 3
             months after the last dose of study drug.

          8. Patients with the ability to understand and give written informed consent for
             participation in this trial, including all evaluations and procedures as specified by
             this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), and
             fertile men with a WOCBP-partner not using adequate birth control.

          2. Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases not
             controlled by prior surgery or radiotherapy, or patients with symptoms suggesting CNS
             involvement for which treatment is required.

          3. Patients with any hematologic malignancy. This includes leukemia (any form), lymphoma,
             and multiple myeloma.

          4. Patients with any of the following hematologic abnormalities at baseline:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,500 per mm3

               -  Platelet count &lt; 100,000 per mm3

          5. Patients with any of the following serum chemistry abnormalities at baseline:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;= 3 × the
                  upper limit normal (ULN) for the institution (&gt;= 5 × if due to hepatic
                  involvement by tumor)

               -  Serum albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dL

               -  Creatinine &gt;= 1.5 × ULN for the institution (or a calculated creatinine clearance
                  &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)

          6. Patients with a significant cardiovascular disease or condition, including:
