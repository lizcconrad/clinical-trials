    <textblock>
      To assess efficacy and safety of omalizumab treatment during 12 months in order to reduce the
      use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in pediatric and adult patients with severe IgE-mediated
      asthma inadequately controlled with high doses of corticosteroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, open label, randomized, parallel-group study with a 12-month
      treatment period. Patients will be assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups, omalizumab plus
      budesonide/formoterol or budesonide/formoterol alone.

      The study comprises 4 phases:

      During the 4-week run-in phase adult patients will receive budesonide 800 mg and formoterol
      24 mg. If a patient complies with all inclusion and exclusion criteria and has been receiving
      the according-to-age run-in proposed doses during the last month, the patient may continue to
      the stable-steroid phase.

      During the 16-week stable-steroid phase, adult and pediatric eligible patients will be
      randomized to one of the two treatment groups.

      During the 8-week steroid-reduction phase, adult and pediatric patients will reduce 25% of
      the budesonide baseline dose every 2 weeks, depending of the asthma control, until reaching a
      100% reduction of the baseline dose. The clinical control of asthma is defined according to
      criteria (GINA 2012)

    <description>The ACQ has six questions to be answered by the patient, each with a 7 point scale (0-good control, 6-poor control), and one question where the actual pre-bronchodilator FEV1 value expressed in % of predicted FEV1 was classified to scores from 0 (&gt; 95% of predicted) to 6 (&lt; 50% of predicted). The overall score is the average of the 7 questions; a minimum overall score of 0 = good control of asthma whereas a maximum overall score of 6 = poor control of asthma. A negative change in score indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life will be measured by the standardized version of the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ[S]) score for adults and the pediatric version of the AQLQ(S) for pediatric patients (PAQLQ[S]) . The AQLQ(S) and PAQLQ(S0 contain 4 domains (activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function, and environmental stimuli), with a total of 32 items; each item is measured in a 7-point Likert scale of 1 to 7 (1 = severe impairment, 7 = no impairment). All items are weighted equally. Mean score is calculated across all items within each domain and the overall score is the mean score of the 32 items.</description>
