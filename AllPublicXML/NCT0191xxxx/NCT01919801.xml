      This study is being conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of icatibant with placebo in
      the treatment for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACE-I)-Induced Angioedema in
      Adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are the class of medications prescribed
      most frequently for the treatment of hypertension. They are also used post myocardial
      infarction as well as in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney
      disease. Approximately 35 to 40 million patients are on ACE-Is worldwide.

      Study HGT-FIR-096 is a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, two-armed,
      placebo-controlled trial. The study population will consist of 118 adult patients, 18 years
      of age or older, who present with an acute ACE-I-induced angioedema attack. The primary aim
      of the study is to demonstrate that icatibant is significantly more effective than placebo in
      resolving attacks of angioedema caused by ACE-I based on the Time to Meeting Discharge
      Criteria (TMDC). Safety and tolerability, as well as the pharmacokinetics (PK), of icatibant
      will also be evaluated. Eligible patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a
      single sub-cutaneous injection of either 30 mg icatibant or placebo.

    <measure>Time to Meeting Discharge Criteria (TMDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>TMDC was based on the investigator-assessed angioedema-associated upper airway symptom assessments. It was calculated from the time of study drug administration to the earliest time point at which the symptoms of difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing were absent and the symptoms of voice change and tongue swelling were mild or absent and all subsequent assessments continued to satisfy these conditions. These symptoms were evaluated by the investigator using a 5-point grading scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe). TMDC was analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

    <time_frame>From start of study drug administration (Day 0) up to follow-up (Day 5)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were defined as adverse events/serious adverse events that started or worsened after the study drug treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Laboratory Evaluation, Vital Signs, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Physical Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>During laboratory evaluation, serum chemistry and hematology blood tests, and urinalysis were performed. Vital signs parameters included evaluation of pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Standard 12-lead ECGs were performed and ECG recordings were read locally at the study site by a cardiologist. Physical examination was performed with examination of major body systems per routine clinical practice.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Symptom Relief (TOSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>TOSR was calculated for the individual symptoms with pre-treatment scores of 2 (moderate) or more improved by at least 1 severity grade and the individual symptoms with pretreatment scores of 0 or 1 (absent or mild) were scored again at 0 or 1 and all the subsequent assessments continued to satisfy this condition. Time-to-event data were summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Time to Meeting Discharge Criteria (TMDC) at Specified Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 6, and 8 hours post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>TMDC was based on the investigator-assessed angioedema-associated upper airway symptom assessments. It was calculated from the time of study drug administration to the earliest time point at which the symptoms of difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing were absent and the symptoms of voice change and tongue swelling were mild or absent and all subsequent assessments continued to satisfy these conditions. These symptoms were evaluated by the investigator using a 5-point grading scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe).

        <title>Time to Meeting Discharge Criteria (TMDC)</title>
        <description>TMDC was based on the investigator-assessed angioedema-associated upper airway symptom assessments. It was calculated from the time of study drug administration to the earliest time point at which the symptoms of difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing were absent and the symptoms of voice change and tongue swelling were mild or absent and all subsequent assessments continued to satisfy these conditions. These symptoms were evaluated by the investigator using a 5-point grading scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe). TMDC was analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were defined as adverse events/serious adverse events that started or worsened after the study drug treatment.</description>

It was calculated from the time of study drug administration to the earliest time point at which the symptoms of difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing were absent and the symptoms of voice change and tongue swelling were mild or absent and all subsequent assessments continued to satisfy these conditions. These symptoms were evaluated by the investigator using a 5-point grading scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe).
