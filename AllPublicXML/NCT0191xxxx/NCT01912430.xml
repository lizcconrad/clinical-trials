      New payment methods such as Accountable Care Organization (ACO's) and medical homes
      facilitate are new models for providers to deliver cost effective, quality patient outcomes.
      Integrated Care Coaching (ICC) is a healthcare delivery model combining telephonic
      interventions with an intelligent information technology platform that offered validated
      protocols and patient outcomes tracking. Health Integrated, Inc. has developed a validated
      program of Integrated Care Coaching (ICC), which was branded as &quot;VitalCare&quot;, and implemented
      with over 7,000 members of the Scott and White Health Plan in Texas, would reduce healthcare
      costs/achieve a return on investment (ROI), improve clinical outcomes, and be satisfying for
      participants.

      total of 7,411 ICC and 10,148 control patients participated. Variables were costs, return on
      investment (ROI), iterative Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)9 scores, and satisfaction.
