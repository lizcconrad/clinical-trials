      Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical study. Introduction: Physiotherapeutic
      intervention aiming to restore mobility using different techniques as stretching, hot packs,
      exercises, therapeutic ultrasound and orthotics. No scientific evidence has been found
      correlating improved joint mobility and the use of these techniques. Application techniques
      of orthoses to reshape the soft tissues have been well detailed, however, no scientific
      evidence supporting their effectiveness on proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) lag
      extension resolution using them as a single treatment has been found.

      Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study was to test the effectiveness of static and
      dynamic orthosis in patients with a PIPJ flexion retraction using them as a single treatment
      compared with traditional combined therapies.

      Method: 63 participants were included in the study. Patients who used splints were compared
      to a control group who received conventional treatment. Active and passive mobility were
      measured before the experiment and again three months after. All the patients were measured
      under the same conditions and treated by the same hand therapist. The relationship between
      contracture resolution and function was measured using the DASH Spanish Version.

    <description>The Spanish standard version of DASH instrument (Rosales et al. 2002) (www.dash.iwh.on.ca) for measuring upper extremity disability was used as a secondary outcome measurement. The questionnaire was given to the participants the day before starting the treatment and again after three months.</description>

    <description>Conventional treatment: The treatment consisted of 10 minutes of local thermotherapy (paraffin), active exercises at the PIPJ and DIPJ (Distal interphalangeal joint), 3 sets of 15 repetitions of each exercise extending and flexing of the PIPJ with metacarpophalangeal joint from 0° to 90° respectively. Distal interphalangeal joint exercises were conducted with identical repetitions. The metacarpophalangeal joint and PIPJ exercises took place at 0 ° and involved stretching (5 sets of 3 reps, holding for 10 seconds) and Therapeutic U.S (0.8 w/cm2 / 7 minutes).</description>

    <description>dynamic extension contracture orthotic. A mobilizing force of 250 - 300 gm/cm2 was set in each one. Patients were instructed to wear it for at least 6 hours per day and then removed it for ADL (Activity Daily Living). A static orthosis was constructed using orfitcast material to the maximum, pain-free length allowed by the tissues at night. Static and dynamic orthoses were checked once a week and adjusted as necessary.</description>
