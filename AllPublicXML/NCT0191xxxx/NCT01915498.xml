    <textblock>
      Study AG221-C-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, PK/PD,
      and clinical activity evaluation of orally administered AG-221 in subjects with advanced
      hematologic malignancies that harbor an IDH2 mutation. The study includes a dose escalation
      phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) and an expansion phase to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical
      activity of AG-221 in select populations.

             (WHO) criteria;

               -  Disease refractory or relapsed (defined as the reappearance of &gt; 5% blasts in the
                  bone marrow).

               -  Untreated AML, greater than or equal to 60 years of age and are not candidates
                  for standard therapy due to age, performance status, and/or adverse risk factors,

          2. Diagnosis of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) according to WHO classification with
             refractory anemia with excess blasts (subtype RAEB-1 or RAEB-2), or considered
             high-risk by the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), that is
             recurrent or refractory, or the subject is intolerant to established therapy known to
             provide clinical benefit for their condition (i.e., subjects must not be candidates
             for regimens known to provide clinical benefit), according to the treating physician
             and with approval of the Medical Monitor.

             Phase 1/Part 1 Expansion:

             Arm 1: Relapsed or refractory AML and age greater than or equal to 60 years or any

             have relapsed following a BMT.

             Arm 3: Untreated AML and age greater than or equal to 60 years that decline standard

                  be based on local evaluation. (Centralized testing will be performed
                  retrospectively.)

               -  For subjects in the Phase 2 portion of the trial, central testing of IDH2
                  mutation of bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood, is required during
                  screening to confirm eligibility

          4. Subjects must be amenable to serial bone marrow sampling, peripheral blood sampling
             and urine sampling during the study.

               -  The diagnosis and evaluation of AML or MDS will be made by bone marrow aspiration
                  and/or biopsy. If an aspirate is unobtainable (i.e., a &quot;dry tap&quot;), the diagnosis
                  may be made from the core biopsy.

               -  Screening bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood samples are required of all
                  subjects. A bone marrow biopsy must be collected if adequate aspirate is not
                  attainable unless:

                    -  A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was performed as part of the standard of

                       study treatment has been sent for cytogenetic analysis.

          5. Subjects must be able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent. A legally
             authorized representative may consent on behalf of a subject who is otherwise unable
             to provide informed consent, if acceptable to and approved by the site and/or sites
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).

          6. Subjects must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status (PS)
             of 0 to 2.

          7. Platelet count ≥20,000/μL (transfusions to achieve this level are allowed). Subjects
             with a baseline platelet count of &lt;20,000/μL due to underlying malignancy are eligible
             with Medical Monitor approval.

          8. Subjects must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by:

               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due
                  to Gilbert's disease, a gene mutation in UGT1A1, or leukemic organ involvement,
                  following approval by the Medical Monitor;

                  phosphatase (ALP) ≤3.0 × ULN (Upper limit of normal), unless considered due to
                  leukemic organ involvement.

          9. Subjects must have adequate renal function as evidenced by:

             • Serum creatinine ≤2.0 × ULN OR

             • Creatinine clearance greater than 40 mL/min based on the Cockroft-Gault glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR) estimation: (140 - Age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female)/72 x
             serum creatinine

             surgery, radiotherapy, or other therapy intended for the treatment of cancer.
             (Subjects with residual Grade 1 toxicity, for example Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy or
             residual alopecia, are allowed with approval of the Medical Monitor.)

         11. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to undergo medically supervised
             pregnancy test prior to starting study drug. The first pregnancy test will be

             on the day of the first study drug administration and confirmed negative prior to
             dosing and Day 1 before dosing all subsequent cycles.

         12. Female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test

             oophorectomy or tubal occlusion or who have not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e.,
             who have not menstruated at all) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had
             menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Females of reproductive
             potential as well as fertile men and their partners who are female of reproductive
