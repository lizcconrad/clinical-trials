    <textblock>
      Study AG221-C-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, PK/PD,
      and clinical activity evaluation of orally administered AG-221 in subjects with advanced
      hematologic malignancies that harbor an IDH2 mutation. The study includes a dose escalation
      phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) and an expansion phase to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical
      activity of AG-221 in select populations.

             and with approval of the Medical Monitor.

             Phase 1/Part 1 Expansion:

             Arm 1: Relapsed or refractory AML and age greater than or equal to 60 years or any

                  be based on local evaluation. (Centralized testing will be performed
                  retrospectively.)

               -  For subjects in the Phase 2 portion of the trial, central testing of IDH2

                       study treatment has been sent for cytogenetic analysis.

          5. Subjects must be able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent. A legally
             authorized representative may consent on behalf of a subject who is otherwise unable
             to provide informed consent, if acceptable to and approved by the site and/or sites
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).

          6. Subjects must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status (PS)
             of 0 to 2.

          7. Platelet count ‚â•20,000/ŒºL (transfusions to achieve this level are allowed). Subjects
             with a baseline platelet count of &lt;20,000/ŒºL due to underlying malignancy are eligible
             with Medical Monitor approval.

          9. Subjects must have adequate renal function as evidenced by:

             ‚Ä¢ Serum creatinine ‚â§2.0 √ó ULN OR
