  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the intervention using a more rigorous randomized
      controlled trial design in order to demonstrate its efficacy compared to a wait-list control,
      thus ensuring that change in behavior does not occur due to the passage of time alone. Using
      this design will also allow us to improve upon our prior clinical research by facilitating
      obtainment of post-treatment and follow-up data (as families in the clinical-only service
      stop attending treatment when behavior improves, and have often not followed-up for booster
      sessions or measure completion).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will employ a randomized controlled clinical trial design comparing symptoms
      of children who complete the Brief Behavioral Intervention to a wait-list control. Children
      in the wait-list control will be waitlisted for four months prior to initiation of treatment,
      which is a typical wait for clinical care. Treatment will then be offered to the children on
      the wait-list.

      All parts of the intervention and all measures of behavior and family functioning are part of
      standard clinical care. The parts of this protocol that are not standard clinical care are
      the following: 1. Randomization process with half of the patients on a waitlist for four
      months. Randomization will be block randomization stratified by gender. 2. Booster sessions
      for problem solving at three months and six months after last treatment session. In standard
      clinical care this occurs only if the patient calls and requests. 3. Collection of behavior
      and family functioning measures at three months and six months after the active treatment
      component.

    <measure>Parent Behavioral Assessment System for Children- 2nd Edition (BASC2) Externalizing Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the parent BASC2 Externalizing score at 3 months post-treatment. The mean score in the control group at 3 months is expected to be about 70 points with a standard deviation of 10 based on previous research. Assuming a 10 unit difference in scores is clinically significant (effect size = 1.0), 17 patients per group will be required to detect a statistically significant difference between groups with 80% power assuming an alpha = 0.05 level of significance.</description>

    <description>The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) and Sutter-Eyberg Student Behavior Inventory-Revised (SESBI-R) will be used to assess oppositional-defiant and conduct problem behaviors, yielding Problem and Intensity scales. The ECBI and SESBI-R were standardized on a large (N=798) sample of children between the ages of 2 and 16 from ethnically diverse backgrounds and exhibit good model fit across ethnic/racial groups. These scales have high internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, good model fit across racial/ethnic groups, enable prediction of membership in referred groups of children, and have good concurrent validity.
The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales IV (FACES-IV) will be used to assess family cohesion and flexibility and has internal reliability and validity over .80 for all scales. The Parenting Stress Index - Short Form will be used to measure stress related to the child's behavior and mood and related to factors specific to the parent.</description>
