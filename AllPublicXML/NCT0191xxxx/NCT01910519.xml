    <textblock>
      This study will compare the different immune responses to Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Monovalent
      Vaccine with and without the AS03 adjuvant. The Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Monovalent Vaccine
      with AS03 adjuvant vaccine is approved for use for adults to protect against flu caused by
      the A/H5N1 &quot;bird flu&quot; virus in Europe but none of the vaccines to be used in the study are
      approved for use in the United States. The results of this study will help researchers learn
      about better ways to vaccinate people against the H5N1 flu.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The influenza virus (a germ) causes influenza or &quot;flu.&quot; The flu is an infection of the
      breathing tubes and the lungs. In recent years, flu viruses that at first only infected birds
      have begun to infect humans. One of these strains is called avian influenza (A/H5N1 subtype)
      or &quot;bird flu&quot;. Although no human cases of bird flu have been diagnosed in the United States,
      this strain has caused severe illness and death in several hundred people since late 2003. .

      Vaccination is the most effective way of controlling flu and preventing its illness and
      complications. Vaccines help prevent illness by causing the body to make antibodies that
      fight infection. One way to improve the effectiveness of a vaccine is to include a substance
      that can stimulate the immune system to make more antibodies. This type of substance is
      called an adjuvant; one type of adjuvant is called AS03 (Adjuvant System 03).
