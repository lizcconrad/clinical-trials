      The mian purpose of this study is to analysis the imaging changes in 3.0T MRI of lumbar small
      joints, intervertebral discs, ligaments and muscle in hospital nurses first suffered with low
      back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common clinical disease seriously affects the quality of people's lives.
      And this disease takes up a large proportion in the crowd. Incipient lumbago is hard to
      diagnose and often hidden morbidity. If early symptoms are ignored by patients, it will
      greatly influence the quality of life in the future. This study will use 3.0T MRI to
      distinguish the difference of lumbar small joints, intervertebral discs, ligaments and muscle
      between the normal and the pain.

      Firstly, we recruit nurses with low back pain in one group, with the normal as control. Then
      the subject will accept 3.0T MRI scanning at the same time. Before scanning we will determine
      the MRI sequence to make sure the imageis are clear enough. At last, we will analysis the
      photos in the image processing workstation, reconstruct the anatomical structure in the
      scanning area. All of this is to find a possible reason or explanation in the occurrence of
      incipient lumbago through the comparison of two group`s images.
