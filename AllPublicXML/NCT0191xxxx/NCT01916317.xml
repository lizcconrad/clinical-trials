      Voltage Gated Sodium Channels Over the years, there is more evidence that ionic channels are
      involved in the oncogenic process. Among these, voltage gated sodium channels (VGSC)
      expressed in non-nervous or non-muscular organs are often associated with the metastatic
      behavior of different cancers.

      Expression of VGSCs has been reported both in vitro and/or in vivo in a range of human
      carcinomas, including breast cancer Ion channels are major signaling molecules expressed in a
      wide variety of tissues. They are involved in determining a variety of cellular functions
      like proliferation, solute transport, volume control, enzyme activity, secretion, invasion,
      gene-expression, excitation-contraction coupling, and intercellular communication.4 VGSC
      activity contributes to much cellular behavior integral to metastasis, including cellular
      process extension, lateral motility and galvanotaxis, transverse invasion, and secretory
      membrane activity.

      A correlation between Na transport and oncogenesis has been widely reported in literature. In
      1980, transformed mouse mammary cells were shown to have 3-fold higher intra-cellular sodium
      content than untransformed cells.5 Additionally evidence suggest that increasing the inward
      sodium current through voltage gated sodium channels increased the invasive capacity of
      breast cancer.6 Also, growth and proliferation of mammary adenocarcinoma cells can be
      inhibited by Amiloride suggesting that epithelial Na channels (ENaC) activity is correlated
      with proliferation of breast cancer cells

      Current evidence suggests that VGSC activity is necessary and sufficient for cancer cell
      invasiveness8. A recent in vitro study has shown that the human MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell
      line expressed functional VGSCs9. However, the molecular nature of the VGSC and its
      functional relevance to breast cancer in vivo are currently under study.

      Surgical operations for cancer have been reported to induce dissemination of cancer cells
      into surrounding tissues or into the circulation10,11and infiltration anesthetics can inhibit
      immune response12-14. Although the mechanism remains to be elucidated, infiltration
      anesthetics such as lidocaine have membrane- stabilizing action (Seeman, 1972) and these
      agents could have direct effects on cancer cells. Therefore, it is important to clarify the
      effects of infiltration anesthetics on behavior of the tumor cells.

      Commonly used local anesthetic agents inhibit the VGSCs and also possess a unique membrane
      stabilizing action through other unknown mechanisms. A study by Mammota et al 15 reported
      that lignocaine, effectively inhibited the invasive ability of human cancer (HT1080, HOS, and
      RPMI-7951) cells at concentrations used in surgical operations (5-20 mM). Lidocaine reduced
      the invasion ability of these cells by partly inhibiting the shedding of HB-EGF from the cell
      surface and modulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration contributed to this action. In
      addition, lidocaine (5-30 mM) infiltrated around the inoculation site, inhibited pulmonary
      metastases of murine osteosarcoma (LM 8) cells in vivo.

      Dose of lidocaine15:

      40 mM (1%) lidocaine is usually used for infiltration anesthesia for surgical operations.
      Lower concentrations (1-20mM) of lidocaine were sufficient to suppress the invasive ability
      of cancer cells14. One mM lidocaine inhibited the invasive ability of HT1080 cells by about
      50%, and 20 mM lidocaine inhibited the invasion ability completely. Lidocaine also inhibited
      dose-dependently the invasive ability of HOS and RPMI-7951 cells, although it was less
      effective on HOS cells. Lignocaine exerts its anesthetic action by obstructing the sodium
      channel 16 however, 10 mMof tetrodotoxin (TTX), a specific sodium channel inhibitor, had
      little effect on the invasive ability of HT1080 cells. Ten mM lidocaine-N-ethylbromide (NEB),
      which does not cross the cell membrane, also had little effect on the invasive ability of the
      cells.

      Objectives

      Primary Objective:

      • To assess the in-vivo ability of local anesthetics agents like lignocaine to decrease the
      dissemination of cancer cells during surgery and improve the disease free interval

      Secondary Objective

      • To assess the in-vivo ability of local anesthetics agents like lignocaine on impacting long
      term survival.

      Methodology / Treatment plan

      The study drug (0.5% lidocaine 60mM) will be tested in the intraoperative setting prior to
      surgery will be tested in a randomized setting.:

      Arm A: 60mM of 0.5% lignocaine will be injected peritumoral prior to excision. The local
      anesthetic should be injected on all 6 surfaces of the tumor and also within the tumor. Wait
      for 7 minutes for its action followed by surgery. (Intervention arm) Arm B: No injection of
      lignocaine prior to excision (Control arm)
