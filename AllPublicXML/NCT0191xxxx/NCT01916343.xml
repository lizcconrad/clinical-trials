  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gynecologists are currently using laparoscopy to perform many surgeries traditionally
      approached by laparotomy. The technical skills required for laparoscopic surgery are
      different than the skills required for laparotomy, causing a prolonged learning curve.
      Currently there is no standardized laparoscopy curriculum for gynecology residents. This
      study aims to develop a specific evidence-based surgical skills gynecologic curriculum that
      could be instituted in residency programs at a national and international level. The
      investigators will then validate the curriculum using Obstetrics and Gynecology residents
      through a cognitive examination, a technical skills examination, and a video recording of
      performance in the operating room.

      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators aim is to design a standardized evidence-based comprehensive
      laparoscopic curriculum that focuses on cognitive knowledge, surgical skills, and team
      training exercises. The investigators hypothesize that residents in the experimental
      curriculum-trained group will perform better than the residents in the traditional residency
      curriculum-trained group on a cognitive examination, a technical skills examination, and in
      the operating room. The operating room performance will be judged by blinded experts on a
      previously validated evaluation tool.

    <description>Technical performance score will be assessed via a previously validated tool known as the OSA-LS (Objective Structured Assessment of Laparoscopic Salpingectomy), with the score received on the OSA-LS being equivalent to their technical score. The OSA-LS is based on the OSATS9, along with a rating scale that has been modified for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The latter was developed by the primary investigator, Dr. Teodor Grantcharov, and consists of both a reduced global rating scale (GRS) made suitable for laparoscopic surgery, along with a task-specific rating scale known as the operative component rating scale (OCRS). Previously in a pilot study, ten video recorded operations were assessed in order to standardize assessments and to make adjustments to the overall scale. Residents will be video recorded performing a salpingectomy in the operating room. These recordings will be then be scored as per the OSA-LS, by a blinded observer in order to generate an overall assessment.</description>

    <description>The cognitive training component of the curriculum will consist of of self-directed reading and video-based learning. Participants will learn theoretical principals and management of post operative complications due to laparoscopic gynecologic surgery and watch videos of gynecologic procedures with an expert facilitator.</description>

    <description>Residents will perform a salpingectomy in the operating room, which will be video-recorded through the laparoscopic camera. The residents in the intervention group will then complete the salpingectomy at the conclusion of the curriculum. Following the completion of the curriculum, residents in the intervention group will undergo a multiple-choice examination as well as a repeat skills examination.</description>
