    <textblock>
      -  This is a single centre, phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
           crossover, dose escalating study of P7435 using single and multiple doses, to be
           conducted in healthy male and female (Non child bearing) subjects having BMI between 19
           to 40 kg/m2.

        -  The study will be conducted in 2 parts as follows: Part A will consist of the Single
           Ascending Dose (SAD) study and Part B will consist of the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD)
           study.

    <description>To determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of P7435 following single oral doses in these subjects (Part A)
The pharmacokinetic parameters (but not limited to) calculated in the double-blind active period (fed) versus the open-label active period (fasted) will be considered for the determination of the food effect.
The following parameters will be calculated: Cmax, tmax, tlag, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, %AUC extrapolated, AUC0-24, kel, t½ for each of the periods i.e., fasted versus fed.</description>

    <description>In Part A, there will be up to 6 cohorts of 8 subjects each (for the 2 cohorts undergoing food effect study, there will be 12 subjects in each cohort). At each dose level, every subject will participate in two periods (one with active, P7435 and the second period with matching placebo or vice versa) separated by appropriate wash-out period between the two periods. The randomization scheme will ensure that no subject undergoes the placebo period twice.
In Part B, there will be up to 3 cohorts of 10 subjects each. Each of the 3 cohorts will participate in two study periods of 10 days of dosing in each (one period with active, P7435 and the other period with matching placebo or vice versa) separated by appropriate wash-out period.</description>
