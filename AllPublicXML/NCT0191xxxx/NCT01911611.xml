  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics of RO6870868 in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive single ascending doses of either RO6870868 or placebo, with or without
      food.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive. Healthy status is
             defined by absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease following a detailed
             medical and surgical history and a complete physical examination

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential including women who have undergone hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy and postmenopausal females

          -  Male subjects must be willing to use effective contraception as defined by protocol
             for the duration of the study and for one month after the last dose of study
             medication

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) at screening of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Non-smokers, or use of &lt; 10 cigarettes (or equivalent nicotine-containing product) per
             day

          -  No medical or social conditions that would potentially interfere with the subjects
             ability to comply with the study visit schedule or the study assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactating women, and male partners of women who
             are pregnant or lactating

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last year

          -  History of immunologically mediated disease

          -  History or symptoms of any significant disease including (but not limited to)
             neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or
             renal disorder

          -  Personal or family history of congenital long QT syndrome or sudden death

          -  Evidence of an active or suspected cancer or a history of malignancy where in the
             investigator's opinion, there is a risk of recurrence. History of having received any
             systemic anti-neoplastic (including radiation) or immunomodulatory treatment
             (including systemic oral or inhaled corticosteroids) &lt;/= 6 months prior to the first
             dose of study drug or the expectation that such treatment will be needed at any time
             during the study

          -  Any confirmed significant allergic reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis) against any
             drug, or multiple drug allergies (non-active hay fever is acceptable)

          -  History of significant psychiatric disease

          -  Significant acute infection, e.g., influenza, local infection, acute gastrointestinal
             symptoms or any other clinically significant illness within two weeks of dose
             administration

          -  History of gastrointestinal disease including inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer
             disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage

          -  Inadequate hematologic, renal or liver function

          -  Positive for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection

          -  History (within 3 months of screening) of alcohol consumption exceeding 14 units per
             week on average (1 unit = 10 grams of alcohol). Alcohol consumption will be prohibited
             at least 48 hours before screening, 48 hours before admission, 48 hours after each
             dose, and 48 hours before each scheduled visit

          -  Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with,
             or for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that
             would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in
             this study

          -  Subjects who had received IFN or peginterferon within 8 weeks prior to dosing

          -  Participation in other clinical studies of a new chemical entity within 60 days prior
             to study randomization
