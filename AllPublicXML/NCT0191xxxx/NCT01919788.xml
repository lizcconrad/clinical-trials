  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus type I (DMI) is characterized by lack of endogenous insulin and these
      patients are 100% dependent on insulin substitution to survive. Diabetes mellitus type II
      (DMII) is characterized by reduced insulin sensitivity and sometimes also reduced insulin
      production, thus patients with DMII might also be dependent on insulin substitution.

      Insulin is produced in- and secreted from the pancreas when blood glucose concentration rises
      during- and after a meal. Insulin increases cellular uptake of glucose leading to lower blood
      glucose concentration. Substitution with insulin is/can be necessary in DM, but at the same
      time it induces the risk of hypoglycemia. This makes treatment with insulin a balancing act
      between hyper- and hypoglycemia.

      A hypoglycemic episode is a dreaded consequence of insulin overdosing, and also a very
      frequent reason for hospital admission in patients with DM. Examples of hypoglycemic symptoms
      may be; shaking, a sense of hunger, sweating, irritability progressing to lack of relevant
      cerebral responses and eventually coma, convulsions and possibly death. People with diabetes
      lose the ability to sense of low blood glucose with time, because of a lack of appropriate
      counter-regulatory responses, hereby increasing the risk of severe hypoglycemia.
      Understanding normal physiologic counter regulatory mechanisms during hypoglycemia is of
      major importance to patients with DM and has the potential to change medical treatment in
      diabetes, to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

      Hypothesis: Hypoglycemia counteracts insulin signaling via hormone-dependent intracellular
      counter-regulatory mechanisms, involving phosphorylation of specific signaling proteins.

      Aim: To define counter-regulatory mechanisms in muscle- and fat tissue during hypoglycemia,
      and to investigate the effect of insulin on lipid metabolism in healthy- and type I diabetic
      subjects.
