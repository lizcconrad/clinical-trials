    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of oral rehydration
      therapy for short hydration in patients with biliary tract cancer who will undergo the
      chemotherapy including gemcitabine and cisplatin.

      A large amount of fluid infusion is required to load for the prevention of renal dysfunction
      by Cisplatin in combination of GC therapy. There is a problem infusion time is take a long
      time for this. In many institutions in Japan, GC therapy is performed over 3 hours or more,
      longer than original method in the ABC-002 trial. Oral rehydration therapy is a therapy that
      performs prevention or treatment of dehydration by the ingestion of oral rehydration
      solution, which is adjusted the concentration of the electrolyte and glucose to absorb good
      efficiency from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a therapy that
      performs prevention or treatment of dehydration by the ingestion of oral rehydration
      solution, which is adjusted the concentration of the electrolyte and glucose to absorb good
      efficiency from the gastrointestinal tract. Many reports suggest ORT may substitute for
      infusion therapy. Herein, the investigators planned the study to examine the safety of
      replacing the fluid infusion by oral rehydration expecting to shorten the time to drip.

Short hydration via oral rehydration solution (OS-1)
Cisplatin plus gemcitabine will be administered via infusion as follows; 500 ml of 0.9% saline including cisplatin (25 mg per square meter of body-surface area) over 1 hour followed by 250 ml of 0.9% saline including gemcitabine over 30 minutes. Before and after the infusion, each 500ml bottle of oral rehydration solution (OS-1) will be taken respectively.</description>
