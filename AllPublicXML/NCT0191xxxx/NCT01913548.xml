  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a sufficient number of iron-overloaded
      thalassemia (THAL), Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)and Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) populations
      with similar duration of chronic transfusion, and age at start of transfusions would be
      available for a confirmatory study. The study will examine the hypothesis that a chronic
      inflammatory state in SCD leads to hepcidin- and cytokine-mediated iron withholding within
      the RES (reticuloendothelial system), lower plasma NTBI (non-transferrin bound iron) levels,
      less distribution of iron to the heart in SCD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A detailed iron burden, transfusion and chelation history will be obtained from chart review
      or from participant recall.

      Iron burden data will include: 1) documentation of liver iron, and 2) average annual ferritin
      values.

      Transfusion data will include: (1) age at onset of regular transfusions, (2) years of chronic
      transfusion therapy, and (3) pre-transfusion Hb calculated as average of all assessments for
      each year.

    <description>Patients with similar duration of chronic transfusion and age at onset of chronic transfusion therapy will be identified from 10 participating centers. Detailed information on iron burden and transfusion, medical, and chelation histories will be obtained in order to establish a cohort of patients that could be available for a future powered study of extra-hepatic iron deposition and underlying biochemical mechanisms.</description>

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        There is no gender predisposition for sickle cell disease, thalassemia major, or
        Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Sickle cell anemia most frequently affects people of African
        descent, thalassemia affects people of Mediterranian, northern African, Southeast Asia and
        Indian descent. Diamond-Blackfan anemia occurs across all racial and ethnic groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  10-20 years of transfusion (defined as 0.2-0.6mg Fe/kg/day exposure with annual
             ferritin levels greater than 2500 in at least 60% of years of chronic transfusion);

          -  0 to 9 years old at the initiation of chronic transfusions; no exchange transfusions
             in the previous 6 months

          -  iron overload documented by either liver biopsy, MRI or SQUID with estimated LIC of
             greater than 7 mg/g dry wt in the previous 6 months or ferritin level greater than
             1500mg/dl.

             claustrophobia, or other contraindications to MRI; Unable to remove ferro-magnetic
             objects from the body in regions to be imaged (e.g., jewelry or piercing)

          -  Presence of any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would make
             the patient unsuitable for enrollment;
