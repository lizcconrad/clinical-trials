  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to get individuals' feedback on advanced care planning and decision
      making.

      This study is divided into two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The purpose of Part 1 is to survey
      people to find out what is important to people with advanced cancer (again, their values,
      such as their goals, concerns and sources of support). This has never been done before in the
      way the investigators are doing it, and that is why this is called a &quot;pilot&quot; study, which is
      where a new method or treatment is being created and evaluated.

      The purpose of Part 2 is to see if combining a medical options video with a short interview
      about values helps people with how they feel about their medical situation, and what they
      know about their medical options for their medical situation.

    <description>Part 1 - This first study phase will involve interviewing 24 patients to ask for their feedback on the appropriateness of questions being developed for use in the narrative interviewing in part 2 of the study. The cognitive interview will be audio-recorded. Demographics and ECOG performance status will be recorded prior to the cognitive interview.</description>

Subjects will neither be shown the goals-of-care (GOC) video nor undergo the narrative interview process - they will be contacted as per re-assessment.</description>

    <description>As outlined ECOG performance status will be recorded at the time of registration without the subject's involvement. Quality of life, treatment satisfaction, distress and peacefulness will also be recorded at baseline. subjects will watch the goals-of-care (GOC) video (described in detail in the next paragraph) and then be given the narrative question stem vetted/assessed in part 1 including any changes made to that stem in the process of Part 1 testing. Subjects in P-COCC arm will then be contacted for a telephone interview and audio-taping of their narrative. Interviews will be semi- structured and based off the narrative stem that subjects were previously given for review. Interviews will last approximately 30-45 minutes and will be conducted by staff from the MSKCC Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to speak, read and understand English well enough to complete study assessments
             and interviews in the judgement of the consenting professional

          -  18 years of age and older

          -  Be seen regularly (at least monthly) at an MSKCC GI medical oncology clinic

          -  Has an exocrine GI cancer with MSKCC pathology confirmation at the primary or
             metastatic anatomic site

          -  Non-metastatic GI cancers are eligible only if the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) performance status54 is 2,3, or 4 at the time of consent (although patients
             with locally advanced [stage III] and inoperable pancreatic cancers are eligible
             regardless of their performance status)

          -  Has a metastatic neuroendocrine histology with MSKCC pathology confirmation as
             moderately or poorly differentiated or intermediate or high grade

          -  A referring physician's estimate of patient life expectancy must be between 1-12
             months. We use this life expectancy range in order to ensure some degree of subject
             homogeneity for the purpose of sample size and methodologic design. Also, these
             timeframes were chosen in order to test an intervention in patients with serious
             illness (under 1 year prognosis).

          -  Part 2 Only: Did not complete Part 1 of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) score of less than &quot;intact mental
             functioning&quot; (3 or more errors).

          -  Significant psychiatric or cognitive disturbance sufficient, in the consenting
             professional's or investigator's judgment, to preclude providing informed consent or
             participating in the interventions (i.e., acute psychiatric symptoms which require
             individual treatment).
