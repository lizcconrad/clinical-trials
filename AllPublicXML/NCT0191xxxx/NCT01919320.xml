      Study Purpose

      The purpose of this PAS is to confirm that patients implanted with the temporary Total
      Artificial Heart (TAH-t) and supported with the Companion 2 Driver System have outcomes
      similar to those patients implanted with the TAH-t and supported with the CSS Console. The
      data collection mechanism for this study is the INTERMACS Registry.

      Study Objectives

      Primary Objective 1:

      To confirm that patients implanted with the TAH-t and supported by the Companion 2 Driver
      System have outcomes similar to those patients implanted with the TAH-t and supported by the
      CSS Console.

      Primary Objective 2:

      To compare positive outcome rates for all TAH-t patients entered in the Intermacs Registry
      initially supported with the Companion 2 Driver System to positive outcome rates for all
      TAH-t patients initially supported by the CSS Console.

      Primary Objective 3:

      To review additional data (patient survival, adverse event rates and bridge to transplant
      rates) to support the conclusion that the use of an artificial heart is reasonable and
      necessary for the treatment of irreversible biventricular failure in Medicare/Medicaid
      patients.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the incidence of adverse events (AEs). The AEs will follow the definitions
           in the INTERMACS Registry.

      Study Hypothesis: Primary Objective 1 The primary hypothesis is that the positive outcome
      rate (defined as transplant , transfer to the Freedom Driver System support, or continuing on
      implant driver support, whichever occurs first; assessed at three and six months
      post-implant) for patients supported with the Companion 2 Driver System is non-inferior to
      the survival rate for patients supported with the Circulatory Support System (CSS) Console.

      Data Collection The data will be collected as defined in the INTERMACS Protocol and the
      patients will be followed at one week, one month, three months and six months or until their
      study endpoint is reached.

      Data Analysis

      Primary Objective 1:

      Data analysis will provide descriptive statistics on enrollment, adverse events, and outcomes
      for TAH-t patients who were implanted while supported with the Companion 2 Driver System
      compared to TAH-t patients who were implanted while supported with the CSS Console.

      Primary Objective 2:

      Data analysis will provide descriptive statistics on enrollment, adverse events, and outcomes
      for all TAH-t patients enrolled in the INTERMACS Registry.

    <description>The positive outcome rates, defined as transplant, transfer to the Freedom Driver System, or continuing on implant driver support (whichever occurs first) for patients implanted on or after June 20, 2012 and supported with the Companion 2 Driver System will be compared to the positive outcome rates at three and six months for patients implanted on or after June 20, 2012 and supported with the Circulatory Support System (CSS) Console.
The analysis will include a lower one-sided 95% confidence bound on the observed survival rate for patients supported with the Companion 2 Driver system which will be compared to the CSS Console survival rate to evaluate non-inferiority.</description>
