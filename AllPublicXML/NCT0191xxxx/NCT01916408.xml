  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate changes in inflammatory status and incidence
      of infection after extreme aerobic physical stress (participation in a marathon). In
      addition, the impact of marathon running on the hemostasis and muscular state will be
      evaluated. Changes at the inflammatory, muscular, and rheological level will be related to
      ingestion of oral hydrolytic enzymes and bioflavonoids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The influence of extreme physical stress, such as that experienced during marathon
      competition, on the inflammatory system and coagulation has been investigated. However, up
      until now, countermeasures against these adverse effects are not adequately identified.

      Immune-modulators (e.g. flavonoids) are known to be present in fruits and vegetables. There
      are also several different proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes found in fruits most of whom
      are attributed protective properties. Therefore, 160 trained and untrained runners will
      consume a mixture of different enzymes and flavonoids (Wobenzym Plus®) or PL 1 (placebo) and
      effects on changes in inflammation and hemostasiologic parameters will be investigated during
      and after extreme physical stress (participation in a marathon race). The clinical result of
      the perturbation of the immune system will be assessed by the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory
      Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) with regard to symptoms of the upper respiratory tract system.

      It is hypothesized that the intake of a product with immunomodulatory potential (Wobenzym
      Plus ®, consisting of hydrolytic enzymes and flavonoids) can positively influence both
      inflammation and blood coagulation pertubations observed after a marathon race.
