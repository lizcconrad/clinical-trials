      The investigators study the VEGF signaling in ICC cell lines／human tissues and its mechanism
      in HCC growth, proliferation and apoptosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have documented the elevated expression of VEGF and its receptors in ICC cell
      lines and tumor tissues. Another study observed that the elevation of VEGF promotes the
      growth. Clinical analyses have discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with
      tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few
      studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF signaling in ICC cells and its possible
      mechanism in regulating ICC growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal
      in ICC growth,proliferation and apoptosis.

      Cut tissue into small pieces (~2 mm2)and wash in drops of saline (1x PBS). Place pieces
      individually into LN2 in Styrofoam cup. Transfer pieces into LN2-cooled 1.5 mL cryovial. Pour
      out excess LN2 from vial, then seal and keep in LN2 until freezer storage.
