  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obtaining a sample from a lesion in the gastrointestinal tract by endoscopic ultrasound (a
      flexible tube with a camera and small ultrasound machine at its end )requires the use of a
      needle for taking the sample from the lesion or what we call &quot;Fine needle aspiration (FNA)&quot;.
      Currently, FNA is done by three commercially available needles. These needles are used
      routinely in our institution for FNA. The data regarding the safety and the successfulness of
      any of these needles are lacking. We sought to compare all three commercially available
      needles in a prospective manner.

      The following are being done only for research purposes; prior to performing the FNA, The
      patient will be randomized to one of the three commercially available FNA needles. At this
      time, all needles are considered equivalent and there is no medical necessity to pick one
      over another. The sample obtained by the needle will be assigned a quality score based on
      certain parameters of the sample such as the abundance of diagnostic cells and the presence
      of blood. We are going to collect certain information about your procedure such as the
      complications of the procedure, number of needle passes and final diagnosis.
