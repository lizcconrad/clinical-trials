  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus is common after colorectal surgery, occurring in up to 20% of patients.
      Stomas are frequently created in conjunction with major colorectal surgery. Obstruction at
      the level of the stoma is a common cause of bowel obstruction or ileus. This is often
      manifested by decrease or delay in stoma output and is often attributed to edema at the level
      of the stoma. Thus, a temporary tube (red robinson catheter) is placed into the stoma at
      bedside, which often relieves the obstruction until the edema at the level of the stoma
      resolves and stoma function occurs around the temporary tube. At this time, the tube is
      removed and the stoma continues to function normally.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a stoma tube (red-robinson catheter) placed
      at the time of stoma creation would reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus in patients
      undergoing major colorectal surgery with creation of a stoma.
