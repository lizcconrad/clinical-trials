  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a poorly understood cause of systolic heart failure and is
      the most common indication for heart transplantation worldwide. Despite advances in medical
      and device therapy, the 5-year mortality of patients with DCM remains high.

      Patients diagnosed of dilated cardiomyopathy with a NYHA functional class of II to IV and
      left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) &lt;35% were selected for randomized controlled study
      of the efficacy and safety of high dose Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor (benazepril
      or valsartan), in comparison with low dose RAS inhibitor(benazepril or valsartan) and
      standard beta-adrenergic blocker therapy (metoprolol). The primary endpoint was all cause
      death or admission for heart failure. Additional prespecified outcomes included all-cause
      death, cardiovascular death, all-cause admission, heart failure admission. Secondary
      cardiovascular outcomes included the changes from baseline to the last available observation
      after treatment in NYHA functional class, quality-of-life scores, LVEF, LVEDD, mitral
      regurgitation and wall-motion score index assessed by ECG. Adverse events were reported
      during in-hospital observation and follow-ups.

    <measure>wall-motion score index</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 and 36 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Wall motion score index (WMSI) was analyzed using an 11 segments model (3) (basal lateral, middle lateral, basal inferior, middle inferior, basal posterior interventricular septum, middle posterior interventricular septum, basal anterior free wall, middle anterior free wall, basal anterior interventricular septum, middle anterior interventricular septum and apex) with six segments each assigned to anterior and inferior regions, the apex being common. The motion of individual segments was graded as follows: normal 0, hypokinesia 1, akinesia 2, and dyskinesia 3. Global systolic wall motion score was calculated by dividing the total score by the number of segments analyzable. Results were only included when at least four segments from each of the anterior and inferior regions were analyzable. The lowest value of segment motion was chosen from the recorded motion amplitude of all 11 segments</description>

    <description>Patients in the metoprolol group were started on 11.875-23.75mg of metoprolol succinct extended-release tablet once daily (11.875mg was recommended for patients with NYHA functional classes III-IV), and then doses were doubled every 2 weeks to achieve asymptomatic bradycardia (50-60 bpm of heart rate) over 4-6 weeks. Investigators were encouraged to up-titrate metoprolol to a maximum dose of 190mg whenever possible.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to high-dose valsartan were started on valsartan 80mg twice daily, and uptitrated to target doses within 7 days under in-hospital observation. The target high doses of valsartan is determined by left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (the maximal value of anteroposterior and lateral diameters) obtained by ECG at the randomization visit. A target dose of valsartan 320mg, 480mg, 640mg daily were assigned to patients with LVEDD of 50-59, 60-69, ≥70 mm respectively.</description>

The target high doses of benazepril is determined by left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (the maximal value of anteroposterior and lateral diameters) obtained by ECG at the randomization visit. A target dose of benazepril 40mg, 60mg, 80mg daily were assigned to patients with LVEDD of 50-59, 60-69, ≥70 mm respectively.</description>
