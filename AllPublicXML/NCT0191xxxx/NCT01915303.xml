      This study is to assess whether pasireotide alone and combined with cabergoline will give
      reliefs on patients with recurrent, persistent and newly diagnosed Cushing's disease. The
      study will also assess study drug safety, the changes in Quality of Life and on clinical
      signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease.

      This study is to assess whether pasireotide alone and combined with cabergoline will give
      reliefs on patients with recurrent, persistent and newly diagnosed Cushing's disease. The
      study will also assess study drug safety, the changes in Quality of Life and on clinical
      signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease. The study consists pasireotide-untreated patients at
      screening and patients currently treated with maximal tolerated doses of pasireotide. Core
      phase will consist of pasireotide-untreated patients at screening - this includes patients
      who have never received pasireotide or patients who have received pasireotide sometime in the
      past but it was not discontinued because of safety. These patients will start pasireotide at
      0.6mg twice a day for 8 weeks. Should biochemical control not be achieved the dose will be
      increased to 0.9mg twice a day. If biochemical control is still not achieved, cabergoline at
      increasing dose will be added. Patients currently treated with maximal tolerated doses of
      pasireotide monotherapy for at least 8 weeks at 0.3mg twice a day, 0.6mg twice a day or 0.9mg
      twice a day, but still did not achieve biochemical control will add cabergoline at increasing
      dose. After 35 weeks of treatment at core phase, patients will have the option to continue
      study treatment in extension phase if pasireotide is not yet approved for commercial use
      and/or reimbursed - if country reimbursement is applicable.

If biochemical control is not achieved by the end of the 8 weeks, and the 0.6mg dose is well-tolerated, the dose will be increased to 0.9mg twice a day for another 8 weeks. If biochemical control is not achieved, cabergoline will be added and patients will begin combination treatment with cabergoline at the starting dose of 0.5mg once a day for 8 weeks. If biochemical control is still not achieved at the end of the third 8 week period, the dose of cabergoline wlil be increased to 1.0mg once a day. Patients can also immediately start the combination treatment by adding cabergoline 0.5mg once a day at study entry to their current maximal tolerated dose of pasireotide. Patients will continue with the combination treatment for 8 weeks. If biochemical control is not achieved by the end of the 8 week period, the dose of cabergoline will be increased to 1mg once a day.</description>
