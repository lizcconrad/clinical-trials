  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether high high density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol(HDL-C) level and low Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein(CETP)
      activity is atherogenic or not in subjects who received health checkups. We investigate the
      association between CETP activities and the severity of atherosclerosis assessed by
      intima-media thickness (IMT) and compare the atherogenic change between in subjects with high
      HDL-C level, low HDL-C level, high CETP activities and low CETP activities by examining the
      morbidity rate of atherogenic diseases, the rate of ischemic electrocardiography(ECG) change,
      Calc Score of artery from chest X-ray, Ankle Brachial Index/Pulse Wave Velocity and various
      serum atherogenic markers. And we also examine the correlation between normal lipid profile
      and concentration, activity and function of surface lipoprotein in subjects with variety of
      lipoprotein levels, including patients with hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia,
      hyper-HDL-cholesterolemia with low or no CETP activity, patients with high level of remnant
      cholesterol or hyperlipoproteinemia of apolipoprotein(Apo)B-48.

        We will explain about this study with the attached leaflet to the male and female examinees
        at the age of 40 and above who undergo annual health check up at Hiraga General Hospital in
        Akita Prefecture and obtain written consent to participate in the study. The written
        consents will be stored. The participant information will be made anonymous with sequential
        ID numbers. However the comparative lists of each participant and ID number will be stored
        in the locked shelf in case of disclosure requests from participants in future. The above
        will be conducted at Hiraga hospital and the samples will be sent to and measured to
        collect data in Osaka University. The analysis of data will be done at Osaka University and
        Akita University.
