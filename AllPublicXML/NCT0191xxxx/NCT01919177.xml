  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to test the hypothesis that inorganic nitrate supplementation will: (1)
      Improve exercise efficiency and performance; (2) Enhance the systemic vasodilator reserve
      during exercise and specifically, the vasodilator response in exercising muscle; (3) Reduce
      arterial wave reflections and arterial load; (4) Improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial
      function in subjects with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

      This represents a series of double-blind, controlled pilot randomized studies in which the
      effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice and nitrate-depleted beetroot juice will be assessed
      in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (n=20). A total of 20 subjects
      will be enrolled over a 1.5 year period and randomized in a cross-over design to a single
      dose of nitrate-rich beetroot juice and nitrate-depleted beetroot juice. The order of the
      interventions will be randomized; thus, all subjects will receive the nitrate-rich and
      nitrate-depleted juice, with a 4-7 day washout period in-between studies.

             upper limit of normal in the previous year.

          3. Stable medical therapy as defined by: (I) No addition or removal of ACE, ARB,
             beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for 30 days. (II) No change in
             dosage of ACE, ARBs, beta-blockers or CCBs of more than 100% for 30 days. (III) No

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Rhythm other than sinus rhythm (i.e., atrial fibrillation).

          2. Neuromuscular, orthopedic or other non-cardiac condition that prevents patient from
             exercising.

          3. Valve disease (&gt; mild aortic or mitral stenosis; &gt; moderate aortic or mitral

             grafting (CABG) within 60 days prior to consent, or requires either PTCA or CABG at
             the time of consent.

          9. Other clinically important causes of dyspnea such as morbid obesity or significant
             lung disease defined by clinical judgment or use of steroids or oxygen for lung
             disease within the past 6 months.

         10. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 110 mmHg or &gt; 180 mm Hg.

             bilirubin &gt; 2x normal).

         15. Patients with a clinically indicated stress test demonstrating significant ischemia
             within a year of enrollment which was not followed by percutaneous or surgical
             revascularization.

         18. Current use of organic nitrates or phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

         19. Pregnancy. Although beetroot juice has not knows teratogenic effects, we feel that not
             enough data exist in this regard. Therefore, all females patients of reproductive age
             will be required to undergo a pregnancy test prior to enrollment.
