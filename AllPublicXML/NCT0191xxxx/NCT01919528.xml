  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central venous catheterization (central line placement) is the common procedure performed
      in the intensive care unit. This procedure is performed by percutaneous puncture of so called
      'the central vein' and than advancement of the catheter over the guidewire (Seldinger
      technique). The tip of the catheter is left in the superior vena cava in the vicinity of the
      right atrium of the heart. Central veins are large veins in the human body passing the blood
      into the heart.

      Typical, clinical indications for the central line placement in the intensive care unit are
      hemodynamic monitoring, volume monitoring, administration of medications, long-term total
      parenteral nutrition, access for renal replacement therapy, difficult peripheral
      catheterization.

      There are two methods of the central venous catheterization in terms of visualization. First
      and older is the blind technique. The operator is locating the anatomical landmarks and then
      performing the entire procedure blindly by percutaneous puncture. This is called the landmark
      technique. Second and new is the ultrasound-guided technique. The operator is locating the
      vein using ultrasonography and then performing the entire procedure under ultrasonographic
      visualization. The real time ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization became the
      standard of care in recent years mainly because of safety issues (is regarded as safer than
      landmark technique)

      The catheterization of the axillary vein is not popular procedure in daily clinical practice.
      But it can be reasonable and safe alternative to others, typically performed central venous
      catheterizations like the internal jugular vein and the subclavian vein catheterizations.

      The main intention of this study is to assess usefulness and safety of the real time
      ultrasound guided axillary vein catheterization in mechanically ventilated patients admitted
      to the intensive care unit.
