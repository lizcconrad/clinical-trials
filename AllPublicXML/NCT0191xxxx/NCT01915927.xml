  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer
      using a biomatrix (the Gore® Bio-A®; Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of
      20 million cells. Twenty adult patients (age 18 years or older) with refractory, complicated
      perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo standard
      adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with
      continuation of pre-existing anti-Crohn's therapy. Six weeks post placement of the draining
      seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore® Bio-A® fistula plug as per
      current clinical practice. The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response
      and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used
      only for the same patient.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Males and females 18-65 years of age.

          -  Residents of the United States.

          -  Crohn's disease with single or multiple draining complex perianal fistulae (definition
             as below) for at least three months despite standard therapy (definition below).

          -  Concurrent therapies with corticosteroids, 5-ASA drugs, thiopurines, MTX, antibiotics,
             and anti-TNF therapy are permitted.

          -  All patients should have undergone a colonoscopy in last 12 months to rule out
             malignant or premalignant condition

          -  Have no contraindications to MR evaluations: e.g. pacemaker or magnetically active
             metal fragments, claustrophobia

          -  Ability to comply with protocol

          -  Competent and able to provide written informed consent

          -  Must have failed standard medical therapy including anti-TNF agents

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Clinically significant medical conditions within the six months before administration
             of MSCs: e.g. myocardial infarction, active angina, congestive heart failure or other
             conditions that would, in the opinion of the investigators, compromise the safety of
             the patient.

          -  Specific exclusions: Evidence of hepatitis B, C, or HIV

          -  History of cancer including melanoma (with the exception of localized skin cancers)

          -  Investigational drug within thirty (30) days of baseline

          -  A resident outside the United States

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  History of clinically significant auto-immunity (other than Crohn's disease) or any
             previous example of fat-directed autoimmunity

          -  Previous allergic reaction to a perianal fistula plug.

          -  If liposuction is not technically feasible

          -  Allergic to local anesthetics

          -  Pregnant patients or trying to become pregnant.
