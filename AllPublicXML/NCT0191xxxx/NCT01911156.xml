      This is a prospective randomized, open-label, phase IV clinical trial to learn the effects,
      good and/or bad, of discontinuing or continuing nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treatment for 72
      weeks in participants with chronic hepatitis B infection whose immune system is controlling
      the amount of virus levels in the blood for at least 12 months of NA therapy.

      About 66 adult men and women will participate in this study from University Health Network
      which includes the Toronto Western Hospital for about 72 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is prevalent world-wide (estimated to
      affect 360 million individuals).

      Chronic hepatitis b may result in progressive liver disease that leads to cirrhosis,
      end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic hepatitis B can also be
      benign and non-progressive, evolving into an inactive carrier state that rarely leads to
      significant liver injury or HCC. Over the last few years, several highly effective antiviral
      agents have been developed and approved for use in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
      Current therapy of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) aims at stopping progression to cirrhosis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      This is a prospective randomized, open-label, phase IV clinical trial to learn the effects,
      good and/or bad, of discontinuing or continuing NA treatment for 72 weeks in participants
      with chronic hepatitis B infection whose immune system is controlling the amount of virus
      levels in the blood for at least 12 months of NA therapy.

      About 66 adult men and women will participate in this study from University Health Network
      which includes the Toronto Western Hospital for about 72 weeks.

          -  Substance abuse (alcohol (≥80 g/day)and inhaled drugs (past 2 years)

          -  Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient
