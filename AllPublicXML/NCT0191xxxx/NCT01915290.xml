  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a substudy of the Generation-100 study (NCT01666340). Self reported physical activity
      versus objectively measured physical activity and its correlation to maximal oxygen uptake in
      an elderly Norwegian population (observational study).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data is collected using activity monitors. This data then compared to self reported physical
      activity obtained through questionnaires. Questionnaires are based on recall. Overall
      physical activity will then be correlated to maximal oxygen uptake to see whether people with
      high activity also have high maximal oxygen uptake.
