    <textblock>
      A phase II trial evaluating Cabazitaxel in patients with brain metastasis secondary to breast
      and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if cabazitaxel can induce a reduction in the size
      brain metastasis in metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer and NSCLC with brain metastasis
      who were not previously treated with whole brain irradiation or require immediate brain
      irradiation.

      Secondary:

        -  To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on the time to initiating whole brain irradiation
           or radiosurgery

        -  To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on the time to developing neurological symptoms

        -  To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on the time to disease progression in the brain

        -  To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on the time to disease progression outside the
           brain. This will be evaluated separately for the breast and NSCLC cohorts To determine
           the objective extra-cranial response (if applicable). This will be evaluated separately
           in the breast and NSCLC cohorts

        -  To determine the safety of cabazitaxel

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective trial using a 2-stage Simon design, in which eligible
      patients will receive intravenous cabazitaxel for two cycles followed by response evaluation.
      Based on the pre-specified criteria of response (intra-cranial, patient will be allowed to
      continue on study drug.

    <description>Eligible patients will receive intravenous 25mg/m2 cabazitaxel every 3 weeks. Contrast-enhanced whole brain MRI will be performed every two cycles. Patients who show ≥50% volumetric reduction in the size of the brain lesion(s) will continue on cabazitaxel until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who show evidence of disease progression and/or developed progressive neurological symptoms will be taken off study and offered whole brain irradiation. Patients who do not meet both criteria can have the choice either to continue on study drug or to be taken off study according to the investigator discretion.</description>
