      This study will be a single centre, open-label, 2-way crossover study. It will comprise of 2
      single oral doses with at least a 14-day washout between doses. Following the first dose
      subjects will be discharged from the unit for the remainder of the washout period. Subjects
      will be re-admitted to the unit on Day -1 (Period 2) and following an overnight fast they
      will be administered the second dose on Day 1 (Period 2). Subjects will be discharged from
      the unit following the 168 h PK blood draw.
