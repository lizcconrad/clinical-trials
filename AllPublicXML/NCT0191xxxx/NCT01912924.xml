    <textblock>
      A study for patients who have chronic postoperative pain who had knee replacement surgery. If
      qualified, a 14 day trial and an implantation of spinal cord stimulator for control of pain
      will be administered. This study will evaluate effectiveness of pain control. Subjects will
      be followed for one year post implantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and Female over the age of 18 who have had a total knee replacement at least nine months
      ago. Continue with unilateral knee pain equal to or greater than 4 on a 1 to 10 scale.
      Subjects will receive a trial placement of spinal cord stimulator for 5 to 10 days. if trial
      is successful subjects will proceed to permanent placement of stimulator for the treatment of
      the knee pain. subjects will then be followed post implant to assess the effectiveness of the
      stimulator for the pain.
