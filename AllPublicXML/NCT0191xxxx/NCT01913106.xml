    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a Phase I - II clinical trial to extend preclinical
      studies involving in situ HSV-tk + Valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with
      brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer. This will provide a novel therapeutic approach
      to prostate cancer and hopefully impact on the development of metastatic disease and the
      control of preexisting metastasis.

      This investigational new drug application describes a proposed phase I/II study designed to
      assess the safety and efficacy of AdV-tk gene therapy in combination with standard
      brachytherapy for patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after having failed
      radiation as a primary treatment with or without minimal metastasis. These patients do not
      have any standard treatment that has been demonstrated to have a high degree of efficacy in
      eradicating the tumor with a reasonable degree of safety. Thus, the potential risks
      associated with the use of gene therapy in this group would appear reasonable. This
      application is for use of a replication defective adenovirus vector (ADV/RSV-tk) delivering
      the HSV-tk gene as a biologic vector for gene therapy.

      Direct introduction of therapeutic genes into malignant cells in vivo may provide an
      effective treatment of solid tumors such as prostate cancer. The herpes simplex virus
      thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene codes for an enzyme which phosphorylates the nucleoside analog
      ganciclovir (GCV) into an intermediate that is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and
      terminates further replication, leading to cell death. Since normal mammalian cells do not
      possess this enzyme, cytotoxicity depends on the successful introduction and expression of
      the HSV-tk gene, phosphorylation of ganciclovir and synthesis of DNA. Non-dividing cells may
      express HSV-tk and phosphorylate ganciclovir but are not harmed since they do not synthesize
      DNA. This approach is especially suitable for the treatment of tumors where rapidly dividing
      tumor cells are adjacent to tissues made up largely of non-proliferating cells. Using human
      and animal models for prostate cancer we have demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated transfer
      of the HSV-tk gene resulted in sensitivity to ganciclovir in vitro and growth suppression of
      mouse prostate cancer in vivo.

    <description>You will be given an antibiotic (Ciproflaxin) to take twice a day beginning the day before the procedure, and continuing for a total of 3 - 5 days. You will also be given 4 pills called (Valtrex) valacyclovir to take three times a day for 14 days, beginning the day before the procedure. You will be given a pill diary in which you will record each dose of valacyclovir that you take. You will receive brachytherapy (radioactive seed placement) the day after you begin taking your pills. After the radioactive seeds are placed, while you are still in the operating room, you will receive an injection into your prostate of 1 or 2 ml (one-fifth or two-fifths of a teaspoon) of a solution of the vector carrying the gene.</description>

    <description>The investigators insert a gene from a herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is a small piece of the basic structure of the virus, into the prostate gland tumor cells. The gene is called the thymidine kinase (tk) gene, which the cell uses to make a protein that can change valacyclovir, The way the tk gene will be transported into the tumor cells is by using a vector or &quot;vehicle&quot; to carry the tk gene into the cells. In this case the vector is a virus - an adenovirus. Scientists at the Department of Cell and Gene Therapy at The Methodist Hospital removed a portion of the adenovirus' genetic material that allows it to replicate so that it cannot cause infections. In place of the removed genetic material the scientists inserted the tk gene. Now the vector can carry the tk gene into tumor cells. When the vector/gene combination gets into tumor cells, it inserts itself into the cells' command center (nucleus) and tells the tumor cells to begin making thymidine kinase protein.</description>
