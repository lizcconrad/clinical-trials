  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, blinded assessor, randomized trial is to assess opioid use
      and patient-reported outcomes of EXPAREL as a foundation in postsurgical pain therapy in
      Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) infiltration in lower abdominal surgical procedures.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to reasons unrelated to safety. However, a primary efficacy endpoint signal was seen during
    a pre-specified interim analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females &gt;18 years of age

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1-3

          -  Undergoing either lower abdominal surgery defined as Laparoscopic Hysterectomy
             (female), Laparoscopic Myomectomy (female), Laparoscopic Colectomy (male/female)

          -  Physically and mentally able to give full informed consent to participate in this
             study and complete all study assessments within the timeframes required (including
             electronic diaries should patient be discharged prior to day 4)

          -  Capable of returning the diary after POD 4 by mail (preferably) or upon follow up
             visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to amide-type local
             anesthetics.

          -  Any patient whose anatomy, or surgical procedure, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             might preclude the potential successful local administration of EXPAREL.

          -  Patients who have received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to EXPAREL
             administration, or planned administration of another investigational product or
             procedure during their participation in this study.

          -  Any chronic condition requiring use of opioids for treatment of a medical condition
             for 2 weeks or more prior to surgery.

          -  Confirmed pregnancy at time of enrollment or breast feeding (females of child-bearing
             potential).

          -  Patients that would constitute a contraindication to participation in the study, or
             cause inability to comply with the study requirements.

          -  Any patient with diagnosed or potential metastatic disease.

          -  Any condition that in the investigator's opinion might be harmed or be a poor
             candidate for participation in the study (such as patients requiring long acting
             opioids as part of the induction medications).

          -  Initiation of treatment with any of the following medications within 1 month of study
             drug administration or if the medication(s) are being given to control pain: selective
             serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
             (SNRIs), gabapentin, pregabalin (Lyrica®), or duloxetine (Cymbalta®)

          -  History of suspected or known addiction to, or abuse of, illicit drug(s), prescription
             medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years.
