  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroscopy, as a conventional examination for gastrointestinal tract disease, plays a very
      important role especially in early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of esophageal and
      gastric carcinoma. However, conventional gastroscopy is associated with several adverse
      effects (including throat discomfort, breath-holding, nausea, vomiting, laryngeal spasm and
      increased heart rate) due to which some patients are intolerant to this examination or even
      refuse the procedure due to fear of these effects. Recently, painless gastroscopy has been
      applied increasingly widely in outpatients to meet the increasing needs for comfortable
      medical care.

      Painless gastroscopy is commonly performed under general anesthesia without establishing an
      artificial airway. This is associated with an even higher anesthetic risk than general
      anesthesia in the operating room due to more basic patient monitoring and life-supporting
      equipment, only one anesthetist to perform anesthesia, fatigue in anesthesia, the requirement
      for a high turnover rate, as well as limited understanding of a patient's condition.
      Therefore, the availability of sedatives and analgesics which can provide rapid onset,
      sufficient sedation and analgesia, a short recovery time and less adverse effects are the
      premise of performing painless gastroscopy. Currently, combined intravenous anesthesia with
      fentanyl and propofol, commonly used in the clinic, is still associated with a long duration
      of action, hypotension in some patients and prolonged recovery. Etomidate has been
      increasingly utilized for in-clinic diagnosis and treatment for procedures such as painless
      coloscopy and early induced abortion due to its rapid onset, rapid metabolism and minimal
      impact on the circulatory and respiratory systems. However, no study on combined intravenous
      anesthesia with fentanyl and etomidate for painless gastroscopy had previously been reported.
      The main purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of combined intravenous
      anesthesia with fentanyl and etomidate for painless gastroscopy compared with the combination
      of fentanyl and propofol in middle aged and elderly patients, and to provide reliable
      evidence for the implementation and promotion of comfortable medical care.
