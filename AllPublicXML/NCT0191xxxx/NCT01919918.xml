    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out more about the mechanism by which neural feedback
      from the working muscle affects the development of central fatigue during exercise. Subjects
      with chronic heart failure (HF) and healthy subject counterparts will be tested to determine
      the mechanisms accounting for the premature fatigue characterizing HF patients during
      physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial part in limiting exercise and/or physical activity in humans results from the
      development of peripheral and central fatigue during physical activity. Peripheral fatigue
      comprises biochemical changes within the metabolic milieu of the working muscle leading to an
      attenuated response to neural excitation, while central fatigue comprises a failure of the
      central nervous system to drive motoneurons.

      Patients with HF have overactive group III/IV muscle afferents and an exaggerated development
      of central fatigue during physical activity that is not explained by their reduced physical
      conditioning or cardiac insufficiency caused by their failing heart. The exact mechanisms
      accounting for the exaggerated central fatigue in HF remains elusive, however, the
      development of central fatigue during exercise has recently been linked to signaling by group
      III/IV muscle afferents. This makes the heightened neural feedback in HF a likely candidate
      for these patients' increased susceptibility to central fatigue.

      Lower pH, increased lactate and increased adenosine triphosphate has been shown to activate
      group III/IV afferents in a physiological manner and thus induce, in a rested and unfatigued
      muscle, the intramuscular milieu associated with moderate to heavy exercise. The objective of
      this study is to quantitate and compare the sensitivity of group III/IV afferents and
      associated effects on central fatigue in HF patients and healthy controls when skeletal
      muscle is subject to controlled lower pH, increased lactate and increased adenosine
      triphosphate.
