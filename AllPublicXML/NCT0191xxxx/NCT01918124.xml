  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial was designed to assess the feasibility, safety, toxicity,
      recurrence and survival pattern when TP or CAP chemotherapy was combined with adjuvant
      radiation for patients with high-risk endometrial cancer.

Radiotherapy:
Pelvic radiation to 45 Gy, 1.8 Gy per day, five days per week (25 fractions) or intensive modulated pelvic radiotherapy, with brachytherapy boost to the vagina if total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done in surgery, or with paraaortic radiation if paraaortic lymphnode metastases were found after surgery.
Cisplatin:
Two courses cisplatin (50mg/m2) given on days 1 and 28 during radiotherapy.
Cisplatin and Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide： Four courses of cisplatin (50mg/m2) and doxorubicin (60mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2) given at 3 week intervals following completion of radiotherapy.
Paclitaxel and Carboplatin： Or four courses of Paclitaxel(135mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC=5) given at 3 week intervals following completion of radiotherapy.</description>
