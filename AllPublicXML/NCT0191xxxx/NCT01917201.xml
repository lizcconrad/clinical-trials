  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to assess the clinical results of implantation of different
      drug eluting stents under &quot;aggressive&quot; intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guided all the way up
      to 24 months after operation and to establish the significance of the data of an optical
      coherent tomography (OCT) for the assessment of direct results of stenting and the degrees of
      endothelization of stent after 6 months.

      The following hypothesis formed the base for this study:

        -  IVUS guided intervention allows to improve the results and increase the safety of
           implantation drug eluting stents.

        -  Suboptimal results according to IVUS data can influence the follow up results of
           treatment.

        -  Suboptimal results according to OCT data, which are not revealed by IVUS, can influence
           the follow up results of treatment.

        -  The use of strategy of stenting with the achievement of optimal results under the
           intravascular methods of visualization allows to reduce the time of application of
           antiplatelet therapy.

        -  The modern limus-eluting stents do not differ in the follow up results in investigated
           criteria.

    <textblock>
      1000 consecutive patients are planned to be included who will underwent endovascular
      treatment answering for the inclusion criteria and having given informed consent to the
      inclusion in the study.

      Criteria for choosing the size of the stent according to the IVUS:

        -  Support on the healthy parts of the vessel.

        -  The diameter of the stent should match the diameter of &quot;media-media&quot; in the distal
           reference segment or be the average between the diameter of the lumen of the proximal
           and distal reference segments.

        -  Postdilatation is sure to be in the stent: in the affected area by a large balloon over
           the initial diameter of the &quot;media-media&quot;, at the entrance of the stent - over the
           initial of the reference diameter of the lumen.

      After postdilatation a control is being performed with &quot;Virtual Histology&quot; (VH) IVUS and
      i-MAP, an optimal stent implantation is estimated.

      Criteria for optimal implantation:

        -  Complete apposition around the entire circumference.

        -  Symmetry index is more than 0.75.

        -  Stent diameter is not less than 80% of nominal.

        -  Lack of initial dissection at the edges of the stent.

        -  Lack of prolapsed tissue.

      A comparison of all the data is carried out by groups with and without using of IVUS and by
      types of the stents, as well as by groups according to intraoperative results: (a) the
      optimal result by IVUS and OCT, (b) optimal result by IVUS; suboptimal - by OCT, (c)
      suboptimal results with IVUS and OCT, as well as in subgroups of optimal (d) and suboptimal
      (e) results by OCT in patients without IVUS.

After the completion of implantation and postdilatation of stents the control IVUS (with VH or i-MAP) is being used, the optimality of stent implantation is also being assessed.If criteria of optimal implantation guided by IVUS were not achieved, additional impact is being made. In case of an additional impact the repeated control IVUS is being completed and the following results are being fixed. After control IVUS the OCT procedure is carried out.

If criteria of optimal implantation were not achieved, additional impact is being made: larger balloon, higher pressure, sufficient time of impact. In case of an additional impact the repeated control IVUS is being completed and the following results are being fixed. After control IVUS the OCT procedure is carried out. During OCT possible problems corresponding to stenting are being fixed. An additional impact based on OCT data is not being used.</description>
