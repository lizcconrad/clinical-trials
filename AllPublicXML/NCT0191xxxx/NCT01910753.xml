    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of resistance training and physical
      functioning associated with nutrition therapeutic education in head and neck cancer patients,
      during their treatment (chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy).

    <textblock>
      The loss of muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia) has been identified as a negative prognosis
      descriptor, disregarding the type of cancer. It is also a predictive descriptor for
      treatment-related toxicity. Therefore it appears crucial to save muscle mass of patients,
      following an adequate physical training together with a personalised diet program. The latter
      point is of major importance as malnutrition concerns 45% patients having head and neck
      cancer cancer, who stop physical activity due to extreme tiredness and decrease of quality of
      life. In the present project, we plan a physical activity program that would be adapted to
      each patient, accompanied by the rethought diet over a 3-month period. The adapted physical
      activity (APA) is constituted of two aerobic stages and one resistance training stage per a
      week. The evaluation will then proceed at three different moments, namely (i) at T0 i.e.,
      beginning of the program, (ii) at 3 months i.e., when the program will be stopped, and (iii)
      at 6 months i.e., three months after the program stop. This evaluation will include the
      success rate, the level of satisfaction, the physiological parameters (VO2max, muscle mass
      and strength, BMI) and quality of life.

    <description>A 3-month program for physical activity and diet education will be followed. An exercise specialist will supervise patients twice per week, during the first six weeks. They will also follow nutrition counselling and therapeutic education by a dietician once per week. During the last six weeks, they will just follow a guide for safe and appropriate exercise regimen. The dietician will call patient weekly during this final period.</description>
