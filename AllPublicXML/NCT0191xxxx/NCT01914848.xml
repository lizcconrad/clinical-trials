      Multiprofessional Advance Care Planning and shared decision making for end of live care for
      terminal patients and their relatives.

      The aim of this study is to develop, implement and test a complex intervention for improving
      patients' preparation for and participation in end of life decisions. In cooperation with
      local, national and international partners, the investigators will focus on strategies to
      enhance advance care planning and shared decision making on end of life issues, and
      documentation and transferability of end of life decisions across health care settings in
      coordinated approach involving patients, their families and care givers (in and out of
      hospital).
