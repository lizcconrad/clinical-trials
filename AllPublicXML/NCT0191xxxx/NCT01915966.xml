  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia or dry mouth is the subjective feeling that there is not enough saliva in your
      mouth. It's a frequent symptom in terminally ill patients receiving palliative care, reducing
      their quality of life and comfort. Usual recommendations in these patients are good oral
      hygiene and mouthwashes, ad libitum consumption of camomile and lemon juice infusions, and ad
      libitum sucking of cold (e.g. ice, ice cream) or citric products (e.g. pineapple). Other
      xerostomia treatments such as artificial saliva and pharmacological drugs (e.g. pilocarpine)
      are less used in terminally ill patients due to cost and secondary effects.

      The purpose of this randomized parallel clinical trial is to determine if a new recipe of
      gelatin with orange juice, cardamome and ginger is more effective in the control of
      xerostomia than the usual treatment of camomile infusion with lemon juice against. Treatments
      will be consumed ad libitum during one week. The main outcome is the subjective assessment of
      dry mouth at end of treatment.
