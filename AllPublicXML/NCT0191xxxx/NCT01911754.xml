          -  Participant has received a blood transfusion, immunoglobulins or other blood
             derivatives within 90 days prior to study entry.

          -  Participant has donated blood or plasma within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Participant has received any live vaccine within 4 weeks or inactivated vaccine within
             2 weeks prior to vaccination in this study.

             to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP
             or investigational device during the course of this study.

          -  Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator.
