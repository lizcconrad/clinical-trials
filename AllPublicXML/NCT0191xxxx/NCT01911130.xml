    <textblock>
      A new strength measurement device called Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength (ATLIS) was
      developed to precisely and conveniently measure static limb strength in patients with ALS.
      The investigators will compare ATLIS data with data from two commonly used ALS outcomes
      measures, the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and slow vital capacity (SVC) in
      a prospective, longitudinal study. All three outcomes measures will be performed on 100
      subjects collected preferably at bi-monthly clinic visits during the study period.

    <textblock>
      Four sites will participate in data collection for this study and will enroll approximately
      20-30 subjects per site. Subjects will be tested every 1 to 4 months for up to two years.
      Subjects will be tested at each visit using ATLIS, ALSFRS-R questionnaire and slow vital
      capacity testing.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Subjects 18 years or older diagnosed with clinically possible, laboratory supported
           probable, probable or clinically definite ALS according to the World Federation of
           Neurology Revised El Escorial Criteria.

        -  Capable of providing informed consent and complying with trial procedures.

      Exclusion criteria:

      - Patients, judged by the site clinical investigator to have medical conditions that may
      limit their ability to safely exert maximal force using the muscles in their arms and legs
      will be excluded from this study (e.g. unstable hypertension, significant cardiac disease,
      significant musculoskeletal disorders, or other medical conditions).

    <measure>Change in Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength (ATLIS) between each visit</measure>
    <time_frame>every 1 to 4 months for up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>ATLIS measures isometric strength in 12 muscle groups in the arms and legs. The subject is tested seated in a specially designed chairs with adjustable uprights. The subject's limb is placed in a standard position and maximal force is exerted on the wireless load cell fixed to the upright. Strength data is digitally captured and expressed as a percentage of expected normal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) between each visit</measure>
    <time_frame>every 1 to 4 months for up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of 12 questions about the subject's ability to function in certain daily activities. Questions are asked in an interview format.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) between each visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 1 to 4 months for up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>SVC measures the amount of air you can exhale following a deep breath. For this test, we will ask you to hold a mouthpiece in your mouth, breathe in deeply, and breathe out as much air as you can, up to 5 times.</description>
