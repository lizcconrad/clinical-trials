      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Suan-Zao-Ren Tang in improving sleep
      quality, anxiety, depression, and heroin craving among methadone-maintained persons with
      sleep complaints.

      Background:

      Heroin dependence is one of the major health issues worldwide. Methadone Maintenance Therapy
      (MMT) is an effective treatment for opioid dependence, but more than three quarters of
      persons receiving MMT report sleep complaints. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is one of
      the most common complementary therapies offered to insomnia patients in Taiwan. Investigators
      designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of TCM in methadone-maintained persons with sleep disturbance.

      Methods/design:

      In this study, inclusion criteria are persons receiving MMT for at least one month, more than
      20 years old, complain insomnia with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) of six or
      higher. Exclusion criteria include being pregnancy, had serious physical or mental illness,
      current use (last 30 days) of TCM, had received any antidepressant or neuroleptic medication
      and inability to read and fill out the forms for the study. The patients were separated into
      an intervention group (Suan-Zao-Ren Tang, SZRT) and a placebo group for four weeks using a
      randomized, double-blind procedure. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks
      and 8 weeks after receiving medication. PSQI was used to assess sleep quality over the past
      30 days, anxiety and depression levels measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck
      Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) were also conducted, heroin craving degree was evaluated by
      the change of the visual analog scale (VAS). Serum proteins will be detected using a
      proteomics method based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the specificity of
      proteins will confirmed by western blotting. T-test and chi-square tests are used for
      statistical analysis.

      Discussion:

      SZRT is a combination of Semen Zizyphi Spinosae (Suanzaoren), Sclerotium Poriae Cocos
      (Fuling), Radix Ligustici Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong), Rhizoma Anemarrhena (Zhimu), and Radix
      Glycyrrhizae (Gancao). It was the most commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formula used for
      the treatment of insomnia. In the classical literature and previous studies, SZRT was said to
      calm the nerves and nourish the blood to eventually bring on a tranquillizing sensation and
      improved the quality of sleep without generating significant side effects. In order to
      evaluate the efficacy of SZRT for sleep disturbance during methadone maintenance,
      investigators designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and perform the
      proteomic-system biology analysis to find the biomarker associated with sleep condition.

    <description>The primary outcome measure under study is the sleep quality. Sleep quality will be assessed using the Taiwanese version of the PSQI, which has demonstrated reliability and validity. It evaluates sleep disturbances in 7subscales: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction. Each subscale is rated on a 4-point scale (0 to 3, with 3 indicating a more profound effect), which is summed together to yield a global score (0to21).</description>

    <description>This measure lists 21 symptoms of anxiety such as feeling hot, scared or nervous. Participants will be instructed to rate how much each of these symptoms bothered them in the past week. Each item can be rated on a 4 point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Severely) yielding a maximum total score of 63 points.</description>

    <description>Depression symptoms will be measured with the BDI-II. This measure consists of 13 items to evaluate depression, and each item is rated from 0 to 3 according to the degree by which it reflects a patient's state during the previous week. The BDI has a high reliability, and concurrent validity.</description>
