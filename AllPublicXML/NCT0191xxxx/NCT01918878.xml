    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm study. The study group will be compose of
      NVAMD patients who had partial or complete failure responding to initial bevacizumab or
      ranibizumab treatment of 3-6 monthly intravitreal injections. The patients in the study
      groups will receive 5 intravitreal injections of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml at specific visits.
      Aflibercept will be provided for total period of 24 weeks.

      The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the use of aflibercept in patients in whom
      initial incomplete response or loss of initial response for other intravitreal anti- vascular
      endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy was demonstrated.

      This is a multi-center study initiated and conducted by the Israeli retina association. Each
      center participating in the study will follow the same protocol including standardized
      measurement of visual acuity, OCT, and Fluorescein angiography (FA).

      We will enroll 48 NVAMD patients which are partial or non-responded for 3-6 injections of
      intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab and no more than one year of treatment .

      Test Treatment:

      Monthly intravitreal aflibercept 2mg /0.05 ml will be given at enrolment (day 0), 4 weeks, 8
      weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks after the initial enrollment for the study group.

      Follow-up period will be 28 weeks,7 visits. At the 28 week visit the primary and secondary
      end points will be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Ophthalmic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Failure of previous intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab treatment, defined as:

               -  3-6 intravitreal injections (The last 3 injections must be no more than 6 weeks
                  between one injection to another).

               -  Maximal central thickness by Heidelberg OCT has to be at least 300 microns or
                  larger (retinal thickness including subretinal fluid {SRF},intraretinal fluid
                  {IRF} and PED).

          2. Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD as documented by fluorescein
             angiogram.

          3. Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye between 20/40 and 20/360, inclusive. The
             VA must be re-confirmed at Day 0 prior to initiation of treatment.

          4. Total area of the lesion (including blood, neovascularization, and scar/atrophy) must
             be ≤ 5 disc areas (DA), of which at least 50% must be active CNV. Active CNV is
             defined as the neovascular component of the lesion as defined by the fluorescein
             angiogram.

          5. Presence on OCT of subretinal, intraretinal or sub-retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)
             fluid and/or subretinal thickening consistent with active CNV.

          6. Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation

          7. Intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg or less.

        General Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects of either gender, aged above 50 years.

          2. Women should be post-menopausal for at least 12 months prior to trial entry, or

          4. Ability to comply with study and follow-up procedures and return for all trial visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ophthalmic Exclusion Criteria

          1. More than 50% of the total lesion size consisting of subretinal hemorrhage.

          6. Active severe intraocular inflammation (≥ trace cell or flare), significant epiretinal
             membrane or vitreomacular traction, macular hole or vitreous hemorrhage.

          7. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule. Absence of an intact posterior capsule is
             allowed if it occurred as a result of YAG laser posterior capsulotomy in association
             with prior posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.

          8. History of idiopathic or autoimmune-associated uveitis in either eye.

          9. Significant media opacities, including cataract, which might interfere with visual
             acuity, assessment of toxicity, or fundus photography in the study eye. Subjects
             should not be entered if there is likelihood that they will require cataract surgery
             in the study eye in the next 7 months.

         10. Presence of other causes of choroidal neovascularization, including pathologic myopia
             (spherical equivalent of -8 diopters or more), the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome,
             angioid streaks, choroidal rupture, and multifocal choroiditis.

         11. Any intraocular surgery or thermal laser within three (3) months of trial entry.

         12. History of any of the following conditions or procedures in the study eye:
             rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, pars plana vitrectomy, filtering surgery (e.g.
             trabeculectomy), glaucoma drainage device, corneal transplant.

         13. Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye.

        General Exclusion Criteria

        1. Any of the following underlying diseases including:

          1. Clinically significant impaired renal (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl or s/p renal
             transplant or receiving dialysis) or hepatic function.

          2. Stroke (within 3 months of trial entry).

          3. Any major surgical procedure within one month of trial entry.

        2. Any treatment with an investigational agent in the 60 days prior to trial entry for any
        condition.

        3. Known serious allergies to the fluorescein dye used in angiography (mild allergy
        amenable to treatment is allowable), to the components of the bevacizumab, or aflibercept
        formulation.
