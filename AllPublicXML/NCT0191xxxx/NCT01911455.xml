  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we want to understand the effectiveness of a drug treatment,
      acamprosate, for interfering symptoms (i.e., inattention/hyperactivity, social impairment)
      associated with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject with FXS will receive 10 weeks of blinded treatment with acamprosate or matching
      placebo. After completion of the double-blind phase, all subjects will have an opportunity to
      receive acamprosate as part of the study procedures for 16 weeks.
