    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to study the safety of REVLIMID® (lenalidomide)
      when given with YERVOY® (ipilimumab) after a stem cell transplant. Researchers also want to
      find out if lenalidomide given with ipilimumab may help to control leukemia, lymphoma, and
      multiple myeloma.

      Study Groups:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of lenalidomide
      based on when you join this study and whether any intolerable side effects were seen in
      previous participants. Two (2) dose levels of lenalidomide will be tested. The first group of
      3 participants will receive the higher dose level of lenalidomide. If intolerable side
      effects are seen in the first 3 participants, the remaining participants will receive a lower
      dose of lenalidomide.

      All participants will receive the same dose of ipilimumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Lenalidomide On Days 1-21 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, you will take lenalidomide by mouth once
      a day. You should take lenalidomide at the same time each day. You should swallow the
      lenalidomide capsules whole with water. Do not open, crush, or break the lenalidomide
      capsules. If you touch a broken lenalidomide capsule, wash the area of your body with soap
      and water.

      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, and it has been less than 12 hours since your regular
      dose time, take it as soon as you remember. If it has been more than 12 hours, just skip your
      missed dose. Do not take 2 doses at the same time. If you take too much lenalidomide, call
      your healthcare provider right away. If you vomit after any dose, do not take another dose.

      Ipilimumab:

      About 1 to 3 days after your last dose of lenalidomide in Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, you will
      receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes. About 4 weeks after each ipilimumab infusion, you
      will start taking lenalidomide as described above.

      You will be given a study drug diary. You will use this diary to write down what time you
      take each dose of lenalidomide. You need to bring the study drug diary to every study visit
      so the study staff can review it.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Visits:

      Before Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your kidney and
           liver function.

      On about Day 14 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      Before Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your adrenal
           gland, pituitary gland, kidney, liver, and thyroid function.

        -  You will have an eye exam to check for side effects, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  If you received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, you will be checked for signs of
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). You were told about GVHD at the time of being prepared
           for transplant. GVHD may cause skin rashes, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or damage
           to the liver, lung, eyes, mouth, skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and/or muscles.
           It may result in jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes).

      Pregnancy Tests:

      If you can become pregnant, you will have pregnancy counseling and testing as long as you are
      taking lenalidomide. Blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test
      at the following times:

        -  around 10-14 days before your first dose of lenalidomide.

        -  up to 24 hours before your first dose of lenalidomide during Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7.

        -  one (1) time a week for the first 4 weeks that you take lenalidomide.

        -  one (1) time every 4 weeks during the rest of treatment if you have a regular menstrual
           cycle or no cycle within 24 months, or every 2 weeks if you have an irregular menstrual
           cycle.

      If your periods are irregular, blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test 2
      weeks after your first dose of lenalidomide and again 28 days after your last dose of
      lenalidomide.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 8 cycles. You may be taken off the study
      drugs early if the disease gets worse, if you have any intolerable side effects, if you are
      unable to follow study directions, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if
      the study is stopped.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-up Visits:

      After your last dose of ipilimumab, and then about 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months later:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your adrenal
           gland, pituitary gland, kidney, and liver function.

        -  If you received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, you will be checked for signs of
           GVHD.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease, if
           your doctor thinks it is needed. To collect a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of
           the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone and bone
           marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.

        -  You will have a positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) scan and/or
           a CT scan, if your doctor thinks it is needed. A PET-CT is CT scan taken after a small
           amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein to find cancer cells in
           the body.

      If you have multiple myeloma, the following additional tests will be performed at the
      follow-up visits:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected to check the status of your
           immune system and the disease after your last dose of ipilimumab, and then about 1, 3,
           6, 12, 24, and 36 months later.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at the 1-month follow-up visit or more
           often, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease at about 12, 24, and 36
           months after your last dose of ipilimumab.

      The above tests/procedures may be performed more often, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      • If you can become pregnant, blood (up to ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test on
      the following schedule:

        -  when you stop lenalidomide therapy and then 28 days later (if you have regular or no
           menstrual cycles)

        -  when you stop lenalidomide therapy and then 14 and 28 days later (if you have irregular
           menstrual cycles)
