  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, placebo (vehicle) -controlled phase
      I study to evaluate the photoallergic potential of Clindamycin-Tretinoin Gel. The design
      consisted of the following periods: screening, induction, rest, challenge, and rechallenge
      (if indicated). Induction visit 1 was to occur within 5 days of screening visit 2. The study
      expected to enroll approximately 62 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects were to receive
      repeated 24-hour study patch applications; after patch removal, the sites were irradiated
      with ultraviolet B light (UVB) and visible light (VIS) during the induction period
      (consisting of 6 consecutive induction phases), and ultraviolet A light (UVA)/ UVB and VIS
      during the challenge and rechallenge periods. Each application site was observed
      approximately 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours later for signs of inflammation.

    <description>In cases where the patch area is larger than the irradiated area, only the irradiated areas will be scored unless reactions outside the irradiated area exhibit unusual responses. Scores represent the presence of clinically significant effects on at least 25% of the test site. Questionable, barely perceptible, or minimal reactions involving less than 25% of the test site will not be considered significant.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The capability of understanding and providing signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any
             protocol-specific procedures were performed.

          -  Male or female subjects aged from 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.

          -  The ability to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.

          -  Possessed Fitzpatrick skin type I (always burns easily; never tans), II (always burns
             easily; tans minimally), or III (burns moderately, tans gradually) that would not
             interfere with the reading of any skin responses. Determination of skin types was
             based on sunburn and tanning histories, as well as subjects' opinions of their
             responses to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure.

          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential who agreed to use a medically
             acceptable method of contraception while receiving protocol-assigned product. A woman
             of childbearing potential was defined as one who was biologically capable of becoming
             pregnant, including perimenopausal women who were less than 2 years from their last
             menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods included the following:

          -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods started at
             least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was started less than 2
             months prior to screening, then a form of non-hormonal contraception was to have been
             added until the third continuous month of hormonal contraception was completed.

          -  Two forms of non-hormonal contraception, including intrauterine devices or properly
             used barrier methods (eg, male or female condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap).
             Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal ligation or partner's vasectomy,
             were to have used a form of non-hormonal contraception. A barrier method or
             sterilization plus spermatocide were acceptable.

          -  Women who were not currently sexually active or lactating agreed to use a medically
             accepted method of contraception is she became sexually active while participating in
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently diagnosed with cancer or had a previous history of cancer, including skin
             cancer, or severe photodamaged skin. Severe photodamaged skin was characterized by
             yellow-gray color, wrinkles with no visible normal skin, and prior skin malignancies.

          -  Female subjects who were pregnant, attempting to become pregnant, or breast feeding.

          -  Used contraindicated prescription drugs within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever was
             longer, of first dose of study product, unless agreed as not clinically relevant by
             the principal investigator and the project physician.

          -  Participated in a previous study of the same study product.

          -  Current use of any medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, may have
             affected the evaluation of the study product or placed the subject at undue risk.

          -  Suffered from any disease or condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             have affected the evaluation of the study product or placed the subject at undue risk.

          -  Any major illness within 30 days before the screening examination.

          -  Considered immunocompromised or using immunosuppressant drugs.

          -  Clinically relevant history of or current evidence of abuse of alcohol or other drugs.
