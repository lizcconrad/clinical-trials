  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is now established that indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, at a dose of
      100 mg, is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of pancreatitis (inflammation of
      the pancreas) after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in high risk
      patients. However, the optimal dose required is not known. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether a dose of 200 mg, administered as rectal suppositories, is more effective
      than the standard dose of 100 mg. An ERCP procedure is a scope procedure where a lighted tube
      with a camera is passed down the patient's throat and allows for evaluation of the bile duct
      and/or pancreatic duct. The most common side effect of this procedure is post-ERCP
      pancreatitis, or swelling of the pancreas. Some patients are at higher risk for this
      complication than others. Our hypothesis is to compare the efficacy of these two dose
      regimens (100 mg vs 200 mg) of prophylactic rectally-administered indomethacin on the
      frequency and severity of post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients.

      After obtaining informed consent, subjects will undergo ERCP per clinical protocol. All
      procedure-related clinical decisions and interventions will be dictated by the performing
      physician as he or she sees fit. At the end of the procedure, it will be determined by the
      endoscopist and research coordinator whether the patient meets inclusion criteria. If
      inclusion criteria are met, subjects will be randomized by concealed allocation to receive
      either 100mg or 150mg indomethacin, in the form of two or three 50mg rectal suppositories.
      Those patients who are randomized to receive the 100mg dose will receive an additional
      glycerin suppository. Four hours later, those patients who were randomized to the high-dose
      group will then receive an additional 50mg suppository while in the recovery area. At this
      same time point, subjects who were randomized to the standard-dose group, will receive a
      glycerin suppository in the recovery area. All participating patients will receive a total of
      4 suppositories.
