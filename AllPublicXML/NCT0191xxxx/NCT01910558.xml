  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Saturated fat leading to elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is considered a
      cardiovascular risk factor. The properties associated with α- cyclodextrin, allow it to
      selectively reduce saturated fat and calories which will have a medically beneficial effect
      on LDL cholesterol and obesity. The purpose of the research is to evaluate this effect of α-
      cyclodextrin. It is hypothesized that alpha cyclodextrin supplementation will increase fecal
      fat on a high saturated fat diet compared to the same diet supplemented with a digestible
      carbohydrate control

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-cyclodextrin which functions as a soluble dietary fiber, has been shown to a form a
      stable emulsion with dietary fat in the ratio of 1:9, with a higher affinity for saturated
      fat compared to unsaturated fat. In humans, supplementation with α-cyclodextrin has been
      shown to lead to a significant weight loss regardless of whether energy intake was maintained
      or increased.The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of a 72 hour fecal fat test
      using stool markers on the last three days of each of three six-day feeding periods. Subjects
      will be served a weight maintaining diet containing 40% fat (of which 40% will be saturated),
      30% protein and 30% carbohydrate for 18 days. Subjects will also consume 1 gram alpha
      cyclodextrin with 1 gram of starch, 2 grams of alpha cyclodextrin, or 2 grams of starch in
      capsule form before breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day in each of the three six-day
      feeding periods. At this dose, alpha-cyclodextrin is recognized as safe by the FDA. All
      stools will be collected over a 72 hour period at the end of each feeding period and analyzed
      for fecal fat excretion.

    <description>Each subject will consume a different product every six consecutive days which is called a feeding period. On the fourth, fifth, and sixth day of each feeding period, a comparison of fat excretion will be measured through a stool sample. These feeding periods will occur for three consecutive six days totaling eighteen days of feeding. 6+6+6=18</description>
