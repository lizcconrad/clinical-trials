    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the predictive value of novel biomarkers and contrast-enhanced
      ultrasonography for early detection of abdominal end-organ (kidney and intestinum)
      hypoperfusion and ischemia in patients undergoing endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) for
      aortic aneurysm or dissection. In this context, patients will be monitored for renal
      biomarkers (TIMP-2, IGFBP7) and intestinal biomarkers (plasmatic intestinal fatty acid
      binding protein (i-FABP)) and local tissue perfusion will be assessed using contrast-enhanced
      ultrasonography (CEUS).

      The ultimate goal of this study is an early identification of patients developing one or both
      of these complications, which may facilitate a timely intervention to improve outcome.
