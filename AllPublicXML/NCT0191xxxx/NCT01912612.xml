  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early stage breast cancer is typically treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
      and/or endocrine therapy. Following treatment, 25-60% of breast cancer survivors have
      reported chronic pain, which can be difficult to manage. Duloxetine is a serotonin
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is FDA approved for treatment of depression, anxiety,
      fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, knee arthritis, and low back pain.

      Pilot data suggest that duloxetine is effective in management of endocrine therapy-associated
      musculoskeletal pain, and a randomized placebo controlled trial of duloxetine has
      demonstrated efficacy for treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. In this
      mechanistic study of duloxetine versus placebo, we will investigate the change in pain
      sensitivity with treatment in order to evaluate both why duloxetine is effective for
      management of pain for some patients, as well as predictors of who is likely to benefit from
      duloxetine. A total of 84 women with early stage breast cancer who have chronic pain
      following treatment, as well as 48 women who are pain free, will be enrolled. All subjects
      will undergo assessment of pain sensitivity and complete questionnaires. Subjects with pain
      will be treated with duloxetine for a total of 7 weeks, with pain sensitivity assessments
      before treatment and after 4 weeks of full-dose treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients at least 25 years of age

          2. Diagnosis of stage 0-III breast cancer within 12 years prior to enrollment. All
             indicated surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy must have been completed at
             least 12 weeks prior to enrollment. Concomitant endocrine therapy and targeted
             therapies such as pablociclib, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab are permitted.

          3. Pain that developed or worsened since breast cancer diagnosis and is not due to
             identifiable traumatic event or fracture

          4. Patient-reported worst pain score between 5 and 10 (inclusive) on a 0-10 scale
             (assessed verbally)

          5. Female patients must be at least 1 year postmenopausal or surgically sterile; or must
             agree to use a medically acceptable form of contraception

          6. Willing to withdraw from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic
             antidepressants prior to treatment initiation

          7. Patients who are currently taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or opioid
             pain medications must remain on a stable dosage throughout the duration of the study

          8. Able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.
