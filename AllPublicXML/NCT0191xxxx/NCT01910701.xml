  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed research is to implement and evaluate a follow-up study of the impact
      of the Family Spirit family strengthening program among a high-risk sample of Apache mothers
      and their children. The Family Spirit intervention is a 52-session home-visiting curriculum
      administered by American Indian paraprofessionals to young mothers from 28 weeks gestation
      through the child's first 3 years of life. In a series of pilot studies and a recently
      completed randomized controlled trial, the Family Spirit intervention has been found to
      positively impact several maternal, parenting and child outcomes up through three years
      postpartum. In the proposed study, the investigators will implement the Family Spirit
      intervention to young mothers (12-20 years at conception), with revisions to several
      assessment measures and to the curriculum such that the substance abuse prevention curriculum
      modules will be taught earlier than in the original study.

      This is a single group pre-post study designed to evaluate the impact of a home visiting
      intervention in improving parenting self-efficacy and a number of other maternal and child
      health and behavioral outcomes among a sample of young mothers, including maternal substance
      use. The Family Spirit intervention consists of 52 sessions (30-60 minutes in duration)
      delivered during a 39-month intervention phase. All sessions are designed to be taught at the
      participant's home, but they may also occur at another location chosen by the participant
      (e.g. study office, vehicle). Outcome data will be collected at Baseline and at 2 months, 6
      months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months postpartum.
