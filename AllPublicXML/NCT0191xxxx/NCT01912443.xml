          -  Unlimited line of treatment (first-line or second line is not limited)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who are not eligible for Bevacizumab treatment according to locally approved
        Bevacizumab China package insert will be excluded. The following patients are not eligible

             *

               -  The measurement of 24-hour proteinuria level is recommended for patients with
                  moderate to high proteinuria risk indicated by clinical judgement. The treatment
                  with bevacizumab should be delayed when proteinuria is ≥2g/24 hours.
