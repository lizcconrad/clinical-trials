  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label Phase Ib dose escalation part followed by a randomized
      double-blinded placebo controlled Phase II part.

      The Phase Ib part will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase II Dose
      (RP2D) of buparlisib in combination with docetaxel. Subsequently the MTD/RP2D will be
      investigated in a Phase II randomized trial in patients with advanced or metastatic squamous
      NSCLC.

      Based on an overall review of safety and preliminary efficacy data done on 01-Dec-2014
      showing marginal anti-tumor activity and newly emerged treatment options, a decision was
      taken to stop further development of this combination in patients with advanced or metastatic
      squamous NSCLC and Phase II of the study was not conducted.

             stereotactic radiosurgery).

          -  Patient has a score ≥ 12 on the PHQ-9 questionnaire.

          -  Patient selects a response of &quot;1, 2 or 3&quot; to question number 9 on the PHQ-9
             questionnaire regarding potential for suicidal thoughts or ideation (independent of
             the total score of the PHQ-9).

          -  Patient has a GAD-7 mood scale score ≥ 15.

          -  Patient has a medically documented history of or active major depressive episode,
             bipolar disorder (I or II), obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of
             suicidal attempt or ideation, or homicidal ideation or patients with active severe
             personality disorders.
