    <textblock>
      Objectives: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Students for Nutrition and
      eXercise (SNaX), a middle-school-based obesity-prevention intervention combining school-wide
      environmental changes, multimedia, encouragement to eat healthy school cafeteria foods, and
      peer-led education and marketing.

      Methods: We randomly selected schools from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)
      and assigned five to the intervention group and five to a wait-list control group. School
      records were obtained for number of fruits and vegetables served, students served lunch, and
      snacks sold per attending student. Pre- and post-intervention surveys assessed psychosocial
      variables among 2,997 seventh-graders (75% of all seventh-graders across schools).

      Hypotheses: For the RCT of SNaX, we hypothesized that SNaX would lead to increases in the
      proportion of students served in the cafeteria (because SNaX markets cafeterias' healthy
      foods); increased fruit and vegetable servings (because SNaX increases access to
      sliced/bite-sized fruits and vegetables); decreased school store snack sales; and greater
      water consumption. We also hypothesized that SNaX would lead to more positive attitudes about
      the cafeteria and water, improve obesity-prevention knowledge, and increase intentions to
      drink water.

    <measure>Attitudes about the cafeteria</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudes about the cafeteria were calculated by survey data using the mean of two 7-point scales representing attitudes about the cafeteria: unsatisfying/satisfying and bad for my health/good for my health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes about water</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intentions to drink water</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intentions to drink water were assessed with two survey items, &quot;How likely is it that you will drink water [or drink water from a refillable water bottle] the next day you are in school?&quot; with 5-point scales (extremely likely/extremely unlikely).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Water consumption frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Water consumption frequency was assessed by survey with, &quot;How often do you usually drink tap water?&quot; and &quot;How often do you usually use a refillable water bottle to drink water?&quot; (every day, a few times a week, once a week, twice a month, once a month, less than once a month, never).</description>
