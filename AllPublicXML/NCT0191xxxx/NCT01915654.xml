    <textblock>
      The purpose of the transfusion of packed red blood cell is to overcome acute or chronic
      anemia cause tissue hypoxia. It increases hemoglobin concentration and consequently increase
      oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. The perioperative period of major surgery is a field
      particularly favorable to the development of tissue hypoxia, which is associated with
      increased mortality and postoperative morbidity. Optimization of oxygen transport to tissues
      at the preoperative period is accompanied by a significant reduction of these major
      complications.

      Clinical complications (infectious or otherwise) related to transfusion of caps Red Blood
      cells Caps (RBC)are well known. Many studies seem to evidence the potentially deleterious
      effect of transfusion, especially in patients with poor condition, related to storage time.
      Indeed, during storage, impaired blood-related storage is created. It is metabolic,
      biochemical and molecular levels. Many studies, carried out in particular in cardiac surgery
      where patients are suitable for transfusion RBC, have focused on the effect of transfusions
      on consumption and the transport of oxygen to demonstrate the impact of conservation lesions
      on their role in vivo. In particular, a single-center retrospective American study showed
      reduction of postoperative complications in patients who received RBC under 14 days.

      However one of the confounding factors present is that all transfused RBCs are not
      leukoreduced (unlike the French transfusion policy). In addition, the greater part of the
      clinical studies are controversial. That is why we aim to assess, through a retrospective
      study of data, the impact of transfusion of red red blood cells within 14 days of
      post-operative morbidity and mortality, compared to the usual transfusion practice in cardiac
      surgery patients.
