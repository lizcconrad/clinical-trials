      complains, using the neuropsychological computerized assessment of WebNeuro by Brain resource
      (BRC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the study includes patients with subjective memory complains - who are concerned about having
      memory problems, that passed successfully the conventional basic cognitive assessment and who
      are not demented.

      the patients were referred to our occupational therapy clinic for cognitive group therapy.

      the aim of the study is to assess the efficiency of such therapy, using the
      neuropsychological computerized assessment of WebNeuro by Brain resource (BRC). the
      computerized assessment last 40 minutes and provide information about different cognitive
      aspects compared to a norm according to age, sex and education.

      each patient will pass the neuropsychological computerized assessment twice: at the beginning
      of the study and after participating in the cognitive group therapy.

      the cognitive group therapy is composed of eight meetings including information about memory
      processes, learning and practicing tools and strategies to improve cognition and memory.

      each individual will be his one control, we will compare the patient achievements in the
      different cognitive aspects before and after the cognitive intervention.

      our hypothesis is that the cognitive group therapy will improve the participants achievements
      in the neuropsychological computerized assessment.
