  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fixed sequence, 2-period crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of
      Palbociclib in absence and presence of prior administration of proton pump inhibitor
      Rabeprazole. The increased gastric pH achieved by the treatment with multiple doses of
      Rabeprazole might affect the absorption process of Palbociclib.

    <time_frame>0-120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
