    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of preoperative chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and
      5-fluorouracil (TPF) in locally advanced resectable oral cavity squamous cell cancer. The aim
      is to improve the rate of pathological complete response to induction chemotherapy in a
      molecular enriched population, consisting of patients with tumour harbouring a functional p53
      protein and/or showing low expression of beta-tubulin II.
