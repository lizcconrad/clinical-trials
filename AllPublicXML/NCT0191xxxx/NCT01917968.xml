  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare transvaginal mesh repair to traditional native tissue
      repair in women surgically treated for anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate clinical effectiveness of transvaginal repair with mesh
      (Uphold LITE) against traditional native tissue repair in women surgically treated for
      anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse. Secondary objectives are to evaluate Uphold
      LITE-related complications and subject reported outcomes.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve superiority of transvaginal repair with mesh
      (Uphold LITE) over native tissue repair at 36 months as compared to baseline. Success will be
      based on a composite of objective and subjective measures.

      Additionally, a co-primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non-inferiority of
      transvaginal repair with mesh (Uphold LITE) to native tissue repair for safety by comparing
      rates of serious device or serious procedure related complications between baseline and the
      36 month time point.

      The secondary endpoints of the study include assessments of complications and subject
      reported outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is female

          2. Subject is ≥18 years of age

          3. Subject has pelvic organ prolapse with the leading edge at or beyond the hymen. At or
             beyond the hymen is defined as POP-Q scores of Ba≥0 or (for prolapse of the anterior
             compartment alone) C≥0 (for prolapse of the apical compartment alone) or C≥-1/2 TVL
             and Ba≥0 (for a multi-compartment prolapse that includes the anterior and apical
             compartments).

          4. Subject reports of a bothersome bulge they can see or feel per PFDI-20, question 3
             response of 2 or higher (i.e. responses of &quot;somewhat&quot;, &quot;moderately&quot; or &quot;quite a bit&quot;)

          5. Subject or subject's legally authorized representative must be willing to provide
             written informed consent
