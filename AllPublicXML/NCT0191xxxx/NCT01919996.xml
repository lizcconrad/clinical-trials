    <textblock>
      This Post-Authorization Safety Study (PASS) is intended to fulfill a regulatory
      post-marketing requirement to provide data regarding visual abilities in children taking
      azithromycin (immediate-release formulation) for acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis. The primary
      objective of the study is to examine the incidence of clinically significant worsening in any
      of the following ophthalmic exams: best corrected visual acuity (distance), color vision,
      Amsler grid testing, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and fundus examination, in a group of
      approximately 30 pediatric patients taking azithromycin oral solution for treatment of an
      authorized indication of use (pharyngitis/ tonsillitis).

      Study was terminated prematurely on October 16, 2015 following FDA decision to release
      Sponsor from post-marketing commitment. No safety and/or efficacy concerns identified.

    <description>Clinically significant change (improvement or worsening) is based on five ophthalmic exams at baseline and the final visit. Any 1 or more of these conditions are a clinically significant change: 1) A worsening in BCVA (distance), as defined in outcome measure 1 OR an improvement in BCVA (distance) as defined in outcome measure 2. 2) A worsening in color vision (FM-100), as defined in outcome measure 1 OR an improvement in color vision (FM-100) as defined in outcome measure 2. 3) A worsening in Amsler Grid, as defined in outcome measure 1, OR an improvement in Amsler Grid, as defined in outcome measure 2. 4) A worsening in anterior segment biomicroscopy, as defined in outcome measure 1 OR an improvement in anterior segment biomicroscopy as defined in outcome measure 2. 5) A worsening in dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy, as defined in outcome measure 1 OR an improvement in dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy as defined in outcome measure 2.</description>
