  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are life-long, incurable illnesses that can have a profound
      effect on the patients quality of life. Disease education is a corner stone of IBD care to
      enable patients to take up an active role in their disease management. While patient
      education is enshrined in the IBD standards, actual patient knowledge is often poor.3
      Knowledge is not associated with the level of the patient's educational achievement, but
      member of patient organisations such as Crohn's and Colitis UK (CCUK) have significantly
      better knowledge than non-members. This may highlight the positive effects of education
      offered by CCUK, but it is also conceivable that patients with a greater interest in their
      disease are more like to join organisations like CCUK. Different sources of patient
      information may therefore influence what level of disease related knowledge a patient
      achieves.

      Apart from high quality clinical information provided by professional organisation (British
      Society of Gastroenterology, European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation), the National Health
      Service and charities (CORE, CCUK), there is also a host of unregulated information
      available. The emerging dominance of the internet for information gathering has provided easy
      access for patients to a host of websites providing information on IBD. A number of these
      provide alternative (not evidence based) views, which could have a potentially negative
      impact on patient's knowledge. Furthermore patients often share their stories on internet
      forums and it is likely that those stories share are more likely to represent the extreme
      ends of disease rather than those experienced by the majority. This could potentially cause
      anxiety in patients with IBD. The quality of information found on the internet varies widely
      and up to 50% of websites have been judged as poor. The vast majority of patients with IBD
      have access to the internet and more than half use to search for health related information.7
      We have previously also demonstrated that patients with anxiety have better disease related
      knowledge of IBD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        patients attending IBD clinics at Leeds Teaching Hospitals

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who are unable to give informed consent.

          -  Individuals who do not speak English, as the questionanire is selfadministered.

          -  Individuals under 18 years of age.

          -  Individuals who are attending Gastroenterology clinics at Leeds General Infirmary and
             St. James's University Hospital because of a flare up of disease activity of their
             ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.

          -  Individuals with Crohn's disease who have a stoma (ileostomy), due to practical
             difficulties in assessing clinical activity in this patient group (it is not actually
             possible to calculate the HarveyBradshaw index in patients with an ileostomy).

          -  Individuals who, in the opinion of the investigator, are not suitable to participate
             in the study.

          -  Individuals who refuse to give written, informed consent to be involved.
