  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2
      trial of AS902330 administered intra-articularly in subjects with primary osteoarthritis of
      the knee and Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or 3. The trial is intended to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of different intra articular dosages of AS902330 (Sprifermin) in these
      individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be equally randomized to either one of 4 treatment arms or a placebo arm. The
      trial consists of a Screening period lasting up to 42 days, a two-year double-blind
      placebo-controlled (DBPC) treatment phase, which begins at randomization (Week 0) and ends at
      Year 2, and a 3-year extended follow-up phase.
