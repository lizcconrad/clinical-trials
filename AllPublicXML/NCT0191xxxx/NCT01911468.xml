  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatment with liraglutide and
      metformin is more effective than liraglutide or metformin as monotherapy in the treatment of
      obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who had been previously poor responders
      regarding weight reduction on metformin monotherapy. We anticipated greater changes in body
      weight in patients on combined treatment than in those on monotherapy with liraglutide or
      metformin.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main outcome was change in body weight.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's body weight was mesured at the base point and every four weeks during 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome was change in body mass index (BMI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's body weight were measured at the basepoint and every four weeks during the 12 weeks of clinical trial. Patient's height was measured at the basepoint.</time_frame>

    <description>Patient's waist circumference was measured in centimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The other outcomes was changes changes in fasting concentrations of glucose.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the basepoint and every four weeks during the 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Concentrations of fasting glucose was measured in mmol/L.</description>

    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the basepoint and every four weeks during the 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Blood concentration was measured in nmol/L.</description>
