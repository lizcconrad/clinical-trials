  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Cerebral Palsy and quadriplegia or severe diplegia suffer from highly reduced
      mobility and consequent constipation. Clinicians frequently recommend standing-frames to
      exercise the support reaction in this population, sharing the opinion that the upright
      position may facilitate intestinal transit, although no evidence supports this assumption.

      The investigators conducted this single-subject research to determine the effects of the
      standing-frame on the frequency of evacuation in chronically constipated children with CP and
      quadriplegia.

      Moreover, the investigators studied its effects on the frequency of induction of evacuation,
      the characteristics of the stool and the pain suffered by the child due to constipation
      and/or evacuation.

        In this study we included children with CP, in the manifestation of severe diplegia or
        quadriplegia, who do not currently use the standing-frame. The population of interest might
        be referred to the Unit for severe disability in developmental age or to one of the
        neuro-psychiatric and rehabilitation Units of the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia, (5.000
        km2 of surface and 1.250.000 inhabitants)

        Inclusion criteria were:

          -  clinical indication for the use of the standing-frame;

          -  constipation problems as defined by guidelines (Clinical Practice Guideline, 2006);

          -  whose parents gave the informed consent to let their child to participate in this
             study.

        Exclusion criteria were:

          -  children who have orthosympathetic reactions to the upright position, skeletal
             deformities and/or medical conditions that, according to clinical judgment, advise
             against the use of the standing frame.
