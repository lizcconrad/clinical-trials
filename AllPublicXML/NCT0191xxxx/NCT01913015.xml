  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of dietary fat levels and
      abiraterone acetate uptake in patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer.
      Abiraterone acetate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Eating a low or high fat diet may increase the uptake of abiraterone
      acetate.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the dietary effects of a low fat and high fat diet at a low abiraterone acetate
      dose (250 mg) on drug levels compared to standard dose administered in a fasting condition.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To potentially guide decisions in the future to use low dose abiraterone in a fed state
      and decrease overall cost.

      II. To evaluate the potential relationship between esterase activity and abiraterone
      metabolism in an exploratory analysis.

      III. To determine the feasibility of using patient-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples
      for pharmacokinetic monitoring.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard dose abiraterone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD) (held
      on days 2, 3, 9, and 10), and low-dose abiraterone acetate PO QD on days 3 and 10. Patients
      eat a low fat breakfast on day 3 and a high fat breakfast on day 10.

      ARM II: Patients receive abiraterone acetate as in Arm I. Patients eat a high fat breakfast
      on day 3, and a low fat breakfast on day 10.

    After enrollment of the first 3 subjects, an interim assessment was conducted. Comparing DBS

    <description>The cross-over difference (log[AUC0-24(low fat)] - log[AUC0-24(high fat)]) of each patient will be computed and graphically illustrated. The cross-over difference will be estimated and reported with 95% confidence interval. Hills-Armitage approach will be used to adjust for the period effect for the estimation. In addition, a bioequivalence range will be computed for the log(AUC0-24[1000 mg with fasting food]), allowing for 20% differences in each side.</description>

    <description>Patients will document the date/time of drug administration and the date/time of sample collection using a drug and DBS sample diary. Deviations greater than 10% of the shorter of the two time intervals surrounding the pre-defined time point will be considered non-adherent. Adherence rates will be compared for different time points.</description>
