    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects, good and/or bad, of the drug
      regorafenib with chemotherapy regime (FOLFOX). This is a a Phase II trial that will study if
      this new treatment is effective and safe in patients with esophagus and stomach cancer.

    <description>Regorafenib 160 mg daily on days 4 to 10 and days 18 to 24 as four 40 mg coprecipitate tablets + mFOLFOX on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle. Each cycle consists of 28 days. All patients will receive systemic chemotherapy with the mFOLFOX regimen and regorafenib. The specific version of the FOLFOX regimen used at MSKCC is mFOLFOX6. mFOLFOX6 will be given on Day 1 of each cycle. Patients will receive Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), 5-FU 400 mg/m2 IVP, and 5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day CIVI x 2 days, every two weeks. Treatment will be performed on the scheduled day ± 7 days. In case of discontinuation of FOLFOX due to cumulative toxicity and administration as a single agent during the study, regorafenib for patient convenience will be administered 160 mg daily for 3 weeks on/1 week off. The 3 weeks on/1 week off schedule is supported by the single agent regorafenib data in colon cancer and GIST.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             esophageal, gastroesophageal junction or gastric adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patient must have disease that can be evaluated radiographically. This may be
             measurable disease or non-measurable disease. Minimum indicator lesion size = 10 mm by
             helical CT or = 20 mm by conventional techniques. Pathological nodes must be = 15 mm
             by the short axis to be considered measurable.

          -  Subject must be able to swallow and retain oral medication

          -  Age 18 years or older.
