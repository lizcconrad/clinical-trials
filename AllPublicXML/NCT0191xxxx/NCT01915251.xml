      Background:

      - Vaginal yeast infections are caused by a fungus called Candida. Candida can live harmlessly
      in the vagina, but most women will have symptoms from a vaginal yeast infection at some point
      during their life. Antibiotics increase the risk for yeast infections, but it is unclear why.
      They may disrupt the balance of healthy bacteria in the vagina. This could make it harder for
      the body to fight off yeast infections. Researchers will give healthy women a common
      antibiotic or a placebo. They will study how the antibiotic affects bacteria and yeast in the
      vagina and other parts of the body. This will let researchers study the normal changes of
      healthy bacteria and yeast over time.

      Objectives:

      - To see how the study drug changes healthy bacteria in the vagina, and how these changes may
      increase the risk for yeast infections.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy women ages 18 to 40 who are not allergic to penicillin.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam (including vaginal
           exam), blood tests and tests for sexually transmitted diseases.

        -  Participants must take birth control pills for at least 3 months before, and during the
           study.

        -  Participants will take the study antibiotic or placebo for 10 days.

        -  Participants will have 7 study visits over 3 months. Visits will be timed around
           participants menstrual cycles.

        -  At the visits, participants will answer questions about their health and undergo tests.
           These may include swabs of the vagina, mouth and skin as well as blood tests. Vaginal
           fluid, saliva and urine will also be collected.

        -  Between visits, participants will collect stool and vaginal samples at home and bring
           them to the next clinic visit.

      This protocol is a prospective, interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      longitudinal study designed to investigate the microbiomic and immunologic perturbations that
      lead to vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in women who receive antibiotics. VVC is the most
      common fungal infection affecting women. Although asymptomatic vaginal Candida colonization
      occurs in ~10-20% of healthy women, ~75% of women will experience at least one episode of
      symptomatic VVC during their lifetime. Nonetheless, the local mucosal factors that allow
      Candida to convert from a commensal organism to an opportunistic pathogen are not well
      defined. Antibiotic use (particularly beta-lactams) is a well-recognized risk factor for the
      development of VVC in healthy women, suggesting that alterations in the endogenous vaginal
      microbial flora results in deregulation of local mucosal anti-Candida immune responses.
      However, which commensal vaginal microbiota are important for protection against Candida
      infection, and the mechanism(s) whereby vaginal microbiota influence the local mucosal immune
      response against Candida, remain unknown.

      To address these questions, healthy women of reproductive age will receive a 10-day course of
      amoxicillin (a broad-spectrum, beta-lactam antibiotic) or a placeboand will undergo vaginal
      sampling for microbiomic and immunologic analyses before, during and after antibiotic
      administration over a 90-day period. The hypothesis of this study is that women who develop
      amoxicillin-associated VVC will have a characteristic microbiomic profile (as compared to
      women with absent or asymptomatic Candida colonization) with associated impairment in local
      mucosal anti-Candida immune responses. The aim of this study is to elucidate the vaginal
      microbiomic and immunologic perturbations that allow Candida to transition from commensal to
      pathogen in the context of antibiotic administration. A better understanding of the role of
      specific microbiota and mucosal immune factors in averting Candida infection may lead to the
      design of targeted preventive and/or therapeutic interventions against VVC.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Females 18-40 years of age must meet the following criteria to be eligible for
        participation in this study:

          -  Willing and able to comply with the procedures of the protocol

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Able to swallow capsules

          -  Have a history of regular (approximately 21-35 day) menstrual cycles prior to
             initiation of hormonal contraception

             Women below)

        Participation of Women:

        Contraception:

        Because menstruation is known to affect the vaginal microbiome and because oral
        contraceptives produce predictable menstrual cycles, subjects must be on oral
        contraceptives in order to be eligible for the study. Additionally, since amoxicillin may
        theoretically reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives, subjects must agree to use an
        additional form of contraception (barrier method, abstinence) while receiving the study
        drug.
