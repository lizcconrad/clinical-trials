  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retention in care and virologic suppression are the key final steps of the HIV treatment
      cascade. Poor or intermittent retention has been associated with later initiation of
      antiretroviral therapy, virologic failure, and death. Regular HIV care has also been
      associated with a decrease in HIV transmission risk behavior. Despite the proven health and
      prevention benefits of consistent HIV care, only 40-50% of those infected with HIV in the
      United States are estimated to meet current retention in care standards and even fewer - only
      about 25% - are estimated to be virologically suppressed.

      The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations provides a useful framework for understanding
      broad areas that may impact adherence to care and treatment. Individual-level domains include
      vulnerable (e.g., depression, stigma), enabling (e.g., social support, positive affect), and
      need (e.g., co-morbidities) factors, and structural domains include, for example, features or
      the clinic and the provider-patient relationship.

      Short message service (SMS) technology represents a new and exciting tool to help retain
      HIV-infected patients in care and treatment. SMS interventions have been deployed
      successfully in support of antiretroviral adherence and virologic suppression in sub-Saharan
      Africa, where two randomized trials have showed clear benefits. A pilot study conducted in
      our clinic suggests that use of SMS messages to promote adherence to care and treatment in
      the urban HIV-infected poor is both feasible and acceptable.

      The investigators believe that combining SMS technology with content-specific messages
      designed to impact factors highlighted in the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations can
      improve retention in care and virologic suppression for an urban public hospital population
      living with HIV, thus the investigators propose the following specific aims.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine whether a behavioral theory-based SMS intervention improves
      virologic suppression [primary outcome] and retention in care [secondary outcome] for a
      vulnerable urban HIV-infected population through a randomized trial of this technology
      compared to SMS appointment reminders alone. Retention in care will also be analyzed as a
      mediator of virologic suppression. Exploratory outcomes include time to virologic
      suppression, sustained virologic suppression, emergency department utilization and
      antiretroviral adherence, as well as levels of depression, positive affect, social support
      and empowerment.

      Specific Aim 2: Examine patient experiences with the SMS intervention, focusing specifically
      on: 1) satisfaction with this technology; 2) identifying barriers to and facilitators of
      patient use of this technology, and; 3) the preferred frequency and content of intervention
      messages.

      Specific Aim 3: Conduct cost and cost-effectiveness analyses of the SMS intervention.
