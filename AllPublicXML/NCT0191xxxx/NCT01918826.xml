  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Charcot syndrome Marie Tooth is the most frequent hereditary neuromuscular diseases:
      there is no curative treatment at present, on the other hand precautionary measures can be
      taken (physiotherapy, port of splints, orthopaedic surgery and technical assistants). In the
      literature and in our recent study (evaluation of the pain in the disease of CMT - Reference
      center of the neuromuscular diseases - CHU Bow) the frequency of the pain is important
      varying from 66 to 96 % cases, affecting especially hands and lower limbs. The care of the
      pain in the Charcot syndrome Marie Tooth is not codified. The transcutaneous
      neurostimulation(TENS) is a not medicinal and not invasive therapeutics, without any brought
      back collateral effect, used at the same time in the chronic pain and acute since 1960, as
      well for the neuropathic pains that musculo-scrawny. No study was realized this day on the
      use of the TENS with analgesic aim in the CMT. We suggest studying the analgesic efficiency
      of the TENS in the Charcot syndrome Marie Tooth on the pains of lower limbs, the most
      frequent painful location in our recent works.

      The main objective will be to analyze the improvement of the pain of lower limbs, based on
      the decrease of the analogical visual scale(ladder) (EVA), at least 30 %.

      The secondary objectives will be to estimate repercussions on the functional capacities (
      ONLS), the quality of life (SF(sci-fi) 12), the satisfaction (EVA), the global
      impression(printing) of change ( PGIC), the consumption of analgesic, DN4, NPSI (Neuropathic
      Pain Symptom Inventory), Concise Questionnaire of the Pains ( QCD), HAD (Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression scale).
