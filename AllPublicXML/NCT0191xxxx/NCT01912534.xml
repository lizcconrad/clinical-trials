  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether treatment with valsartan will have
      beneficial effect in early hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) by assessing many domains that
      reflect myocardial structure, function and biochemistry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II, randomized clinical trial
      to assess the safety and efficacy of valsartan in attenuating disease evolution in early HCM.
      Sarcomere mutation carriers with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic overt disease (NYHA class
      I-II), and mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) will be studied.
