  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among patients undergoing heart surgery, a measurable degree of heart muscle tissue injury is
      expected. The level of injury can be shown by measuring the blood levels of specific
      molecules called cardiac biomarkers. Those cardiac biomarkers are often used in the acute
      cardiac care to diagnose a myocardial infarction.

      Postoperative heart infarction remains a frequent and important complication after heart
      surgery.Therefore it is important to recognize any cardiac event in patients who underwent
      heart surgery. Although different diagnostic tools can be used to recognize these events, few
      is known about the value of those cardiac biomarkers to diagnose a myocardial infarction
      after heart surgery.

      In this study the investigators will describe the concentration changes of those cardiac
      biomarkers over time in patients undergoing heart surgery, and the investigators will try to
      establish a upper level value who could indicate heart infarction.

      This is a prospective interventional mono centre study. High-sensitivity troponin and CK-MB
      will be measured at different point of times in all adult patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery.

      Experiments are conducted at the O.L.V. Hospital, Aalst, Belgium, in a fully equipped
      operating room and intensive care facility and in the presence of board-certified
      anesthesiologists for safety reasons. After approval by the institutional ethics committee
      and written informed consent, all adult patients scheduled for different types of cardiac
      surgery between June 2013 and June 2014 will be enrolled. Collected data include demographic
      information, presence of co-morbid conditions and basic preoperative laboratory testing
      (including Hs-cTn and CK-MB) (Table 1) as well as per- and postoperative factors (Table 2).

      Four different surgeons will perform the surgeries. The revascularization strategy and work
      method are chosen according to each surgeon's preference and good clinical practice. Standard
      monitoring is used in all patients. Anaesthesia management is at the discretion of the
      attending anaesthesiologist and according to good clinical practice.

      Serum levels of CK-MB and Hs-cTn will be measured at induction of anaesthesia (after
      placement of the arterial line), upon arrival at the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as
      every 3 hours for 12 hours, then every 6 hours the following 12 hours and a last sample is
      taken 48 hours after surgery. Samples are analysed at the department of Clinical Biochemistry
      of our institution with the Elecsys Troponin T hs immuno-assay. Lower limit of quantification
      being 0,14 Nano gram/L (company data).

      Twelve-lead ECGs obtained routinely the day prior to surgery, immediately upon arrival at the
      ICU, and then 24 and 48 hours post-surgery will be retrospectively reviewed by a cardiologist
      blinded to all other data for evidence of new postoperative MI.

      All cardiac events, as described by the Third Global MI Task Force definition of MI, will be
      noted. Additional ECG or transesophageal echocardiography will be done at the discretion of
      the attending ICU physician, according to ICU protocols and good clinical practice.

      Approved automated record keeping system (MetaVision Suite, iMDSoft, the Netherlands) will be
      used in the ICU. The principal investigator and/or co-investigators will supervise data
      handling.

    <description>Postoperative myocardial infarction remains a frequent and important complication after cardiac surgery. In 2012 the Third Global MI Task Force has presented a third universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) implying that MI associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarkers values &gt; 10x99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values (≤ 99th percentile URL), in addition with either (i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB (left bundle branch block), or (ii) angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or (iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Although some suggest that ECG, myocardial scan, and CK-MB criteria underestimate the prevalence of MI after CABG, few is known about the established threshold values for hs-cTn after valve surgery or combined surgery.</description>
