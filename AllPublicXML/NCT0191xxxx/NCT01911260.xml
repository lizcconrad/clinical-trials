      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of weekly zinc supplementation on
      schoolchildren with growth deficit or normal stature.

      Zinc is an important micronutrient for humans. Trials with zinc have shown positive effects
      of supplementation on growth, but there is still a lack of results on schoolchildren
      population. This Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial was design to measure the effect of
      weekly zinc supplementation on schoolchildren with growth deficit and normal stature.
      Schoolchildren were allocated into two homogeneous groups named Growth Deficit (HAZ &lt; -1,5
      Z-score), and Normal Stature (HAZ between -1,0 and ±1,0 Z-score) and were randomly assigned
      to compose two exposed and two control groups to receive a supplement of 30mg of zinc amino
      acid chelate or placebo individually once a week, during 12 weeks. Children's heights were
      measured at the end of supplementation period and again after 12 weeks.

    <time_frame>Height-for-Age Z-score was measured at the End of Supplementation period and again at the End of Follow-up period, with a 12 weeks interval.</time_frame>
    <description>Schoolchildren were allocated into two homogeneous groups named Growth Deficit (HAZ &lt; -1,5 Z-score), and Normal Height (HAZ between -1,0 and ±1,0 Z-score), and were randomly assigned to compose two exposed groups to receive a supplement of 30mg of zinc amino acid chelate, and two control groups to receive placebo individually once a week, during 12 weeks. Children's heights were measured at the End of Supplementation period and again after 12 weeks (Follow-up period). In combination with sex and age we transformed stature to Height-for-Age, expressed in Z-score, which was calculated as a number of standard deviations or Z-scores below or above the reference mean or median value, according to the formula below:
Z-score = (observed value - median value of the reference population) / standard deviation value of reference population.
We analyzed and discussed the change in HAZ (HAZ at the End of Follow-up period - HAZ at End of Supplementation).</description>

      <recruitment_details>From original database of 2.519 children, enrolled in the first and second grades of four State-run public basic schools, we selected this study sample using height for age indicator (HAZ). Meetings were held at school with parents/guardians to explain the objective and procedures of the study in order to obtain a written consent.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>From original database (n=2.519), we selected children with one and a half or more standard deviations below the mean height for age (HAZ) and gender of the reference population as Growth Deficit group. For the Normal Height group, HAZ was define as between -1 and +1 standard deviations from the mean height reference for age and sex (n=218).</pre_assignment_details>

The supplement administration was made individually with 1ml BD Plastipak disposable syringe, directly into the child's mouth, by the principal investigator. The chosen supplementation day was Tuesday. Therefore, the following weekdays were reserved to supplement any absent student.</description>

        <title>Change in Height-for-Age Z-score (HAZ) From End of Supplementation to End of Follow-up Period.</title>
        <description>Schoolchildren were allocated into two homogeneous groups named Growth Deficit (HAZ &lt; -1,5 Z-score), and Normal Height (HAZ between -1,0 and ±1,0 Z-score), and were randomly assigned to compose two exposed groups to receive a supplement of 30mg of zinc amino acid chelate, and two control groups to receive placebo individually once a week, during 12 weeks. Children's heights were measured at the End of Supplementation period and again after 12 weeks (Follow-up period). In combination with sex and age we transformed stature to Height-for-Age, expressed in Z-score, which was calculated as a number of standard deviations or Z-scores below or above the reference mean or median value, according to the formula below:
Z-score = (observed value - median value of the reference population) / standard deviation value of reference population.
We analyzed and discussed the change in HAZ (HAZ at the End of Follow-up period - HAZ at End of Supplementation).</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The sample loss is a factor that hinders the adoption of results as definitive. Even if they remained similar according to biodemographic variables, we cannot guarantee the maintenance of group equality defined in randomization.</limitations_and_caveats>
