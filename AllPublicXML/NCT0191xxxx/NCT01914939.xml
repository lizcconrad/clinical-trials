  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 3-year study is a trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with or without oxytocin
      (OT) augmentation, in young adults with autism spectrum disorders. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either a social skills-focused CBT intervention or a stress
      management/relaxation training CBT intervention. Participants will also be randomized to
      receive either a) intranasal oxytocin or b) a placebo drug, prior to the psychotherapy. The
      design of the study will enable examination of the efficacy of CBT for young adults with
      autism spectrum disorders. The design of the study will also allow examination of whether
      oxytocin enhances the efficacy of CBT.

      The investigators will perform functional (fMRI) and structural (MRI) imaging with all
      participants prior to treatment. This will enable examination of the relations between
      measures of brain function and structure, and improvements in target symptoms over the course
      of treatment. The aim is to discover whether there are neural characteristics that can
      identify which participants with autism spectrum disorders are most likely to respond to CBT
      interventions and/or oxytocin treatment.

    <measure>Changes in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The ADOS is a semi-structured standardized assessment of communication and social interaction that is considered a gold-standard assessment of autism spectrum disorders. The study will use Module 4, designed for use with adolescents and adults. The primary endpoint(dependent measure) will be the change in a global impression of social engagement by a clinician who is an experienced ADOS administrator. This will be a rating on a 10-point scale and involve expert clinical judgement of the qualities and behaviors that are at the core of the social/communicative deficits.</description>
