  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial to study the safety and efficacy of IMMU-130. IMMU-130 is composed
      of a drug attached to an antibody. The drug is the active ingredient in irinotecan which is a
      common chemotherapy drug used for colorectal cancer. Antibodies are proteins normally made by
      the immune system. They bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm to
      the body. The antibody in this study was designed to bind to a marker located on colorectal
      cancer tumors. The antibody was originally made from mouse proteins, but was changed in the
      laboratory to be more like human antibodies. This study will investigate how IMMU-130 acts
      for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The study is mainly being done to see if IMMU-130 is
      safe and effective.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients, ≥ 18 years of age, able to understand and give written
             informed consent

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma

          -  Stage IV (metastatic) disease

          -  Previously treated with at least one prior irinotecan-containing regimen for
             colorectal cancer

          -  Adequate performance status (ECOG 0 or 1) (Appendix 1)

          -  Expected survival ≥ 6 months

          -  CEA plasma levels &gt; 5 ng/mL

          -  Measurable disease by CT or MRI, but with no single lesion measuring more than 10.0 cm

          -  At least 4 weeks beyond treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation
             therapy) or major surgery and recovered from all acute toxicities

          -  Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support (hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL, ANC ≥
             1,500 per mm3, platelets &gt; 100,000 per mm3)

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN, bilirubin within normal
             limits, AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 x IULN or 5 x IULN if know liver metastases)

          -  Otherwise, all acute toxicity at study entry ≤ Grade 1 by NCI CTC v4.0, or recovered

             entry as defined as: (1) no evidence of new enlarging CNS metastasis, (2) off steroids
             or on a stable dose of steroids.

          -  Patients with CEA plasma levels &gt; 1000 ng/mL must be approved in advance by the
