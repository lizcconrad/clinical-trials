  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate gait when individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) are walking
      while talking to see how walking changes when challenged to perform a functional cognitive
      task simultaneously. By looking at walking alone and walking with varying cognitive loads the
      investigators will be able to determine motor and cognitive factors vulnerable to
      interference in PD. Each is important to understand so that training can address components
      of walking that become impaired when someone is distracted by a common cognitive task and so
      that the intensity of treatment matches the level of task difficulty. Using this initial
      data, the investigators will establish a protocol to improve walking taking into account the
      unique features of PD, including bradykinesia, freezing of gait, stiffness, and problems with
      memory and attention. The investigators will evaluate the potential for this treatment to
      improve walking and improve or maintain cognitive abilities necessary to multitask.

      In this study participants will be asked to participate in a training study to examine
      whether a new walking intervention that combines cognitive training with walking on a
      treadmill improves walking more than gait training or cognitive training alone. Participants
      with Parkinson's disease (PD) will come to the lab for a complete gait assessment using a
      motion analysis system that will record leg motion and muscle activity during comfortable
      walking. During the initial evaluation, participants will also complete cognitive assessments
      and surveys about community activities and quality of life related to PD. Participants will
      be divided into one of the three training groups and asked to come to the lab three times a
      week for four weeks during the intervention. One week and one month after training,
      participants will return to the lab to complete all the same assessments that were performed
      during the initial visit. The results of the three testing sessions (initial, one week and
      one month) will be compared between and within groups to see if any of the interventions
      provided unique benefits to the health of persons with PD.

    <description>Changes in gait parameters are a key measure of the difficulty of performing two tasks at once. Decreases in gait speed, increased time in double support (two feet on the ground) and stopping while talking have been linked to increased disability and risk for falls.</description>

    <description>Participants will count backward by sevens from a digit between 90 and 100. The ability to perform the task will be used as a measure of cognitive trade-off relative to walking performance.</description>

Measurements will be taken of spatial and temporal features of walking with and without a secondary task. In addition, cognitive tests of memory and attention will be performed. Outcomes will narrow measures to those most likely to show clinically significant change.</description>
