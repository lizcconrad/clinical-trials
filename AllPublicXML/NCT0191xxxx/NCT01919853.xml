  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
      (MBSR) to an attention control psycho-educational support group in treating cancer-related
      fatigue (CRF) in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors with
      clinically-significant CRF. The study will collect, store, and later analyze blood and urine
      samples for several biomarkers that may be linked to persistent CRF in cancer survivors.

      This is a randomized, attention control clinical trial to compare MBSR to support and
      education on biobehavioral outcomes in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors
      with clinically-significant CRF. The study will use quantitative and qualitative methods to
      evaluate the following:

      Primary Aim 1: Determine effect size estimates of MBSR compared to attention control in
      reducing fatigue interference and the severity of several cancer-related symptoms immediately
      post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up.

      Exploratory Aim 1: To identify potential moderators of intervention effects in breast cancer
      survivors (BCS) and colorectal cancer survivors (CRCS), such as demographic, clinical/disease
      characteristics, personality traits, and baseline mindfulness level.

      Exploratory Aim 2: To compare levels of a number of anti- and pro-inflammatory proteins
      present in blood and urine between MBSR and attention control groups immediately
      post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, and between fatigued and non-fatigued breast cancer
      survivors at baseline.

    <description>The MBSR intervention is an 8-week course meeting 2 hours weekly. The curriculum is based on MBSR manuals with a brief CRF education component incorporated into the first and second class sessions, drawing from information from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines for CRF. In general, the MBSR class includes guided meditation practice; mindful, gentle movement (hatha yoga); didactic material on self-regulatory responses to stress; and group discussion that includes the participants' growing incorporation of mindfulness in adapting to life experiences. Along with class time, each participant is asked to commit 20 minutes per day, six days per week to formal meditation practice using compact disk recordings of the teacher's voice.</description>

    <description>The attention control is an 8-week class meeting 2 hours weekly. The group sessions are supportive in tone, focus on pre-designated topics relevant to fatigue management (e.g., sleep hygiene, nutrition, exercise, emotional regulation), and involve weekly readings and open group discussion about session topics. This condition contains &quot;non-specific&quot; factors similar to MBSR (e.g., facilitator offering participants compassionate attention, empathy, genuine caring, and an opportunity to discuss what is important to them in a supportive environment); however, mindfulness is not presented/practiced in the group.</description>
