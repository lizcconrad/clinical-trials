    <measure>Number of Participants With Drug Related Adverse Events (AEs) or Any Serious AE's</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 53</time_frame>
    <description>A summary of serious AEs and all other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Pain Severity Item and Interference Item to Week 50</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported scale measuring severity of pain and interference on function. Severity scores: 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) on each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in past 24 hours, and pain right now. Interference scores: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) on each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference = average of non-missing scores of individual interference items.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement) to Week 50</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>PGI-I measures a participant's perception of improvement at the time of assessment compared with the start of treatment. Score ranges from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity) to Week 50</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S measures severity of illness at the time of assessment compared with start of treatment with scores ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-24) to Week 50</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>RMDQ-24 is a participant completed questionnaire and measures the degree of disability due to back pain. The questionnaire consists of 24 statements and the participant was instructed to put a mark next to each appropriate statement. The number of statements marked was summed by the clinician for a total score. The total score ranged from 0 (no disability) to 24 (severe disability).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) to Week 50</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 Health Status Survey is a generic, health-related scale assessing participant's quality of life on 8 domains: physical functioning, social functioning, bodily pain, vitality, mental health, role-physical, role-emotional and general health. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life Questionnaire-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) to Week 50</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a three level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These combinations of attributes were converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the Japan population-based algorithm ranging from -0.111 to 1.0, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) to Week 50</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>BDI-II is a 21-item, participant-completed questionnaire to assess characteristics of depression. Each of the 21 items corresponding to symptoms of depression were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 and was summed to give a single score. A total score of 0-13 was considered minimal range, 14-19 was mild, 20-28 was moderate, and 29-63 was severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 53</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal behavior is defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation is defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation.</description>

        <description>A self-reported scale measuring severity of pain and interference on function. Severity scores: 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) on each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in past 24 hours, and pain right now. Interference scores: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) on each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference = average of non-missing scores of individual interference items.</description>

          <description>A self-reported scale measuring severity of pain and interference on function. Severity scores: 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) on each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in past 24 hours, and pain right now. Interference scores: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) on each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference = average of non-missing scores of individual interference items.</description>
          <population>(FAS): All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-dose BPI pain severity (average pain) scores. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used.</population>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a three level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These combinations of attributes were converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the Japan population-based algorithm ranging from -0.111 to 1.0, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
