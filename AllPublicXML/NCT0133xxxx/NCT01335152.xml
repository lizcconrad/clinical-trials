  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress Management interventions have been shown to decrease cancer-related distress, foster
      emotional growth and improve immune functioning during treatment for breast cancer.

      This study will evaluate an online version of a stress management intervention for women with
      early stage breast cancer. Each chapter of the 10-week intervention include self-assessment
      and targeted feedback, education, interactive learning exercises -- all tailored to the needs
      of women with early stage breast cancer. In addition, guided writing exercises will promote
      emotional expression and a discussion board will encourage group support.

      The web-based intervention is being evaluated in a randomized clinical trial with a sample of
      120 women with early stage breast cancer. Women will be randomly assigned to use the 10-week
      intervention with biweekly telephone assessments or to the telephone assessments alone.
