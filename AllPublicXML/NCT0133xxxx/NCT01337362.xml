  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 1 diabetes are at risk of very low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) as a
      severe side effect to insulin therapy, in particular subjects who have lost warning of
      hypoglycaemia. During hypoglycaemia a low frequent activity can be seen with
      electroencephalography (EEG) as cognitive function declines.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the activity in the brain, the cognitive function,
      and the skin temperature when patients are exposed to repeated hypoglycaemia. The results
      will show whether the response to hypoglycaemia will change after repeated episodes.

      It is our hope that results can contribute to improved understanding of hypoglycaemic EEG
      changes.

      Background:

      Patients with type 1 diabetes are at risk of severe hypoglycaemia as a severe side effect to
      insulin therapy, in particular subjects who have lost warning of hypoglycaemia (hypoglycaemia
      unawareness). The episodes are associated with impaired quality of life and can lead to
      permanent brain damage and death.

      During hypoglycaemia a low frequent activity can be seen with electroencephalography (EEG) as
      cognitive function declines. Repeated hypoglycaemic episodes result in down regulation of
      counter regulatory and symptomatic responses. It is not known whether a similar phenomenon is
      present for cerebral dysfunction as judged by EEG changes and cognitive function.

      The purpose is to investigate the activity in the brain, the cognitive function, and the skin
      temperature when patients are exposed to repeated hypoglycaemia. The results will show
      whether the response to hypoglycaemia will change after repeated episodes.

      The methods:

      The investigators will recruit two groups of patients: Patients with hypoglycemia awareness
      and patients with hypoglycaemic unawareness.

      The patients are exposed to hypoglycaemia on two concomitant days while the investigators
      record EEG and perform cognitive tests. Skin temperature is assessed by the use of
      thermography. If the patient has hypoglycaemic unawareness a 4 week period follows where the
      glycaemic control is loosened to avoid hypoglycaemia episodes and the patients is then
      exposed to hypoglycaemia again.

      The prospect:

      It is the investigators hope that results can contribute to improved understanding of
      hypoglycaemic EEG changes and skin temperature changes. This could be of potential benefit
      for patients with hypoglycaemic unawareness.

    <description>EEG will be analysed in order to see whether there are any differences between aware and unaware patients during hypoglycaemia. It is our hope that the result can help develop an alarm before the patient experiences severe hypoglycaemia.</description>

    <measure>QTc interval</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators want to investigate whether the QTc complex gets wider during hypoglycaemia. This is in order to see whether long QTc could be the explanation behind sudden dearth in diabetes patients.</description>

    <measure>Skin temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Skin temperature will be measured by thermography. The investigators want to see whether the skin can be used as a biomarker for hypoglycaemia.</description>

    <measure>Auditory evoked potentials</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators what to see whether there is any difference in auditory evoked potentials (AEP) between aware and unaware diabetic patients. The subject will hear a common and a rare sound in a 4:1 ratio while the EEG is recorded. Afterwards the data is analyzed and the AEPs are addressed.</description>

    <description>The investigators want to address whether there are any differences in the cognitive function between aware and unaware patients. The cognitive function will be addressed by the use of cognitive function tests (CalCAP) and Stroops tests as well.</description>
