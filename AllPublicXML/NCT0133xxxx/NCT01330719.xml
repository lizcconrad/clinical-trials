  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although of low prevalence, aggressive periodontitis is a rapid destructive form of
      periodontal disease that initiates at a young age, leading to premature loss of first molars
      and incisors. Little is known on the mechanisms of this disease. It is imperative to
      understand mechanisms of disease to establish proper treatment. We have established a
      controlled study in a comparable population presenting similar aggressive disease
      characteristics to evaluate the mechanisms of this disease. It is the goal of this study to
      determine immunological and microbiological mechanisms responsible for the rapid tissue
      destruction in children with localized aggressive periodontitis and how traditional
      periodontal intervention affects these mechanisms. Important knowledge gained with this
      proposal will aid in defining specific treatment approaches to better control disease
      progression and prevent disease initiation in susceptible individuals.

      There a multiple appointments throughout the study which can vary depending upon if a patient
      has the disease present or not.

      If the patient has gum disease: At the initial examination, some samples will be collected:
      the natural fluid that comes from the gums and the bacteria that are present there will be
      collected by inserting a piece of paper and a filter strip in the spaces between teeth and
      gums; blood samples may also be taken by a phlebotomist to evaluate some inflammatory signs
      of disease and possible genetic markers (about 5 teaspoons at each visit); and a cheek swab
      may be taken by gently rubbing a little brush into the inside of the cheeks. Patients also
      may be asked to spit into a container we provide. Tissues from gums that are usually
      discarded may also be collected during treatment. When patients return for re-evaluation of
      their gums, all these samples may be collected again at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the
      initial therapy. After 24 months, only clinical examinations may be performed, up to 3 more
      visits within the following 3 years.

      If the patient does not have gum disease: If gums are healthy and the patient does not need
      treatment, they will be seen every 6 months for examination and cleanings, then sample
      collections may also be taken at these visits up to 24 months. These sample collections are
      done to be studied by genetic tests, which will tell us if there are specific genetic markers
      (inherited markers) associated with this disease, and also other laboratory testing, which
      will help the researchers identify how the body responds to bacteria. These markers will also
      be evaluated in family members (parents, grandparents or siblings), when possible, to check
      for the likelihood of these members developing this disease.

      Regardless of the patient's gum condition, investigators will also evaluate current and past
      dental x-rays to determine if there were signs of this disease in the past.

      Investigators may also take photos of the teeth and gums.

    <description>Treatment includes scaling and root planing with systemic antibiotics, Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 250 mg tid 7 days. At certain intervals after the scaling and root planing, your gums will be reevaluated. You will receive further surgical gum therapy only if your gums haven't shown improvement after first treatment on the reevaluation appointments. If surgery is needed, a bone substituting material may be necessary to &quot;fill&quot; the spaces where bone has been destroyed by the disease. Extraction of teeth might also be part of gum treatment if the disease is very severe. Re-treatment with antibiotics also may be necessary depending on the response after treatment. You are usually re-examined and receive additional cleanings every 3 to 6 months to ensure the disease does not come back.</description>
