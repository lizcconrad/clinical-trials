  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      P3914 a pro-drug of Naproxen, characterized by naproxen (COX inhibiting moiety) linked to a
      NO moiety is intended for the treatment of pain and inflammation. The rationale behind
      development of P3914 is to maintain the analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activity
      of naproxen and enhance GI safety by virtue of release of NO besides with no major effect on
      blood pressure on long-term administration.
