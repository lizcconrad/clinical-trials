  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The oral appliances have been increasingly used in the treatment of primary
      snoring and in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome besides being treatment
      options in adults with moderate to severe sleep apnea who did not accept or adapt to
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). It is not well established yet in the literature,
      which patients with mild to moderate OSA will present a good response to treatment with oral
      appliances.

      Objective: To determine a value of CPAP pressure that correlates with a favorable response to
      the use of oral appliance in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea.

      Patients and Methods: Two groups of 30 male patients (25-65 years, body mass index &lt; 35
      kg/m2) will be selected: the first group with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) between 5 and 15
      events per hour of sleep and the second one with an AHI between 15 and 30 events per hour of
      sleep. Each patient will undergo three polysomnographic recordings (baseline, CPAP titration,
      after two months of treatment with oral appliance). Subjective (sleep disorders
      questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and sleep diaries) and objective
      (polysomnography) parameters of sleep will be evaluated, besides the quality of life (SF-36),
      mood (POMS), and anthropometric measurements (neck circumference and craniofacial
      characteristic). Good response to treatment with the AIO will be considered as a 50%
      reduction in the baseline AHI index or AHI after treatment less than 5 events per hour of
      sleep.
