    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a nonrandomized, Phase I study to assess the safety of infusion of
      NK cells that will be selected from sibling donors and infused to patients with hematological
      malignancies early following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a very effective treatment for a
      number of hematological malignancies but relapse remains a major problem, especially in
      patients with high risk disease. Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that recognize
      and kill virally infected cells and tumor cells. NK cells are identified by the expression of
      the CD56 surface antigen and the lack of CD3. Their ability to kill tumor cells makes them
      promising to evaluate as effector cells for immunotherapy.

    <description>To evaluate the safety and toxicity of escalating doses of ex vivo selected donor CD56+CD3- NK cells, adoptively infused on day 7 following sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with hematological malignancies. We will specifically look for the proportion of patients who develop infusion related toxicity. Toxicity will be defined as per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing an allogeneic HSCT from a sibling donor, as treatment for a
             hematological malignancy. The conditioning regimen, and in particular whether ablative
             or non ablative, will not be considered in the criteria for recruitment

          2. Patient and donor Age &gt;18 years

          3. Patients and donors must have signed an informed consent form

          4. The donor must be willing and capable of donating lymphocytes for NK selection using
             apheresis techniques

          5. Donor must be fit to undergo leukapheresis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy &lt; 3 months

          2. ECOG performance status 3 or 4

          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, life
             threatening cardiac arrhythmia

          4. Patients will not be eligible if they receive in vivo T depletion with ATG, ALG or
             campath-1H

          5. HIV-positive patients

          6. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements and ability to comprehend the investigational nature of the study and
             provide informed consent
