  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to particulate air pollution has been shown to increase cardiovascular mortality and
      morbidity, and in previous controlled exposure studies has been shown to have acute
      cardiovascular and respiratory effects. The last decade has seen an unprecedented drive
      towards finding a bioeconomical and renewable source of fuel in order to reduce our
      dependence on fossil fuels. Although both biodiesel and bioethanol have emerged as contenders
      for future fuels, biodiesel remains as the strongest contender within European markets. In
      2007 researchers at the EPA released a commentary, which concluded that the assumed
      correlation between the chemical composition of biodiesel exhaust and a reduction in health
      effects was only hypothetical. They suggested that there was a clear need for the study of
      health effects in humans regarding biofuel exhaust. In this project the investigators aim to
      investigate the cardiovascular, respiratory and inflammatory responses to biofuel exhaust
      exposure in healthy volunteers.
