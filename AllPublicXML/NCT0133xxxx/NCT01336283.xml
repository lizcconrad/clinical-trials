      Aims: To prove the benefits of an specific strength training program in COPD patients
      compared to those achieved with the traditional endurance training. We will assess which is
      the proper training modality and which of them is the most beneficial according to the
      features of the patient to whom it is applied.

      Subjects and Methods: We will study 66 patients diagnosed of COPD with a moderate-severe
      obstruction (FEV1&lt;60%) and clinically symptomatic. The monitoring will be done for 3 moths.
      Patients will be differentiated between COPD with &quot;predominant chronic bronchitis&quot; and COPD
      with &quot;predominant emphysema&quot;, with regard to clinical, functional and radiological criteria.
      After stratification of the sample, patients will be prospectively assigned to three groups
      of 22 patients each: a) Endurance training group, on cycle ergometer at a workload of 70%
      VO2max. b) Strength training group, with 5 different weightlifting exercises (4 sets of 6-8
      repetitions). c) Mixed training group, with half the time dedicated to each type of training.
      Training will be developed during 12 weeks, three times per week, in 40 minutes sessions.
      Analysed variables, at the beginning and at the end of program will be: Chest X-ray, basic
      blood analyses, electrocardiogram, simple spirometry and bronchodilator test, blood gases,
      static pulmonary volumes, diffusion measurement and respiratory muscle pressure. Muscle
      strength will be assessed by means of 1RM test and the Myometer® dynamometer. Using the
      muscle skeletal ultrasound, we will control changes in muscle fibre size. Maximal and
      submaximal exercise tests on cycle ergometer will be also performed, so as a walking test
      (shuttle walking test). At last, we will assess treatment effect on dyspnea (Mahler`s test)
      and quality of life (CRDQ).

      Hypothesis: A strength training program would significantly increase peripheral muscle power.
      This type of training would mainly have effect on the &quot;predominant emphysema&quot; COPD patient,
      where the important weight lost causes a decrease in muscle strength.

             -  Two-dimensional ultrasound of the quadriceps muscle and biceps to measure the size
                of muscle fibers. Probes will be used for external parts with a frequency of 7.5
                MHz measurements were made from the skin depth to each of the different muscles and
                the thickness of each of them.

                  1. Maximum, with cycle ergometer and methodology already known (11), including:
                     Determining, from the respiratory gases, oxygen consumption, carbon production
                     and indirect anaerobic threshold, breathing pattern (minute ventilation, tidal
                     volume, respiratory rate) , electrocardiography and pulse oximetry during
                     exercise with heart rate control, blood pressure and dyspnea Borg scale.

                  2. Submaximal cycle ergometer resistance with 80% of the load reached the
                     ultimate test, with essentially control the resistance time, distance walked,
                     and control of saturation (pulse oximetry) and heart rate achieved.

                  3. Shuttle walking test, walk test is performed continuously walk between two
                     points separated 10 meters and control the pace of a hearing (12).

           Assessment of dyspnea and quality of life:

             1. Baseline dyspnea index and index of transitional measures functional impairment,
                magnitude of the task and the magnitude of effort (Test of Mahler).

             2. Assessment of quality of life based on the specific questionnaire (CRQ) proposed by
                Guyatt for COPD patients and modified for your understanding in Spanish-speaking
                subjects.

        6. Study design:

           The training of the different groups were carried out for 12 weeks, three times per week
           in sessions of 40 minutes duration.

             1. The resistance training will take place in cycle ergometer with a level of initial
                charge of about 70% of initial maximal oxygen consumption, increasing the load
                every two weeks as tolerated.

             2. The strength training with weight lifting practice and will consist of 4 sets of
                6-8 repetitions of simple exercises. These are held at a station multigimnástica
                (CLASSIC Fitness Center, KETTLER) and are:

                  -  Simple bending of the arms (pull cable to the chest &quot;Chest pulls&quot;): Effects on
                     the latissimus dorsi, deltoids and biceps. Sitting in the face of the tower of
                     strength, approaching the bar to the chest and arm span later after return to
                     the starting position.

                  -  Simple extension arms (force to the neck &quot;Neck presses): Effects on the
                     deltoids and triceps. Sitting upright on the bench and held the weight to
                     shoulder height, arm span will be held over his head, slowly returning after
                     bending arms to starting position.

                  -  arm flexion and extension against resistance (Mariposa &quot;Butterfly&quot;): Effects
                     on the pectoral and deltoid muscles. Sitting upright on the bench with your
                     forearms and elbows on a lever, takes it to the midline, giving way slowly to
                     the starting position.

                  -  Extension legs (leg extension): Effects on quadriceps. Sitting on the bench
                     leg extension is performed against resistance.

                  -  Leg Curl (leg curls): Effects on femoral biceps and calves. Lying prone on the
                     bench legs are flexed against the peso.

                Resistance is increased gradually from 50% of the maximum weight you can lift the
                patient on one occasion, early in the week, up to 85%. Every two weeks the weight
                limit is reassessed to adjust the training load in each patient (Test 1 RM).

             3. In the group that carried out the joint training, half the time of each session
                will be devoted to strength training, following the same methodology (same number
                of years but with two sets of each), and the other half training resistance bike,
                beginning with one or the other interchangeably.

           Upon completion of 12 weeks of training will be repeated all baseline tests (except for
           chest CT) and compared the results.

        7. Exit criteria of the study:

             -  patient's clinical decompensation

             -  Loss of 3 or 5 consecutive sessions staple

             -  On the initiative of the patient.

        8. Statistical analysis:

      Analyzing the effect size at the expense of an improvement in work reached more than about 15
      W in the stress test, considered a standard deviation of this parameter of ± 10 W, an alpha
      of 0.05 and a beta of 0.1 (statistical power 90%) and calculating a loss ratio of 15%, we
      estimate a sample size of 22 patients for each group.

      Comparing before and after the training response in each group were performed using the
      paired t test. Comparisons between trained groups were made using analysis of variance
      (ANOVA). The Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis will allow to
      examine relationships between physiological variables. Be considered significant at p &lt;0.05.
      The dispersion of a mean value is expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
