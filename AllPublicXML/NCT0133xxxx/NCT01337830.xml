      Study to determine the safety and effectiveness of Ariva® Silver Wintergreen lozenge on
      reducing craving for a cigarette in daily smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will be given an Ariva® Silver Wintergreen lozenge or a Silver Wintergreen
      lozenge, which contains only silver salt, on a random basis.

      Once the lozenge has dissolved in the mouth, subjects will smoke one of their own cigarettes,
      and will answer questions about the experience and their craving for a cigarette.

      After a washout period, each subject will repeat the steps with the second type of lozenge.
