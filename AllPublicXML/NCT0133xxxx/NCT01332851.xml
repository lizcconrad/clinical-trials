      The study evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of a well-documented relationship-based
      intervention (Promoting First Relationships), compared to a resource and referral condition,
      in improving outcomes for families of infants and toddlers referred to Child Protective
      Services (CPS) for maltreatment. In addition, it evaluates the effectiveness of training
      community social service workers in providing the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child maltreatment has well-established, wide-ranging, and long-term negative effects on
      children. Most children who have experienced maltreatment and are receiving services through
      the Child Welfare System (CWS) remain in their homes with their caregivers. While the need
      for parenting services is extensive, few intervention programs have proven to be efficacious
      in reducing child abuse and neglect within the CWS population, especially for infants and
      toddlers. It is essential that social service practitioners within the CWS delivery system
      are equipped to provide brief interventions to maltreating parents. This grant, &quot;Training
      Social Work Providers: Intervention for Maltreating Families of Infants and Toddlers,&quot; is an
      evaluation of a training program for social welfare providers to implement a brief attachment
      theory-based intervention to families who have been investigated for child abuse and neglect
      by Child Protective Services. The program (Promoting First Relationships [PFR]; Kelly,
      Buehlman, &amp; Caldwell, 2000) will be tested at two levels: through social welfare practice and
      at the level of outcomes for children and families.

      Social service providers will be trained to deliver PFR to families under investigation for
      maltreatment by the Department of Social and Health Services, in two counties in Washington
      State. Subsequently, families under investigation by CPS will be recruited into the study and
      randomly assigned to the experimental group (receiving the PFR intervention) or to the
      comparison group (receiving resources and referrals).

      The specific aims of this study are to (1) Test the effectiveness of training community
      social welfare service providers in the use of attachment-based interventions by measuring
      their pre-training and post-training service provision strategies and interactions with
      maltreating families; (2) To test the effects of a relationship and attachment-based
      intervention with infants/toddlers of parents identified as maltreating by comparing them to
      a control group on rates of re-referral to CPS, severity of referral, and foster care
      placement; and (3) To conduct a test of the effectiveness of an attachment-based intervention
      on child well-being by comparing experimental and comparison groups on important outcomes
      (attachment security, emotional regulation, behavior, and developmental functioning).

      RELEVANCE Child maltreatment is a serious public health issue, affecting close to a million
      children nationally every year. The establishment of effective evidence-based interventions
      for high-risk families is essential to curtail the devastating long-term effects of
      maltreatment. The proposed study tests the feasibility and effectiveness of a well-documented
      relationship-based intervention (Promoting First Relationships) in improving outcomes for
      families referred to CPS for maltreatment.

    <description>PFR is based on attachment theory and is strengths based. The 10 week intervention is delivered in the home of the family. Each week has a theme for discussion, an activity which includes videotaping or viewing and reflecting on a videotaped session, and time for &quot;joining&quot; - checking in with the parent, listening to their concerns and establishing a positive, supportive relationship. The sessions include handouts, one with the content area covered that day and one applying a topic to their relationship with their child. The provider also videotapes playtime between parent and child and alternates every other week with watching the video with the parent. When the parent and provider watch the video of the previous session, they reflect about what the needs are of both the parent and the child. The provider helps the parent develop greater empathy and understanding of the child's needs and feelings, and helps the parent identify her own feelings and needs around parenting.</description>

    <description>This condition will consist of 1) Resource and Referral Personal Assistance provided over the phone, and 2) Local Services Resource Packet. The participant in this arm of the intervention trial will receive a phone call from a Resource and Referral Specialist hired by the project. The service will consist of a needs assessment to identify the particular needs or concerns of the family (such as housing needs, mental health, tangible goods). If a need is identified, the Referral and Referral Specialist will provide the family with local information regarding the stated need (such as a phone number to a housing assistance program, location of local food bank). In addition, families in this condition will have the Research and Referral Specialist's phone number they can call if an additional need arises. The resource packet will include information organized by type of need or resource. These packets will be updated regularly as services change over time.</description>
