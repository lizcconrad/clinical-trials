  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  One way to treat certain cancers of the blood and immune system is to give a patient
           stem cells from the bone marrow of a donor whose genes are very similar but not
           identical to the patient s. One problem with these transplants is that the new immune
           cells may not work as well in the recipient as they did in the donor. The result may be
           that the immune system will not work as well. This can increase the risk of severe
           infections and other complications.

        -  Researchers are studying the use of drugs that lower hormone levels and may allow the
           immune system to recover in a way that improves white blood cell function. In this study
           they will be looking at the drug lupron, a drug that lowers estrogen or testosterone
           levels, to see if it might improve the function of the newly transplanted cells.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether lupron improves immune system function after bone marrow
           transplantation from a donor with similarities in their immune cells (matched to each
           other).

        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of a nuclear medicine test with a radiotracer drug FLT in
           imaging studies. FLT will be used to image the immune system function in patients who
           have received bone marrow from the donor.

      Eligibility:

        -  People between 15 (or as young as 9 in those who have gone through puberty) and 40 years
           of age. These patients must have acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia,
           or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. They must also be eligible for a bone marrow
           transplant.

        -  Genetically similar donors for the patients who are eligible for a transplant.

      Design:

        -  People taking part in the study will be screened with a physical examination, medical
           history, blood and urine tests, and imaging studies. Patients who are not in remission
           or who require a bone marrow donor search may receive chemotherapy first.

        -  Donors will provide bone marrow for transplant according to standard bone marrow
           transplant (BMT) procedures.

        -  All women and half of the men will receive regular lupron doses 2 weeks before BMT to
           suppress hormone function.

        -  All recipients will receive 4 days of radiation followed by 2-4 days of chemotherapy
           before the bone marrow transplant (depending on age). Recipients will also receive other
           drugs to prevent transplant rejection and other complications of transplantation.

        -  Recipients will be monitored in the hospital for 4 weeks after transplant with blood
           tests and other studies.

        -  Some recipients will have an imaging study with FLT during the protocol. These imaging
           studies will take place before the transplant, on days 5 and 28 after transplant, and at
           a later time to be determined by the study researchers.

        -  Following discharge, participants will be monitored closely for up to 6 months, with
           regular but less frequent followup visits for at least 5 years. Study-related
           medications, including vaccinations for the new immune system, will be provided by the
           National Institutes of Health during the hospital stay and after discharge.

      Background:

        -  Impaired lymphocyte immune reconstitution is associated with morbidity and mortality
           following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

        -  Data suggest that one of the limitations of immunity after HSCT is the lack of thymus
           recovery and proper B cell development.

        -  Androgen withdrawal has been shown to enhance T and B lymophopoiesis.

        -  Lupron is an approved, safe, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist/antagonist.

        -  Noninvasive imaging modalities to study immune reconstitution would be invaluable to
           predict optimal or impaired immune recovery permitting early institution of therapies.

        -  FLT is 3 -deoxy-3 18F-fluorothymidine, a radiolabeled thymidine analogue that
           illustrates dividing hematopoietic cells and may predict immune recovery after
           allogeneic HSCT.

        -  FLT has been used safely in patients who have received intensive chemotherapy.

      Objectives:

        -  Primary: To determine if Lupron improves B lymphocyte reconstitution after HSCT.

        -  Primary: To assess whether 18F FLT PET/CT could predict early engraftment/immune
           reconstitution in marrow and thymus after allogeneic HSCT.

        -  Primary: To assess safety of Lupron after 2nd HSCT evaluated in a separate arm.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients &gt; 9 years old and pubertal and/or &gt;15 year and less than or equal to 55 years,
           with aggressive leukemia (Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes
           (MDS) with high risk cytogenetics, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), CMML, certain CML)
           requiring HSCT will be enrolled at NCI.

        -  At University of Oklahoma, Age &gt; 17 years old and less than or equal to 55 years for
           recipient.

        -  Patients &gt; 4 and &lt; 24 years with the above diseases will be enrolled at Children s
           National Medical Center.

      Design:

        -  This is a prospective pilot study, the primary aims of which are: 1) to assess whether
           Lupron enhances lymphocyte recovery after HSCT and 2) whether FLT imaging can be used to
           predict engraftment/immune reconstitution, and 3) whether Lupron and FLT are tolerable
           for second HSCT.

        -  At NCI and Univ of Oklahoma, post-pubertal pediatric male patients (&lt;18 years) will be
           randomized to receive a 3 month (11.25 mg) injection and adult male patients will be
           randomized to receive 4-month preparation of Lupron (30 mg) or placebo two weeks before
           the preparative regimen for first BMT. Women and all individuals undergoing 2nd BMT will
           receive Lupron at these doses per age and be evaluated in the treated cohort. At
           Children s National Medical Center, the patients will not receive Lupron outside of the
           context of clinical care, and will receive myeloablative HSCT as per standard of care
           with FLT imaging for engraftment as the only primary endpoint.

        -  A target of 68 evaluable adult patients will be enrolled on this trial, which may
           necessitate up to 118 patients (118 donors) enrolled to reach this target at NCI and
           University of Oklahoma. A total of 10 pediatric patients will be enrolled at Children s
           National Medical Center for FLT imaging only. Sixteen of these patients will be enrolled
           to undergo second BMT.

        -  At NCI, adults greater than 18 years old both female and adult male patients undergoing
           2nd BMT will receive 4-month preparation of Lupron (30 mg) two weeks before the
           preparative regimen. All patients will undergo FLT imaging to evaluate whether this may
           predict HSCT response or failure (relapse). This will be a pilot arm of 16 patients
           total.

        -  The planned length of this trial is 7 years with interim analyses at day 100 and day
           365.

        -  Some of the patients are anticipated to be evaluated using FLT (to include only patients
           needed for the immunological primary endpoint, not increasing total patient numbers). 23
           adult NCI patients in total will undergo FLT PET/CT imaging on day -1, at day +5 or day
           +9, at 4 weeks, and at a future point to include evidence of GVHD relapse, or immune
           recovery. An estimated 50 patients (including subset of the 23 patients undergoing
           serial scanning) will be imaged approximately at 1 year for evaluation of thymus
           reconstitution. The total possible numbers will include no more than 118 patients to
           achieve the 68 evaluable adults for the immunological primary endpoint. However, all NCI
           patients will undergo a single 1 year FLT for evaluation of thymus reconstitution. 10
           pediatric patients at CNMC will undergo FLT PET/CT imaging on Day -1, day+9, and day +28
           (if possible). Initial images will be correlated with

      engraftment and other secondary endpoints.

      -Study endpoints to include: 1) safety of Lupron in the context of allogeneic BMT, 2)
      lymphocyte reconstitution after Lupron administration, 3) the incidence of acute and chronic
      GVHD and infectious complications, 4) remission rates after HSCT.
