    <textblock>
      Coronary angiography exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the routine use of large field of view during image acquisition for
      coronary angiography. Patients with indication of diagnostic coronary angiography will be
      randomized for the use of either large field of view during image acquisition or medium field
      of view. Patients, physician and nurse radiation exposure will be measured by digital
      dosimeter.
