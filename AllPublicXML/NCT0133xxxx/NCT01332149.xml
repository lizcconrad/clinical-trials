  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregabalin has proven effective in previous clinical trails in other countries in relieving
      neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy.

      This study is being conducted according to China registration requirement to submit a
      reapplication with new local diabetic peripheral neuropathy study as a commitment plus the
      existing data to apply for Lyrica &quot;pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia&quot; indication
      after Lyrica &quot;pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia&quot; is approved.

    <description>The daily pain rating scale (DPRS) consists of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10.

    <description>The DPRS consists of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) Score at Weeks 1, 5, and 9</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 5, and 9</time_frame>
    <description>SF-MPQ was assessed according to the participant's answer to the SF-MPQ questionnaire. The score for each composite scale (sensory, affective, and total) was derived by summing the reported intensity value for each item within a particular scale where None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The sensory score was the sum of the scores of the first 11 pain descriptors (throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot-burning, aching, heavy, tender, and splitting) and could range from 0-33. The affective score was the sum of the scores of the last 4 pain descriptors (tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel) and could range from 0-12. The total score was the sum of the scores of all 15 pain descriptors and could range from 0 to 45. Higher scores indicated greater pain.</description>

However, 3 participants discontinued right after randomization without any treatment information. As such, the actual number of participants randomized and assigned to treatment was 623 as stated in the “Started” Row below.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weekly Mean Sleep Interference Score at Weeks 1 to 9</title>
        <description>Pain-related sleep interference was assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (did not interfere with sleep) to 10 (completely interfered [unable to sleep due to pain]). Participants were to describe how their pain had interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10. The weekly mean score was the sum of the daily scores divided by the number of diary entries during that week. The overall change is the average change from Weeks 1 to 9.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) Score at Weeks 1, 5, and 9</title>
        <description>SF-MPQ was assessed according to the participant’s answer to the SF-MPQ questionnaire. The score for each composite scale (sensory, affective, and total) was derived by summing the reported intensity value for each item within a particular scale where None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The sensory score was the sum of the scores of the first 11 pain descriptors (throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot-burning, aching, heavy, tender, and splitting) and could range from 0-33. The affective score was the sum of the scores of the last 4 pain descriptors (tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel) and could range from 0-12. The total score was the sum of the scores of all 15 pain descriptors and could range from 0 to 45. Higher scores indicated greater pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MOS-Sleep Scale, Sleep Disturbance Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The MOS-Sleep Scale was a participant-rated questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assessed key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yielded 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. The total score ranged from 0 to 100. For sleep disturbance, the subscale score also ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater sleep disturbance.</description>

Instrument scoring yielded 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. The total score ranged from 0 to 100. The MOS Sleep Quantity sub-scale scores ranged from 0 to 24 (number of hours slept).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HADS Depression Total Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The HADS was a self-administered questionnaire that consisted of 2 subscales, 1 measuring anxiety (HADS-A Scale) and the other measuring depression (HADS-D Scale). Each subscale was comprised of 7 items; participants assessed how each item applied to them on a scale of 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Subscores from HADS-A (Anxiety) and HADS-D (Depression) were not to be combined. The interpretation of each HADS subscales was as follows: 0-7 normal, 8-10 mild, 11-14 moderate and 15-21 severe.</description>
