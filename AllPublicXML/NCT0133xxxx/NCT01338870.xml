    <textblock>
      B2611003 is designed to study how safe and effective an investigational medication
      (PF-04991532) is in people with Type 2 diabetes. Subjects in the study will receive 1 of 6
      treatments for 3 months. One of the treatments will be sitagliptin which is an approved drug,
      and another treatment will be placebo, which does not contain active ingredient.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test is between 4 percent (%) and 5.6%. HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 12</title>
        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test is between 4 percent (%) and 5.6%. HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.</description>

        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test is between 4% and 5.6%. HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.</description>

          <description>Overweight or obesity increases the risk for developing diabetes. The treatment of diabetes has been the recommendation to lose weight. As weight loss progresses and is maintained, an improvement of glycemia may be evidenced by a reduction in HbA1c.</description>
