  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the possible effect of dexamethasone on prevention of cognitive
      dysfunction in the postoperative period of elderly patients undergoing to surgery under
      general anesthesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is related with the use of opioids in the postoperative
      period, lack of physical activity, fatigue, postoperative pain and quality of life. The use
      of corticosteroids preoperatively reduces postoperative pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting in
      the postoperative period and is frequently used as an adjuvant in anesthesia. This study aims
      to evaluate the possible effect of dexamethasone on prevention of cognitive dysfunction in
      the postoperative period of elderly patients undergoing to surgery under general anesthesia.
