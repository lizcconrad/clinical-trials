    <textblock>
      Shoulder rotator cuff (RC) tears are a significant cause of pain and disability. Surgery is
      done to reconnect the torn RC tendon(s) to the bone. The goals of RC surgery are to decrease
      pain, and to increase range of motion (ROM) and strength. This is done arthroscopically;
      through a small incision in the patient's shoulder. After surgery, patients are usually
      placed in a sling for up to 6 weeks to protect the repaired shoulder tendons. During this
      time, ROM exercises are only done by using the un-operated arm for assistance. Voluntary or
      active shoulder movement is usually not permitted to allow the repaired tendons to heal.
      Unfortunately, some patients develop shoulder stiffness while wearing the sling, which can
      delay rehabilitation. Any delays in rehabilitation may result in reduced shoulder function, a
      slower return-to-work or daily activities, and may also impact the health care system,
      through increased use and cost of rehabilitation.

      This study's purpose is to determine if patients can safely stop wearing their sling as early
      as pain and comfort allow following RC surgery. A total of 200 patients (100 per group) will
      be randomly assigned to one of two study groups:

      Patients in Group A (accelerated rehab) will wear their sling for comfort only following
      surgery. Self-assisted ROM exercises are allowed at any time. This means that patients may
      stop wearing their sling if pain and comfort allow, and start active movement for activities
      of daily living only.

      Patients in Group B (standard rehab) will wear their sling for 6 weeks. Like in group A,
      self-assisted ROM exercises are allowed at any time, but active movement will not be allowed
      until 6 weeks after surgery. Patients in both groups will be given the same self-assisted ROM
      exercises after surgery.

      Patients who agree to participate in the study will see their surgeon and the study physical
      therapist/research coordinator on 6 occasions (pre-surgery, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 months
      post-surgery). Each visit will take about 30 minutes and will include a ROM assessment,
      strength assessment (as appropriate) and disease-specific quality of life questionnaires.
      Patients will also undergo an Ultrasound exam to verify that their RC repair is intact at
      12-months. Differences in ROM, strength, questionnaire scores, RC integrity, and adverse
      events will be examined between the two groups. Differences will also be examined according
      to RC tear size and patient characteristics.
