    <textblock>
      In clinical practice language impairment is frequently reported in association with nocturnal
      epileptiform activity. There is a spectrum of epileptic conditions that are characterized by
      nocturnal epileptiform activity. From mild to severe this spectrum involves: Rolandic
      epilepsy (RE), nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE), Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) and
      electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep (ESES). The exact characteristic of the
      relationship between nocturnal epileptiform activity and language impairment is yet to be
      explored. The investigators suggest that nocturnal epileptiform EEG discharges and nocturnal
      epileptic seizures during development will cause diseased neuronal networks that involve
      language. The diseased neuronal networks are less efficient compared with normal neuronal
      networks.

      Objective: Identification of a diseased neuronal network characteristic in children with
      nocturnal epileptiform activity, which can explain language impairment in these children. For
      this the investigators will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyse brain
      activity and diffusion weighted MRI to investigate white matter connectivity.

    <description>Morphological, anatomical or functional correlate that can explain the comorbidity of language problems in childhood epilepsy. In Rolandic epilepsy, e.g., the epileptic focus is in the brain motor strip, and from classical anatomy no connection is known from the motor strip to the language areas. Think of deviations in the brain such as cortical thinning in both regions or aberrant functional or anatomical networks linking both regions.</description>
