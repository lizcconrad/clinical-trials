  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive clinical research aiming:

        -  To describe the clinical spectrum and clinical characteristics of community acquired
           pneumonia (CAP) in patients admitted to hospital

        -  To identify the etiology of CAP and the antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated organisms

        -  To identify the risk factors that influence the severity of CAP
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Vietnam, the range and relative contribution of organisms causing CAP remain unclear,
      largely because diagnostic tools are limited and clinical research uncommon. An improved
      understanding of the risk factors, etiology and clinical outcomes of CAP in Vietnam would
      contribute to improved approaches to patient diagnosis and clinical management. This will be
      achieved by following the clinical and laboratory progress and treatment outcomes of
      in-patients diagnosed with CAP from admission to discharge. Comparative analyses will be
      between subgroups including survivor and non-survivor, severe CAP and non-severe CAP, known
      etiology and unknown etiology, SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and shock septic.
