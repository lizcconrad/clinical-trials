  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe how the inflammatory pathways differ in subjects with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in adult male and female subjects with COPD to collect blood,
      endobronchial tissues and BAL to investigate the inflammatory genes/pathways associated with
      AECOPD at the time of exacerbation (ie, active disease) and at 6 weeks later (ie, stable
      disease).
