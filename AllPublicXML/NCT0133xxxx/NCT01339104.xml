    <description>All subjects will receive regorafenib administered from Day 1 -21 at a dose of 160 mg od (4 x 40 mg tablets) followed by a 7 days break in repeating cycles of 28 days. The drug is to be taken in the morning with approximately 240 mL of water after having a low fat breakfast. Holter ECGs with triplicate measurements will automatically be obtained at specified timepoints over 24 hours on days -1 and Cycle 1, Day 21. PK samples will be drawn on Cycle 1, Day 21. PK timepoints are time-matched with Holter ECG timepoints. 24 hour urine will be collected beginning on Cycle 1, Day 21. MUGA scans will be done at screening, Cycle 2 Day 21 (after 42 doses of BAY73-4506), then every 3 cycles starting in Cycle 5, and at end of treatment.</description>
