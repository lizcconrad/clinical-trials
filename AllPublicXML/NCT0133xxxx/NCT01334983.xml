      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a gentle physical conditioning program
      comprised of isotonic resistive strengthening and pedometer-directed walking can improve the
      physical functioning and fatigue of patients with late stage lung or colon cancer.

      A. SPECIFIC AIMS

      The results of this prospective pilot cohort study will be used to power and inform the
      design of a randomized controlled trial. Its specific aims are:

        1. To characterize the receptivity of patients with late stage lung or colon cancer to
           perform an individualized fitness program to prevent deconditioning and functional
           decline.

        2. To estimate the adherence of patients with LSC (LSC) to an individualized fitness
           program.

      4. To estimate the degree to which symptoms, e.g. fatigue and pain, associate with adherence
      to an individualized fitness program.

      5. To estimate improvements in functional status associated with performance of an
      individualized fitness program among patients with LSC.

      B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Most people with LSC function poorly at diagnosis, deteriorate
      steadily over a period of months to years, and become dependent prior to death. Their
      disablement exacts staggering costs in quality of life (QoL), caregiver burden, and health
      care expenses. Oncologic clinicians, as a result of their training and focus on the treatment
      of cancer, often neither systematically detect nor treat the function and symptom problems
      that cause disablement. As a consequence rehabilitation therapies, even those with well
      documented evidence of benefit, tend to be under-utilized and provided too late to be
      maximally effective. The public health burden of this issue is likely to only worsen given
      the improving survival of patients with LSC and the increasing age and medical complexity of
      those being treated.

      C. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Design A randomized controlled trial. Duration Following
      enrollment, study participants will remain on the study for 2.5 months after instruction in
      their individualized REST program. REST titration and tailoring for participant specific
      barriers will occur over the telephone for the 2 week &quot;initiation phase&quot; after initial REST
      instruction. Thereafter, patients will perform their REST independently at home during the 8
      week &quot;training phase&quot; with &quot;as needed&quot; telephone-based guidance from a PT. We therefore
      anticipate that the study will continue for a total of 6 months; 3 months to recruit 68
      patients and an additional 2.5 months for all participants to complete initiation and
      training phases of the protocol.

      Subject Enrollment Identification of participants. A sample of 68 patients with Stage III or
      IV NSCLC or Extensive stage SCLC, or Stage IV colon cancer will be identified.

      Dr. Cheville will contact eligible patients by telephone after they receive a mailing
      describing the study and permitting them to opt out by returning a postage-paid postcard. A
      'fold over' postcard will be sent so as to maintain the patient's privacy regarding lung or
      colon cancer diagnosis. Dr. Cheville's efforts to contact eligible patients will continue
      until 5 attempts have been made on different week days and times of day. Eligibility and
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed. If the patient is eligible, the study will
      be described in detail and verbal consent will be obtained from those desiring to
      participate. An informed consent form will be mailed to each patient willing to participate
      in the study to ensure that they have adequate opportunity to review the document. Informed
      consent will be obtained by Dr. Cheville when the patient comes to the Mayo Clinic for study
      enrollment. All questions will be answered prior obtaining informed consent.

      Eligibility. Eligible subjects must have a diagnosis of Stage III or IV NSCLC or extensive
      stage SCLC, or Stage IV colon cancer and be receiving a chemotherapeutic regimen that
      requires visits to the Mayo Clinic Department of Medical Oncology &lt; every 4 weeks for the
      first 6 weeks following enrollment or undergoing monitoring visits at comparable intervals.
      Pathological confirmation is not required if the oncology provider specializing in lung
      cancer has a high level of certainty regarding the diagnosis. Entry criteria will not
      consider number or location of metastases or prior treatment. The participants will be
      required to be fluent in the English language and have intact cognitive status (Folstein
      mini-mental score &gt; 25).

      Recruitment. Approximately 50 new lung cancer cases are diagnosed each month at the Mayo
      Clinic. Of these, about 70% are initially diagnosed with Stage III or Stage IV NSCLC or
      Extensive Stage SCLC and 60% elect to receive their cancer-related care at Mayo. Recruitment
      rates in our previous work in this population have been high. The proposed intervention
      entails greater patient commitment and we anticipate a recruitment rate of 50%. We will
      target patients meeting the study criteria who are undergoing ongoing treatment at the MCCC
      as well as those who are newly diagnosed. We anticipate a recruitment rate of 10 patients per
      month and that recruitment will continue for 3 months. We have not previously recruited
      patients with colon cancer, but anticipate recruitment of 10 patients per month based on the
      experience of other researchers.

      Randomization. Patients will be block randomized to the REST intervention or wait-list
      control. Stratified randomization will not be used.

      Intervention Overview. The intervention is provision of an individualized, 2-part, 3-tiered
      REST program which will include the exercises listed in Table 1 to all participants randomly
      assigned to the intervention arm. In addition, participants will receive a step pedometer and
      will be encouraged to remain as active as possible during the study period based on objective
      feedback from their pedometer readings. A PT specialized in cancer rehabilitation will
      instruct participants in REST and will adapt the program to accommodate for symptoms,
      co-morbidities, or other issues that may impede a participant's ability to perform the REST
      program. The PT will follow up with each participant by telephone at 1- and 2-weeks following
      REST instruction to encourage participants and to problem solve regarding any barriers which
      may be impeding their performance of REST. After the 2-week initiation phase, participants
      will perform REST independently during an 8 week training phase but will be encouraged to
      contact the PT with any questions or difficulty. Patient reported outcome (PROs) measures
      will be collected at baseline prior to REST instruction and after completion of the 2-month
      training phase, as outlined below.

      Baseline assessment and REST instruction. Patients will be examined and instructed in their
      REST programs on a day when they will be visiting the Mayo clinic either for treatment or
      evaluation. REST will not be feasible if it adds to patients' already significant travel
      demands. The PI will obtain a functional history and perform a routine physical examination
      on all patients to ensure that they may safely participate and to identify impairments or
      physical vulnerabilities that will require individualizing their REST program. A tailored
      REST fitness program will be developed for each patient by a PT specialized in cancer
      rehabilitation. Patients will be provided with upper and lower extremity REST routines (each
      requiring 7 minutes) designed to maintain core and appendicular strength with minimal burden.
      The REST lower extremity routine will include 6 exercises and will target the hip flexors,
      hip abductors, hip extensors, knee extensors, knee flexors, shoulder stabilizers, and back
      extensors. The REST upper extremity routine will include 5 exercises and will target the
      elbow extensors, elbow flexors, shoulder stabilizers, shoulder flexors, and abdominal
      muscles. Each routine can be performed at 1 of 3 intensity levels depending on how
      participants feel on a given day. Each of the routines is performed twice per week for a
      maximum total of 28 minutes of resistive strengthening per week. The standard REST lower
      extremity program is performed in a standing position; however the program can be adapted for
      seated performance. Note that the REST program can also be individualized to accommodate
      impairments such as degenerative arthritis, back pain and osseous instability.

      Subjects will also be dispensed a pedometer and encouraged to wear it daily for the first 2
      weeks of their study enrollment in order to establish an average baseline number of steps per
      day. Thereafter they will be instructed to wear the pedometer 3 times per week and to chart
      the number of steps taken between waking and retiring to bed and encouraged to 'make up' for
      days/weeks when fewer steps are taken due to increased symptom burden, post-chemotherapy
      fatigue, or other contingency.

      Subjects will be provided with laminated cards illustrating their REST program to encourage
      their adherence. They will also receive a ring bound monthly calendar with their REST program
      illustrated on the top and a calendar on the bottom with designated boxes for number of
      pedometer recorded steps per day and to indicate which (if any) tier of the REST program they
      completed on a given day. Calendars will be submitted for analysis at the end of the 2 month
      study period. Modified laminated cards and calendar pages will be provided if changes in
      their health status require alterations of their REST program.

      Initiation phase. Participants will be encouraged to perform their upper extremity and lower
      extremity REST programs twice per week. After the first week, they will follow up with the
      study PT by telephone to address any questions they may have and to address any difficulties
      with REST. The PT may adjust their REST program if it proves uncomfortable or overly
      fatiguing. Participants will continue to perform the REST program with any modifications for
      the second week after training. They will again follow up with the study PT by telephone at
      the end of the second week to address any issues. Dr. Cheville will serve as resource for the
      study PT during the initiation phase in case he/she has any questions regarding symptom
      control or the safety of REST.

      Training phase. Following the initiation phase the participants will continue to perform
      their REST programs 4 times per week (2 upper and 2 lower extremity) for 8 weeks. While no
      follow up telephone calls will be scheduled with the study PT, participants will be
      encouraged to contact the PT with any questions or difficulties. The PT will consult Dr.
      Cheville on an as needed basis.

      Data Collection Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Measures. Baseline PROs will be collected
      after subjects sign informed consent, following randomization and, for intervention group
      members, before the PTs instruct them in the REST exercises. Week 10 PROs will be mailed to
      the patients with a postage paid return envelope. Participants who do not respond in the
      first week will be sent a second mailing. Subjects will receive $25.00 compensation for
      completing each set of PROs, for a total of $50.00.

      Ambulatory Post Acute Care Basic Mobility and Daily Activity Short Forms FACIT-F Outcome
      Expectations for Exercise Self Efficacy for Exercise North Central Cancer Trials Group
      Patient Quality of Life-Linear Analogue Self Assessment (LASA) Scale. The LASA Scale is a
      single item measurement of global quality of life rating on a numerical rating scale from 0
      to 10 with well established validity data in cancer populations.38 Other Treatments.
      Oncological care will be not affected by this study: subjects will continue to make their
      routine clinic visits and receive oncological cares as usual. Analgesic medications will be
      permitted (and assessed), to adjust for co-intervention differences between groups in the
      analyses.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics will be calculated for participants' demographic
      and lung cancer-related characteristics, as well as their function- and symptom-related PROs.
      Descriptive statistics will also be calculated for the data collected by the study PT
      regarding the frequency of specific problems (e.g. shoulder pain with REST) encountered
      during the initiation phase, as well as the number of calls per participant during the
      training phase, time per call, and reasons for these calls.

      Data collected from patients' calendar records of REST adherence and steps per day will be
      described in terms of proportions and means, respectively. An arbitrary threshold of 75% will
      be used to distinguish participants who did and did not adhere to the recommended 4 sessions
      per week. Participants who did not perform their REST program 4 times per week for at least 6
      of the 8 weeks during the training phase will be considered non-adherent. Exploratory
      analyses of significant differences between participants that did and did not adhere will be
      performed with nonparametric testing.

      The normality of the PROs will be assessed by testing of skew and kurtosis. Nonparametric
      statistical tests will be used to evaluate PROs that are not normally distributed. Student's
      paired T-test will be used to estimate the effect of the intervention on primary and
      secondary outcomes. Additionally, the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the
      degree of change in these scores between patients randomized to the intervention group who
      did and did not comply with REST. The magnitude and directions of the relationships between
      change in mean steps per day during the training interval (calculated as mean from week 10
      minus mean from baseline) and changes in PRO scores will be assessed with Pearson correlation
      coefficients. Given the pilot nature of this work, adjustments will not be made for multiple
      comparisons.
