  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a common, costly condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
      Diabetes self-management education, the process of teaching individuals to manage their
      diabetes, has been considered an important part. The intensive education has the capacity to
      deliver effective interventions to a large number of people. The investigators may be able to
      redirect our efforts to diabetes care and education strategies that will have a positive
      impact on the optimization of glycemic control and the prevention of long-term complications
      of diabetes, reducing the subsequent human and health care costs.

      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical study. 1500 subjects with
      Type 2 DM will be enrolled and be randomized into Structured Education Group and Conventional
      Education Group in 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both of the groups will be treated with Scilin®M30
      twice daily (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner). All the previous oral antidiabetic
      drugs (OAD(s)) will be discontinued except metformin and alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors. The
      physician will determine the starting dose (0.3 IU/kg～0.4IU/kg), as well as later changes to
      dose according to insulin titration algorithm. The treatment duration will last 16 weeks.
