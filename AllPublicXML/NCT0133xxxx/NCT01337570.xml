  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy as determined by the proportion of women in each arm HIV-1 seroconversion rate per person-years of product use, measured at the end of the investigational product use period.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is HIV-1 seroconversion measured by rapid and specialized laboratory tests according to a comprehensive HIV testing algorithm. This algorithm employs a series of high specificity and high sensitivity immunoassay-based HIV blood tests that minimize the chance of false positive results to determine if a subject is positive for HIV. Endpoint confirmation of HIV infection is by Western blot.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety as determined by grade 3 and 4 AE's, clinically significant grade 2 laboratory findings (based on DAIDS grading) and all serious AE's.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by self-reports, physical examination, safety laboratory tests and other specialised investigations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the protocol-specific product regimen as determined by self-reported diary cards and questionnaires.</measure>
