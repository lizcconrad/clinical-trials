    <measure>Mean Score of the Caregivers' Rating of Neupro® Compared to Oral Anti-Parkinson Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire completed at a single time-point during the run of the cross-sectional study (16 months). Suitable patients suffer from idiopathic iPD treated with a combination of l-dopa or another oral iPD drug and Neupro® for at least one month.</time_frame>
    <description>The caregivers were asked to fill out a questionnaire composed of 7 questions covering caregiving aspects. The mean score is calculated from the scores for the single responses which are rated from 'great disadvantages' to 'great advantages' and scored on a 5-point scale from -2 to +2.
Each caregiver could have assessed one or multiple participants. The scores from each caregiver were averaged over all participants they assessed, and the final mean score was calculated from the averaged assessments of the caregivers.</description>
