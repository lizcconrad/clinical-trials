    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational cohort study with 3-month follow-up among a cohort
      of intranasal steroid (INS) -experienced patients newly starting fluticasone furorate nasal
      spray (FFNS). The primary aim is to examine the effect of FFNS on the use and associated cost
      of concomitant allergic rhinitis medications in INS-experienced patients starting treatment
      with FFNS who have a history of prior concomitant medication use. The secondary aim will be
      to determine the effect of FFNS on control of allergic rhinitis, as assessed by the Rhinitis
      Control Assessment Test (RCAT).

      Adult patients filling a new FFNS prescription will be recruited (within 4 days of starting
      their FFNS) across 50 branches of a retail pharmacy chain with co-located convenient care
      clinics. Approximately 350 patients who have active seasonal rhinitis and have used an INS
      other than FFNS and another prescription or over-the-counter allergy medication in the
      previous allergy season will be eligible for the study. A baseline questionnaire will be
      administered to collect information on patient demographics, a brief medical history of the
      patient's rhinitis, prior use of INS and other prescription and over-the-counter medications
      taken for allergic rhinitis, total out of pocket costs for the prior allergy season, number
      of office visits due to allergic rhinitis, and level of control of symptoms of allergic
      rhinitis.

      At 1, 2, and 3 months post-enrollment, a follow-up questionnaire will be administered to
      collect information on medications taken for allergic rhinitis, office visits due to
      rhinitis, and level of control of symptoms of allergic rhinitis. In addition, pharmacy claims
      data will be abstracted for patients 1 year prior to enrollment and 4 months after enrollment
      to verify and supplement patient reported data as needed.

      The primary outcomes will be rate of use of non-INS concomitant medications (frequency and
      duration) at baseline, and 1, 2, and 3 months follow-up and change in rate of use of non-INS
      concomitant medications (post vs. pre and from baseline to 3 months follow-up). Secondary
      outcomes will be change in total allergic rhinitis pharmacy expenditures (post vs. pre and
      from baseline to follow-up) and change in the level of control of allergic rhinitis, as
      measured by score on the Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT), from baseline to follow-up.

        Adult patients filling a new fluticasone furorate nasal spray (FFNS) prescription will be
        recruited across 50 branches of a retail pharmacy chain with co-located convenient care
        clinic located throughout the United States. Approximately 350 patients who have active
        seasonal rhinitis and have used an intra-nasal steroid (INS) other than FFNS and another
        prescription or over-the-counter allergy medication in the previous allergy season will be
        enrolled in the study.
