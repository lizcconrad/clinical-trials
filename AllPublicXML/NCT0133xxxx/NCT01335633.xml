      The study will entail cognitive assessment of a single cohort of patients with Multiple
      Sclerosis. Each subject will be assessed twice, approximately 45 days apart. There will be no
      intervention or control group. Each participant will have a caregiver capable of responding
      to a brief report of observations regarding neuropsychological skills and abilities in the
      patient.
