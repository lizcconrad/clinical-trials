  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective claims database study was to compare the change in
      migraine-related prescription (i.e. NSAIDs, Opioids, Ergots) utilization among migraine
      suffers following initiation of Treximet ™ (sumatriptan/naproxen) compared with subjects
      initiating treatment with other orally available triptans. The study was used to validate the
      migraine-related prescription utilization patterns predicted by the Treximet ™ Budget Impact
      Model.

      The SourceLx dataset from the family of Wolters Kluwer databases was used for this analysis.
      The database contains 30% of prescription claims filled in the United States (US),
      approximately 160 million patient lives. The data has broad representative coverage at both
      the geographic and payment levels.

    <measure>Mean Number of Triptan Tablets Per Participant in 6-month Follow-up Period: Treatment-naïve Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months from the index date (from January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2009; the index date was defined as the first date of oral triptan/sumatriptan-naproxen sodium prescription)</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of tablets per participant was computed using prescription fills dispensed in the 6-month follow-up period. &quot;Other&quot; represents acetaminophen (APAP)/isometheptene/dichlorphenazone and APAP/isometheptene/caffeine, for example. The number of tablets dispensed was obtained from the &quot;quantity dispensed field&quot; in the claims data. Triptan tablets were classified as index and non-index medication (if a different oral triptan was filled from that of the index medication); only oral triptans were considered (i.e., excluded injectable triptans).</description>

    <description>Health plan cost was defined as the pharmacy costs.

        <title>Mean Number of Triptan Tablets Per Participant in 6-month Follow-up Period: Treatment-naïve Analysis</title>
        <description>The mean number of tablets per participant was computed using prescription fills dispensed in the 6-month follow-up period. &quot;Other&quot; represents acetaminophen (APAP)/isometheptene/dichlorphenazone and APAP/isometheptene/caffeine, for example. The number of tablets dispensed was obtained from the &quot;quantity dispensed field&quot; in the claims data. Triptan tablets were classified as index and non-index medication (if a different oral triptan was filled from that of the index medication); only oral triptans were considered (i.e., excluded injectable triptans).</description>
        <time_frame>6-months from the index date (from January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2009; the index date was defined as the first date of oral triptan/sumatriptan-naproxen sodium prescription)</time_frame>
        <population>The SourceLx dataset from the family of Wolters Kluwer databases was used for this study. The database contains 30% of prescription claims filled in the United States, corresponding to approximately 160 million lives.</population>

        <title>Mean Total Cost (Health Plan Plus Participant Copay Costs) Per Participant for Migraine-related Medications in 6-month Follow-up Period: Treatment-naïve Analysis</title>
        <description>Mean Total Cost was defined as the pharmacy cost plus the participant copay. Pharmacy costs were computed corresponding to the use of triptans, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and other migraine therapy tablets (ergots and others). Pharmacy cost plus participant copay was calculated as the mean of the total costs (pharmacy cost plus participant copay) of the five drug categories.</description>

The number of tablets dispensed was obtained from the &quot;quantity dispensed field&quot; in the claims data. Triptan tablets were classified as index and non-index medication (if a different oral triptan was filled from that of the index medication); only oral triptans were considered (i.e., excluded injectable triptans).</description>

            <title>Switch - Oral Triptan</title>
            <description>Participants having at least one pharmacy claim for sumatriptan/naproxen sodium or an orally administered triptan during January 1, 2007 to November 30, 2009 (study period) was selected as the target population. The index date was defined as the date of first switch to sumatriptan/naproxen sodium or an oral triptan prescription during the enrollment period (January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2009). Participants belonged to this arm if they received oral triptan as their first triptan medication and then switched to a different oral triptan in the enrollment period. Sumatriptan/naproxen sodium users were matched to oral triptan users on propensity scores based on baseline characteristics.</description>

          <title>Mean Total Cost (Health Plan Plus Participant Copay Costs) Per Participant for Migraine-related Medications in 6-month Follow-up Period: Treatment-switch Analysis</title>
          <description>Mean Total Cost was defined as the pharmacy cost plus the participant copay. Pharmacy costs were computed corresponding to the use of triptans, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and other migraine therapy tablets (ergots and others). .Pharmacy cost plus participant copay was calculated as the mean of the total costs (pharmacy cost plus participant copay) of the five drug categories.</description>
