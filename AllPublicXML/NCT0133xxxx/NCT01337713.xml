  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an impressive and growing body of data suggesting that massage therapy is effective
      in decreasing some symptoms of pathological conditions as well as facilitating growth,
      reducing pain, increasing alertness, diminishing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and
      enhancing immune function. Preliminary studies suggest that massage therapy decreases
      symptoms of anxiety and depression, and lowers salivary cortisol levels in a wide array of
      childhood and adult neuropsychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder,
      attention-deficit-disorder hyperactivity, depression, bulimia and anorexia-nervosa.
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by the presence of a constellation of
      signs and symptoms for at least 6 months in duration, with some type of functional disability
      or decrease in quality of life. The signs and symptoms of GAD include a myriad of somatic
      symptoms including muscle tension, headaches, backaches, fatigue, restlessness, insomnia, as
      well as psychological feelings of worry, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed. Both
      pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are effective in decreasing the signs and symptoms of GAD.
      Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients with GAD never receive adequate pharmacotherapy
      or psychotherapy. Therefore, the development of a complementary and alternative therapy that
      has demonstrated efficacy for GAD might be well received by patients.

      This study's goals are to investigate the efficacy of Swedish massage therapy vs. light touch
      therapy and better understand the biological effects of massage in patients with anxiety.
      Qualified participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups in which they will
      receive Swedish massage therapy twice per week for 12 weeks or Light Touch therapy twice per
      week for 6 weeks followed by Swedish massage therapy twice per week for the next 6 weeks. The
      total length of the study is 13 weeks, which includes a screening visit that takes about 3
      hours and two therapy visits per week for 12 weeks that last about 1 hour each. Blood and
      urine will be collected at three of the visits. Compensation is up to $400 for completing the
      entire study.
