  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin
      superfamily of receptors that is specifically expressed on the surfaces of monocytes and
      neutrophils.TREM-1 expression is increased in infectious diseases and is associated with the
      release of soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1).There has been demonstrated that the value of plasma
      sTREM-1 levels as an indicator of sepsis was superior, although other studies reported that
      the value of sTREM-1 for diagnosing sepsis was inferior.An increasing number of studies
      indicate that there are increased levels of sTREM-1 in body fluid samples for the following
      diseases and conditions: sepsis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, septic arthritis, meningitis,
      peritonitis, and uterine cavity infection.

      Inflammation is now believed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of AKI. It is
      hypothesized that the initial insult results in morphological and/or functional changes in
      vascular endothelial cells and/or in tubular epithelium in sepsis models. Then, leukocytes
      including neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, and lymphocytes infiltrate into the
      injured kidneys and induce the generation of inflammatory mediators. Whether urine sTREM-1
      could also be detected and its significance in sepsis and AKI has not been reported yet.

      The present study focused on the value of serum &amp; urine sTREM-1 for sepsis identification,
      severity and prognosis assessments, and potential sepsis-related AKI. We also made
      comparisons between sTREM-1 and WBC counts, serum CRP, serum PCT, urine output,CC SCr, and
      BUN among sepsis patients.
