      The objective of this study is to confirm the safety and to establish the effectiveness of
      low voltage external beam radiosurgery using the IRay System for the treatment of subjects
      with recurrent leakage secondary to neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) as
      determined by decreasing the number of Lucentis injections required during the first 12
      months of the study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have neovascular AMD, have received at least 6 prior injections with
             Lucentis or Avastin and have exhibited one or more of the following:

               -  have persisting fluid despite 3 consecutive monthly injections of anti- VEGF, or

               -  received 4 prior injections over a 6 month period, or

               -  received 8 prior injections over a 12 month period.

          2. Subjects must now have the need for further anti-VEGF treatment due to increased fluid
             or persistent cysts on OCT, or leakage on FA.

          3. Subjects must have a total lesion size of ≤12 disc areas and a CNV lesion with the
             greatest linear dimension of ≤6 mm, but not greater than 3 mm from the center of the
             fovea to the furthest point on lesion perimeter.

          4. Subjects must have signed (and been given) a copy of the informed consent form, and be
             willing and able to return for scheduled treatment and follow-up examinations for the
             3-year duration of the study.

          5. Subjects must be at least 50 years of age.

          6. Women must be post-menopausal ≥1 year or surgically sterilized, or a pregnancy screen
             must be performed prior to the study and a reliable form of contraception approved by
             the investigator must be maintained during the study.

          7. Subjects must have best corrected visual acuity of 75 to 25 letters in the study eye
             and at least 20 letters in the fellow eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CNV due to causes other than AMD, including ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid
             streaks, multifocal choroiditis, choroidal rupture, or pathologic myopia (spherical
             equivalent ≥-8 diopters).

          2. A globe axial length of &lt;20 mm or &gt;26 mm.

          3. Evidence of uncontrolled diabetes as determined by an HbA1c of &gt;6.5% and/or with
             retinal findings consistent with diabetic retinopathy.

          4. Prior or concurrent therapies for age related macular degeneration including
             submacular surgery, subfoveal thermal laser photocoagulation (with or without
             photographic evidence), transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT), or ocular photodynamic
             therapy in the study eye.

          5. History of radiation to the head in the region of the study eye.
