  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A critical aspect of real-world functioning following kidney transplantation involves how
      adherent individuals are to their medication regimens. Regardless of the possible dangers of
      failing to adhere to anti-rejection medications, such as increased graft rejection, studies
      have reported rates of non-adherence at almost 50% following renal transplant.

      The Cognitive Aging Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Wendy Thornton, at Simon Fraser
      University, has previously identified relationships between several potentially important
      cognitive and psychosocial variables, and self-reported medication adherence in renal
      transplant recipients, including depressive symptoms, as well as everyday and traditional
      cognitive functioning [4]. The possibility that changes in dosing regimens for a given
      medication may have an additional impact on medication adherence presents an important issue
      worth further exploration.

      The current study will allow for more thorough delineation of the roles of psychosocial and
      cognitive predictors of adherence with state-of-the-art monitoring techniques. In addition,
      the investigators will assess whether different dosing formulations of tacrolimus impact
      adherence behaviors in renal transplant recipients.

      The proposed research has two primary aims to examine:

        1. To examine the role of cognitive and psychosocial variables in predicting medication
           adherence in renal transplant recipients.

        2. To examine whether different formulations of tacrolimus (once per day dosing versus
           twice per day dosing) will impact medication adherence in renal transplant recipients.
