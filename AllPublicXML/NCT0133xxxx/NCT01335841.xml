    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate an optimization of the establishment of
      orthopedic implants in surgery of the spine and pelvic ring by combining 3D fluoroscopy and
      navigation system versus conventional method involving anatomical landmarks and 2D
      fluoroscopy.

    <description>After randomization, patients will be operated with the conventional method either with navigation station. In the conventional method, the orthopedic surgeon based on anatomical criteria to establish its implants. It uses an image intensifier in 2D mode to monitor the implementation of the implants. In computer assisted surgery, the surgeon uses a navigation station that allows real-time flow instruments to guide its implementation of the implants. It uses an image intensifier in 3D mode on the one hand to achieve a first series of image that will be used for navigation and also to monitor the implementation of the implants.</description>
