  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to test the effectiveness of recovery management checkups for
      women offenders (RMC-WO) released from jail to provide continuity of care immediately upon
      release and to help them manage their long-term recovery. The hypotheses in the first phase
      were: 1)women assigned to RMC (versus control) will a) return to treatment sooner after the
      initial release from jail and b) be more likely to receive treatment in the 90 days after
      release from jail; 2)women who received treatment in the first 90 days post release (vs. no
      treatment) will be more likely to sustain their abstinence through 90 days post release from
      a) any alcohol or drugs, b) alcohol, c) cannabis, d) cocaine, and e) opiates; 3)women who
      maintained their abstinence from any alcohol and other drugs through the first 90 days post
      release (vs. any relapse) will be less likely to have a) unprotected sex, b) commit any other
      illegal activity, and d) be re-incarcerated in jail or prison. In the second phase repeated
      exposure to these efforts on a quarterly basis is expected to further strengthen each of
      these effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The components of the recovery management checkups will include: on-going monitoring via a
      re-entry meeting, two monthly meetings and quarterly assessments for 3 years, personalized
      feedback on substance use and high risk behaviors, linkage to community-based substance abuse
      treatment (when needed), on-site HIV booster sessions (when needed), and treatment engagement
      and retention support. Motivational interviewing will provide the therapeutic approach to
      transition women from one step of the change process to another. Combined, these components
      and therapeutic milieu afford an opportunity for immediate linkage to community-based
      treatment and HIV prevention as well as ongoing monitoring for relapse and early
      re-intervention for both substance use and HIV risk behaviors (both public health
      priorities).

    <description>Women assigned to the RMC condition met with a linkage manager after each research interview. When a woman reported substance use, HIV risk behavior or illegal activity, the linkage manager used motivational interviewing to: provide feedback regarding her current substance use, HIV risk behavior or illegal activity, discuss barriers that prevented her from stopping each activity and ways of avoiding them in the future, and assess and discuss her level of motivation for change. Linkage managers also scheduled treatment appointments, accompanied the women to treatment intake and stayed through the process and implemented an Engagement and Retention Protocol designed to improve retention rates. For women who refused the treatment option, the linkage manager and participant agreed upon an Alternative Action plan, which included various behaviors the woman had agreed to engage in to reduce or stop her substance use, HIV risk, or her participation in illegal activity.</description>
