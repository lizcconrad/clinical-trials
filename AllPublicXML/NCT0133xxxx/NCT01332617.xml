      The purpose of this study test the hypothesis that the combination of simvastatin and
      zoledronic acid (for reversal of drug resistance), with bortezomib, high-dose
      methylprednisolone and bendamustine on a day 1,8 schedule (to reduce toxicity) will be an
      effective and well-tolerated treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) (complete response (CR) + very good
      partial response (VGPR) + partial response (PR)) of patients with multiple myeloma who have
      relapsed or are refractory after bortezomib treatment and will now receive a combination
      therapy of simvastatin, zoledronic acid, bortezomib, bendamustine and methylprednisolone.

      To evaluate safety and tolerability of studied therapy.

      Secondary

        1. To estimate the progression-free Survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), overall
           survival (OS) and duration of response (DOR).

        2. To describe toxicities (frequency and severity) during the treatment. 3 To estimate
           clinical benefit response (CBR) (ORR + minor response (MR)) and stable disease (SD).

      4 Explore factors associated with ORR, PFS, OS, toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma (using the International Myeloma
             Working Group Guidelines)

          -  Patients must have failed at least one prior treatment regimen containing bortezomib.

        They may be refractory to primary therapy or relapsed and have measurable or assessable
        disease. (Refractory disease is defined as anything less than PR or progression within 60
        days of completing therapy.)

          -  Patients with Multiple Myeloma must have measurable active, progressive or symptomatic
             disease. Measurable disease may be paraprotein or free light chains in serum or urine,
