      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of autologous T-antigen-presenting
      cells (T-APC) vaccine following therapeutic autologous lymphocytes (CTL) and cyclophosphamide
      in treating patients with metastatic melanoma. Aldesleukin may stimulate lymphocytes, such as
      CTL, to kill melanoma cells. Treating lymphocytes with aldesleukin in the laboratory may help
      the lymphocytes kill more tumor cells when they are put back in the body. Vaccines made from
      melanoma antigen may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells and
      may boost the effect of the CTL. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving T-APC vaccine after CTL and cyclophosphamide may be an
      effective treatment for melanoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of T-APC vaccination following adoptive T cell therapy.

      II. Evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred
      cytotoxic t lymphocytes (CTL) followed by T-APC vaccination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the antitumor effect of adoptive T cell therapy followed by T-APC vaccination.

      OUTLINE : This is a dose-escalation study of T-APC vaccine.

      INFUSION I: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and -3
      and low-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 0-14. Patients
      also receive CTL IV on day 0.

      INFUSION II: Beginning 6-48 hours later, patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide,
      low-dose IL-2, and CTL as in Infusion I. Patients also receive T-APC vaccine IV within 18-36
      hours following CTL infusion and in week 4, and IL-2 SC BID on days 0-14 following second
      T-APC vaccination.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks.
