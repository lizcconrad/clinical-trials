    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer have poor prognosis and majority of patients resistant to 5-FU/DDP based
      first-line chemotherapy in China. There was no recommended second-line chemotherapy for
      advanced gastric cancer. Taxane is promising in gastric cancer. Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound
      Paclitaxel (Abraxane，ABI-007) has good convenience to use and been approved in breast cancer
      in many countries. The investigator then initiated a prospective phase Ib/IIa clinical trial
      with nab-paclitaxel plus TS-1 as the second-line treatment in advanced gastric cancer to
      observe the safety and efficacy.

      This study is a two-stage design. Stage 1

      The investigator should evaluate two recommend dose and tolerability of nab-paclitaxel plus
      S-1 after one course of treatment as 3+1 design:

      nab-paclitaxel should be given intravenously on days 1 and 8 at a dose as follows, Treatment
      should be repeated every 3 weeks: Treatment arm A：125 mg /m2; Treatment arm B：100 mg /m2;
      Treatment arm C: 80 mg /m2; S-1 should be given orally twice a day as follows for 14
      consecutive days, followed by a 1-week rest. Treatment should be repeated every 3 weeks. BSA
      ＜ 1.5 m2，40mg，bid;BSA ≥ 1.5 m2，50mg，bid.

      The investigator should determine whether to continue the original regimen; compare the
      safety and pharmacokinetic results with original profile of combination therapy to select the
      best therapy programs (RD, recommended dose).

      Stage 2 According to two-stage design (Simon,1989), re-entry subjects to the recommended dose
      group to a total of 25 valid cases. If 11 patients achieve response, then enter the second
      phase of total 66 patients.
