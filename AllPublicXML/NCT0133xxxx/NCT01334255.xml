  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LT1009-Oph-002 is a Phase 1b study designed to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of
      iSONEP following one, two or three injections of iSONEP, as needed, for the treatment of
      Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED) secondary to PED Secondary to Exudative Age-Related
      Macular Degeneration (AMD) or Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen (16) subjects per dose group who have received a minimum of 3 and no more than 7
      doses of an anti-VEGF agent (i.e., Lucentis or Avastin), and whose PED has not decreased by
      greater than 25% in height despite therapy, will be enrolled for a total of 32 subjects. The
      presence of PED diagnosed by the Investigator will be confirmed by SDOCT, ICG and FA by a
      digital imaging reading center prior to subject enrollment. The ability of iSONEP to induce
      regression of persistent PED in subjects with exudative AMD or PCV despite previous treatment
      with an anti-VEGF agent will be evaluated.
