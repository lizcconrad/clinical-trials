      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer cells in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer
      cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and
      prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or stopping them from dividing. Giving everolimus together with rituximab,
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone may kill
      more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of everolimus when
      given together with rituximab and combination chemotherapy in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus in combination with R-CHOP
           (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate and
           prednisone) chemotherapy.

        -  To assess the feasibility of everolimus in combination with standard R-CHOP chemotherapy
           in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the toxicities associated with everolimus in combination with R-CHOP
           chemotherapy.

        -  To further describe the toxicities associated with everolimus in combination with R-CHOP
           chemotherapy.

        -  To assess the rate of event-free survival (EFS) at 12 months for diffuse large B-cell
           lymphoma patients treated with everolimus in combination with R-CHOP chemotherapy.

        -  To evaluate overall response rate, complete response rate, duration of response, EFS,
           overall survival, and progression-free survival for patients treated with everolimus in
           combination with R-CHOP chemotherapy.

      Tertiary

        -  To profile gene expression using immunohistochemistry and categorize patients as
           germinal-center B-cell-like (GBC) vs activated B-cell-like (ABC) vs unclassified
           lymphoma subtype. (exploratory)

        -  To determine whether previously identified predictive markers in large cell lymphoma
           remain valid with the addition of everolimus to R-CHOP chemotherapy. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a feasability
      expanded-cohort study.

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-10 or 1-14; rituximab IV,
      cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-60 minutes, and vincristine sulfate
      IV on day 1; and prednisone PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor biopsies are collected for laboratory studies and patients may undergo blood and needle
      biopsy sample collection for correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.

    <description>Patients registered to the study will receive an assigned dose of everolimus by mouth and RCHOP for a maximum of six cycles. Each cycle is a total of 21 days. RCHOP consists of 375 mg/m2 IV rituximab, 750 mg/m2 IV cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/m2 IV doxorubicin, 1.4 mg/m2 IV vincristine and 100 mg/m2 by mouth QD prednisone. The study includes a Phase I component to determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus and the second component determines the feasibility of therapy administered to lymphoma patients.</description>
