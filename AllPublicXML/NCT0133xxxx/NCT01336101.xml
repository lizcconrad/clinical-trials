  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical registry is to demonstrate the efficacy of the EPIC™ stent in
      patients with superficial femoral/ popliteal artery disease.

      100 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery lesion will be enrolled in the study and
      shall undergo 4 visits during the trial -a pre-procedure visit, procedure visit at which time
      the stent will be placed, and follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months.

      Study hypothesis: The EPIC™ Self-Expanding Nitinol Vascular Stent with Delivery System will
      be efficacious in patients with Superficial Femoro/Popliteal Artery disease.

      The SUMMIT Registry addresses the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

      PAD represents a major challenge to physicians in treating the Superficial Femoral (SFA) and
      Popliteal arteries. These vessels are exposed to enormous mechanical stress what represents a
      harsh environment for any endovascular device. During flexing of the knee, the SFA/Popliteal
      arteries can bend, rotate, elongate and compress dramatically. An ideal stent designed for
      use in the SFA/Popliteal arteries would offer great ranges of movement while adequately
      supporting the arteries.

      Subject of study is the EPIC™ Femoropopliteal Self-Expanding Stent System which provides a
      great range of motions for a highly flexible femoral artery while adequately supporting the
      vessel.

      Primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the device in treating lesions of the
      SFA/Popliteal artery.

      The project is a multi-centre open label study. Primary efficacy parameter will be assessed
      by measuring the in-stent binary stenosis using duplex ultrasound at 6 and 12 months after
      the stent placement. Binary restenosis is defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR)
      ≥2.5:1.

      Anticipated study duration is 18 months: 6 months recruiting and 12 months follow-up.
