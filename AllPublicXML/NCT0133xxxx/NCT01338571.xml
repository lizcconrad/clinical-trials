      This is a pilot study and will be used to power an NIH grant application on the effect of
      resistant starch on weight gain in children.

      Stool fatty acids and stool pH from the baseline and week 4 stool samples will be compared by
      paired-t test. The stool microflora changes will be reported using descriptive statistics for
      the percent changes in the different bacterial phyla.

    <description>Children will be given yogurt twice a day for four weeks. The dose for an adult is 8 ounces of yogurt twice a day. The dose will be scaled to the children based upon surface area dosing charts, but will not exceed a resistant starch load of 1 gram per year of age plus 10 grams10.</description>
