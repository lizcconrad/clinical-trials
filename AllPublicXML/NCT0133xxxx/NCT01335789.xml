  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how people who frequently use marijuana respond to a
      stressful task, and if a medication (oxytocin) affects this response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress is commonly associated with drug craving and relapse in substance-dependent
      individuals. Several studies indicate that hypothalamic neuropeptides may mediate behavioral
      response to stress. For example, preclinical and clinical investigations have indicated that
      the neuropeptide oxytocin exerts anxiolytic effects in stress paradigms. Several studies have
      indicated that oxytocin promotes trust, social bonding, and calmness; however, little is
      known about the potential anxiolytic affects of oxytocin in marijuana-dependent individuals.
      A preclinical study investigating the effects and mechanism of lithium on cannabinoid
      withdrawal in rats had positive findings, with increasing oxytocin levels hypothesized to
      moderate this effect (Cui et al, 2001). Given the anxiolytic nature of oxytocin, it may have
      a therapeutic role in ameliorating the negative affect commonly observed prior to relapse in
      marijuana-dependent individuals, as well as the anxiety associated with marijuana withdrawal.
      This pilot protocol will provide important preliminary data on the effect of oxytocin on
      stress in marijuana-dependent individuals.

    <measure>Stress (as Measured by Cortisol)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes following Trier Social Stress Task completion</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary cortisol samples were collected via passive drool to provide empirical assessment of stress reactivity. Reported here is salivary cortisol level 5 minutes following Trier Social Stress Task exposure (approximately 60 minutes post study drug/placebo administration). Trier Social Stress Task is a psychosocial laboratory stress task in which subjects deliver a speech and perform a math problem in front of a stranger audience.</description>

    <measure>Stress (as Measured by Subjective Report)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes following Trier Social Stress Task completion</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective report of stress was measured using a 0-10 Likert Scale (0=not at all, 10=extremely). Reported here is subjective stress level 5 minutes following exposure to the Trier Social Stress Task (approximately 60 minutes post study drug/placebo administration). Trier Social Stress Task is a psychosocial laboratory stress task in which subjects deliver a speech and perform a math problem in front of a stranger audience.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Craving (as Measured by the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes following Trier Social Stress Task completion</time_frame>
    <description>The MCQ is intended to measure marijuana craving in adults. It measures symptoms on four subscales: expectancy, purposefulness, emotionality, and compulsivity. The scale rates individual items from 1-7 with a composite scoring range of 12-84 and possible subscale scoring range of 3-21. Reported here is MCQ composite score 5 minutes following Trier Social Stress Task exposure (approximately 60 minutes post study drug/placebo administration). Trier Social Stress Task is a psychosocial laboratory stress task in which subjects deliver a speech and perform a math problem in front of a stranger audience.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual
             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.

          -  Subjects must meet DSM-IV criteria for current marijuana dependence (within the past
             three months). While individuals may also meet criteria for abuse of other substances,
             they must identify marijuana as their primary substance of abuse and must not meet
             criteria for dependence on any other substance (except nicotine) within the last 60
             days.

          -  Subjects must consent to remain abstinent from all drugs of abuse (except nicotine and
             marijuana) for a three-day period immediately prior to the CTRC admission. Subjects
             must abstain from marijuana for 24 hours prior to testing. By restricting marijuana
             use as proposed, subjects should not be under the acute effects of marijuana, and also
             may be experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms, the measurement of which is one of the
             outcome variables being tested.

          -  Subjects must consent to random assignment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential and not practicing an
             effective means of birth control.

          -  Subjects with evidence of or a history of significant hematological, endocrine,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or neurological disease including
             diabetes, as these conditions may affect physiological/subjective responses.

          -  Subjects with Addison's disease, Cushing's disease or other diseases of the adrenal
             cortex likely to affect hormonal/neuroendocrine status.

          -  Subjects with a history of or current psychotic disorder or bipolar affective disorder
             as these may interfere with subjective measurements.

          -  Subjects with current major depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder as
             these disorders are associated with characteristic changes in stress response.

          -  Subjects receiving synthetic glucocorticoid therapy, any exogenous steroid therapy, or
             treatment with other agents that interfere with hormonal measurements within one month
             of test session.

          -  Subjects taking any psychotropic medications, including SRI's or other
             antidepressants, opiates or opiate antagonists because these may affect test response.

          -  Subjects with any acute illness or fever. Individuals who otherwise meet study
             criteria will be rescheduled for evaluation for participation.

          -  Subjects who are obese (³ 20% over ideal weight) as this may interfere with hormonal
             status.

          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to maintain abstinence from alcohol and other
             drugs of abuse (except nicotine) for three days prior to the stress task procedure.

          -  Subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence (other than nicotine or
             marijuana) within the past 60 days.

        <description>Salivary cortisol samples were collected via passive drool to provide empirical assessment of stress reactivity. Reported here is salivary cortisol level 5 minutes following Trier Social Stress Task exposure (approximately 60 minutes post study drug/placebo administration). Trier Social Stress Task is a psychosocial laboratory stress task in which subjects deliver a speech and perform a math problem in front of a stranger audience.</description>

        <title>Craving (as Measured by the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire)</title>
        <description>The MCQ is intended to measure marijuana craving in adults. It measures symptoms on four subscales: expectancy, purposefulness, emotionality, and compulsivity. The scale rates individual items from 1–7 with a composite scoring range of 12-84 and possible subscale scoring range of 3-21. Reported here is MCQ composite score 5 minutes following Trier Social Stress Task exposure (approximately 60 minutes post study drug/placebo administration).
