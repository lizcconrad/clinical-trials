  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and immune response of a new intranasal
      vaccine against influenza, called NB-1008. The vaccine is composed of a licensed vaccine that
      is normally given as an injection, called Fluzone, and an adjuvant (additive that helps a
      vaccine work better), called W805EC.

          3. If female, must be non-pregnant as confirmed by a negative serum pregnancy test
             conducted at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test conducted at the site
             within 24 hours preceding receipt of vaccine.

          4. Females who are not surgically sterile or at least one year post-menopausal agree to
             use oral, implantable, transdermal or injectable contraceptive or another reliable
             form of contraception approved by the Investigator for a minimum of 30 days prior to
             vaccination and for 3 months following vaccination.

          5. Healthy, as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and
             clinical laboratory examinations.

          6. Comprehension of the study requirements, expressed availability for the required study
             period, and ability to attend scheduled visits.

          7. Has given written informed consent to participate in the study.

             of chronic cough, frequent sinus infections, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, nasal
             polyps or obstruction, including deviated septum significant enough to obstruct the
             nasal openings are to be excluded. Subjects with seasonal rhinitis may be included if
             their 'season' does not occur within 3 months of the vaccination date and they are not
             currently receiving intranasal steroids.

          2. Receipt of the 2008-2009 influenza vaccine.

          3. Positive serology for HIV-1 or HIV-2, or HCV antibodies.

             will be allowed. Administration of study vaccine can be delayed if a nonstudy vaccine
             has been administered and will be given as soon as acceptable, as described above.

         14. Known allergy to any vaccine component, including eggs, egg products, or thimerosal.

         15. History of allergic and/or anaphylactic type reaction to injected vaccines or to any
             of the components of NB-1008 [soybean oil, dehydrated alcohol (anhydrous ethanol),
             polysorbate (Tween 80) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)].

         16. History of drug or chemical abuse in the year before the study.

         17. Receipt of any investigational product or nonregistered drug within the 30 days before

             administration prior to the Day 60 telephone contact.

         20. Donation of blood or blood products within 8 weeks before study entry or at any time
             up to the Day 28 clinic visit.

         21. Acute disease within a week prior to vaccination, defined as the presence of a
             moderate or severe illness (as determined by the investigator through medical history
             and physical examination) with or without fever. For subjects with a minor illness,
             such as diarrhea, or mild upper respiratory tract infection with or without low-grade
             febrile illness, the subject can be re-screened once they have complexly recovered.
