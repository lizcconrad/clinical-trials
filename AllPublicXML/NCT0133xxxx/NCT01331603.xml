  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, it has been demonstrated that iron overload is associated with the appearance of
      labile plasma iron (LPI).

      LPI is redox active and is rapidly taken up by cells, leading to a rise in the labile iron
      pool (LIP) and catalyzing generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to
      cellular damage.

      The LPI data are mostly derived from thalassemia iron overload research , however, there are
      a few data describing LPI and its correlations with the classical iron overload parameters
      (ferritin, TSAT) in acute anemias such as MDS Therefore we are going to assess LPI in iron
      overloaded myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (low and high risk) and primary myelofibrosis, in
      order to assess whether it can be used as alternative to the routinely used parameters; TSAT
      and ferritin levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60-80% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) present with
      symptomatic anemia and 80-90%, of these, will require red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.
      Excess transfusional iron causes iron overload (IO) which is characterized by elevated serum
      ferritin (&gt; 1000ng/ml) and transferrin saturation (TSAT &gt; 50%) levels.

      Assessment of IO using serum ferritin and TSAT levels is not accurate enough and this is due
      to changes in serum ferritin and TSAT during any inflammatory condition.

      Since serum ferritin is considered as a positive acute phase reactant and therefore
      inflammatory state can lead to an increase in serum ferritin levels and so does not reflect
      the exact amount of iron overload.

      In contrast TSAT can decrease during inflammation and in addition it follows diurnal
      variations.The aim of our present study is to asses the levels of LPI in patients with in
      iron overloaded MDS patients (low and high risk), and also patients with primary
      myelofibrosis, in order to find out any laboratory correlations between LPI, TSAT and srum
      ferritin levels.

      Methods:

      The study will contain 50 patients low+high risk MDS patients and patients with primary
      myelofibrosis with iron overloaded. The risk stratification of these patients will be
      calculated according to the WPSS (WHO adapted Prognostic Scoring System)

      After ICF (Informed Consent Form) has been signed by the patients the following laboratory
      tests will be taken once during the study:

        -  Ferritin (local laboratory)

        -  Transferrin Saturation (local laboratory)

        -  CRP (local laboratory)

        -  LPI (feROSâ„¢ eLPI from Aferrix Ltd., Tel- Aviv, Israel)
