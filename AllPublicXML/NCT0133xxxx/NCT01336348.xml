    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label prospective randomized pharmacodynamic investigation of 2
      antiplatelet regimens in patients undergoing coronary intervention for ST segment elevation
      myocardial infarction(STEMI):

        1. Tirofiban bolus only or bolus followed by 2 hour infusion on top of 600 mg clopidogrel
           or 60 mg prasugrel.

        2. Prasugrel given at 60 mg.

      Primary hypothesis: Percentage IPA after 20uMol/ADP at 30' will be superior in the tirofiban
      arm (as aggregate) versus prasugrel alone arm Percentage IPA at 30' after 20uMol/ADP 90%±15
      and 80%±15 in the tirofiban and prasugrel alone arm, respectively. For a power of 90% and an
      alpha error set at 5%, 50 patients per group have to be recruited.

    <description>Platelet aggregation (PA) will be performed as previously reported [J Am Coll Cardiol 2006;48:2178-85]. Blood samples anticoagulated with 0.129 mol/l sodium citrate will be collected for platelet reactivity. Platelet-rich plasma, obtained by centrifuging whole blood for 10 min at 200 g, will be stimulated with 5 and 20 µmol/l adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) (Alfa Wasserman, Bologna, Italia) and aggregation will be assessed using a AggRAM Advanced Modular System light transmittance aggregometer.</description>

    <description>Blood samples draen at 15', 30', 1H, 2H, 6H and 18-24H, anticoagulated with 0.129 mol/l sodium citrate will be collected for platelet reactivity.
