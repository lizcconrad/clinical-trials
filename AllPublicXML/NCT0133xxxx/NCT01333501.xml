  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate, by means of a specific cognitive test battery
      (Brief Repeatable Battery and Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System scale), the
      slowing/reduction of cognitive dysfunction progression in RRMS patients after 18 months of
      treatment with fingolimod in comparison with interferon beta 1b treatment, and to evaluate
      which test of the battery is the most sensitive in detecting differences between treatment
      groups.

    <measure>Change From Screening in Selective Reminding Test - Long-Term Storage (SRT-LTS) Raw Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (-1month), 18 month</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Repeatable Battery (BRB)- widely used as a clinical and research tool, with 68% sensitivity and 85% specificity. It consists of the serial administration of 5 tests. One of the tests is SRT (Selective Reminding Test) for episodic memory (verbal learning and delayed recall). A word recalled on two consecutive trials is considered to have entered long-term storage (LTS) on the first of these trials and scored as LTS on all following trials. The total of the words in LTS of all six trials is then summed. The total score ranged from 0 to 72. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Brief Repeatable Battery (BRB)- widely used as a clinical and research tool, with 68% sensitivity and 85% specificity. It consists of the serial administration of 5 tests. One of the tests is SRT (Selective Reminding Test) for episodic memory (verbal learning and delayed recall). A word recalled on two consecutive trials is considered to have entered long-term storage (LTS) on the first of these trials and scored as LTS on all following trials. The total of the words in LTS of all six trials is then summed. The total score ranged from 0 to 72. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Change From Screening in Selective Reminding Test – Consistent Long Term Retrieval (SRT-CLTR) Raw Score</title>
          <description>Brief Repeatable Battery (BRB)- widely used as a clinical and research tool, with 68% sensitivity and 85% specificity. It consists of the serial administration of 5 tests. One of the tests is SRT (Selective Reminding Test) for episodic memory (verbal learning and delayed recall). A word recalled on two consecutive trials is considered to have entered long-term storage (LTS) on the first of these trials and scored as LTS on all following trials. The total of the words in LTS of all six trials is then summed. If a word in LTS is consistently recalled on all subsequent trials, it is then scored as Consistent Long Term Retrieval (CLTR). The total of the words in CLTR of all six trials is summed. The total score ranged from 0 to 72. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Word List Generation (COWAT/WLG): The COWAT assesses verbal fluency on semantic stimulus by asking the patient to produce as many words as possible belonging to a semantic category. The test assessed the verbal fluency, recorded all the possible correct word that a patients should give in 90 sec. No maximum range is available. Higher values represent a better outcome. The score was the number of correct words. The more words the patient pronounces, the better it is. We can imagine that the minimum value might be zero words, , but it is not a score scale.</description>

        <description>The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System – Sorting Test is one of the nine tests presented in the DKEFS manual and explores the patient’s executive abilities. It has a standard form (version A, administered at screening and Month-18 visit) and an alternate form (version B, administered at Month-9 visit). The standard form consists of the practice card set, card set 1 and card set 2. The alternate form consists of the same practice card set, card set 3 and card set 4. The DKFES test consisted of two testing procedures: free sorting and sort recognition. In free sorting, six scores were obtained: Confirmed Correct sorts for card sets 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4 for version B), sum of confirmed Correct Sorts. In sort recognition, a description score for card set 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4 for version B) was obtained, as well as the sum of description scores of both sets. The total score ranged from 0 to 16. Higher values represent a better outcome</description>

The standard form consists of the practice card set, card set 1 and card set 2. The alternate form consists of the same practice card set, card set 3 and card set 4. In free sorting, six scores were obtained: Confirmed Correct sorts for card sets 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4 for version B), sum of confirmed Correct Sorts, Free Sorting Description score for card set 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4 for version B) and sum of Free Sorting Description scores. In sort recognition, a description score for card set 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4 for version B) was obtained, as well as the sum of description scores of both sets. The total score ranged from 0 to 64. Higher values represent a better outcome</description>

        <description>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (mFIS) questionnaire is described at each time point to evaluate fatigue by means of usual descriptive statistics. Three domains were also defined: Physical Subscale (sum of items 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 20, 21 and therefore ranging from 0 to 36), Cognitive Subscale (sum of items 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19 and therefore ranging from 0 to 40) and Psychosocial Subscale (sum of items 8, 9 and therefore ranging from 0 to 8).

          <title>Changes From Baseline in Fatigue Impact Scale (mFIS, Total Score and Scores of the 3 Individual Domains).</title>
          <description>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (mFIS) questionnaire is described at each time point to evaluate fatigue by means of usual descriptive statistics. Three domains were also defined: Physical Subscale (sum of items 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 20, 21 and therefore ranging from 0 to 36), Cognitive Subscale (sum of items 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19 and therefore ranging from 0 to 40) and Psychosocial Subscale (sum of items 8, 9 and therefore ranging from 0 to 8). Finally, mFIS - overall score ranged from 0 to 80. The mFIS total score was computed as the sum of scores for each item. Lower values represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The Environmental Status Scale (ESS) is used to quickly evaluate a patient for handicap. It was derived from a measure of socio-economic status. It consists of seven parameters: (1) actual work status, (2) financial and economic status, (3) personal residence or home, (4) personal assistance required, (5) transportation, (6) community services, (7) social activity. Each parameter has a single score from minimum 0 to maximum 5. ESS score is the sum of the points for all 7 parameters: minimum score: 0; maximum score: 35.
