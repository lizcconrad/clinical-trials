      The purpose of the study was to investigate the changes of Ryodoraku value at 12 source
      acupoints, and heart rate viability (HRV) when acupuncture or far-infrared ray illumination
      applied to CV12 acupoint.

    <textblock>
      Acupuncture and far-infrared ray illumination at CV12 acupoint have been widely used to treat
      many diseases in clinic. To our knowledge, the report is about the different reaction on
      autonomic nervous system between acupuncture and far-infrared illumination is very rare until
      now.Therefore,the study was to investigate the different changes on autonomic nervous system
      from Ryodoraku value at 12 source acupoints and heart rate viability (HRV) when acupuncture
      or far-infrared ray illumination applied to CV12 acupoint.
