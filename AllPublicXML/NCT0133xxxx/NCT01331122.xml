  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of Gait (FoG) is a class of symptoms that occur in Parkinson's patients. Also called
      motor blocks, FoG is characterized by a sudden inability to move the lower extremities which
      usually lasts less than 10 seconds. The exact pathophysiology of FoG is poorly understood,
      but treatment with levodopa appears to improve FoG observed in the off-state. As Parkinson's
      patients progress in severity, FoG in the on-state can increase in frequency and appears to
      be resistant to dopaminergic therapies. There is additional evidence that norepinephrine as
      well as dopaminergic systems may be involved in FoG.

      Droxidopa has has been approved for use in Japan since 1989 for treatment of frozen gait or
      dizziness associated with Parkinson's Disease. This study is to further explore the safety
      and efficacy of droxidopa in this indication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients, aged at least 30 years;

          -  Diagnosed with probable levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson's Disease , and
             receiving levodopa. Other Parkinson's Disease medications can also be used.

          -  At least 3 months incidence of typical freezing of gait (FOG) symptoms, occurring
             while levodopa is otherwise providing an &quot;on&quot; mobility state (including at least one
             of the following FOG patterns: start hesitancy, freezing at making turns or when
             passing through a doorway, spontaneous freezing during continued walking, or freezing
             of gait related to a simultaneous mental or physical activity).

          -  Provide written informed consent to participate in the study and understand that they
             may withdraw their consent at any time without prejudice to their future medical care

          -  On a stable dose of carbidopa, alone or with other Parkinson's medication, providing a
             range of carbidopa between 100mg and 400mg daily
