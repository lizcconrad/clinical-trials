      The objective of this project is to conduct a retrospective economic analysis of the use of
      dutasteride for the prevention of prostate cancer based on data from the REDUCE clinical
      trial. REDUCE is a 4-year, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel assignment clinical
      trial of the use of dutasteride compared with no chemopreventive treatment.

      The REDUCE trial was a four-year, international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study. There were 790 investigators in 42 countries.
