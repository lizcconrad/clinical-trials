      The Objective was to Develop a Cost-Effectiveness study that compares Ciclesonide and
      Beclomethasone in pediatric asthma control.

      Cost-effectiveness study, of cohorts, observational, analytic, prospective, from health
      institution perspective. Based on published data related to percentage of patients free of
      crisis for both molecules, it was estimated that the sample size to detect significant
      differences between the two alternatives was 20 patients per alternative. Medical records of
      94 patients with diagnosis of uncontrolled asthma were included, aged between 6 and 15 years,
      47 received Beclomethasone randomly, and 47 received Ciclesonide randomly, treatment
      physician was blind related to this assignation, both cohorts were followed for 6 months, and
      primary effectiveness variable was defined as number of patients free of crisis with each
      alternative. Cost generating variables were defined as medication use, and hospital stay.
      Decision analysis was based on a decision tree.
