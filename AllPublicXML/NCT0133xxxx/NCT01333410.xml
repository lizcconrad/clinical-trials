  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo has remained a difficult disease to treat. Previous available therapies are often
      ineffective. It usually takes several months or years for complete repigmentation and some
      areas of the body get at best only partial repigmentation. The desire of the patient to
      undergo therapy varies from patient to patient and needs to be assessed individually. Several
      factors should be considered when planning the treatment strategies including type of
      vitiligo, site and degree of involvement, skin color, psychological effect, patient
      compliance, ease to assess to therapy, cost of treatment and social association of the
      disease.

      Topical corticosteroids are still be the standard treatment of localized vitiligo. However,
      the adverse effects such as skin atrophy, striae, pigmentary change and
      hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis suppression can occur if we use inappropriate strength of
      topical steroids for a long period of time.

      Tacrolimus (FK-506) is a new immunosuppressive agent that acts by inhibiting T-cell
      activation and cytokine release. It offers a safe and efficacious alternative for many skin
      conditions. It minimizes the need for topical glucocorticoids and does not cause skin
      atrophy. Tacrolimus was first reported for treatment of vitiligo in 2002. The underlying
      mechanism was shown in an in vitro study that topical tacrolimus promoted proliferation of
      melanocytes and melanoblasts.

      This study purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.1% topical tacrolimus ointment
      comparing to 0.1% mometasone furoate cream in the treatment of adult vitiligo.

      At first visit, patients will be randomized to receive 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for apply to
      vitiligo lesion on one side of the body. The lesion on the other side of the body will be
      treated with 0.1% mometasone furoate cream. Patients are instructed to apply 0.1% tacrolimus
      ointment and 0.1% mometasone furoate cream twice a day for 6 months

      Patients will be follow up at 2, 4 and 6 months for clinical improvement, side effects and
      photographs
