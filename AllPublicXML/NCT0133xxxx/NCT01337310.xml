    <textblock>
      Tesetaxel is an orally active tubulin-binding inhibitor of the taxane class. Evaluation of
      tesetaxel in Japanese patients has been limited. This study is being conducted to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose and safety of tesetaxel administered orally once every 21 days to
      Japanese patients.

    <description>The starting dose for the first 3 patients treated will be 24 mg/m2. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity, the dose will be increased by 3 mg/m2 for the next group of 3 patients treated. Interpatient dose escalation will continue in this manner to 27 and 31 mg/m2 until the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum dose allowed per protocol (31 mg/m2) is reached and 6 patients are treated at this dose.</description>
