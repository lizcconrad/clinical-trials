  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma tumor tissue ( in particular regressive areas) present a lymphocytic infiltrate with
      an anti-tumoral specificity. The aim of the study is to analyse at different stages of the
      disease, tumor samples and to characterise the cellular infiltrate in situ ( in particular T
      lymphocytes, NK cells and macrophages), the role of inhibitor receptors on in situ
      immunosuppression, and potential modulation by medical treatments such as dacarbazine.

      The study is divided in 4 parts:

      Part 1: study of cellular infiltrate (lymphocytes) performed on large primary melanoma and
      cutaneous metastasis ( fresh samples) Part 2: NK cells study on metastatic regional lymph
      nodes ( fresh samples) and blood samples Part 3: a retrospective study of macrophages in
      sentinel lymph nodes and in corresponding primary melanomas Part 4: study of the cellular
      modulation by the chemotherapy (DTIC or cisplatin or inhibitor of B-raf) which(who) will be
      made on two cutaneous metastases by patient (one taken before the treatment(processing) and
      one taken during the evaluation after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment(processing))
