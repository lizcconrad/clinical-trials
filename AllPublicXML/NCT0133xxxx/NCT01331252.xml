      This is a randomised controlled trial of the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in patients
      with severe tetanus admitted to the intensive care ward nursed in a supine or semi-recumbent
      position.

      Background: Hospital-acquired pneumonia remains a common and important cause of morbidity and
      mortality in patients with severe tetanus who require a tracheostomy whether or not they are
      mechanically ventilated. We propose to investigate if the incidence of hospital-acquired
      pneumonia can be reduced by nursing tetanus patients semi-recumbent at 30o rather than supine
      as is the current practice.

      The aim of this study will be to assess the frequency of clinically suspected and
      microbiologically confirmed hospital acquired pneumonia in patients nursed in a
      semi-recumbent or supine body position. A secondary end-point will be the mortality in each
      group. Patients at risk of developing hospital acquired pneumonia (in hospital without
      developing pneumonia for more than two days) will be evaluated

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Consecutive patients will be entered into the study as they are admitted to the
             intensive care ward with a clinical diagnosis of tetanus.

          2. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient or next-of-kin before
             randomisation.

          3. An envelope for the next study number will be opened in which patients will be
             randomly allocated to either semi-recumbent (300) or supine (00) body position. The
             randomisation will be created by a computer generated list.

          4. All health care personnel will be instructed not to change the position, unless for
             medical requirements.

          5. The correctness of the position will be checked twice daily.

          6. Surveillance for clinical detection of pneumonia or other infection will be done
             daily. If infection is suspected relevant microbiological samples will be taken.

          7. The study period will end 72 hours after the patient has left the intensive care ward,
             or if there is a permanent change in body position for more than 1 hour or death.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recent abdominal surgery (&lt;7 days)

          2. Shock refractory to vasoactive drugs or volume therapy

          3. Recent intensive care (&lt;30 days)

          4. Neonates

          5. Pneumonia at the time of admission to intensive care.
