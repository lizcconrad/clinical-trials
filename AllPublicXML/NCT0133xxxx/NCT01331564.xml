    <textblock>
      The project aims to develop, implement and evaluate electronically-mediated behavioral
      intervention programs for pregnant and postpartum women in order to prevent excessive weight
      gain during pregnancy and postpartum weight retention.

      This study seeks to expand the understanding of how to slow the accumulation of weight in
      childbearing women. The intervention goals are to decrease the prevalence of excessive
      pregnancy weight gain and mean weight retention in the first 18 months postpartum in
      socio-economically and racially/ethnically diverse sample of 1,641 pregnant women. Women will
      be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Intervention Group 1 will receive the
      intervention program only during pregnancy (e-intervention 1). Intervention Group 2 will
      receive e-intervention 1 plus intervention for 18 months postpartum (e-intervention 2).
      Control women will receive non-weight related content during both time periods at the project
      website. The primary hypotheses for the randomized controlled trial are: H1: The proportion
      of women in Intervention Groups 1 and 2 who gain more weight in pregnancy than is recommended
      by the IOM will be 33% less than the proportion of the women in the Control Group who gain
      excessively and H2: The Control Group will have a higher mean weight retention at 12 months
      postpartum than Intervention Groups 1 and 2.
