      The aim of the study is to find the optimal management of patients with acute myocardial
      infarction with ST elevations treated by primary PCI who have at least one significant
      stenosis of non-culprit coronary artery. The primary endpoint of the study will be incidence
      of combined endpoint of all cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke during
      the follow up of 24 months in group of patients treated with staged revascularization (PCI or
      CABG) in comparison with patients treated conservatively.

      Introduction:

      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) of the occlussion or significant stenosis
      of infarct artery is a method of choice in treatment of acute myocardial infarction with ST
      segment elevation (STEMI). It is not clear, what is the optimal management of patients with
      acute myocardial infarction with ST elevations (STEMI) treated by primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) who have at least one significant stenosis of non-culprit
      coronary artery. Numerous cardiology centers perform staged PCI on significant stenoses
      involving the &quot;non-infarct&quot; coronary artery (arteries) 3-40 days after PPCI, but the benefit
      of this staged PCI for such patients has not yet been clearly demonstrated.

      Aim of study:

      The aim is to find the optimal management of patients with acute myocardial infarction with
      ST elevations (STEMI) treated by PPCI who have at least one significant stenosis of
      non-culprit coronary artery. The primary endpoint of the study will be incidence of combined
      endpoint of all cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke during the follow
      up of 24 months in group of patients treated with staged revascularization (PCI or CABG) in
      comparison with patients treated conservatively.

      Hypothesis:

      Our hypothesis is that complete staged revascularization of significant stenoses of the
      coronary arteries will improve the long-term prognosis in patients after PPCI as compared to
      conservative management.
