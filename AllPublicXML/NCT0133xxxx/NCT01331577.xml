  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress is a common problem with significant consequences for health. It can be a trigger for
      somatic diseases as well as psychological disorders and leads through missed working days and
      healthcare cost to a high economic loss. It is for health and economic reasons essential to
      develop and evaluate effective interventions that can inoculate against stress and build
      inner strength.

      A cognitive-behavioural training for groups that is well evaluated and has shown to be
      effective is the Stress-Inoculation-Training by Meichenbaum. As the public utilization of
      methods of the complementary and alternative medicine is increasing a rigorous evaluation is
      needed. Integrative Kinesiology is a popular method that has been said to be effective
      against stress and its symptoms.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled evaluation and comparison of the
      interventions to each other and to a waiting-list control group. Hypothesis: Healthy
      volunteers attending a two dayseminar will show significantly reduced psychobiological
      reactivity, decreased stress perception and less anxiety to a standardized psychosocial
      stress test compared to the waiting list group. A total of 64 healthy volunteers will be
      randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The efficacy of the interventions will be
      measured through the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to measure the psychobiological stress
      reactivity.
