  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary anastomotic strictures (post liver transplantation) occur in 15-20 % of the cases.
      Biliary stenting using plastic prosthesis during a period of 1 year is the treatment of
      choice. Problematic in this approach is the regular change, necessary to overcome occlusion
      of the stent, resulting in cholestasis and/or infection. This change needs to be performed
      every 3 months or more frequently in patients with symptoms of stent occlusion.

      The Kaffes stent (RMS) is a metallic removable stent, especially constructed for the
      treatment of biliary anastomotic strictures post liver transplantation. The advantage could
      be that this stent is less prone to occlusion with a lower change frequency (e.g. every 6
      months).

      No randomized, controlled trial (RCT) or data exist comparing plastic stenting versus Kaffes
      stenting.

    <measure>Comparison of patency of the bile duct between normal and Kaffes stenting.</measure>
    <time_frame>after 6 months and after 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of patency of the bile duct 6 months after 1 year of stenting. Patency is defined as the presence of normal liver function test (direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), alkaline phosphatase) and non-dilated bile ducts on Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). In the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, rejection or other causes of possible disturbed liver function parameters, the MRCP findings rule over the lab tests.</description>

    <description>The safety of the Kaffes stent, compared to the normal stent will be assessed (e.g. change of stents, blood tests, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP)).</description>

Patients included in the Kaffes stent arm will receive change of the stent every 6 months for a total duration of 1 year.
In case the patient develops symptoms of stent occlusion (rise of liver tests, fever, septicimiae), the stent will be changed as soon as possible.</description>
