    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the association between image and certain molecular
      markers with complete response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer, treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy composed of Bevacizumab, Docetaxel and Doxorubicin.

    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacogenomic phase II, multicenter, prospective clinical trial whose main
      objective is to evaluate the association of molecular and imaging markers with the response
      to bevacizumab administration in combination with docetaxel and doxorubicin as neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients diagnose with locally advanced breast cancer.

    <description>The dosage form is Parenteral Injection (I/V) for all study drugs. Bevacizumab 15mg/kg in a single dose on day 1. Then 3 weeks later begin the cycles. On the day 1 of the cycle the patient receives Bevacizumab 15mg/kg, docetaxel 60mg/m2 and doxorubicin 50mg/m2.
The cycles have a frequency of one every three weeks, and the protocol defines 4 cycles in total.
The surgical procedure will be done 4-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy.</description>
