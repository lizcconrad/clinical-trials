  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FORESEE HOME is intended for the early detection of central and paracentral
      irregularities (abnormalities) in the visual field, most commonly associated with Age Related
      Macular Degeneration (AMD). However, the device has the ability to detect the development of
      the lesion post treatment and therefore to assess in determination of the next treatment.

      The Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) may be used as well to identify choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV). Comparison between the two methods will allow better understanding
      of both devices.

      The FORESEE HOME can be used as an assessment tool for the progression and success of the
      treatment given to AMD lesions. Therefore, evaluating the size and the location of the
      treated lesions may serve as an additional tool.
