    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well vismodegib after stem cell transplant works in treating
      patients with high-risk first remission or relapsed multiple myeloma. Vismodegib may slow the
      growth of cancer cells. Giving vismodegib after autologous stem cell transplant may kill more
      multiple myeloma cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if GDC-0449 (vismodegib) is able to reduce myeloma cancer stem cells (CSC)
      when given to patients with multiple myeloma (MM) following autologous stem cell
      transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether GDC-0449 is inhibiting the hedgehog (Hh) pathway in patients with MM
      following autologous transplantation by measuring downstream targets of Hh using quantitative
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on plasma cells and MM CSC obtained
      from blood and bone marrow of patients undergoing treatment.

      II. To determine whether changes in MM CSC as measured by clonogenic assays on bone marrow
      are seen in response to GDC-0449 and whether these changes predict recurrence.

      III. To determine whether changes in MM CSC can be measured with similar or better accuracy
      using peripheral blood flow cytometry as compared to bone marrow clonogenic assays.

      IV. To determine the safety and toxicity profile for treatment with GDC-0449 following
      autologous transplantation in patients with high risk or relapsed MM.

      V. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GDC-0449 (total and unbound) at steady-state
      and correlate this with pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints.

      VI. To determine the one year progression free survival for patients given GDC-0449 following
      autologous transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 11 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
