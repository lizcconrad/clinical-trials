    <textblock>
      Plerixafor in combination with bevacizumab is a drug combination that may stop cancer cells
      from growing abnormally. Bevacizumab, also known as Avastin, is FDA approved for use in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma and has been studied extensively in other types of solid
      tumors. Plerixafor, also known as Mozobil, is FDA approved for use in patients with
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma and has been used in treatment for other cancers.
      Information from experiments in laboratories suggests that the combination of plerixafor and
      bevacizumab may help prevent the growth of gliomas.

      Part 1: The investigators are looking for the highest dose of plerixafor that can be given
      safely with bevacizumab (with a 21 days on/7 days off regimen of plerixafor). The
      investigators will also do blood tests to find out how the body uses and breaks down the drug
      combination.

      Part 2: The investigators are looking to see if plerixafor can get past the blood-brain
      barrier and into brain tumors. The investigators will also do blood tests to find out how the
      body uses and breaks down the drug combination.

      Part 3: The investigators are looking for for more information re: safety and tolerability of
      plerixafor in combination with bevacizumab (with a 28 days on/0 days off regimen of
      plerixafor). The investigators will also do blood tests to find out how the body uses and
      breaks down the drug combination.

      -  This study is organized into cycles. Each cycle lasts four weeks (28 days). Cycles occur
           back to back without a break in between.

        -  Plerixafor is given as subcutaneous injection (under the skin). The injection should be
           given at approximately the same time each day (If participants would like the option to
           administer their Plerixfor in the evening rather than in the morning on non-clinic days,
           this is a possibility, provided certain conditions are met). The research doctor will
           specify which days participants should take plerixafor. In general, plerixafor will be
           given once daily during the first three weeks of every cycle (during part 3, patients
           will receive plerixafor the last week of each cycle, as well). For the first week (5-7
           days) of Cycle 1, the injections will be given in the clinic and the nurses will teach
           the participant and their spouse/friend/family member how to administer the injections.

        -  Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) will be given as an infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

        -  During Part 1 the investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that
           can be administered safely in combination with bevacizumab so not everyone who
           participates will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend
           upon on the number of participants who have been enrolled and how well they have
           tolerated their doses.

        -  During Part 2, before patient begins their post-surgical cycles of treatment, plerixafor
           will be administered daily for 5-9 days at the MTD established in Part 1 of the study;
           patient will continue to surgery; and once recovered from surgery, patient will begin
           post-surgical cycles of treatment (plerixafor and bevacizumab) at the MTD/regimen
           established in Part 1 of the study.

        -  In addition to taking the study medication, participants will have the following tests
           and procedures done: physical and neurological exam, assessments of the tumor by MRI or
           CT scan, routine and research blood tests, routine urine tests, pregnancy test (if
           applicable), ECG, collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via spinal tap.

        -  Participants may remain in this research study as long as their tumor is responding or
           it is determined that receiving further study drugs will not be safe.

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory Objective #1 - Preliminary data assessment on the anti-tumor efficacy of plerixafor in combination with bevacizumab in this population. Since efficacy is not the primary objective, the efficacy variables will be summarized descriptively by treatment cohort. Efficacy evaluations will occur every 8 weeks and will consist of imaging and clinical assessment. The rates of response (Complete Response and Complete Response + Partial Response) will be estimated for each dose cohort in Part 1, the MTD (expanded) cohort in Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory Objective #4 - Investigation of the correlation of treatment response with laboratory correlates including circulating biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of the analysis of the biological correlate data is providing an increased understanding of the nature of the response to plerixafor (AMD3100) and bevacizumab and whether blood and tissue biomarkers can assist in predicting response and progression. These studies are exploratory. The nature of the analyses and the strength of the conclusions from these laboratory studies depend not only on the amount of data available, but also on the nature of patient response to therapy. The information will be limited by the small number of patients treated at each dose.</description>

             method;

          -  or 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male and female condoms,
             diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm).
             Hormonal contraceptive methods are not sufficient, as information about any
             interaction of plerixafor with hormonal contraceptives is not known.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior chemotherapy within the past 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Patients must be off treatment with Temozolomide for at

             fewer than 14 days from start of Plerixafor and bevacizumab. For participants
             enrolling in Part 1 or Part 3 AND who have progressed on a prior anti-VEGF(R) (other
             than bevacizumab) containing regimen, patients must be off anti-VEGF(R) treatment for
             at least 28 days before receiving Plerixafor and bevacizumab. For patients enrolled in

             least 28 days prior to surgery.

        NOTE: Participants must have recovered to a grade 0 or 1 from any clinically significant
        toxicity related to prior therapy (with the exception of lymphopenia, which is common after
        therapy with temozolomide). For any patient who received prior bevacizumab or an
        anti-VEGF(R) therapy, patient must NOT have discontinued that treatment regimen due to a
        treatment-related toxicity.

          -  In order to prevent registering patients with pseudoprogression rather than true
             disease progression, patients must not have received any form of cranial radiation
             within 12 weeks of study entry.

        NOTE: Patients who have received cranial radiation within 12 weeks of study entry will be

          -  Major surgical procedure (including craniotomy) or significant traumatic injury less
             than 28 days or those who receive minor surgical procedures (e.g. core biopsy or fine
             needle aspiration) within 7 days.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents within the past 28
             days.

        NOTE: If agent's half-life x 5 is &lt; 28 days, patient may have taken it within the last 28
        days, provided at least 5 half-lives have passed since having last taken it.

          -  Patients who have had prior therapy with CXCR4 inhibitors.

             allowed to participate.

          -  Prior therapy with thalidomide and lenalidomide is allowed.

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with implanted radiotherapy or chemotherapy
             sources such as wafers of polifeprosan 20 with carmustine (e.g. Gliadel wafers).

             composition to plerixafor or bevacizumab.

          -  For the first 20 patients to register, no anti-coagulation is allowed; for all
             subsequent patients screened, patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation with
             warfarin at baseline are excluded (however, therapeutic or prophylactic therapy with a
             low-molecular weight heparin is acceptable).

          -  Patients must not have a known coagulopathy that increases risk of bleeding or a
             history of clinically significant hemorrhages in the past.

          -  Patients whose MRI scan demonstrates intratumoral hemorrhage or peritumoral hemorrhage
             are not eligible for treatment if deemed significant by the treating physician.

          -  Patients with gastrointestinal bleeding or any other hemorrhage/bleeding event CTCAE

             hypertension, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients with greater than 1+ proteinuria on a urine dipstick or equivalent routine
             laboratory analysis will require further testing with a urine protein to creatinine

          -  Participants with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years AND are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
