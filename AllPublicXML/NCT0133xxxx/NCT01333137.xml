  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      P276-00 is a novel, potent, small-molecule, flavone-derived Cdk 4 D1, Cdk1 B, and Cdk9 T
      inhibitor, with potent cytotoxic effects against chemosensitive and chemoresistant cancer
      cell lines.This study is planned to compare efficacy of the standard chemotherapy regimen of
      gemcitabine and carboplatin when administered with or without P276-00 in subjects with
      advanced triple negative breast cancer.

             lymphangitic pulmonary disease
