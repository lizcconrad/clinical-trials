  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance in cancer patients is often overlooked despite its documented high
      prevalence and negative impact. There are few empirically validated non-pharmacological
      treatments for insomnia and many patients are unwilling to rely on sleeping medications. This
      study will determine whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (a program that teaches
      meditation and yoga) produces equivalent results with the additional benefits of reduced
      stress and mood disturbance, to an already established treatment for insomnia,
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. This will allow for the expansion of treatment options for
      insomnia beyond what is currently available and improve quality of life for millions of
      cancer survivors.
