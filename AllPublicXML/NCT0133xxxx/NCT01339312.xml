  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to gather safety and immunogenicity data with Purified Vero Rabies
      Vaccine - Serum Free (VRVg), when given in a post-exposure prophylaxis vaccination schedule,
      using the Essen regimen, across different populations.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is at least as immunogenic as the reference vaccine, Verorab
           vaccine, in terms of proportion of participants with a rabies virus neutralizing
           antibody titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at Day 14, i.e., before the fourth vaccination, in
           participants aged 10 to 17 years and in participants aged 18 years and over.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the clinical safety of VRVg after each vaccination when administered in a
           post-exposure prophylaxis vaccination schedule in each respective age group and overall

        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg before the fourth vaccination and 14
           days after the last vaccination in each respective age groups and overall.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive five vaccinations (on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28) and will be
      assessed for immunogenic response on Days 0, 14, and 42. They will also be monitored for
      safety from the day of the first vaccination and for up to 6 months after the final
      vaccination.
