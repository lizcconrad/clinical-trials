  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the time to total hip replacement in patients with
      hip osteoarthritis going through both a supervised exercise program and patient education
      compared to patients going through patient education only.

      The null hypothesis is: There are no differences in time to total hip replacement between
      patients with hip osteoarthritis who went through a 12 week supervised exercise program and
      patient education compared to patients who went through patient education only.

      Material and methods:

      109 patients with both symptomatically and radiographically verified hip osteoarthritis were
      included in this randomized controlled trial between april 2005 and october 2007. They were
      randomized to either a 12 week supervised exercise program and patient education (n=55) or
      patient education only (n=54).

      Information on if and when total hip replacement is performed will be collected between April
      1st and May 1st. Time since inclusion to follow-up will range from 3.5 to 6 years. Data will
      be collected directly from the study participants by telephone.

      The main outcome is time to total hip replacement.

      Status:

      This study is a prolongation of an on-going RCT (3a-2005-NAR) using clinical outcomes to
      evaluate the effect of supervised exercise and patient education.

      The study will be carried out: NAR-Department of Orthopedics, Ullevaal University Hospital.

    <description>The exercise protocol included exercises from former studies on comparable patient populations. The intensity of the strength- and flexibility exercises meets the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) recommendations for developing and maintaining muscular fitness in adults. Patients was required to exercise for approximately 60 minutes, to-three days a week for 12 weeks. Patient's attendance to the exercise program (compliance) was registered.
All patients included in the study participated in a patient education program which included two individual and three small-group sessions lasting one hour each time.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 40 and 80 years old with uni- or bilateral hip disability.

          -  Hip pain for more then 3 months.

          -  Harris Hip Score between 60 and 95. Harris Hip score (0-100 points) is widely used as
             an assessment of hip function in patients with hip OA. Harris Hip Score of 60 or below
             are used regularly at our institution as one of the criteria for total hip replacement
             surgery.

          -  Radiographic verified hip OA (Danielsson's criteria for radiographic OA: Danielsson's
             criteria for minimal joint space: &lt; 4 mm &lt; 70 years, &lt; 3 mm â‰¥ 70 years, or 1 mm
             difference between hips).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have a history of resent trauma or functional impairment to the lower
             limbs or diseases which might interfere with participation (rheumatoid arthritis,
             cancer, osteoporosis, severe back pain, knee OA).

          -  Patients with co-morbidities not tolerating physical activities
