    <textblock>
      This is a study of factors, such as pain, family support, psychological history and
      alcohol/substance use, that may influence whether a person experiences depression after their
      spinal cord injury.

      The objective of this study is to examine the degree to which vulnerability factors are
      mediated by stress to increase risk for depression after SCI in a sample of adults who
      sustained their injuries after the age of 18 years. Participants will complete a written
      survey (about pain, daily activities, social support and life experiences) and a telephone
      interview that will provide information about these factors.
