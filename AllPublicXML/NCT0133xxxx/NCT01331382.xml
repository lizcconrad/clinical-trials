  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resveratrol is associated with a plethora of physiological effects in humans, including
      modulation of cerebral blood flow, despite apparently poor bioavailability. This study
      investigated whether the physiological effects of resveratrol could be affected when
      co-supplemented with piperine, an alkaloid which may be able to enhance the bioavailability
      of resveratrol.
