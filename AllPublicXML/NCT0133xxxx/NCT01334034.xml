    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body), and the
      pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of NNC 0123-0000-0338 as
      tablets in healthy subjects.
