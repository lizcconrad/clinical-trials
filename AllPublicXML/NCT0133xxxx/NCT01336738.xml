    <textblock>
      B2611002 is designed to study how safe and effective an investigational medication
      (PF-04991532) is in people with Type 2 diabetes. Subjects in the study will receive 1 of 5
      treatments for 3 months. One of the treatments will be sitagliptin which is an approved drug,
      and another treatment will be placebo, which does not contain active ingredient.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test is between 4 percent (%) and 5.6%. HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 12</title>
        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test is between 4 percent (%) and 5.6%. HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.</description>

        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test is between 4% and 5.6%. HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.</description>

        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. The normal range for the HbA1c test is between 4% and 5.6%. HbA1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.</description>
