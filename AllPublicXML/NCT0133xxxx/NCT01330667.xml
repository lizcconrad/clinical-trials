  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct an exploratory pilot study, enrolling 30 exclusively
      breastfeeding newborns 36-96 hours of age, whose Total Serum Bilirubin (TSB) is within 0.1-3
      mg/dl of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)-recommended treatment thresholds for
      Phototherapy (PT). These newborns will be randomly assigned to receive either 10 cc
      extensively hydrolyzed formula following each breastfeeding using cup, spoon or syringe, or
      to continue exclusive breastfeeding. Infants will be followed at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months to
      assess breastfeeding duration and use of formula and complementary foods. Our hypothesis is
      that limited, small amounts of formula administered without a bottle immediately following
      breastfeeding might reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia among newborns at
      increased risk of TSB exceeding AAP-recommended thresholds for beginning phototherapy.

    <time_frame>Up to three months after birth</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask mothers whether the infant received any breast milk in the last 24 hours. For infants whose mothers state they have received breast milk in the last 24 hours, the investigators will ask mothers whether the infant received anything other than breast milk in the last 24 hours. The investigators will ask mothers whether the infant received anything other than breast milk since the prior assessment. The investigators will query subjects using the Breastfeeding Self Efficacy Scale, short form, at enrollment, 1week and at 1 month.</description>
