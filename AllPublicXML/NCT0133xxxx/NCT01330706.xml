      The investigators conducted a controlled, prospective randomized study to examine the
      antiseptic efficacy of intraoperative scrubbing methods during nail avulsion surgery. The
      investigators compared intraoperative antiseptic scrubbing using 0.9% saline solution and
      0.1% polihexanide. Swab samples were taken from each patient at 5 distinct stages throughout
      the surgical procedure, and bacterial culture analysis was performed (positive culture rate,
      total inocula count, reduction of bacterial load, and identification of specific
      microorganisms).

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed until the surgery to heal completely,an expected average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of inoculum reduction at the irrigation step was calculated as follows: percentage of inoculum reduction = 100 e (1003 Ii)/Is, where Ii is the bacterial count (CFU/cm2) at the irrigation step and Is is the inoculum (CFU/cm2) at the surgery step.
Bacteria were identified using standard laboratory methods. The limit of detection in the nailfold test was 1.33 CFU/cm2.</description>
