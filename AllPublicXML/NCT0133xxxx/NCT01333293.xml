  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with mastocytosis often suffer from associated symptoms such as nausea, vertigo,
      fatigue, urticaria, abdominal cramps, diarrhea or hypotension due to release of mediators by
      mast cells. These patients have also an increased frequency of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid
      reactions due to allergens such as hymenoptera or nonspecific stimuli such as contrast media,
      local anesthetics or analgesics. In addition, there is increased osteoporosis in mastocytosis
      patients due to the activity of mast cell mediators on osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Symptoms
      of mastocytosis respond poorly to treatment with antihistamines or other antiallergic drugs.
      There is currently no specific treatment for this disease with the exception of rare cases.
      There are, however, some case reports suggesting that omalizumab might decrease symptoms
      including hypotensive events.

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether patients suffering from mastocytosis benefit
      from a 6 month course of omalizumab with regard to symptoms and quality of life and whether
      the applied in vitro and in vivo monitoring tools represent useful surrogate markers for the
      efficacy of omalizumab in patients with mastocytosis.

      The study will take place as double-blind placebo controlled study. After a first a
      run-period of 2 months for all participants randomization (1:1) in two group will take place:

      Group A: With omalizumab treatment for 6 months; dosage and administration schedule according
      to body weight and total IgE level (1/2 of the patients). Group B: Placebo (1/2 of the
      patients). After 4 months of treatment in both groups patients are encouraged to stop all
      drugs given to reduce mast cell related effects, mainly antihistaminics . In case that
      disturbing symptoms are reoccurring patients are allowed to restart these drugs. The
      evaluation will take place after 5 months of treatment.

      Finally, a follow up visit 1 and 4 months after the study will take place.
