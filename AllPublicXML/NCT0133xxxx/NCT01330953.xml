    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are (1) To determine the safety of LY2928057 in healthy people,
      and any side effects that might be associated with it; (2) To understand how the body of
      healthy people handles LY2928057; (3) To determine the effect of LY2928057 on blood iron
      level in people's body; and (4) To evaluate how people's immune system reacts to LY2928057.
