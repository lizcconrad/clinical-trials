    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to implement a simplified Negative Pressure Wound Therapy
      (sNPWT) device in a low resource setting. The investigators hypothesize that the sNPWT device
      is at least equivalent to commercially available NPWT devices. Therefore, the specific aims
      of this study will be to measure: 1. the mechanical properties of the sNPWT device and 2. the
      adverse events associated with the sNPWT device.
