      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the predictive value of 18F-fluoromisonidazol-PET
      (FMISO-PET), 2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glukose-PET-CT (FDG-PET-CT), Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (DWI-MRI) and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (DCE-MRI) for patients with anal cancer receiving radiation therapy +/- chemotherapy
      (Cisplatin and 5-FU).

      The study involves tree MRI sessions, two FDG-PET-CT sessions and one FMISO-PET session. The
      FMISO-PET session is presently not carried out because of delivery problems. The production
      of 18F-fluoromisonidazol at The Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine,
      Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Denmark has not jet been approved by the Danish
      Medicines Agency.
