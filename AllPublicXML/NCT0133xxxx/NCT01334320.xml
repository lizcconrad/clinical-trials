  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controversy over surgical treatment of clinically negative neck in early stage oral squamous
      cell carcinoma revolves around the uncertainty of its impact on patient prognosis. The
      efficacy of elective neck dissection on prognosis in T1, 2 N0M0 patients continues to be the
      subject of clinical debate. Currently the clinically negative patients are treated by one of
      the two main policies: one is elective neck dissection; the other is &quot;watchful waiting&quot;. The
      objective of this multi-institutional prospective randomized controlled study is to evaluate
      the survival benefit of elective neck dissection on the prognosis of T1, 2 N0M0 patients with
      carcinoma of oral cavity. The enrolled patients with T1, 2 N0M0 oral cancer will be
      randomized into two groups: elective neck dissection versus watch and wait. The survival rate
      and the recurrence rate between two groups will be compared. The result of the study will
      give surgeons evidence-based instructions for the management of clinically negative neck in
      patients with cancer of oral cavity.

      There are controversies on the benefits of elective neck dissection (END) for clinically
      negative neck in early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to
      determine the need for a randomized controlled trial in order to evaluate the survival
      benefit of elective neck dissection on the prognosis of T1, 2 N0M0 patients with carcinoma of
      oral cavity. We initiate this multi-institutional study, expecting 448 primary oral cancer
      patients to be enrolled. And we are going to randomly divide these patients into two groups:
      END and &quot;watch and wait&quot;. The END group will undergo one stage surgery of END and primary
      tumor excision, and the &quot;watch and wait&quot;group will be treated with primary tumor excision
      transorally as initial treatment, with rigorous postoperation consultation. All patients will
      be followed up with at least 5 years after initial treatment, and the survival rate and the
      recurrence rate between groups will be compared.
