  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare standard of care hemostasis techniques with and
      without the use of Aquamantys in reducing peri-operative blood loss.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of Aquamantys in reducing
      peri-operative blood loss compared with standard electrocautery

      Secondary objectives include :

        -  Rate and volume of transfusions

        -  Evaluating the reduction in hemoglobin and hematocrit values post- operatively

        -  LOS costs, and operative time

        -  Gathering operator feedback on qualitative criteria, including ease of use and surgical
           visualization between the two treatment groups
