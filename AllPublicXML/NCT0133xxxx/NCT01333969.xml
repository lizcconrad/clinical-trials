  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of a tourniquet for 5 minutes and subsequent reperfusion before actual
      inflation of the tourniquet for total knee arthroplasty (ischemic preconditioning) decreases
      the level of local inflammation and therefore postoperative pain in response to reperfusion
      of the ischemic extremity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During knee surgery your surgeon routinely uses a device called a tourniquet that allows us
      to temporarily cut of blood supply to the site of surgery. This helps to reduce blood loss
      and improves operating conditions. When allowing blood back into your leg at the end of the
      procedure, debris (bone, fat, tissue breakdown products and cement from the surgery) gets
      washed out and gains access to the rest of your body. In the vast majority of cases this
      event bares no major clinical consequences, but can rarely result in signs of inflammation of
      various body systems. Patients with evidence of impaired organ system function such as
      pre-existing lung and heart disease may be more vulnerable. Previous studies suggest that
      cutting off the blood supply for a short period of time just before a prolonged episode,
      could lead to a decrease in the extent of tissue breakdown products in this extremity and may
      thus be associated with a decrease in the inflammation of other organ systems. We propose to
      study this theory in knee surgery patients by looking at levels of markers of inflammation
      present in the blood before and after surgery.
