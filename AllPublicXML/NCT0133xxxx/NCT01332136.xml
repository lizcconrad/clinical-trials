    <textblock>
      This research study will be completed by enrolling a prospective, observational cohort study
      to evaluate medical versus surgical treatment outcomes for chronic sinus disease. This
      investigation will compare quality of life outcomes between each treatment type, as well as
      measure cellular and molecular markers of inflammation in the sinus mucosa, to create models
      that predict improvement in quality of life following treatment.
