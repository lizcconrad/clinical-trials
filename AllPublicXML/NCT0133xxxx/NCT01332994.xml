  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multi-center, two-arm, uncontrolled and non-randomized study will evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis. Patients will receive 8 mg/kg RoActemra/Actemra intravenously every 4 weeks for 12
      weeks and - if adequately responded - for further 12 weeks. Patients, who show an inadequate
      clinical response after the first 12 weeks to RoActemra/Actemra, will receive 1 g
      MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) intravenously at Week 16 and 18. The anticipated time of study
      treatment is 32 weeks.

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>After a screening period of up to 4 weeks, eligible participants were treated according to a predefined treatment algorithm based on disease response. In certain cases a re-screening was allowed. Participants were enrolled into the study with the administration of their first dose.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Tocilizumab (TCZ)/TCZ or TCZ/Rituximab (RTX)</title>
          <description>All participants were assigned to receive TCZ 8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) via intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 4 infusions from Baseline to Week 12. Clinical response was assessed at Week 16 using Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS28) to determine subsequent treatment assignment. Participants who achieved early remission, defined as a DAS28 score of less than (&lt;) 2.6, were transferred to clinical routine care and no longer received study medication. Participants who were considered partial responders, defined as a decrease from Baseline in DAS28 score greater than (&gt;) 1.2 or a score between 2.6 and 3.2, inclusive, received TCZ 8 mg/kg via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 4 additional infusions from Week 16 to 28. Those with assessed as having no response, defined as a decrease from Baseline in DAS28 score less than or equal to (≤) 1.2 or a score &gt;3.2, received RTX 1000 milligrams (mg) via IV infusion at Weeks 16 and 18.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Remission According to DAS28 at Week 32 Among Participants Treated With 8 Courses of Tocilizumab</title>
        <description>The DAS28 was calculated as [0.28 x the square root of number of swollen joints] + [0.56 x the square root of number of tender joints] + [0.7 x the natural log of ESR] + [0.014 x VAS patient global assessment of disease activity]. VAS assessments involved a 10-cm horizontal scale from 'no disease activity' to 'maximum disease activity.' DAS28 scores ranged from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity. Remission was defined as a DAS28 score &lt;2.6 at the assessment visit.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 was calculated as [0.28 x the square root of number of swollen joints] + [0.56 x the square root of number of tender joints] + [0.7 x the natural log of ESR] + [0.014 x VAS patient global assessment of disease activity]. VAS assessments involved a 10-cm horizontal scale from 'no disease activity' to 'maximum disease activity.' DAS28 scores ranged from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Response According to ACR Criteria at Week 32 Compared to Week 16 Among Nonresponding Participants Treated With Rituximab</title>
        <description>Response was determined using ACR criteria based upon assessment of 66 joints for swelling and 68 joints for tenderness; joints were classified dichotomously as swollen or not swollen and tender or not tender. Respectively, these assessments were used to generate an SJC ranging from 0 to 66 swollen joints and a TJC ranging from 0 to 68 tender joints. Response was defined as a reduction from the reference visit (Week 16) of at least 20% for one of the following: VAS scores for patient-reported pain, patient global assessment of disease activity, or physician global assessment of disease activity, HAQ-DI, or CRP; plus a reduction in individual SJC and TJC of 20% (ACR20), 50% (ACR50), or 70% (ACR70). VAS assessments involved a 10-cm horizontal scale from 'no disease activity' to 'maximum disease activity.'</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Scores at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16</title>
        <description>The CDAI was calculated as [SJC + TJC + VAS patient global assessment of disease activity + VAS physician global assessment of disease activity]. VAS assessments involved a 10-cm horizontal scale from 'no disease activity' to 'maximum disease activity.' CDAI scores ranged from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity. The SDAI was determined by adding CRP level to the CDAI score. Scores ranged from 0 to 86, with higher scores also indicating increased disease activity. A reduction in either score at the assessment visit reflects improvement in disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16</title>
        <description>Blood samples for laboratory assessments, including hemoglobin level, were collected prior to each dose of study medication. The mean hemoglobin level was determined at Baseline and for assessment visits by averaging the observed hemoglobin level among all participants providing evaluable blood samples. Change from Baseline was calculated as [mean hemoglobin at the assessment visit minus mean hemoglobin at Baseline] and expressed in grams per liter (g/L).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze total B-cell panel via immunophenotyping. Subpopulations were as follows: transitional (cluster of differentiation [CD] 19-positive, immunoglobulin (Ig) D-positive, CD38 medium, CD10-positive); naive (CD19-positive, IgD-positive, CD38 medium, CD27-negative); pre-switch memory (CD19-positive, CD27-positive, IgD-positive); post-switch memory (CD19-positive, CD27-positive, IgD-negative); IgG-positive class-switched (CD19-positive, IgG-positive); IgA-positive class-switched (CD19-positive, IgA-positive); double-negative memory (CD19-positive, IgD-negative, CD27-negative); and plasmablasts (CD19-positive, IgD-negative, CD38 high, CD27 high). Naive B-cell compartment was defined as the sum of transitional and naive B-cells. The sum of memory B-cell subsets with or without double-negative B-cells was also determined.</description>

        <title>Percentage of B-Cells at Baseline by B-Cell Subpopulation Among Nonresponding Participants Treated With Rituximab</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze total B-cell panel via immunophenotyping. Subpopulations were as follows: transitional (cluster of differentiation [CD] 19-positive, immunoglobulin (Ig) D-positive, CD38 medium, CD10-positive); naive (CD19-positive, IgD-positive, CD38 medium, CD27-negative); pre-switch memory (CD19-positive, CD27-positive, IgD-positive); post-switch memory (CD19-positive, CD27-positive, IgD-negative); IgG-positive class-switched (CD19-positive, IgG-positive); IgA-positive class-switched (CD19-positive, IgA-positive); double-negative memory (CD19-positive, IgD-negative, CD27-negative); and plasmablasts (CD19-positive, IgD-negative, CD38 high, CD27 high). Naive B-cell compartment was defined as the sum of transitional and naive B-cells. The sum of memory B-cell subsets with or without double-negative B-cells was also determined.</description>

        <title>Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient Between Percentage of B-Cells at Baseline and Difference in DAS28 Scores Between Baseline and Week 16 Among Participants With Early Remission</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze total B-cell panel via immunophenotyping. Subpopulations were as follows: transitional, naïve, pre-switch memory, post-switch memory, IgG-positive class-switched, IgA-positive class-switched, double-negative memory, and plasmablasts. Naive B-cell compartment was defined as the sum of transitional and naive B-cells. The sum of memory B-cell subsets with or without double-negative B-cells was also determined. Extent of disease response, using change from Baseline to Week 16 in DAS28 score, was correlated to the percentage of B-cells within each subpopulation at Baseline. Correlation is indicated by a correlation coefficient (r) &gt;0.2, with greater values indicating a stronger correlation.</description>

        <title>Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient Between Percentage of B-Cells at Baseline and Difference in DAS28 Scores Between Baseline and Weeks 16, 24, and 32 Among Participants Treated With 8 Courses of Tocilizumab</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze total B-cell panel via immunophenotyping. Subpopulations were as follows: transitional, naïve, pre-switch memory, post-switch memory, IgG-positive class-switched, IgA-positive class-switched, double-negative memory, and plasmablasts. Naive B-cell compartment was defined as the sum of transitional and naive B-cells. The sum of memory B-cell subsets with or without double-negative B-cells was also determined. Extent of disease response, using change from Baseline in DAS28 score, was correlated to the percentage of B-cells within each subpopulation at Baseline. Correlation is indicated by a correlation coefficient (r) &gt;0.2, with greater values indicating a stronger correlation.</description>

            <description>All participants were assigned to receive TCZ 8 mg/kg via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 4 infusions from Baseline to Week 12. Clinical response was assessed at Week 16 using DAS28 to determine subsequent treatment assignment. Participants who achieved early remission, defined as a DAS28 score of &lt;2.6, were transferred to clinical routine care and no longer received study medication. Participants who were considered partial responders, defined as a decrease from Baseline in DAS28 score &gt;1.2 or a score between 2.6 and 3.2, inclusive, received TCZ 8 mg/kg via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 4 additional infusions from Week 16 to 28. Those with assessed as having no response, defined as a decrease from Baseline in DAS28 score ≤1.2 or a score &gt;3.2, received RTX 1000 mg via IV infusion at Weeks 16 and 18.</description>

        <title>Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient Between Percentage of B-Cells at Baseline and Difference in DAS28 Scores Between Baseline and Weeks 16, 32, 40, 48, and 66 Among Nonresponding Participants Treated With Rituximab</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze total B-cell panel via immunophenotyping. Subpopulations were as follows: transitional, naïve, pre-switch memory, post-switch memory, IgG-positive class-switched, IgA-positive class-switched, double-negative memory, and plasmablasts. Naive B-cell compartment was defined as the sum of transitional and naive B-cells. The sum of memory B-cell subsets with or without double-negative B-cells was also determined. Extent of disease response, using change from Baseline in DAS28 score, was correlated to the percentage of B-cells within each subpopulation at Baseline. Correlation is indicated by a correlation coefficient (r) &gt;0.2, with greater values indicating a stronger correlation.</description>

            <description>All participants were assigned to receive TCZ 8 mg/kg via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 4 infusions from Baseline to Week 12. Clinical response was assessed at Week 16 using DAS28 to determine subsequent treatment assignment. Participants who achieved early remission, defined as a DAS28 score of &lt;2.6, were transferred to clinical routine care and no longer received study medication. Participants who were considered partial responders, defined as a decrease from Baseline in DAS28 score &gt;1.2 or a score between 2.6 and 3.2, inclusive, received TCZ 8 mg/kg via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 4 additional infusions from Week 16 to 28. Those with assessed as having no response, defined as a decrease from Baseline in DAS28 score ≤1.2 or a score &gt;3.2, received RTX 1000 mg via IV infusion at Weeks 16 and 18.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life as Assessed Using HAQ-DI</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI evaluates participant-reported quality of life using 8 categories: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other common activities such as running errands and performing household chores. Each category contains multiple questions, which are answered using a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. The overall index score is taken as an average of the individual item responses and may range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate more difficulty in daily living activities. The mean index score at each timepoint was determined by averaging the scores among all participants.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life as Assessed Using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)</title>
        <description>The FACIT-F evaluates quality of life using 5 categories: physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and fatigue (FS). Participants answer each item on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4. The total score is the sum of individual responses across all 5 categories and may range from 0 to 160. The FACIT-General (FACIT-G; range 0 to 108) is the sum of scores for PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB; the FACIT-Fatigue (FACIT-F) trial outcome index (TOI; range 0 to 108) is the sum of scores for PWB, FWB, and FS; and the FACIT-F fatigue (range 0 to 52) is the sum of scores for the FS only. For derivations of the FACIT-F reported here, higher scores indicate better quality of life. The mean score at each timepoint was determined by averaging scores among all participants.</description>

          <title>Quality of Life as Assessed Using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)</title>
          <description>The FACIT-F evaluates quality of life using 5 categories: physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and fatigue (FS). Participants answer each item on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4. The total score is the sum of individual responses across all 5 categories and may range from 0 to 160. The FACIT-General (FACIT-G; range 0 to 108) is the sum of scores for PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB; the FACIT-Fatigue (FACIT-F) trial outcome index (TOI; range 0 to 108) is the sum of scores for PWB, FWB, and FS; and the FACIT-F fatigue (range 0 to 52) is the sum of scores for the FS only. For derivations of the FACIT-F reported here, higher scores indicate better quality of life. The mean score at each timepoint was determined by averaging scores among all participants.</description>

          <title>Change From Week 16 to 32 in Quality of Life as Assessed Using FACIT Among Nonresponding Participants Treated With Rituximab</title>
          <description>The FACIT-F evaluates quality of life using 5 categories: PWB, SWB, EWB, FWB, and FS. Participants answer each item on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4. The total score is the sum of individual responses across all 5 categories and may range from 0 to 160. The FACIT-G (range 0 to 108) is the sum of scores for PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB; the FACIT-F TOI (range 0 to 108) is the sum of scores for PWB, FWB, and FS; and the FACIT-F fatigue (range 0 to 52) is the sum of scores for the FS only. For derivations of the FACIT-F reported here, higher scores indicate better quality of life. The mean score at each timepoint was determined by averaging scores among all participants, and the change in score was calculated as [mean score at Week 32 minus mean score at Week 16].</description>

      <desc>Adverse events (AEs) were assessed at each treatment visit from Baseline to Week 16, at which point participants having achieved early remission completed the study. Those who did not achieve early remission continued to receive treatment, and AEs were assessed until 4 weeks after last dose (TCZ/TCZ) or until Week 66 (TCZ/RTX).</desc>

          <description>All participants were assigned to receive TCZ 8 mg/kg via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 4 infusions from Baseline to Week 12. Clinical response was assessed at Week 16 using DAS28 to determine subsequent treatment assignment. Participants who achieved early remission, defined as a DAS28 score of &lt;2.6, were transferred to clinical routine care and no longer received study medication. Participants who were considered partial responders, defined as a decrease from Baseline in DAS28 score &gt;1.2 or a score between 2.6 and 3.2, inclusive, received TCZ 8 mg/kg via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 4 additional infusions from Week 16 to 28. Those with assessed as having no response, defined as a decrease from Baseline in DAS28 score ≤1.2 or a score &gt;3.2, received RTX 1000 mg via IV infusion at Weeks 16 and 18.</description>
