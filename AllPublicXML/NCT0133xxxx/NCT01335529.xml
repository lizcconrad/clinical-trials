  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) co-infected
      patients are non responders after 48 weeks of the current standard-of-care with
      Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin. The results of re-treatment are disappointing. The addition of
      Boceprevir to the current standard-of-care has been shown to increase the efficacy of therapy
      in HCV mono-infected patients previously treated with a bi-therapy. Knowing that HIV/HCV
      co-infected patients are subject to more rapid hepatic fibrosis as well as to increased risks
      of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, it is important to
      improve the response rate of the re-treatment of hepatitis C in these patients.

      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Boceprevir in
      combination with Peg-Interferon alfa 2b plus ribavirin, in patients co-infected with HIV and
      chronic genotype 1 HCV, and previously treated with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin. 80 subjects
      will be enrolled. The primary endpoint will be the Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) defined
      as undetectable HCV-RNA at Week 24 after the end of therapy.

      The majority of HIV/HCV co-infected patients are non responders after 48 weeks of the current
      standard-of-care with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin. The results of re-treatment are
      disappointing. The addition of Boceprevir to the current standard-of-care has been shown to
      increase the efficacy of therapy in HCV mono-infected patients previously treated with a
      bi-therapy. Knowing that HIV/HCV co-infected patients are subject to more rapid hepatic
      fibrosis as well as to increased risks of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and
      hepatocellular carcinoma, it is important to improve the response rate of the re-treatment of
      hepatitis C in these patients.

      Subjects enrolled in this trial will have many predictive factors of failure: HIV
      co-infection, previous failure to Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin, HCV genotype 1 infection. One
      study reported a SVR rate of 9% after re-treatment with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin in such
      patients. Another trial has shown a substantial increase of the response rate with a
      tri-therapy in HCV mono-infected patients.

      The investigators propose to carry out a multicentric, national, non-randomized phase II
      trial in 80 patients.

      The proportion of patients with F4 cirrhosis will have to be inferior to 50% of enrolled
      subjects.

      The number of null responders to a previous treatment (HCV RNA drop &lt; 2 log10 at W12) and
      without F4 cirrhosis will have to be lower or equal to 20.

      The primary objective of the study is to estimate, in Genotype 1 - HCV/HIV co-infected
      patients, non responders to a previous therapy with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin, the rate of SVR
      after 48 or 72 weeks of a three-drug regimen containing Peg-Interferon, Ribavirin and
      Boceprevir according to the Virologic Response and to compare the SVR rate to a threshold
      rate 20%, lowest rate to consider a therapeutic benefit in this population.

      A pharmacokinetic sub-study including 30 patients will be performed to estimate
      pharmacokinetic parameters of antiretroviral treatment (Atazanavir combined with Ritonavir,
      Raltegravir, Tenofovir) in combination with anti HCV treatment at baseline and W8 and
      pharmacokinetic parameters of Boceprevir at W8.
