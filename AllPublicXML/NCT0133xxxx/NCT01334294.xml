    <textblock>
      ForeseeHome, an FDA-approved home device, was specifically designed for unsupervised
      Preferential-Hyperacuity-Perimeter (PHP) testing of Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
      patients at home by characterizing central and paracentral metamorphopsia . The purpose of
      the current study is to evaluate if, in post-treatment patients, PHP parameters as measured
      with the ForeseeHome are in agreement with clinical decisions and retinal characteristics as
      measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Received intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy for CNV in the study eye (SE), within
             2-12 months prior to the study

          2. Last diagnosis was, and current diagnosis is, no CNV activity in SE eye

          3. Current plan in SE is clinical examination as standard care but at intervals of not
             more than 8 weeks.

          4. Visual acuity of 20/80 or better in SE

          5. Are capable and agree to sign a consent form and participate in the study

          6. Age &gt; 55 year of age

          7. Are able to use a standard computer mouse correctly and without assistance

          8. Have a working telephone landline at the main residence (cellular communication maybe
             available for the study, and then eliminate this requirement)

          9. Clear view of the macular area on fundus photography

         10. Are willing to give their name and contact information to Notal Vision, supplier of
             the device, so that the company can provide direct services if needed (e.g., assist in
             using the home device, report the frequency of usage, coordinate replacement of
             devices in case of a technical problems, etc.)

         11. Agree to be examined by an ophthalmologist if SE shows symptoms of changes during the
             study

         12. Have a US address and do not plan on traveling abroad during the study period

         13. Fluent in English

         14. Perform a reliable ForeseeHome test during the enrollment visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of macular disease other than AMD or glaucoma in SE

          2. Presence of any significant media opacity that precludes a clear view of the macular
             area as identified in SE by biomicroscopy

          3. Any non-macular related ocular surgery performed within 3 months prior to study entry
             in SE

          4. Participant are not enrolled in another stuy that could affect the interval between
             clinical examinations, or the frequency of use of the ForeseeHome device
