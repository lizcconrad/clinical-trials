  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will include patients with relapsed epithelial ovarian
      cancer. In spite of increased rates of complete response to initial chemotherapy, most
      patients with advanced ovarian cancer relapse and succumb to progressive disease.
      Immunotherapy may have potential for consolidation therapy. Dendritic cell vaccine is well
      toleranted in previous studies, with minor side effects and no serious adverse events
      registrated In this study, patients will receive DC-vaccine therapy after response to
      platinum treatment at relapse. The investigtors include patients in good clinical condition
      with no severe symptoms of the disease. If patients relapse during vaccine treatment, they
      will be discontinued from the study.

      The investigators have included hTERT- and survivin mRNA in addition to amplified cancer stem
      cell mRNA in the vaccine.

      Study Period:

        -  Estimated date of first patient enrolled: First quarter of 2011

        -  Anticipated recruitment period: 3 years

        -  Estimated date of last patient completed: First quarter of 2017, follow up to 2022.

      Treatment duration:

      Patients will receive intradermal immunization once a week for 4 weeks followed by monthly
      &quot;vaccine boost&quot; during the first year. Patients that show immunological response will
      continue with vaccination every month the second and third year or as long as there is
      vaccine available. The patients will have follow up for 5 years or until progression of
      disease as evaluated by the investigator.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study needed to be terminated due to new knowledge about cancer vaccines. A new protocol
    with an expected more efficient vaccine is currently being written.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer. Histologic documentation of the
             original primary tumor is required via pathology report.

          -  Completed first line treatment (surgery and adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment with
             carboplatine and paclitaxel)

          -  Relapsed and platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian carcinoma patients with response to
             chemotherapy in recurrent disease
