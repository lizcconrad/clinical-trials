    <description>The electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) is a validated, self-rated version of the C-SSRS designed to uniquely assess both suicidal behavior and ideation. Suicidal ideation is assessed at 5 distinct levels of increasing severity:
Level 1: Wish to be Dead
Level 2: Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts
Level 3: Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act
Level 4: Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan

Level 2: Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts
Level 3: Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act
Level 4: Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan

        <description>The electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) is a validated, self-rated version of the C-SSRS designed to uniquely assess both suicidal behavior and ideation. Suicidal ideation is assessed at 5 distinct levels of increasing severity:
Level 1: Wish to be Dead
Level 2: Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts
Level 3: Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act
Level 4: Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan
Level 5: Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent</description>
