  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect the background characteristics of juvenile cerebral palsy patients aged 2-year or
      older prescribed BOTOX for the treatment of equines foot due to lower limb spasticity,
      compare them with those of patients whose deaths or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to
      the possible spread of toxin are reported through the spontaneous ADR reporting system, and
      discuss potential risk factors for such ADRs.

      1. In each of prospective medical institutions (where BOTOX is expected to be prescribed
           annually to at least 10 juvenile cerebral palsy patients aged 2-year or older), the
           Medical Representative will explain the objectives, subjects and methods of the
           investigation to the prospective investigator (i.e., a physician who will prescribe
           BOTOX and can comply with the protocol of the investigation) and ask for his/her
           participation in the investigation.

        2. When the physician agrees to participate in the investigation, a written agreement will
           be concluded between GSK and the head (e.g. director) of the medical institution prior
           to the start of the investigation.

        3. After the completion of the investigation period, the physician will complete the case
           report form (CRF) for the patients prescribed BOTOX by him/her during the investigation
           period. The information of the patients who developed ADRs will be collected separately
           through the spontaneous ADR reporting system on a daily basis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Background factors:

        The following background characteristics will be compared between the patients collected
        during the investigation and the patients whose deaths or ADRs related to the possible
        spread of toxin are reported through the spontaneous ADR reporting system, to discuss the
        potential risk factors for death or spread of toxin:

          1. severity of indication (cerebral palsy) prior to use of BOTOX

          2. Medical history/concurrent medical conditions (e.g., dysphagia, seizure, pulmonary
             disorder, neuromuscular disorder, and cardiac disorder, and others) ; Yes/No, and if
             yes, specify the diseases

          3. Use of concomitant drugs and non-drug therapies

          4. Dose per kg body weight

          5. Dose per injection site (e.g., gastrocnemius muscle, soleus muscle, tibialis posterior
             muscle)
