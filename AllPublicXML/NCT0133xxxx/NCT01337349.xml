    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double blinded randomized clinical study to evaluate the Effects of
      Pentoxifylline on left ventricular systolic function indices and circulating biomarkers in
      patients with chronic congestive heart failure.

      A few studies all focused in Africa have consistently shown marked beneficial effects of
      pentoxifylline in improvement of left ventricular size and systolic function along with
      marked decrease in biomarkers of heart failure and apoptosis markers on top of standard CHF
      therapy. Furthermore pentoxifylline was shown to have negligible effects on heart rate, blood
      pressure in those studies. Limitations of these studies are that they are largely single
      center originating in the African subcontinent and have never been tested in the North
      American population, particularly Caucasians.

      Despite major advances in medical therapy for congestive heart failure, it is still one of
      the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in North America. Most medications tested for
      improvement of Ejection Fraction with the exception of Beta-Blockers and Ace-Inhibitors have
      been associated with worsening mortality. Pentoxifylline is a medication that has negligible
      effects on myocardial oxygen consumption, yet promising effects on inflammatory markers seen
      in CHF with the possibility of improvement in LV systolic function and symptomology and may
      prove to be a useful addition for CHF patients. This would prove to be especially useful,
      particularly when associated with no major side effects.

      Patients who meet inclusion criteria will have a baseline physical exam, Heart Failure status
      assessment based on the Kansas City Heart Failure Questionnaire, EF assessment based on SPECT
      MUGA, cardiopulmonary exam to evaluate Vo2 max and assessment of left ventricular end
      diastolic and systolic dimensions based on 2D echo and labs drawn to assess circulating
      biomarkers. Patients will than be randomized into the control population where they will
      receive a placebo medication vs. the study population who will receive pentoxiphylline 400mg
      three times daily for 6 months. Patients will also have a one and three month clinic visit to
      assess for any potential change in symptoms and to assess medication compliance. Patients
      will then have a 6 month follow-up with repeat physical exam, Heart Failure status assessment
      based on the Kansas City Heart Failure Questionnaire, EF assessment based on SPECT MUGA,
      cardiopulmonary exam to assess Vo2 Max and assessment of left ventricular end diastolic and
      systolic dimensions based on 2D echo and labs drawn to assess circulating biomarkers.
