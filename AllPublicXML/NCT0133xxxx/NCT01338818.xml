    <measure>Change From Extension Baseline (Week 40) to End of Study (Week 66) in on DSM-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (DSM-IV ADHD RS) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 40 - week 66</time_frame>
    <description>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (DSM-IV ADHD RS) total score consists of 18 items directly adapted from the ADHD symptom list according to the DSM-IV. The DSM-IV ADHD RS total score was calculated as the sum of the Inattentive and the Hyperactive-Impulsive subscores. The 18 items are rated from 0 (&quot;rarely or never&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Very often&quot;). The total score ranges from 0 to 54. Decrease in the DSM-IV ADHD RS total score indicates improvement, therefore a greater decrease (change at Final Visit compared to baseline) indicates a greater improvement in ADHD symptoms. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) applied for each patient with data in extension period. If no post-baseline is available, it is considered as missing.</description>

    <measure>Change From Extension Baseline (Week 40) to End of Study (Week 66) on Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>week 40 - week 66</time_frame>
    <description>SDS,5-self-rated questionnaire to measure the extent a pt's disability due to an illness/health problem interferes with work/school,social life/leisure,family life/home. First 3 items, pts are asked how their symptoms disrupted their regular activities over the past 7d in each using a scale from 0(not at all)-10(extremely) Each subscale(work disability, social life disability, family life disability)can be scored independently or combined into a total score(sum of the non-missing responses for items 1-3)from 0-30,higher scores indicate significant functional impairment. Subscale scores&gt;5 suggest impairment in that subscale area. Final 2 items ask pts about the # of days their symptoms caused them to miss school/work and # of days their symptoms caused them to be underproductive at school/work.(These items were not included in the total score.) Before responding to SDS items 1-3, pts were verbally instructed to recall the past 7d, items 4-5 refer to the last week w/in the item wording.</description>

        <description>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (DSM-IV ADHD RS) total score consists of 18 items directly adapted from the ADHD symptom list according to the DSM-IV. The DSM-IV ADHD RS total score was calculated as the sum of the Inattentive and the Hyperactive-Impulsive subscores. The 18 items are rated from 0 (&quot;rarely or never&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Very often&quot;). The total score ranges from 0 to 54. Decrease in the DSM-IV ADHD RS total score indicates improvement, therefore a greater decrease (change at Final Visit compared to baseline) indicates a greater improvement in ADHD symptoms. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) applied for each patient with data in extension period. If no post-baseline is available, it is considered as missing.</description>

        <description>SDS,5-self-rated questionnaire to measure the extent a pt’s disability due to an illness/health problem interferes with work/school,social life/leisure,family life/home. First 3 items, pts are asked how their symptoms disrupted their regular activities over the past 7d in each using a scale from 0(not at all)-10(extremely) Each subscale(work disability, social life disability, family life disability)can be scored independently or combined into a total score(sum of the non-missing responses for items 1-3)from 0-30,higher scores indicate significant functional impairment. Subscale scores&gt;5 suggest impairment in that subscale area. Final 2 items ask pts about the # of days their symptoms caused them to miss school/work and # of days their symptoms caused them to be underproductive at school/work.(These items were not included in the total score.) Before responding to SDS items 1-3, pts were verbally instructed to recall the past 7d, items 4-5 refer to the last week w/in the item wording.</description>
