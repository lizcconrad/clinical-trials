      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of occupational therapy in
      Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a complex disabling condition progressively affecting activities and
      participation of patients. Occupational Therapy aims to optimise functional performance and
      engagement in meaningful roles and activities. The lack of scientific evidence for the
      effectiveness of Occupational Therapy (OT) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) highlights the urgent
      need for high quality intervention studies. The Dutch clinical practice guideline for OT in
      PD (2008)offers a good basis for conducting an intervention study. The completed OTiP pilot
      underscored the feasibility and the need for a large scale trial.

      The OTiP study evaluates the effectiveness of OT in improving daily functioning of patients
      with PD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not capable of completing the self assessment forms (i.e. due to language problems or

          -  Co morbidity with symptoms that interfere with actively taking part in the
             intervention (e.g psychosis, severe heart condition). Or limitations in activities are
             dominated by the co morbid condition rather than by Parkinson's Disease.

          -  Current participation in other allied health research (i.e. PARKFIT)

          -  Having received occupational therapy intervention in the last 3 months
