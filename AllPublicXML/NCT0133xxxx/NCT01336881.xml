    <textblock>
      This research trial is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from young patients with liver
      cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify biomarker signatures associated with hepatoblastoma subtypes (by microRNA
      array profiling), and their potential correlation with liver developmental stages as well as
      outcome.

      II. To correlate expression array data with copy number array data.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To carry out a focused sequencing interrogation of amplified or deleted genomic regions as
      well as genes in key cell pathways involved in embryonic development and/or stem cell
      signaling pathways for which preliminary data suggests involvement in the pathogenesis of
      hepatoblastoma.

      II. To perform whole exome sequencing in a subset of tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for hepatoblastoma and other liver tumor
      biomarkers by microRNA array profiling and exome sequencing. Results are then compared with
      patients' clinical data.
