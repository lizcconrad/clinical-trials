  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) is a demyelinating and degenerative disorder of the CNS affecting
      vision and spinal cord function. This disease is rare compared to Multiple Sclerosis (MS),
      but it is devastating and often leads to accumulating disability with a 5 year-mortality of
      approximately 30%. Survivors are typically left with severe morbidity secondary to blindness,
      quadriparesis and respiratory failure. No agent has been found to be highly effective in
      halting disease activity. Based on recent outcomes of stem cell transplant trials and reports
      in autoimmune diseases including MS, and based on the mechanisms of NMO, we anticipate that
      stem cell transplantation may provide lasting disease stability for NMO patients. The
      hypothesis of the present trial is that autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplantation in
      patients with NMO will provide lasting benefit in relapse prevention. Specifically, we
      anticipate a 50% reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing relapse over a three
      year period. We will be following patients for a total of five years after transplantation.

      Patients who are deemed eligible will be enrolled and undergo a two stage transplant process
      followed by neurological assessments every 6 months for the following 5 years assessing EDSS,
      visual metrics, MRI, AQP-4 antibodies, MSFC and SF36.
