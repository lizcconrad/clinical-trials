    <time_frame>1,6 and 12 months</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety and tolerability over 12 months, based on evaluation of reported adverse events (AEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events will be summarized in a frequency table and according to MEdDRA preferred term and intensity.
All subjects with AEs will be listed individually with subject number in addition to type of event, start and stop time of event, duration of event, seriousness, intensity, causality, action taken and outcome of the adverse event.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the event of capsular contraction over 12 months, based on the appearance and tenderness of the Subject's buttocks as graded by the investigator.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate anticipated adverse events occurring during the first 2 weeks after treatment and to evaluate pain experienced during injection under local anesthesia.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate whether parameters of the injection procedure have effect on safety or perceived improvement (subject's GEIS assessment and Investigator's GEIS assessment).</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the Subject's satisfaction with his/her buttocks and general appearance up to 12 months using the Subject's questionnaire.</measure>
