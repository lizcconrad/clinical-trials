    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare healthy children to children who have systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a childhood disease that has high risk for low bone mass and
      vertebral compression fractures.

      The purpose of this research study is to measure bone mass in children with SLE using
      different measurement techniques. Children with chronic illnesses are at risk of bone
      fragility. This is important because bone fragility can result in childhood fractures
      especially children with SLE. Therefore better diagnosis technique can lead to better
      management of bone health.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For SLE subjects: Subjects age 5-21 drawn from rheumatology clinic at Children's
             Hospital of Philadelphia diagnosed with SLE for at least 1 month. Also subjects with
             no known vertebral compression fracture of L2.

          -  For Control subjects: Subjects age 5-21. Controls will be a 50% male/female.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For SLE subjects: Subjects with SLE will be excluded if they have conditions or drug
             exposure unrelated to SLE and known to impact growth or bone health.

          -  For Control subjects: Chronic disease or syndrome known to affect growth or bone
             health, prematurity (&lt;37 weeks gestation), or use of any medication known to affect
             growth.
