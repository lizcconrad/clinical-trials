  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I study, the investigators want to vaccine with THERAVAC® (an inactivated toxin
      coupled to melanoma antigen) some patients with advanced metastatic melanoma disease.

      The primary objective is to analyze the safety of the inreasing doses of vaccine.

      The secondary objective is to document whether this vaccine can induce tumor regression in
      immunized patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three treatment cohorts and the inclusion of patients in governed by the
      dose-limiting toxicities in the previous cohort.

        -  the first three patients will receive a dose of 50 µg of Theravac®

        -  second cohort of three patients will receive a dose of 150 µg Theravac®

        -  the third cohort of three patients will receive a dose of 250 µg Theravac® and
           eventually a total of 14 patients will complete the step with the highest dose.

      All the patients will receive four immunizations every three weeks in two intradermal sites
      and in two subcutaneous sites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven cutaneous, uveal or mucosal melanoma.

          2. Melanoma must be metastatic. The origin of the primary could be cutaneous, uveal or
             mucosal and any metastatic stage is accepted, except if brain or leptomeningeal
             localizations are present, or if plasma LDH are elevated more than 1.5 normal upper
             values (see also below).

          3. HLA-A2 positive.

          4. The melanoma must express the tyrosinase gene (positive RT-PCR on a frozen pre-immune
             tumor sample) (see Appendix B).

          5. At least one measurable or non-measurable tumor lesion (see Section 8.1).

          6. Expected survival of at least 3 months.

          7. Karnofsky performance scale ≥70 or WHO performance status of 0 or 1 (see Appendix C).

          8. Vital laboratory parameters should be within normal range, except for the following
             laboratory parameters, which must be within the ranges specified:

             Lab Parameter Range Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl or ≥ 6,25 mmol/l Granulocytes ≥ 1,500/µl
             Lymphocytes ≥ 700/µl Platelets ≥ 100,000/µl Serum creatinin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl or ≤ 177
             μmol/l Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl or ≤ 34.2 μmol/l ASAT and ALAT ≤ 2 x the normal
             upper limits LDH ≤ 1.5 x the normal upper limit.

             congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction within the past six months; unstable

          5. Other serious acute or chronic illnesses, e.g. active infections requiring
             antibiotics, bleeding disorders, or other conditions requiring concurrent medications
             not allowed during this study.

          6. Other malignancy within 3 years prior to entry into the study, except for treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ.

          7. Allergy to kanamycin (used in the preparation of the recombinant protein) or to any
             other aminoglycoside antibiotic.

          8. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessments.

          9. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent
             within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

         10. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.
