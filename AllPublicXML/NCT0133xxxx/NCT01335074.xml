    <textblock>
      Sorafenib is the standard therapy for advanced liver cancer but often shows dose-limiting
      toxicities with the need to reduce the applied dose of the compound. As this limits the
      overall response rate of the therapy, a combination with temsirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR
      signaling, will be investigated regarding safety and tolerability in patients with advanced
      liver cancer under a reduced dose of sorafenib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling pathway have recently been established as novel
      potent anti-cancer agents for solid and hematologic malignancies. Several pre-clinical
      reports have shown a good anti-tumor activity in different HCC models and first reports from
      clinical trials in HCC promise a good efficacy in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor cell
      growth. mTOR inhibition has also been shown to enhance the activity of other cytotoxic
      agents.

      Sorafenib also interferes with tumor cell survival, proliferation and angiogenesis by
      inhibiting molecular pathways independent of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. We therefore expect
      an at least additive effect by inhibiting two parallel but independent intracellular pathways
      in HCC tumor cells that will prolong overall survival and time to progression.
