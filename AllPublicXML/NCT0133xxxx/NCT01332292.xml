      This study will investigate the effect of dosing with fluticasone furoate 100 μg (micrograms)
      in asthmatic subjects aged 5-11 years of age. Fluticasone furoate is currently under
      development as the inhaled corticosteroid component of a combination product containing an
      inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist.

      The study will be a randomized two-way crossover, with a placebo control. During each
      treatment period subjects will receive a daily dose via a novel dry powder inhaler for 14
      days. Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited to this study, with the aim that 20 will
      complete the study. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and serum cortisol levels will be
      investigated.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled into one of two cohorts based upon age; the younger cohort was enrolled after a review of the safety/pharmacokinetic data of at least six participants from the older cohort. Each participant was assigned to treatment randomly; assignment was not to be influenced by whether participants were in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A Baseline assessment was carried out on Day 1 of the first treatment period. Participants were then randomized to one of the two possible treatment sequences (fluticasone furoate [FF] 100 µg followed by placebo; placebo followed by FF 100 µg). Results are reported by intervention, regardless of the age of the participant.</pre_assignment_details>

Inhaled FF 100 µg and matching placebo were administered once daily in the morning (Day 1 to Day 14) via a Dry Powder Inhaler. The washout period between the 14-day treatment periods was at least 7 days.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations. Refer to the General Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

        <description>During the pharyngometry assessment, participants inhaled through a wavetube, which had a mouthpiece with the same dimensions as the mouthpiece on the dry powder inhaler used for this study. This technique was used to measure the size of the throat and mouth (oropharynx) in the form of pharyngograms. Pharyngometry data were recorded for each day (Days 1 and 14 of the respective treatment period) using the mean of four measurements (pharyngograms), and the average oropharyngeal cross-sectional area was calculated.</description>

          <description>During the pharyngometry assessment, participants inhaled through a wavetube, which had a mouthpiece with the same dimensions as the mouthpiece on the dry powder inhaler used for this study. This technique was used to measure the size of the throat and mouth (oropharynx) in the form of pharyngograms. Pharyngometry data were recorded for each day (Days 1 and 14 of the respective treatment period) using the mean of four measurements (pharyngograms), and the average oropharyngeal cross-sectional area was calculated.</description>

The mean of the two inhalation profile measurements was used for each day (Days 1 and 14 of the respective treatment period), and the inhalation time was determined.</description>

        <description>The total emitted dose (TED) is defined as the mass (micrograms) of the nominal dose that passes beyond the throat. The recorded inhalation profiles of the participants and the mouth-throat (oropharyngeal) models of the sizes that approximated to pharyngometry measurements of the participants were used in conjunction with the electronic Lung (eLung) for in vitro assessment. The eLung is a breathing simulator that replicates the selected inhalation profile with an active inhaler placed at the lips end of the selected ororpharyngeal model. After the dose is emitted from the inhaler, the analysis and assay of throat deposition and material passing beyond the throat was used to derive the nominal, minimum, and maximum predicted total emitted dose.</description>

          <description>The ex-throat dose (ETD) and the “nominal ETD” is the mass (micrograms) of active investigational material that passes beyond the throat, nominal being the mean.The recorded inhalation profiles of the participants and the mouth-throat (oropharyngeal) models of the sizes that approximated to pharyngometry measurements of the participants were used in conjunction with the electronic Lung (eLung) for in vitro assessment. The eLung is a breathing simulator that replicates the selected inhalation profile with an active inhaler placed at the lips end of the selected ororpharyngeal model. After the dose is emitted from the inhaler, the analysis and assay of throat deposition and material passing beyond the throat was used to derive the nominal, minimum, and maximum predicted ETD and ETD &lt;2 microns.</description>

        <description>PR, QRS, QT, QTcB, QTcF, and RR were measured at Baseline and Day 14 of the respective treatment period. Baseline is defined as the pre-dose measurement at Day 1 for each period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Day 14 minus the Baseline value. QTcB is the QT duration corrected for heart rate by Bazett’s formula. QTcF is the QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia’s formula.</description>
