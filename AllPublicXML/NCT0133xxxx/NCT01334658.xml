    <textblock>
      This is a study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and impact of two intraocular
      irrigating solution (BSS ® versus glucose-bicarbonate-Ringer Lactate - GBRL) on the health of
      the cornea after cataract surgery by phacoemulsification.

    <description>A group received BSS ® (ALCON LABORATORIES, INC.) and another group received glucose-bicarbonate-Ringer Lactate (GBRL) [500 cc. Ringer Lactate (GLICOLABOR, Pharmaceutical LTD.) enriched with 1.5 ml of glucose in water (25%) and 08 ml of sodium bicarbonate (8.4%)] as a solution for irrigation during surgery.
All surgeries were performed by single surgeon (HON), using the standard surgical technique quick-chop. Immediately before surgery, solutions for irrigation [BSS ® (ALCON LABORATORIES, INC..) and glucose-bicarbonate-Ringer Lactate (GBRL)] were brought to the operating table in a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius. The microcoaxial Phacoemulsification was performed under a phaco Legacy Series 20000 (ALCON LABORATORIES, INC..).</description>
