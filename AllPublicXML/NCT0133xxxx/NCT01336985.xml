    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Cancers in other parts of the body often spread to the liver, developing tumors which in
           many instances cannot be removed with surgery. Liver chemoembolization is a treatment
           that is routinely performed to control liver tumors in those who cannot have surgery. It
           has been shown to prolong survival, but does not cure the cancer. During
           chemoembolization very tiny beads (drug-eluting beads, or DEB) containing chemotherapy
           drugs (usually doxorubicin) are administered directly into the blood vessels of a liver
           tumor. The drug within the beads is then released into the tumor whilethe beads
           temporarily interrupt the tumor s blood supply.

        -  Irinotecan, a drug commonly given intravenously to treat colon cancer, has been given in
           chemoembolization procedures in four other studies that have shown that the treatment is
           generally well tolerated. Researchers are interested in determining whether giving the
           drug irinotecan directly into the liver using drug-eluting beads is not only well
           tolerated but also provides a larger dose directly to the tumor as determined by tumor
           and normal liver tissue biopsies. The liver biopsies are an optional portion of the
           study.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of chemoembolization with irinotecan for tumors
      caused by cancer that has spread to the liver.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have melanoma, colon, or another intra-abdominal
      cancer that has spread to the liver.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests,
           tumor imaging studies, and liver biopsies.

        -  Participants will receive up to 3 DEB chemoembolization treatments about 6 weeks apart.

        -  After two treatments, participants will have imaging studies to see if the tumors have
           shrunk, and those whose tumors have shrunk may have a third treatment.

        -  Multiple liver biopsies may be performed and blood samples will be taken to determine
           how much drug is in the tumor and the circulation, and to see how the tumor reacts to
           the drug.

        -  Participants will return for followup visits for up to 1 year....

      Background:

        -  Clinical evidence suggests that hepatic chemoembolization may prolong survival in
           patients with hepatic metastases.

        -  Early studies have indicated that chemoembolization using irinotecan drug eluting beads
           may be more effective in treating hepatic metastases from colon or melanoma primary
           tumors.

      Objectives:

        -  Primary Objective:

           --To determine the safety of hepatic chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads
           containing 100mg of irinotecan

        -  Secondary Objectives:

             -  To determine the serum pharmacokinetics and tumor tissue concentrations achieved
                following hepatic chemoembolization with irinotecan-eluting beads

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients &gt; 18 years of age with pathologically proven hepatic metastases from the
           gastrointestinal tract, or melanoma with unresectable hepatic lesions.

        -  Patients whose extent of hepatic metastases represents &lt;60% of total liver volume AND
           whose extrahepatic metastatic disease is determined to be minimal

        -  Patients must be ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2 and a life
           expectancy of more than 3 months.

        -  Patients must have adequate organ function.

        -  Patients must not have had chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biological therapy for at
           least 4 weeks prior to starting study treatments.

        -  Patients are not to receive conventional chemotherapy or therapeutic monoclonal
           antibodies while on study.

        -  Patients must not have an acute, critical illness.

      Design:

        -  A Phase Ib trial in which patients undergo hepatic chemoembolization with drug-eluting
           beads containing 100mg irinotecan.

        -  Up to 15 patients will be enrolled over 1 year to accrue 10 evaluable patients.

        -  Patients will undergo up to 3 chemoembolizations.

        -  Following chemoembolization, patients will have serial serum pharmacokinetic samples
           drawn and tumor biopsies in order to measure serum and tumor tissue concentrations of
           irinotecan

        -  Patients will be followed for one year after completion of the last treatment.
