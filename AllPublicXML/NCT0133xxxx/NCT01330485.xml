  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nested within a longitudinal study investigating emotion regulation skills and subsequent
      depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder, the effectiveness of a systematic affect
      regulation training (ART; Berking, 2010) is evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests that deficits in general emotion regulation skills (GEMS; e.g., the
      abilities to be aware of, understand, accept, tolerate and modify negative emotions) help
      maintain symptoms in depression, as well as in other mental disorders often co-occurring with
      depression. Therefore, systematically targeting these deficits can be hypothesized to enhance
      efficacy and efficiency of current treatments for this severe and highly prevalent disorder.
      However, at this point there is a lack of prospective studies that investigate the causal
      effects of a broad range of potentially relevant GEMS on depression, evaluate the effects of
      systematically enhancing these skills with specific interventions, and investigate whether
      the level of comorbid symptom load moderates the importance of GEMS in depression. Therefore,
      we assess GEMS, depressive symptom severity (DSS) and comorbid symptom load in 150
      individuals seeking treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) across multiple assessment
      points, and clarify causal pathways between GEMS and DSS. Nested within the longitudinal
      design, prior to individual cognitive behavioral therapy for depression (iCBT-D) participants
      will be randomly assigned either to (a) a group-based training of GEMS (ART = affect
      regulation training; Berking, 2010), (b) an active treatment condition designed to control
      for unspecific effects of psychotherapeutic interventions (i.e.,
      common-factor-based-treatment control condition, CFT-C), or (c) a wait-list-control condition
      (WLC). Potential effects of systematically enhancing GEMS on DSS will be assessed during an
      8-week pre-iCBT-D interval (stand-alone effects) and during the first four months of
      subsequent iCBT-D (augmentation effects). Assessment will include retrospective self-ratings,
      observer-based ratings, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Thus, in addition to
      providing important information on the relevance of GEMS for the maintenance of depression,
      the study will help evaluate different methodological approaches of identifying deficits in
      GEMS.
