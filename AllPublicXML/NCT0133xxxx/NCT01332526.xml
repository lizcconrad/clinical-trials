  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fructose intake from added sugars has increased dramatically over the last century and has
      recently been implicated as potential contributor to metabolic syndrome, obesity,
      hypertension, inflammation and kidney disease. Fructose differs from the other sugars
      because, uric acid is generated during its metabolism. Serum uric acid levels have been found
      to correlate with the intake of fructose and added sugars. In turn, an elevated serum uric
      acid has also been shown to be associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and
      metabolic diseases. On the other hand complexity of fructose metabolism in each individuals
      results of the various magnitude of hyperuricemia induced by fructose intake. The magnitude
      of uric acid production in each patient may reflect individual predisposition to endogenous
      urate production in a face of relatively normal fasting uric acid concentration. Therefore
      the oral fructose tolerance test might reveal an occult purine disturbances which plays
      casual role in either metabolic disturbances or organ damage.

      The aim of this study is to see whether is a relationship between fructose induced
      hyperuricemia and metabolic disturbances , inflammatory state and organ damage in obese and
      various stages CKD patients.

      The study will be performed in two experimental groups. Proposed study groups Study I
      Patients with BMI&gt; 30 and metabolic syndrome. Patient with BMI&gt; 30 without metabolic
      syndrome. Normal healthy controls. Study II Patients with CKD stage III and uric acid &lt; 7
      mg/dl Patients with CKD stage III and uric acid &gt; 7 mg/dl Patient with asymptomatic
      hyperuricemia and eGFR &gt; 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, , uric acid &gt; 7 mg/dl Hemodialysis patients

      Characteristics of the particular patients group- including criteria:

      10- 15 participants in each subset of each group age 18-65 y. Gender: females and males in
      equal proportion. Group I Patients with BMI&gt; 30 and metabolic syndrome ( ATP III). Patient
      with BMI&gt; 30 without metabolic syndrome. Normal healthy control- healthy persons( without
      renal disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, BMI &lt; 25;normotensives ).

      Group II Patients with CKD stage III (GFR 30-59 ml/min/1,73 m2) and uric acid &lt; 7 mg/dl.

        -  without diabetes mellitus proteinuria &lt; 3,5 g/24 h without immunosuppressive agents,
           ACEi, ARB, allopurinol treatment well controlled hypertension ( &lt; 140/90 mmHg) Patients
           with CKD stage III(GFR 30-59 ml/min/1,73 m2) and uric acid &gt; 7 mg/dl

        -  without diabetes mellitus proteinuria &lt; 3,5 g/24 h without immunosuppressive agents,
           ACEi, ARB, allopurinol treatment well controlled hypertension ( &lt; 140/90 mmHg)

      Patient with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, uric acid &gt; 7 mg/dl with normal renal function
      Hemodialysis patients.

        -  CKD: nondiabetic nephropathy

        -  duration hemodialysis 3-48 months

        -  Hb-11-13 g/dl

        -  well controlled hypertension ( &lt; 140/90 mmHg)

        -  without ACEi, ARB, allopurinol treatment

        -  residual diuresis will be estimated for last 48 hours-between mid and next dialysis
           Method of investigation All patients and controls ( but hemodialysis) will present after
           overnight fast. Baseline tests include 24 hr urine collection for: sodium, calcium,
           phosphorus, creatinine, uric acid, NAG, albumin will be carry out and the same morning
           fasting sample of blood for: creatinine, cystatin C , uric acid, sodium, glucose,
           insulin, triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol, calcium, phosphorus, hsCRP. BP will be
           determined as the mean of three readings taken 5 min apart while sitting. Next in all
           patients and controls fructose tolerance test will be performed. The test consists of
           giving 1 gram/kg b.w. of fructose p.o. with blood collection at 0,30,60 and 120 min
           afterward for serum uric acid determination and uric acid area under the curve will be
           calculated. The calculated area under curve is the measure of occult uric acid
           disturbance when compared to controls.

      Day before the urine collection the ABPM , BMI, IM (intima media ratio) , renal duplex
      ultrasound (RI) will be done

      Measure BMI, waist circumference
