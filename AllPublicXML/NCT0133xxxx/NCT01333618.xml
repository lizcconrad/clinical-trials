  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that implantation of inferior vena cava filter was safe and
      effective in the prevention or reduction of fatal pulmonary thromboembolism in numerous
      clinical researches. When acute deep venous thrombosis need transcatheter thrombolysis,
      transfemoral Günther Tulip Filter implantation could avoid catheter across the Günther Tulip
      Filter. Although incidence of significant filter tilting (&gt;10°) is not high (13%-16%), severe
      tilting of the Günther Tulip Filter may be associated with difficulty or sometimes
      impossibility of retrieval. It has been reported that a simple technique of keeping tension
      of the delivery system may prevent significant tilting of the transjugular Günther Tulip
      Filter in an in-vitro study. But no clinical study of prevention transfemoral Günther Tulip
      Filter from tilting has been reported. The investigators conducted a randomized, controlled
      study to test whether the introducer curving technique is useful to decrease the extent of
      tilting of transfemoral Günther Tulip Filter.

      The study was designed as a double-blind randomized controlled trial, with research assessors
      and patients intended to be blind to the intervention status. The staff members performing
      the assessment were not involved in implementing any aspect of the intervention. 108 patients
      were randomized to accept curving introducer Günther Tulip Filter and transcatheter
      thrombolysis or straight introducer Günther Tulip Filter and transcatheter thrombolysis. The
      assessments include the tilting angle between the axes of inferior vena cava and Günther
      Tulip Filter after implantation; the tilting angle between the axes of inferior vena cava and
      Günther Tulip Filter before retrieval; the fluoroscopy time of Günther Tulip Filter
      retrieval; the rate of retrieval hook adhering vascular wall; the success rate of retrieval.

    <description>The Günther Tulip filter (Vena Cava MReye Filter Set; William Cook Europe, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) The amplitude of introducer curvature was 5°-15° less than the angle between the inferior vena cave axis and the approached iliac vein axis and the distance between the vertex of the curved angle and the hook of the filter was 2-4cm less than the distance between the level of the renal vein confluence and the furcation of inferior vena cave.</description>
