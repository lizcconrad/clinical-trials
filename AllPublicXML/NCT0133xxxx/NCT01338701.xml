  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether acupuncture can help to decrease the number and severity of
      headaches in people who have Traumatic Brain Injury. The aim of this study is to compare two
      different types of acupuncture—either Traditional Chinese Acupuncture or ear acupuncture—to a
      group that receives no acupuncture at all. Acupuncture has been demonstrated to reduce pain,
      improve health-related quality of life, prevent migraine headaches, and improve tension and
      chronic daily headaches.

      This is a 12 week study. If eligible, participants will be randomly assigned to 1of 3 groups:
      ear acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, or the usual care group.

      Subjects receiving acupuncture will:

        -  meet with one of the acupuncturists who will conduct her first assessment

        -  come to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) 10 times over a 6-week period to receive
           acupuncture treatments from a licensed acupuncturist

      Subjects in the usual care group will:

        -  not receive any acupuncture treatments

        -  continue usual treatment plan

        -  be given the option to receive 10 acupuncture treatments between the 6- and 12-week
           period

      All subjects will also:

        -  complete questionnaires at 3 different times: baseline (beginning of study), after 6
           weeks, and after 12 weeks. These questionnaires will assess headaches, overall health
           and quality of life

        -  complete a daily headache diary

        -  continue to be treated for their headaches

        -  continue taking prescription and over-the-counter medications for any conditions being
           treated

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Auricular (Ear) Acupuncture is administered in a step-wise, algorithmic acupuncture approach in which needles are inserted at specific auricular landmarks. The sequence and location of needled points is determined by the participant's severity of headache pain at presentation and response to needling. Between six and nine points are needled in each treatment session depending on the individual's response (i.e., a decrease or persistence of headache pain). In-dwelling ASP needles are inserted at the end of each session. Participants are instructed to remove the needles after 3 days, or sooner if pain or redness developed at a needle site. Ten 45-minute acupuncture treatment sessions are administered over 6 weeks.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Traditional Chinese Acupuncture (TCA)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A semi-standardized form of Traditional Chinese Acupuncture (TCA) is administered, incorporating the insertion of up to 22 acupuncture needles associated with each individual participant's: (1) primary headache pattern (up to three pairs of points); (2) secondary headache pattern (up to 2 pairs of points); (3) Ah-Shi or tender points (up to 4 points); (4) constitutional points (source points on two meridians); and, (5) up to 2 pairs of additional points from a selected list. Point selection was reassessed every two weeks per TCM diagnostic and treatment principles. While the majority of points were located on the limbs, points also included local points of tenderness to the head, as well as the front and back of the torso. Ten 60-minute TCA sessions are administered over 6 weeks.</description>
