    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Assess the relative bioavailability of 2 oral formulations of samatasvir (capsule and
           tablet prototype test formulation)

        -  Compare the amount of study drug that is in the blood after taking either the capsule
           form of the drug or the tablet form of the drug while fasting.

        -  Determine the amount of study drug that is in the blood after eating a meal.

        -  Evaluate the safety of the tablet form of samatasvir in healthy people.

    <textblock>
      Each participant will receive each of the formulations in a crossover design. Part A Periods
      1 and 2: Participants will receive either samatasvir capsules or tablets according to
      randomization under fasting conditions on Days 1 and 8. Part A Period 3: All participants
      will receive samatasvir tablets under fed conditons on Day 15.

      Each dose will be separated by a 7-day wash-out period. Part B: All participants will receive
      samatasvir capsules under fed conditons on Day 1.
