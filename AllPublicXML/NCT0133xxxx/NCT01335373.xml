  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginitis is the most common gynecologic diagnosis in the primary care setting. In
      approximately 90 percent of affected women, this condition occurs secondary to bacterial
      vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis or mixed infection.

      Neo-Penotran Forte is registered for treatment of these most common vaginal infections.
      Efficacy and safety of this product is already established, and this observational study was
      designed to learn more about practical use of Neo-Penotran® Forte in real life setting.
