      The study is a two-arm, randomised, double-blind, international, multi-centre phase II trial
      of cediranib in Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS).

      The study aims to confirm the ability of cediranib to halt disease progression in patients
      with metastatic ASPS, as measured by the change in tumour size at 24 weeks after
      randomisation, and to produce objective response according to RECIST criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged 16 years and older with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of ASPS will be
      recruited. Eligible patients will be randomised to receive cediranib (30 mg daily po) or
      placebo (30 mg daily po) in a 2:1 ratio. At 24 weeks post randomisation, treatment will be
      unblinded after which time all patients on placebo and those who have not progressed on
      active treatment will be given cediranib. Treatment will then continue until objective
      disease progression or death.

             entry)

          2. Age 16 years and older

          3. Availability of archived tissue blocks or unstained slides to enable confirmation of

          6. Progressive disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 within 6 months prior to randomisation

          7. Measurable metastatic disease using RECISTv1.1, i.e. at least one lesion 10 mm in
             diameter (15 mm in short axis for nodal lesions) assessable by CT (or MRI for brain
             metastases).

          8. Patients with brain metastases are permitted provided disease is controlled with a
             stable dose of corticosteroid and/or non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsant
