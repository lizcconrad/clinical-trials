  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe bacterial infections are associated with mortality of about 30%. Patients with
      moderate to severe bacterial infections given early and appropriate empirical antibiotic
      treatment are at a lesser risk for a fatal outcome, with odds ratios ranging from 1.6 to 6.9.
      However only about 2/3 of patients worldwide are given early and appropriate empirical
      antibiotic treatment. About 40% of patients treated with antibiotics are given superfluous
      treatment.

      TREAT is a computerized decision support system for antibiotic treatment in inpatients with
      common bacterial infections. TREAT is based on a state of the art stochastic model of the
      domain (a causal probabilistic network) and uses a cost benefit model for antibiotic
      treatment, including costs assigned to future resistance. It was tested in a randomized
      controlled trial in 3 countries and shown to improve the percentage of appropriate empirical
      antibiotic treatment while at the same time reduce hospital stay and the use of
      broad-spectrum antibiotics. The main limitation of TREAT is inherent in the limited
      information available within hours of presentation.

      A second attractive approach to improve antibiotic treatment is to use techniques that do not
      depend on cultures, and thus shorten the time to identification of the pathogen to a few
      hours only. The LightCycler® SeptiFast test from Roche performs in vitro nucleic acid
      amplification test for pathogens causing bloodstream infections.

      The purpose of the clinical trial is to show that the combined system TREAT/PCR assays will
      improve the outcome of inpatients with moderate to severe bacterial infections, while at the
      same time reducing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, with no or little additional costs.
      A secondary objective will be to assess the sensitivity and specificity of whole blood PCR,
      using TREAT as the reference standard.

TREAT will provide advice for the empirical antibiotic treatment and unless the caring physician can justify a deviation from this recommendation, TREAT's recommendation will be implemented (yes or no antibiotic treatment and type of antibiotic).

Blood will be collected aseptically and the test will be performed once daily between 1000AM-1700PM (results available daily at 1700 PM). PCR results and a PCR-revised TREAT recommendation will be reported to the patient's physician in charge and treatment will be revised accordingly.</description>
