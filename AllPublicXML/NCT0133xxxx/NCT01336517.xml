      The main purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the effect of a lower leg brace on
      walking efficiency and community walking in people who have weakness in one side of the body
      caused after a stroke. The evaluation will consist of several tests that will evaluate
      movement, tightness, balance and sensation in affected leg.

      To comprehensively evaluate the effect of an AFO on ambulatory function and loading in
      hemiplegic gait. This study is addressing important questions regarding the effect of an AFO
      on gait and introduces technology for quantifiable objective assessment of AFO effectiveness.
      It will attempt to identify if AFO wear compliance increases community ambulation and walking
      efficiency bilaterally. Research is needed to fully understand how compliance affects
      mobility outcomes.
