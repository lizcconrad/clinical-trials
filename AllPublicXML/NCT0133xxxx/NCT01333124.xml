    <textblock>
      This phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative chemoradiotherapy with
      gemcitabine (400mg/m2, weekly) for resectable pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the complete (R0) resection rate for
      patients with and resectable pancreatic cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy
      and curative surgery. An experimental arm that result a complete resection rate of at least
      90% would merit further study. With 90% power to reject that null hypothesis that the true
      complete resection rate is ≤75% with a type I error level of 5%, evaluable 53 patients are
      required. Considering the 20% unevaluable patients due to the immediate distant metastasis
      after treatment7, 8, 17 and 10% follow up loss, a total of 64 eligible patients will be
      enrolled.

    <description>Radiation: chemoradiotherapy with Gemcitabine All patients will receive gemcitabine 400 mg/m2 as an intravenous 30-min infusion on day 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 with radiotherapy.After 4-6 week from end date of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo preoperative evaluation including CT, PET, CA19-9, CEA. If the patient is feasible for resection on this evaluation, the surgery is performed in 1 to 2 weeks. After surgery, patients will receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 as an intravenous 30-min infusion on day 1, 8, and 15 for every 28 days. Subjects will be treated for at least 1 cycle and to a maximum of four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy unless there is documented relapse, unacceptable adverse events or withdrawal of consent.</description>
