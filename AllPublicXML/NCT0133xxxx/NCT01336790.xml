    <textblock>
      The purpose of the National Lymphatic Disease and Lymphedema Registry is to collect health
      information in order to study the disease classification, natural history, and impact of
      Lymphatic Disease, Lymphedema and Related Disorders and its treatments and medical outcomes.

      This project represents the inauguration of a National Patient Registry for Lymphatic
      Diseases. This project will be completed through an affiliation with the Lymphatic Research
      Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote research and the
      development of new therapies for patients with lymphatic diseases, including lymphedema. The
      registry will provide researchers with much-needed clinical data to study the impact of
      diseases of the lymphatic system, in order to develop improved treatments and find a cure for
      lymphatic diseases, lymphedema, and related disorders. The establishment of this initiative
      is a major step forward in research for direct study of groups of patients with lymphatic
      disease. In the future, this project will be able to be linked with a tissue bank, in which
      tissue and blood samples derived from patients will be made available for research into human
      disease states. A national patient registry and tissue/cell bank program paves the way for
      future clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies designed to treat lymphatic
      disease in human subjects.
