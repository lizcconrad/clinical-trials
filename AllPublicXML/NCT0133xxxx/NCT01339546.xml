    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to assess the change in ambulatory care visit rates for acute
      otitis media between the period before (2001-2009) and after the introduction of the
      13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) (2011-2013) among children less than 5
      years old in the United States.

      NAMCS-The survey utilizes a three stage sampling design based on (1) probability of selecting
      a primary sampling unit (PSU) (2) probability of selecting a physician within the PSU and (3)
      probability of selecting a patient within the physician practice. This last probability is
      defined to be the exact number of office visits during physician's specified reporting week
      divided by the number of patient record forms completed. NHAMCS- For producing unbiased
      national estimate, this survey utilizes four stages (a) Probability of selecting a PSU (b)
      probability of selecting a hospital with in PSU (c) probability of selecting an emergency
      department (ED) or outpatient department (OPD) within the hospital (d) probability of
      selecting a visit within ED or OPD. The overall probability of selection is the product of
      the probabilities at each stage. The inverse of the overall selection probability is the
      basic inflation weight.
