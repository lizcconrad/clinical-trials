    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that subcutaneous Abatacept is effective in reducing synovial
      inflammation, osteitis, and erosions in Rheumatoid Arthritis as assessed by low field
      extremity MRI and X-ray.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) Abatacept to inhibit
      progression of structural joint damage in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      receiving MTX and have inadequate disease control (defined as an ESR based DAS28 ≥ 3.2 AND ≥
      6 swollen and ≥ 6 tender joints). The study consists of a screening period (Days -21 to -7),
      a baseline visit (Days -20 to -1), and a treatment Period (open label Abatacept 125 mg SC for
      24 weeks). All the visits may occur at the indicated week +/- 2 days. The last efficacy
      assessments are to be conducted at Week 24 and subjects are to be contacted by telephone for
      a safety follow-up 2 months after the final study agent has been administered.

      The maximum length of the study is 35 weeks, which includes the 2-week screening period,
      1-week baseline period, 24-week open label treatment, and 8-week follow-up period. Eligible
      subjects are to continue their current MTX treatment regimen, a stable dose of at least
      15mg/week, during the entire length of the study (24 weeks). At Day 0, patients who meet
      inclusion criteria, will be dosed from Day 0 to Week 24 with Abatacept 125 mg SC injection.

      Subjects are to self-administer SC study agent at Weeks 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17,
      18, 19, 21, 22, and 23 and are not required to return to the study site at these weeks. All
      other visits, SC study agent is to be administered while the subject is at the study site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects currently experiencing active moderate to severe RA according to the revised
             1987 ACR criteria for the diagnosis of RA at screening. The ESR-based DAS 28 must be
             equal or greater than 3.2

          2. MTX inadequate responders with moderate to severe RA. Subjects currently receiving MTX
             for at least 12 weeks and who have received MTX at a stable dose (≥15mg/week) for at
             least 6 weeks prior to treatment (Day 0). They must be biologic drug naive

          3. All subjects must receive at least 5 mg oral folic acid weekly.

          4. At screening active RA as defined by ≥ 6 swollen joints and ≥ 6 tender joints with
             erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥ 28 mm/h.

          5. Subjects must be seropositive with documented rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic
             citrullinated peptide (anti CCP) positivity. If a documented history of RF or anti CCP
             positivity is not available, RF and anti CCP titers will be obtained at screening

          6. MRI evidence of at least one joint with osteitis or erosion attributable to RA as
             determined by an MRI musculoskeletal radiologist. Any joint of the dominant hand or
