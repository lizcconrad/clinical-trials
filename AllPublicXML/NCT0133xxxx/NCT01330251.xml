    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of gastric bypass surgery on type II diabetes. The
      study will recruit patients with type II diabetes having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, patients
      without type II diabetes having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and control subjects (patients
      having gastroscopy, but no surgery). Targeted enrollment is 30 patients per group. Samples of
      intestine are taken prior to surgery in gastroscopy, during surgery, and 6 months after
      surgery during gastroscopy. Meal test with incretin measurements, and feces and blood
      samplings are performed before and after surgery

      Hypotheses are:

        -  The pathogenesis of type II diabetes is linked to changes in the expression of
           intestinal endocrine cells

        -  The changes in the incretine excretion after the gastric bypass surgery partly explain
           the amelioration of type II diabetes

        -  The oxidation of lipoprotein is diminished after the gastric bypass surgery slowing the
           development of atherosclerosis

        -  The immunologic functions of the intestine are changed by the gastric bypass surgery
           attenuating systemic inflammation

        -  The gastric bypass surgery changes cholesterol and bile acid metabolism

        -  The gastric bypass surgery changes the fecal microbiota

      Primary end points are:

        -  Changes in the amounts of endocrine cells in ventricle, duodenum and jejunum

        -  Changes in the incretine secretion studied with liquid meal test

        -  Changes in the oxidation of lipoproteins

        -  Changes in the immunologic markers in ventricle, duodenum and jejunum

        -  Changes in the amounts of phytosterols, cholesterol metabolites and bile acids

        -  Changes in fecal microbiota
