    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of memantine
      (Namenda®) for cognitive and behavioral impairment in adults ages 18-50 years with autism
      spectrum disorders (ASD). This is an exploratory, 12-week, pilot study, seeking to determine
      whether Namenda is efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of adults with ASD. The
      study results will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger randomized controlled clinical
      trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical power.

    <description>Number of participants with reduction in ASD symptom severity defined as a reduction in Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) score from baseline of greater than or equal to 30%.
The SRS is a 65-item rating scale completed by an informant to measure the severity of autism spectrum symptoms as they occur in natural settings.</description>

    <description>Number of participants with reduction in ASD symptom severity defined as an NIMH Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) Improvement score less than or equal to 2. The CGI-Improvement is a clinician-rated measure of improvement. Scores range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) for PDD.</description>

    <description>Memantine (Namenda®) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003 and by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products in 2002 for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Evidence from available treatment trials of memantine in ASD and non-ASD populations of youth and adults strongly suggest that memantine could be an effective agent for the treatment of adults with ASD.
During the 12 weeks of study duration, subjects will be evaluated at weekly intervals for the first 4 weeks and thereafter every 3 weeks. Memantine will be administered in divided dose twice a day in the morning and evening. Titration of study medication will be guided by a forced titration schedule with an option for slower titration or holding at lower dose per clinician judgment. Safety, effectiveness, response and side effects will be evaluated.</description>

Evidence from available treatment trials of memantine in ASD and non-ASD populations of youth and adults strongly suggest that memantine could be an effective agent for the treatment of adults with ASD.
During the 12 weeks of study duration, subjects were evaluated at weekly intervals for the first 4 weeks and thereafter every 3 weeks. Memantine was administered in divided dose twice a day in the morning and evening. Titration of study medication was guided by a forced titration schedule with an option for slower titration or holding at lower dose per clinician judgment. Safety, effectiveness, response and side effects were evaluated.</description>
