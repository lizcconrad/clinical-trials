  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the BD 4mm x 32G Ultra-Fine Nano pen
      needle provides equivalent glycemic control to the BD 8mm x 31G Ultra-Fine short pen needle
      as measured by fructosamine (FRU) among Lantus®, Levemir®, and/or NPH users taking one or
      more single daily injections of greater than 40 units of insulin.

      Glycemic control, injection pain, leakage, preference, comfort, and other parameters will be
      compared between the 4mm x 32G and the 8 mm x 31 G pen needle after three weeks of use of
      each device. Sufficient numbers of subjects taking Lantus® as their basal insulin will be
      enrolled so as to allow for pre-specified analysis of this subgroup.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized two period crossover study. Each subject's participation is
      expected to last about seven weeks and includes a brief enrolment period followed by two
      consecutive three week treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2).

      In Period 1, subjects will use the first assigned study pen needle (either the 4mm Nano or
      the 8mm Short) to self-administer daily all their pen-based diabetes medications. Upon
      completion of Period 1, subjects will switch to the alternate pen needle for Period 2. The
      randomization schedule will determine the order of pen needle use.

      Blood samples for determination of fasting blood glucose and serum fructosamine
      concentrations will be collected at baseline (Visit 2) and the end of Period 1 (Visit 3) and
      Period 2 (Visit 4). Blood samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Glycemic Control as Measured by Percent (%) Absolute Change in Fructosamine</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks per pen needle</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of glycemic control will be the percent difference in FRU assessed at the end of Period 1 compared to FRU assessed at the end of Period 2. The average percent difference in FRU between the Nano and Short pen needles, with the Short as a reference, must be shown to be no more than +/- 20% with 95% confidence. General linear models will be used, adjusting for baseline FRU. This outcome measure was to be determined for the total subject population as well as for the subset of Lantus users.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glycemic Control as Measured by Fasting Blood Glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks per pen needle</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of glycemic control will be the percent difference in fasting blood glucose (FBG) assessed at the end of Period 1 and Period 2. The average percent difference in FBG between the Nano and Short pen needles, with the Short as a reference, must be shown to be no more than +/- 20% with 95% confidence. General linear models will be used, adjusted for baseline FBG. This outcome measure will be determined for the total subject population as well as for the subset of Lantus users.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Leakage Event</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks per pen needle</time_frame>
    <description>Leakage will be assessed by the subject after any injections of long-acting insulin of greater than 40 units. Subjects will record in their study diary if they observed insulin leakage from the injection site.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative Injection Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Period 2 (six weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete a 150 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a measure of the pain perceived with the needle they are using at that point in the study relative to the needle they used the previous period. The VAS is anchored at the center (0mm) with &quot;as painful&quot; and at each extreme with &quot;much less painful (-75mm) and &quot;much more painful (+75mm). The sign of each VAS score will be adjusted for the order of pen needle (PN) use, such that the 8mm short PN is always considered the reference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Period 1 (three weeks) and Period 2 (six weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>After using each pen needle for three weeks, subjects will be asked to respond Yes or No to the question &quot;Were the pen needles used for long acting insulin injections at doses greater than 40 units during this past study period acceptable to you?&quot; This outcome measure will be determined for the total subject population as well as for the subset of Lantus users.</description>

        <description>The measure of glycemic control will be the percent difference in FRU assessed at the end of Period 1 compared to FRU assessed at the end of Period 2. The average percent difference in FRU between the Nano and Short pen needles, with the Short as a reference, must be shown to be no more than +/- 20% with 95% confidence. General linear models will be used, adjusting for baseline FRU. This outcome measure was to be determined for the total subject population as well as for the subset of Lantus users.</description>

          <description>The measure of glycemic control will be the percent difference in FRU assessed at the end of Period 1 compared to FRU assessed at the end of Period 2. The average percent difference in FRU between the Nano and Short pen needles, with the Short as a reference, must be shown to be no more than +/- 20% with 95% confidence. General linear models will be used, adjusting for baseline FRU. This outcome measure was to be determined for the total subject population as well as for the subset of Lantus users.</description>

        <description>The measure of glycemic control will be the percent difference in fasting blood glucose (FBG) assessed at the end of Period 1 and Period 2. The average percent difference in FBG between the Nano and Short pen needles, with the Short as a reference, must be shown to be no more than +/- 20% with 95% confidence. General linear models will be used, adjusted for baseline FBG. This outcome measure will be determined for the total subject population as well as for the subset of Lantus users.</description>

        <title>Relative Injection Pain</title>
        <description>Subjects will complete a 150 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a measure of the pain perceived with the needle they are using at that point in the study relative to the needle they used the previous period. The VAS is anchored at the center (0mm) with &quot;as painful&quot; and at each extreme with &quot;much less painful (-75mm) and &quot;much more painful (+75mm). The sign of each VAS score will be adjusted for the order of pen needle (PN) use, such that the 8mm short PN is always considered the reference.</description>
