      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential role of Axitinib (AG-013736) in the
      treatment of unresectable/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of an investigational drug, Axitinib following prior antiangiogenic
      therapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
      a primary cancer of the liver. Angiogenesis is a physiological process involving the growth
      of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. A tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that can
      inhibit angiogenesis. In this study, patients with advanced HCC who have failed prior
      antiangiogenic therapy, will receive Axitinib in cycles of 4 weeks. Axitinib is an oral,
      potent and selective inhibitor of angiogenesis. This study will evaluate the response rate of
      HCC following treatment with Axitinib as well as safety, feasibility, overall survival of
      patients, progression-free survival, and quality of life in persons with unresectable HCC.
      The study also compares response determined by RECIST to response determined by Choi
      Criteria.
