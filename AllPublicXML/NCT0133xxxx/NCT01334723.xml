  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study aims to quantify the relationship between 5-alpha-reductase
      inhibitor (5ARI) adherence / length of therapy and the likelihood of acute urinary retention
      (AUR) or prostate surgery in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as well as the
      economic impact associated with these medical encounters. The Integrated Health Care
      Information Solutions (IHCIS) database will be utilized for this study (2000-2006).

MPR was calculated as the number of days that 5-ARI therapy was taken divided by the total number of follow-up days. For this analysis, the threshold for compliance was set at MPR = 70%.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Risk of Acute Urinary Retention and Surgery Based on an MPR Threshold of 70%</title>
        <description>Claims-based definition of acute urinary retention (AUR) and surgery based on the presence of an ICD-9-CM code of 599.6x, 788.20, or 788.29 and CPT procedure codes, respectively. For this analysis, we evaluated the association between compliance with 5-ARI therapy (measured by medication possession ratio [MPR]) and risk of AUR or surgery. MPR was calculated as the number of days that 5-ARI therapy was taken divided by the total number of follow-up days. For this analysis, the threshold for compliance was set at MPR = 70%.</description>

          <description>Claims-based definition of acute urinary retention (AUR) and surgery based on the presence of an ICD-9-CM code of 599.6x, 788.20, or 788.29 and CPT procedure codes, respectively. For this analysis, we evaluated the association between compliance with 5-ARI therapy (measured by medication possession ratio [MPR]) and risk of AUR or surgery. MPR was calculated as the number of days that 5-ARI therapy was taken divided by the total number of follow-up days. For this analysis, the threshold for compliance was set at MPR = 70%.</description>
          <population>Enrolled Population: participants in the IHCIS database with a diagnosis of benign prostate hyperplasia or enlarged prostate as indicated by ICD-9-CM code on claims (222.2x or 600.xx). Participants were included if they had at least 60 days of 5-ARI therapy during the enrollment period, 6 months of continuous enrollment, and no prior surgery.</population>
