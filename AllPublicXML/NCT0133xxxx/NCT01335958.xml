        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception for women of
             childbearing potential

          -  Measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at
             least one dimension

        Inclusion Criteria Specific to Patients with Ovarian Cancer:

          -  Advanced, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has
             progressed or relapsed during or within 6 months of the most recent treatment with a
             platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen, and for which no standard therapy exists

          -  For patients in the dose-expansion cohort of the study only, no more than two prior
             chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer

        Inclusion Criteria Specific to Patients with Pancreatic Cancer:

          -  Incurable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease for which no standard therapy
             exists, consisting of unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including
             recurrence of previously-resected disease that is considered unresectable with
             curative intent

          -  No more than one chemotherapy regimen (approved or experimental) administered in the
             metastatic setting

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anti-tumor therapy, including chemotherapy, biologic, experimental, or hormonal
             therapy within 4 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Palliative radiation to bone metastases within 2 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (including
             HIV and atypical mycobacterial disease, but excluding fungal infections of the nail
             beds)

          -  Current Grade &gt;1 toxicity (except alopecia and anorexia) from prior therapy or Grade
             &gt;1 neuropathy from any cause

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy
             (or recombinant antibody-related fusion proteins)

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis

          -  Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (progressing or requiring
             anticonvulsants or corticosteroids for symptomatic control). Patients with a history
             of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided that they meet all of the following
             criteria: evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS, radiographic demonstration
             of improvement upon the completion of CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim
             progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening
             radiographic study, and the screening CNS radiographic study is &gt;= 8 weeks since
             completion of radiotherapy and &gt;= 4 weeks since the discontinuation of corticosteroids
             and anticonvulsants.

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications

          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases, such as cardiovascular
             disease (including stroke, New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease
             or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening, unstable arrhythmias, and
             unstable angina); nervous system, pulmonary (including obstructive pulmonary disease
             and history of symptomatic bronchospasm), renal, hepatic, endocrine, or
             gastrointestinal disorders; or a serious non-healing wound or fracture

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding
