      Study Primary Objectives:

      To compare glycemic control, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (A1C), between insulin glargine
      and 75% insulin lispro protamine suspension/25% insulin lispro as add-on therapies in
      subjects who failed oral combination therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin.

      Study Secondary Objectives :

      To compare the following measures between subjects receiving insulin glargine or 75% insulin
      lispro protamine suspension/25% insulin lispro:

        -  Incidence of hypoglycemia

        -  Change in weight

        -  Change in serum lipid profile

        -  Percentage of subjects achieving A1C levels ≤7%

    <description>Lantus (insulin glargine) administered subcutaneously 15 minutes before the evening meal for 24 weeks. The initial dosage was 10 units /day for 7 days. This was followed by titration every 7 days by increasing the dosage until control was established. Insulin dosages were increased according to a subject's glucose values determined by Self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG).
The starting dosage of metformin or sulfonylurea was the dosage the subject was taking when randomized. The dosage was to remain unchanged during the course of the study. The administration schedule was left to the discretion of the investigator.</description>
