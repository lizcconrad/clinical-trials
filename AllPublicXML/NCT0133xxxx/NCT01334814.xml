      The proposed study is a randomized, single blind trial of intermittent versus continuous
      stimulation among essential tremor (ET) patients with a chronic history of continuous
      stimulation. The trial is 10 weeks in length with clinical evaluations (about 60 minutes)
      performed on weeks 1, 2, 6, and 10, and phone interviews (about 5 minutes) on weeks 3, 4, 5,
      7, 8, and 9. The study includes outcome measures of tremor, stimulation-induced side effects,
      sleep quality, and voltage threshold for optimal tremor control and sustained side-effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  individuals with essential tremor who are at least 6 months status-post thalamic
             stimulator placement

          -  maintained a consistent chronic or intermittent stimulation schedule for at least 4
             consecutive weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  no changes in stimulation parameters for at least 2 consecutive months prior to study
             enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with clinically significant dementia (i.e., a score less than 24 out of 30 on
             the Mini Mental Status Exam14)

          -  women who are not post-menopausal

          -  patients with other significant neurological or psychiatric disease other than
             essential tremor

          -  patients treated with pallidotomy or thalamotomy

          -  patients with significant psychiatric disturbance as determined by Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual-IV criteria which would make informed consent/cooperation
             problematic
