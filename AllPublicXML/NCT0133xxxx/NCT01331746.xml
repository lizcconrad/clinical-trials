      A study to look at the effectiveness of a drug called APD515, designed to be applied to the
      lining inside the mouth, at relieving dryness of the mouth. Study will compare one week of

          -  For females of child-bearing potential: ability and willingness to use a highly
             effective form of contraception (e.g., abstinence from sexual intercourse, surgical
