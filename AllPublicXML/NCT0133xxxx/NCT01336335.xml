    <textblock>
      Recent evidences suggest that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can contribute to cardiovascular
      disease even in the absence of hypertension. However, there are few data regarding the impact
      of OSA on the sympathetic system in apparently normotensive patients with OSA as well as the
      impact of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure in different sites of activation
      (heart, peripheral nerves and circulating catecholamines)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>improvement in sympathetic activity in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in MSNA will be quantified as burst frequency over time (bursts per minute) and as burst frequency corrected for heart rate values (bursts per 100 heartbeats)in the begining and after 3 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>improvement in sympathetic activity evaluated in different sites of activation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>All measurement will be performed at the begining and after 3 months. Blood: blood and 24 hour urine will be collected for norepinephrine quantification.
Heart: Early (15 min) and delayed (3 hr) planar images will be taken after injection of (123)I-MIBG. The mean counts of the whole heart and the mediastinum will be obtained to calculate heart-to-mediastinum count ratios from the early images (H/Me) and from the delayed images (H/Md) and the myocardial washout rate (WR).
