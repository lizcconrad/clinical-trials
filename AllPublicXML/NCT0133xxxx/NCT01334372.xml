      This investigation is a feasibility study conducted in a VA outpatient treatment setting. The
      study is designed to test the feasibility of implementing a novel way of working with
      suicidal patients, the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS). The
      primary purpose of the proposed project is to determine if it is possible to train clinicians
      working in the Mental Health Clinic at the Denver VA Medical Center (VAMC) to utilize this
      therapeutic framework. This project is extremely timely in relation to expectations of future
      increased clinical demands among potentially high-risk Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation
      Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans who may become suicidal in the years to come.

    <description>First, as discussed above, suicidality is the focus of treatment rather than one of many symptoms being treated. Second is the emphasis on patient and therapist collaborating on treatment rather than the therapist dictating how therapy progresses. Beyond those two basic tenets, each therapist is free to utilize their current clinical skills to conduct psychotherapy.</description>
