      In this study, the investigators will determine the utility of Tamoxifen, a non-cytotoxic
      agent, to improve quality of life, biochemical parameters, and bone marrow involvement in
      systemic mastocytosis patients having 1) up to 20% bone marrow infiltration by mast cells
      and/or 2) mediator-release symptoms which are not controlled by tolerated doses of standard
      &quot;non-cytotoxic&quot; medications regardless of the percentage bone marrow involvement by
      mastocytosis. The dose of Tamoxifen will be 20 mg/day and the duration of treatment will be
      for one year. Patients currently taking interferon alfa, imatinib mesylate, or cladribine
      will be excluded until these medications have been stopped.
