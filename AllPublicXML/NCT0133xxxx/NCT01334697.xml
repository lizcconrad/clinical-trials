          -  No clinically important abnormal physical or laboratory findings at the screening
             examination.

          -  Normal or clinically acceptable ECG.

          -  Normal blood pressure (systolic: 90-140 mmHg; diastolic: 50-90 mmHg) and heart rate
             (40-100 bpm).

          -  Body Mass Index of 19.0-29.0 (kg/m2).

          -  Ability to communicate well with the investigator and to comply with the requirements
             of the entire study.

          -  Willingness to give written informed consent (prior to any study-related procedures
             being performed) and to be able to adhere to the study restrictions and examination
             schedule.

          -  For female subjects with childbearing potential: use of a known highly effective
             method of birth control, defined as those which results in a low failure rate: i.e.
             less 1% per year, (contraceptive pills, intrauterine contraceptive device, implants,
             vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence), for at least three consecutive months
             prior to the study, during the study and one month after the end of the study.

          -  For male subjects with partners of child bearing potential: use of appropriate
             contraceptive methods (vasectomy, condoms or sexual abstinence), for at least the
             study period and one month after the end of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Administration of any investigational drug in the period within three months prior to
             informed consent.

          -  Use of any prescription medication during the period 0 to 30 days or over-the-counter
             medication during the 0 to 5 days before entry to the study.

          -  Donation or loss of greater than 400 ml of blood in the period 0 to 12 weeks before
             entry to the study.

          -  Serious adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to any drug.

          -  Inability to communicate or co-operate with the investigator because of a language
             problem, poor mental development or impaired cerebral function.

          -  History of drug dependence (except tobacco) or psychiatric illness within the past 2
             years.

          -  Consumption of alcohol within 24 hours prior to dose administration.

          -  Presence of pain incurred by unknown causes.

          -  Pregnancy or nursing.

          -  Positive urine drug screen for drugs with a high potential for abuse and low
             persistence in the urine.

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking during study days.

          -  Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigators, is likely to interfere
             with the successful collection of the measures required for the study.
