    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if surgery is superior to non-operative care for
      sciatica caused by a lumbar disc herniation. This study will include patients that have had
      severe sciatica for greater than 4 months which reflects the wait time of the Canadian health
      care system. This study is an opportunity to make an important contribution to medical
      science as there is no &quot;top tier&quot; evidence for or against this highly prevalent surgery.
      Although there have been several recent randomized trials in the field, all have been marred
      by a large number of patient crossing over from non-operative to operative treatment. Due to
      the wait for spine surgery, the Canadian system has a built-in delay that prevents such a
      cross over of patients. This study capitalizes on this unique opportunity to perform a high
      caliber surgical trial. Patients consenting to be in the study will be randomly assigned to
      expedited surgery within three weeks or standardized non-operative care while they wait on
      the surgeons list for consultation and then surgery (minimum wait of 9 months). The study
      will assess pain, function, quality of life, satisfaction, and work status to determine if
      one treatment is superior.
