      To investigate possible problems or questions in safety and efficacy of ADOAIR 100 DISKUS and
      ADOAIR 50 AEROSOL 120 in Japanese pediatric patients with bronchial asthma for a long term
      under the practical use conditions. In this special drug use investigation, the following
      items shall be handled as the priority investigation items for information collection.

        1. Systemic effects accompanying steroid administration; influences on adrenocortical
           function, influences on bone metabolisms (fracture, osteoporosis, etc.), cataract,
           glaucoma

        2. Events related to nervous system, musculoskeletal system and circulatory system; tremor,
           headache, cramp, tachycardia, etc.
