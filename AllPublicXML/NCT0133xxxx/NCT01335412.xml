    <textblock>
      This is an active electronic surveillance using data from the Defense Medical Surveillance
      System (DMSS) to detect and characterize serious, rare adverse events occurring within 42
      days after vaccination with the Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine IXIARO within the US Military,
      to detect adverse events that occur more frequently after IXIARO and to electronically follow
      up pregnancies during or shortly before which IXIARO was administered.

      There will be no intervention and no individuals contacted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female active duty U.S. military personnel ≥ 17 years of age who either
             received at least one dose of IXIARO (IXIARO exposed group) or at least one dose of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have an ICD-9-CM code suggestive of one of the predefined adverse
             events screened for in IC51-401 prior to vaccination with IXIARO cannot with certainty
             be classified as being &quot;disease free&quot; at study entry and will be excluded for that
             adverse event.
