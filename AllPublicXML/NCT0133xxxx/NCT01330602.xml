  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is, to instigate a reduction in atherosclerotic burden
      within the carotid arteries in the intervention group compared to the control group and to
      demonstrate parallel improvements in cardiovascular and overall health status relative to
      usual care
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals at intermediate risk account for a large proportion of patients presenting with
      atherosclerotic events. The barriers to reducing this problem relate to the expense of an
      unselective primary prevention strategy among a group where the majority will not have
      events, as well as the difficulty of getting apparently well subjects to adhere to lifestyle
      and pharmacologic management.

      An outcome-based study would require large numbers and would be unlikely to be funded without
      proof of concept. CIMT will be used as a validated surrogate of atherosclerotic status and
      future cardiovascular events in this study.

      As such, this study will use CIMT (as both a delineator of risk and in the primary endpoint),
      a marker of atherosclerotic burden (the disease process rather than a surrogate), to address
      the unresolved issue about how to most efficiently manage intermediate risk subjects with a
      family history of premature atherosclerosis by combining better selection of such individuals
      for active treatment and recommended lifestyle changes with a DMP strategy to optimise their
      successful application in the longer-term.

      The Intima-Media thickness guidance of Primary prevention in Relatives of individuals with
      Early onSet atherosclerosiS (IMPRESS) Study will test the following null hypothesis:

      In intermediate risk, first-degree relatives (i.e. mother, father, brother or sister) of
      individuals with premature atherosclerosis, a CIMT-targeted DMP for primary prevention (the
      IMPRESS intervention) incorporating more intensive non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      management, provides no better reduction of atherosclerotic burden (as determined by the
      change in CIMT from baseline to follow-up completion) than usual health care management
      during three years follow-up.

      Study Design The study hypotheses will be examined via a randomised controlled primary
      prevention/intervention trial comparing an individualised DMP with usual clinical care of
      middle-aged (40-65 years old) subjects who have a family history of premature cardiovascular
      disease and are determined to be at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event within the
      next 5 years7, 22.

      Study Centres

      As a multicentre study, participants will be recruited from three centres:

        -  Princess Alexandra Hospital (Brisbane, Australia): responsible site investigator
           Associate Professor Karam Kostner

        -  Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute/ The Alfred Hospital (Melbourne, Australia):
           responsible site investigator Dr Melinda Carrington

        -  National University Health System and Novena Heart Centre (Singapore): responsible site
           investigator Professor Desley Hegney

      Participants This study will be conducted in a group of 40-65 year old adults.

      IMPRESS Study will test the following null hypothesis:

      In intermediate risk, first-degree relatives (i.e. mother, father, brother or sister) of
      individuals with premature atherosclerosis, a CIMT-targeted DMP for primary prevention (the
      IMPRESS intervention) incorporating more intensive non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      management, provides no better reduction of atherosclerotic burden (as determined by the
      change in CIMT from baseline to follow-up completion) than usual health care management
      during three years follow-up.

      Primary End-Point Consistent with the study hypothesis, the primary study end-point is change
      in CIMT from baseline to three years, as determined by a blinded core laboratory and analysed
      on an intention-to-treat basis according to random study group allocation.

      Secondary End-Points

      The secondary endpoints are change from baseline to three years in the following variables:

      i) Plaque length (carotid artery) ii) Internal CIMT iii) General health and well being (as
      measured by the SF-12 18 and EQ-5D 19) iv) Mental health (as determined by the Arrol 20 +/-
      CESD 21) v) Health care costs vi) Modifiable risk factors for atherosclerotic disease other
      than diabetes ( i.e. smoking, dyslipidaemia, obesity and hypertension) vii) Absolute
      cardiovascular risk profile 22 and risk of diabetes (as determined by the Type 2 Diabetes
      Risk Assessment Tool [AUSDRISK]) Score 23) viii) Diabetic status (as determined by fasting
      glucose) ix) All-cause mortality/ cardiovascular hospitalisation

    <description>All participants randomised into the IMPRESS Intervention group will undergo tailored health profiling.This individual assessment will be carried out within the clinic setting.
The key elements of the IMPRESS intervention include:
Promoting a healthy lifestyle
Supporting lifestyle and risk modification
Encouraging active self-management of risk and chronic disease
Improving coordination of care
Pharmacological therapy All the individuals in the intervention group will receive a comprehensive report on their risk status and ideal goals.</description>

    <description>Usual Care Following the assessment of absolute cardiovascular risk, usual care participants will be provided a report outlining areas in which improvements could be made for the prevention of atherosclerotic burden.
No restrictions will be made in respect to usual care management. As such, the prescription of standard medications for primary prevention of atherosclerotic burden based on individual risk factors is anticipated in 20-30% of usual care participants.
At 18 months and three years those in the usual care arm will be invited to undergo repeat CIMT measurements, pathology, absolute risk score calculation and health-related questionnaires as part of the structured study follow-up</description>
