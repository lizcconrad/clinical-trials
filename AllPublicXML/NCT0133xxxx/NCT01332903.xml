    <description>To investigate the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of AZD5069 in human subjects by measuring the amount of [14C] radioactivity in plasma and whole blood and the resulting area under the concentration-time curve from zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC), to the last measurable concentration (AUC(0 t)).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of AZD5069 in human subjects by measuring Plasma [14C] AZD5069:AZD5069 (cold) ratios for concentrations and selected pharmacokinetic parameters (AUCs and Cmax).</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the excretion of AZD5069 in human subjects by measuring the amount and percentage of radioactive dose recovered in urine, faeces, and renal clearance.</measure>
    <time_frame>From pre-dose until 168hours post last dose</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD5069 given orally</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening visit, Day 12, up to follow up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments will include adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis and physical examination. Absolute values and change in baseline for any of these parameters will be reported.</description>
