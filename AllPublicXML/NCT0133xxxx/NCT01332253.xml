    <measure>Number of Doses of Fentanyl Administered in the Postoperative Period Prior to Discharge.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the primary objective of reduced fentanyl use in the post-operative period, the number of fentanyl doses (0.5 mcg/kg IV) administered in the post-operative period prior to discharge will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Pain as Measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 30 Minutes Post-procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's self-reported pain at 30 minutes post-procedure will be measured using a VAS scale. The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The subject is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance, in mm, on the 100 mm line between the &quot;No Pain&quot; anchor and the subject's mark. The score would be between 0 and 100. A lower score represents less pain while a higher score represents more pain.</description>

    <description>o evaluate the secondary objective of pain, the patient's self-reported pain at 90 minutes post-procedure will be measured using a VAS scale. The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The subject is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity.

    <description>To evaluate the secondary objective of pain, the patient's self-reported pain at 120 minutes post-procedure will be measured using a VAS scale. The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent.

    <measure>Parent Satisfaction With Regards to Pain Management Post Procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the secondary objective of pain, parental satisfaction during the post-operative period will be measured with regards to pain management. The Parental Satisfaction Survey asked the parent to base their response on their child's management from the time they arrive in the recovery room until they were discharged. Question 1 asked &quot;How satisfied were you with your child's pain management at the time of discharge?&quot;</description>

        <description>The patient's self-reported pain at 30 minutes post-procedure will be measured using a VAS scale. The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The subject is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance, in mm, on the 100 mm line between the &quot;No Pain&quot; anchor and the subject's mark. The score would be between 0 and 100. A lower score represents less pain while a higher score represents more pain.</description>

        <title>Postoperative Pain as Measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 120 Minutes Post-procedure.</title>
        <description>To evaluate the secondary objective of pain, the patient's self-reported pain at 120 minutes post-procedure will be measured using a VAS scale. The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors (No Pain, Worst Possible Pain). The VAS is self-completed by the respondent. The subject is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance, in mm, on the 100 mm line between the &quot;No Pain&quot; anchor and the subject's mark. The score would be between 0 and 100. A lower score represents less pain while a higher score represents more pain.</description>

        <title>Parental Satisfaction With Vomiting Control in the Post-Operative Period.</title>
        <description>To evaluate the secondary objective of pain, parental satisfaction during the post-operative period will be measured with regards to vomiting control. The Parental Satisfaction Survey asked the parent to base their response on their child's management from the time they arrive in the recovery room until they were discharged. Question 3 asked &quot;How satisfied were you with your child's vomiting management during the study?&quot;</description>
