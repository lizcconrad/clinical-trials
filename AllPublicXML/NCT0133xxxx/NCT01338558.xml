    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Avastin
      (Bevacizumab) added to standard mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with Stage
      IV metastatic colorectal cancer. According to K-RAS gene mutation status, patients will be
      assigned or randomized to receive either Avastin 5 mg/kg intravenously (iv) on Day 1 of each
      2-week cycle or cetuximab 400 mg/m2 iv on Day 1 followed by 250 mg/m2 iv every week, in
      addition to mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
