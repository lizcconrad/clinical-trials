  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) prior to surgery for lower gastrointestinal (colon and
      rectal) cancer is associated with improved survival, but also adversely affects physical
      fitness, potentially rendering patients unfit for major surgery or increasing the risk of
      adverse outcome (death and serious complications) after major surgery. The investigators aim
      to obtain pilot data showing that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT)reduces objectively
      measured exercise capacity (fitness).

      Purpose: To evaluate the effects of chemoradiotherapy on pre−operative fitness of patients
      prior to major colorectal cancer surgery.

      Design: Patients will act as their own case−control.

      Patients will be consented at the earliest available opportunity following the decision that
      they have surgically treatable disease and they consent to pre−operative NACRT. Consent for
      the study will be gained as an outpatient. At &quot;visit 1&quot; patients will undergo CPET, as is our
      current standard practice, prior to commencing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. As part of the
      assessment, they will have pulmonary function testing (static lung volumes, lung diffusing
      capacity). They will then undergo 6 weeks of long course NACRT, as is standard current
      practice at our institution. At &quot;visit 2&quot;, approximately four to six weeks following
      chemoradiotherapy another CPET test will be repeated. This is also current standard practice
      at our institution. Data from visit 1 and visit 2 will be compared in a paired manner. A
      statistician will be consulted to assess the degree of normality of the data, the statistical
      tests to use, and for power calculations. At no point will any treatments be postponed or
      changed solely for the purposes of collecting data for the research.

    <description>Exercise capacity (fitness) before and after NACRT will be assessed using CPET.We have pilot data on an upper gastrointestinal cancer cohort that shows that neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone results in lower levels of fitness (mean fall VO2@LT of 2.19ml/kg/min), which relates to survival before stomach and oesophageal surgery in a group of patients in Liverpool. These data also suggest that the insult of chemotherapy and surgery increases mortality</description>

        Colorectal cancer is the third commonest cause of cancer related death (after breast and
        lung cancer) in the United Kingdom and the second commonest in non smokers. Around 100 new
        cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed each day in the UK. In 2002 there were 34,889 new
        cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed in the United Kingdom, and approximately 17,000 deaths
        (CRUK 2006). Almost three quarters of bowel cancer cases occur in people aged 65 and over.
        Within England, mortality rates are generally higher in the north of the country.
