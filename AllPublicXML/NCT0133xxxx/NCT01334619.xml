  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The retrograde infraclavicular brachial plexus block has been proved an effective and safe
      approach. Realtime ultrasound guide will facilitate a successful peripheral nerve block. The
      purpose of this study was to determine the medium effective volume required to produce an
      effective retrograde infraclavicular block using an ultrasound (US)-guided technique.

    <textblock>
      Thirty adults undergoing elective upper limb surgery received an US-guided retrograde
      infraclavicular block. The initial concentration of 0.5% ropivacaine injected was 30 ml,
      which was subsequently varied at a ratio of 1: 1.2 for each consecutive patient according to
      the response of the previous patient. The medium effective volume (EV50) was determined using
      the Dixon and Massey up-and-down method. The effective volume in 95% of patients (EV95) was
      calculated using probit regression.
