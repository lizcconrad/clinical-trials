  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Terlipressin is an effective and safe treatment for bleeding caused by rupture of oesophageal
      varices, which are life-threatening complications of liver cirrhosis.

      Oesophageal varices are abnormal dilatation of veins occurring in the lower oesophagus, which
      can develop in patients with cirrhosis. Bleeding caused by rupture of these varices is a
      life-threatening complication with mortality between 20-50%.

      Such bleeding can be treated with drug therapy and/or endoscopic; endoscopic therapy consists
      of a flexible tube equipped with a camera at the terminal end, allowing for visualizing and
      treating the oesophageal varices.

      In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of terlipressin -
      Glypressin 1 mg, powder and solvent for solution for injection.

      The non-interventional observational study &quot;Follow-up of Glypressin (terlipressin) clinical
      efficacy in the treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices&quot; aims to demonstrate that
      administration of Glypressin (terlipressin 1 mg) controls the bleeding in such patients.

        60 estimated eligible participants with an age of 18-70 years, suspected or diagnosed with
        bleeding oesophageal varices. Patients have cirrhosis (from any cause, any Child class) and
        upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage

             suspected or diagnosed of liver cirrhosis, with bleeding oesophageal varices
             visualized endoscopically.

        (An important upper gastrointestinal bleeding is one requiring at least 2 units/24h of
        transfused blood).
