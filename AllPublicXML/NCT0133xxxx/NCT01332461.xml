  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective cross-sectional database study using administrative data (study
      period: 1/1/2003 through 7/31/2008). Managed care enrollees (aged &gt;40 years) having at least
      one Hospitalization with primary or secondary diagnosis of COPD (ICD code 491.xx, 492.xx and
      496.xx) or at least one Emergency Room (ER) visit with primary diagnosis of COPD (index
      event) during the study period was the target population. All subjects were required to have
      one year of pre-index period baseline data. COPD events of interest were ER, Hospital and
      physician visits followed by oral corticosteroids (OCS) or antibiotics (Ab) within 7 days.
      Other censoring events were treatment switch; loss of enrollment; &gt;60-day gap between
      medication fills; or end of study period.

      This study is a non descriptive hypothesis testing study. Key study hypotheses are listed
      below.

      Specifically the study hypotheses for the primary outcome being tested were:

      Ho: There is no difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization between FSC and OMT Ha:
      There is a difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization between FSC and OMT

      Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and OMT Ha: There is a
      difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and OMT

    <time_frame>Maximum of 1 year after index date (Jan 1, 2004 through May 30, 2008)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants (par.) with a COPD-related hospitalization/ ER visit was computed during follow-up (FU) and was standardized by dividing by the total days of FU in each cohort since par. had different lengths of FU. The number of par. per 100 person-years was computed as: numerator = total number of par. with a COPD-related hospitalization/ER visit; denominator = sum of the time of FU in years across all par./100. The index date is defined as the date of discharge from a hospitalization/ER visit for COPD that had a maintenance medication dispensed within 60 days post-discharge.</description>

    <description>The number of participants having a COPD-related event was computed during the follow-up and was standardized by dividing by the total days of follow-up in each cohort since patients had different lengths of follow-up. Four types of COPD events were defined: COPD-related hospitalization, emergency room (ER) visit, physician visit with a prescription (Rx) for oral corticosteroid or antibiotic within 3 days of the visit, or combined occurrence of any of the aforementioned three types.</description>

    <time_frame>Maximum of 1 year after index date (Jan 1, 2004 through May 30, 2008)</time_frame>
    <description>Cost categories included medical, pharmacy, and total calculated as the sum of medical and pharmacy. Costs were computed during a variable follow-up period and were standardized on a per-month basis. COPD-related medical costs were computed using claims with a primary diagnosis of COPD, and COPD-related pharmacy costs were computed using the paid amounts of pharmacy claims for prescription medication used for COPD.</description>

Four types of COPD events were defined: COPD-related hospitalization, emergency room (ER) visit, physician visit with a prescription (Rx) for oral corticosteroid or antibiotic within 3 days of the visit, or combined occurrence of any of the aforementioned three types.</description>
