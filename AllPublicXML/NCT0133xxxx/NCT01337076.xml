  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sponsor values the progression of hearing healthcare practice and acknowledges a need for
      re-evaluation of indications for determining adult cochlear implant candidacy. This need
      arises from current research, peer reviewed literature, and technological advancement with
      concomitant performance outcomes. To address this specifically, the Sponsor proposes to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Cochlear™ Nucleus® implant system with a revised
      indication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing research, as discussed, supports the opinion that current candidacy criteria are set
      conservatively. The Sponsor, in addition to the support of recent peer reviewed literature
      illustrating a need for an appropriate criteria and more suitable speech recognition measure,
      believe it is appropriate at this time to re-evaluate the candidacy requirements associated
      with adult cochlear implantation. Specifically, this will be accomplished by evaluating the
      safety and efficacy of the Cochlear™ Nucleus® cochlear implant system under revised cochlear
      implant indications. The proposed approach would be to evaluate individuals scoring between
      10 - 40% inclusively on Consonant Nucleus Consonant (CNC) monosyllabic words who do not meet
      current approved speech perception criteria with the widely used sentence measure Hearing In
      Noise Test (HINT) in quiet. No change to current qualifying audiometric criteria (bilateral
      moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequencies and profound hearing
      loss in the mid to high speech frequencies) for implant candidacy is proposed.

    <measure>CNC Monosyllabic Word Score - Treated Ear</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study endpoint was to test whether a statistically significant difference could be obtained between the mean, preoperative Consonant Nucleus Consonant (CNC) monosyllabic word score in the ear to be implanted compared to the postoperative CNC word score in the cochlear implant alone condition at 6 months postimplant activation for candidates who currently perform outside the approved Nucleus® cochlear implant candidacy requirements.
CNC Word Test is a validated test of open-set word recognition. The test consists of 10 lists with 50 monosyllabic words in each list. Subject responses are scored for both words and phonemes correct in the correct sequence. Subjects will be tested using a configuration of speech at 0º azimuth in quiet.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eighteen years of age or older at the time of the study.

          -  Preoperative aided CNC word score in quiet of greater than or equal to 10% and less
             than or equal to ¬¬40% in the ear to be implanted; equal to but no better than 50% in
             the contralateral ear

          -  Bilateral moderate to profound hearing loss in the low frequencies (up to 1000 Hz) and
             profound sensorineural hearing loss in the high speech frequencies (3000 Hz and above)

          -  Willingness to use bimodal stimulation (i.e. a cochlear implant on one ear and a
             hearing aid on the contralateral ear) through at least 6-months postactivation.

          -  English spoken as the primary language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Congenital hearing loss (for the purpose of this study, onset prior to 2
             years-of-age).

          -  Preoperative aided HINT sentence score less than or equal to 50% in the ear to be
             implanted

          -  Ossification, absence of cochlear development or any other cochlear anomaly that might
             prevent complete insertion of the electrode array.

          -  Hearing loss of neural or central origin (e.g., deafness due to lesions on the
             acoustic nerve or central auditory pathway).

          -  Active middle-ear infection.

          -  Unwillingness and/or inability of the candidate to comply with all investigational
             requirements including, but not limited to, study protocol and surgical procedure.
