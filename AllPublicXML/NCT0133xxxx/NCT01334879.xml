      This study investigates the use of a high dose anti-VEGF agent for the treatment of radiation
      retinopathy in those patients who have recalcitrant disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, Phase I study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in
      subjects with radiation retinopathy. This is a single center, non-randomized, active
      treatment study involving 10 consecutive patients. This study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of a high dose (2.0 mg) intravitreal ranibizumab and its effect on regression of
      radiation retinopathy and mean change in visual acuity.

    <description>All subjects will be assessed at baseline, at 7 days after first injection, and monthly for adverse events. The primary outcome measures for safety and tolerability are: 1. incidence and severity of ocular adverse events, as identified by eye examination (including best corrected visual acuity testing) and 2.
