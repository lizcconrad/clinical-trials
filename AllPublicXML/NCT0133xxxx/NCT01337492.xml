    <textblock>
      Patients with either histological confirmation or clinical diagnosis who are candidate for
      orthotopic liver transplant(OLT) will receive Sorafenib 400mg 2 x day (BID) as a neoadjuvant
      (bridging) treatment until transplant. If patient progresses or falls outside of the Milan
      criteria on sorafenib patient can be treated per physician's discretion using local therapy.
      Patient will be followed until 30 days after the orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).

      Primary objective:

      â€¢ To evaluate safety (including possible surgical complication) and feasibility of using
      sorafenib as neo-adjuvant (bridging therapy) prior to orthotopic liver transplant(OLT).

      The primary goal of this pilot study is to assess the safety and feasibility of treating HCC
      patients with sorafenib prior to OLT, as determined by the number of patients experiencing
      grade 4 hemorrhaging or bleeding post-operatively.

      To achieve these goals a 2-stage accrual design will be used with a maximum accrual goal of
      10 patients. Initially 5 patients will be entered on-study. If more than one patient
      experiences grade 4 hemorrhaging/bleeding following OLT the trial will be closed and
      sorafenib will not be considered safe and/or feasible. If no patient experiences this event 5
      additional patients will be enrolled. At the end of the study sorafenib will be considered
      safe and feasible in this setting if no patient experience grade 4 hemorrhaging/bleeding
      following transplant. With this design, and assuming at least 3 of the 5 patients in each
      cohort undergo OLT, the likelihood of stopping early is &lt;.04 if the underlying risk
      hemorrhages/bleeding are low (&lt;5% each) whereas there is a &gt;.42 chance of early termination
      if the risks are substantial (e.g. &gt;.20 likelihood of dose limiting toxicity and &gt;.30
      likelihood of &gt;grade 4 hemorrhages/bleeding). Overall the likelihood of accepting or not
      accepting sorafenib as safe and feasible are &gt;.84, and &lt;.16, respectively under these
      conditions.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Drop out rate

        -  Time to progression prior to orthotopic liver transplant (OLT)

        -  Waiting time.
