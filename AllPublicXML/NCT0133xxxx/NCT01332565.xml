      This study is a Phase 1, open label, non-randomized, single dose study to determine
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of doultegravir (DTG) following 50 mg single oral
      administration in healthy Japanese subjects. A total of 10 healthy Japanese subjects will be
      enrolled in this study to receive a 50 mg single dose of DTG. Subjects will have a screening
      visit within 30 days prior to the administration of study drug, a treatment visit, and a
      follow-up visit 7-14 days after the administration of study drug.

             years with being a Japanese passport holder. Healthy as judged by a responsible
             physician with no clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or
             laboratory evaluation, including 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be included
             only if the Investigator considers that the finding will not introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  The subject is greater than or equal to 20 and less than or equal to 55 years of age,
             inclusive.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a

             estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt; 147 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Child-bearing potential and
             agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol for the time
             period between screening and dosing of study drugs to sufficiently minimize the risk
             of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must also agree to use contraception
             throughout the study and until two weeks after the last dose of study medications.

             the range of 45-100 bpm for both male and female subjects. The subject's body
             temperature is &gt; 37.5 degrees celcius.

          -  History/evidence of symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary
             artery bypass grafting surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or
             congenital cardiac diseases or any clinically significant cardiac diseases.

          -  An episode of cardiac syncope within one year before screening period.

          -  History/evidence of clinically significant pulmonary diseases and

             collection of the final pharmacokinetic sample.

          -  Has a history of use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6 months of
             the screening visit.

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures
             or compromise subject safety.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, or
             serum creatinine values greater than the upper limit of normal. A single repeat is

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy and pancreatitis should be excluded.

          -  History of significant renal or hepatic diseases.

          -  History of Gilbert's syndrome.

          -  Has an abnormal ECG as described in the protocol.

          -  Clinically significant anomaly in electrolytes in subjects with heart rate greater
