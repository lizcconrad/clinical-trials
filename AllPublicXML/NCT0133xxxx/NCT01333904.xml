  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish single and multiple dose safety in healthy subjects
      and subjects with mild chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD). In addition, the study
      will evaluate preliminary proof of concept endpoints in COPD subjects such as biomarkers in
      sputum and mucociliary clearance.

      The proposed initial trial in healthy subjects and subjects with mild COPD will establish the
      tolerability of PUR118 in these subjects over single and short multi-day dosing periods. The
      study will also provide preliminary data regarding PUR118's potential impact on biomarkers in
      COPD. Finally, this trial will assess PUR118's effect on mucociliary clearance. This is a
      four part study enrolling healthy volunteers in a single ascending dose design (SAD; Part I),
      followed by multiple ascending dose design (MAD; Part II). Contingent on demonstration of
      safety in a healthy subject population, the study will enroll mild COPD subjects for a short
      multi-dose design (Part III) incorporating safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Lastly Part
      IV of the trial will assess the effect of PUR118 on mucociliary clearance in mild COPD
      subjects.
