      This pilot trial studies the differentiation of bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis with
      ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging procedures that allow doctors
      to more accurately differentiate between malignant bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis may help
      in diagnosing patients correctly and may result in more timely treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of bone sarcomas and
      osteomyelitis based on their ferumoxytol-enhancement on relatively early postcontrast
      T1-weighted images.

      II. Establish MR imaging characteristics of bone sarcomas and osteomyelitis based on their
      ferumoxytol-enhancement on delayed postcontrast T2-weighted images.

      III. Establish T2-weighted MR imaging characteristics of iron labeled mesenchymal stem cell
      (MSC) in osteonecrotic bone over time, before and after surgical core decompression and bone
      marrow implantation.

      IV. Adding a second branch for patients who can not receive ferumoxytol but still getting the
      MRI exam.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) and then undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI up
      to 1 hour after infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suspected or confirmed diagnosis of a bone sarcoma or osteomyelitis

          -  Symptomatic osteonecrosis (ON) of the femur or proximal tibia with MR signal
             abnormalities that involve more than 50% of the respective joint surface, but no
             evidence of epiphyseal collapse

          -  There will be no gender/race-ethnic restrictions

          -  In this pediatric &amp; adult study, the participant or parent/guardian is consented, and
             the patient when a minor is given an assent form and involved in the discussion as
             appropriate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to MRI

          -  Presence of metal implants

          -  Need for sedation or anesthesia

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Hemosiderosis/hemochromatosis (patients can still be included in the 2nd branch
             without receiving ferumoxytol)

          -  There will be no restrictions regarding use of other investigational agents

          -  Patients with evidence of iron overload, hemosiderosis/hemochromatosis will be
             excluded for the bone sarcoma study; however, they can undergo MRI exam without
             ferumoxytol enhancement for the ON study

          -  History of allergic reactions to similar compounds will be obtained and patients with
             positive history of allergic reactions will be excluded from the study

          -  Pregnancy or nursing patients will be excluded from the study; a pregnancy test will
             be done prior to the MR examination for postmenarchal teenage girls, in whom pregnancy
             may be possible; only patients with a negative pregnancy test will be included in the
             study
