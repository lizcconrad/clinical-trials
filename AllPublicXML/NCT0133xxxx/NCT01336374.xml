  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of vacant lot greening on perceptions of
      safety and violence for residents living around the lots. We hypothesize that people living
      around lots that are greened will have improved perception of safety.

    <textblock>
      Violence is a serious health problem in the US, and especially in Philadelphia, as the city
      ranks first in violent crime amongst the ten largest US cities. The determinants of violent
      crime range from individual to community level factors. In this study, we focus on physical
      incivilities in the built environment, specifically vacant lots, as they have been associated
      with violent crime. Physical incivilities are also associated with individual perceptions of
      crime and safety, and subsequently, negative health outcomes. However, prior research has
      been observational and retrospective. We aim to expand this body of work through a randomized
      community intervention trial of vacant lot greening to explore causal mechanisms between
      vacant lots and violent crime outcomes. This pilot study, in partnership with the
      Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, will investigate the feasibility of a vacant lot greening
      intervention, and explore how vacant lot greening changes resident perception about violence,
      fear, stress, and neighborhood disorder, as well as violent crime in the surrounding area. We
      will interview residents living around the greened and non-greened lots during a joint walk
      around a pre-determined route, which will ensure exposure to our intervention. We will also
      use violent crime data (homicide, aggravated assault, robbery, and rape) from the
      Philadelphia Police Department. Results of this pilot trial will be used to develop a full
      scale vacant lot greening grant to be submitted to the National Institutes of Health or the
      National Institute of Justice.
