  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label pharmacokinetic study where up to 40 subjects with advanced
      solid tumors (up to 6-10 with normal renal function and up to 18-30 with varying degrees of
      renal dysfunction) will receive weekly doses of AMG 386 intravenously. The primary objective
      is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single agent AMG 386 in subjects with various
      degrees of renal function. Once the AMG 386 PK characterization is complete in the first 5
      weeks of the study, all subjects will be allowed to continue to receive AMG 386 weekly only
      or subjects in group 1, 2 or 3 can opt to receive AMG 386 weekly in combination with
      paclitaxel until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.
