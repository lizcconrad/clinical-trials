  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the persistence of immunity to hepatitis B in healthy children aged
      7 to 8 years, after previous vaccination with Infanrix hexa™ in the first two years of life,
      and also their ability to mount an immune response to the challenge dose of Engerix-B™
      Kinder.

Any temperature was defined as axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 degree centigrade (°C), grade 3 temperature was axillary temperature &gt; 39.0°C. For other symptoms, any was defined as occurrence of any general symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and grade 3 was defined as a general symptom that prevented normal activity. Related was a general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

        <description>The anamnestic response is defined as an antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL at post Engerix-B Kinder challenge dose time point for initially seronegative subjects ,and as an antibody concentration at post Engerix-B Kinder challenge dose time point ≥ 4 fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration for initially seropositive subjects. A seropositive/seronegative subject was defined as subject with HBs antibody concentration below/greater than or equal to the seropositivity cut-off of 6.2 mIU/mL. A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HBs ELISA had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL).
