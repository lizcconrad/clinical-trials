  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of BI 853520
      monotherapy by defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommending the dose for
      further trials in the development of this compound.

      Secondary objectives are

        -  determination of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile;

        -  exploratory pharmacodynamic analysis; and

        -  collection of preliminary data on anti-tumour efficacy.
