      The investigators want to determine whether TIG influences the formation of tetanus antibody
      after simultaneous tetanus vaccination according to age and the time-interval of the last
      tetanus vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When an injured patient visits the ED, unnecessary injection of tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG)
      may cause side effects and also increase the medical expense.5 Further, the opportunity of
      assessing a rising tetanus antibody titer may be missed after simultaneous injection of
      tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (Td) and TIG. According to age, the elevation of the tetanus
      antibody titer after tetanus prophylaxis might be not equivalent because of different levels
      of basal immunity and the time-interval of the last tetanus vaccination. Therefore, we wanted
      to determine whether TIG influences the formation of tetanus antibody after simultaneous
      tetanus vaccination according to age and the time-interval of the last tetanus vaccination.

    <measure>The change from baseline in tetanus antibody titer at 4weeks, 6 months and 12months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The tetanus antibody titers were determined by ELISA and the results were reported in IU/mL. The measurement of tetanus antibody titer at 4 weeks should be needed to check the peak titer after vaccination. the change of tetanus antibody titers were calculated by geometric mean titers(GMTs), and we compared the GMTs between the groups(Td vs Td-TIG)at baseline, 4weeks, 6months, and 12 months by independent T-test.</description>
