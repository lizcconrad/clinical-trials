        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures.

          -  Healthy male subjects aged ≥20 - ≤45 years with suitable veins for cannulation or
             repeated venepuncture.

          -  Male subjects should be willing to use barrier contraception ie, condoms, from the day
             of dosing until 3 months after dosing with the investigational product.

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between≥ 18 and ≤30 kg/m2 and weigh at least 50 kg and no
             more than 100 kg.

          -  Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent for genetic research. If a
             subject declines to participate in the genetic component of the study, there will be
             no penalty or loss of benefit to the subject. The subject will not be excluded from
             other aspects of the study described in this Clinical Study Protocol, so long as they
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of
             drugs

          -  A history of erectile dysfunction or anatomic abnormality of the penis (eg, cavernosal
             fibrosis, Peyronie's disease, or plaques) which interferes with normal erectile
             function

          -  Predisposition or history of priapism (eg, sickle cell anemia or trait).

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of investigational product
