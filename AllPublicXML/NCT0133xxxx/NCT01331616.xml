      Does treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with prior or current radiotherapy
      lead to optic neuropathy?

      The investigators research will focus on patients prior to them beginning treatment with
      bevacizumab (Avastin), by undergoing a baseline visual examination with Visual evoked
      Potentials testing. This will allow testing of the patient's optic nerve function
      bilaterally. Patients will then begin their normally scheduled treatment with avastin, and
      other chemotherapeutic agents, as well any radiation treatments scheduled. Once patients have
      completed their treatment with avastin for 6-8 weeks, they will then undergo their second
      Visual Evoked Potential testing, with both studies then being compared for any changes within
      the optic nerves. Patients will also be recommended to have stringent follow up with an
      Ophthalmologist to include confrontational visual field testing, external and anterior
      segment examination, and dilated fundus examination. The investigators main objective is to
      assess whether or not bevacizumab causes a direct toxic effect on patient's optic nerves
      leading to an acute/subacute optic neuropathy.

    <description>Does Avastin lead to optic neuropathy in combination w chemo-radiotherapy? Our research will focus on patients prior to them beginning treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin), by undergoing Visual evoked Potentials testing. This will allow testing of the patient's optic nerve function bilaterally. In our study of VEP, we will be measuring optic nerve function, to asses if there has been any damage.</description>

    <description>The investigators will compare the results of the patient's Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) testing performed prior to treatment with Avastin and chemo-radiotherapy to the results of the VEP after completion to assess optic nerve function; and any signs of direct optic neuropathy In our study the investigators will compare the results of the Visual Evoked Potential results performed prior to the chemoradiation to results of the Visual Evoked Potential after completion of standard-of-care treatment for glioblastoma.</description>
