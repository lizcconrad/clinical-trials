  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silicosis is well-known occupational disease caused by free crystalline silica (silicon
      dioxide) and is marked by inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. There are cumulative evidences
      that exposure to Caesar stone (quartz surface products that manufactured from up to 93%
      quartz, polymer resins and pigments) is particularly dangerous to exposed workers.

      Goals: To examine marble workers exposed to Caesar Stone in order to propose a working plan
      of surveillance and prevention by biological monitoring.

      Study participants would be recruited during two years of the study. They will be asked to
      come to a single visit at Pulmonary Laboratory of Tel Aviv Medical Center. During the
      meeting, participants will be given a precise explanation about the tests they will perform
      and after signing the informed consent will perform following tests:

        1. Induced sputum (IS) - will be done after pretreatment with short acting beta-2 agonist
           and 3% saline will be administrated by an ultrasonic nebulizer for up to 20 min.
           Differential cell count, particle size distribution test of the particulate matter (with
           a Eyetech Analyzer (Ankersmid, Yokneam, Israel)will be done from IS samples and
           evaluation the activity of Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) protein from IS supernatants.

        2. EBC-Exhaled Breath Condensate-will be done by condensation expiratory air and
           particulate matter and markers of oxidation will be measured.

        3. Participants will be asked to complete occupational questionnaire.

        4. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): The measurement will be performed using standard
           protocols according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS)
           guidelines. Including Lung diffusion testing.

      Laboratory tests of induced sputum and EBC will be done within a week of a participant visit.
      Analysis of data will be done after the completion of data collection and laboratory tests.
