  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated three million people are affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) in the UK, giving it a prevalence of 1.5% of the population in 2007/08. COPD accounts
      for approximately 30,000 deaths each year in the UK and is an important co-morbidity in those
      dying from other smoking related diseases, most commonly ischaemic heart disease and lung
      cancer. The National COPD audit showed a very high level of co-morbidity, the association
      with cardiovascular disease being particularly strong with 51% of patients with
      cardiovascular disease having been admitted for COPD within the preceding 24 months. Patients
      with COPD are at increased risk of myocardial infarction compared to the general population.
      Although this increase in cardiovascular risk exists, it is not clear is whether survival
      after myocardial infarction is different in patients with and without COPD and what factors
      contribute to this survival difference. Differences in survival may arise due to differences
      in prescribing certain drugs such as beta-blockers, differences in prevalence of risk factors
      (e.g. current smoking status) or increased COPD events such as exacerbations which themselves
      are associated with increased mortality.

      The investigators primary aim is to investigate whether survival after first myocardial
      infarction is shorter in patients with COPD than those without COPD and to establish reasons
      for these differences in survival.

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

      Objectives:

        1. To investigate survival differences after first myocardial infarction in patients with
           and without COPD.

        2. To investigate if these survival differences exist due to a) differences in prevalence
           of risk factors (e.g. smoking) b) differences in management after myocardial infarction
           (e.g. uptake of cardiac rehabilitation, prescription of beta-blockers) and c) COPD
           related events (e.g. exacerbations).

        The study population is comprised of patients registered at those GPRD practices that
        agreed to the linkage with the MINAP database, and whose practices are &quot;up to standard&quot;
        according to GPRD criteria. Practices taking part in the GPRD are chosen to be
        representative of all UK practices, and 98% of people in the UK are registered with a GP.
        Therefore the GPRD should be a representative sample of the UK population

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in GPRD practices which are deemed &quot;up to standard&quot; by GPRD criteria will be

          -  Age over 18.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded after experiencing their first MI.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they do not fulfil one of the inclusion criteria.
