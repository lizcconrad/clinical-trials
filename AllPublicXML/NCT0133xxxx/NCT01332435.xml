  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study aims to assess the economic impact of early initiation of
      5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) therapy in patients with enlarged prostate (EP) receiving
      5ARI and alpha-blocker (AB) combination therapy. Both the Integrated Health Care Information
      Solutions and PharMetrics databases will be utilized for this study (2000-2007).
