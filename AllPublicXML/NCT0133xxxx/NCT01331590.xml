  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of G-CSF to disrupt the bone marrow
      microenvironment as a means to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with
      relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will combine G-CSF as priming prior to and during the administration of
      salvage chemotherapy regimen in ALL. Abundant data suggests that leukemic cells receive key
      growth and survival signals from the bone marrow microenvironment. Our preclinical data show
      that 4-5 days of G-CSF treatment is associated with a loss of osteoblasts and decreases
      expression of key chemokine/ cytokines which support lymphocyte development. The
      investigators hypothesize that G-CSF will disrupt the protective effects of the bone marrow
      microenvironment and augment the effect of chemotherapy in adults with ALL. This is a pilot
      study of G-CSF priming in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL to determine the
      feasibility and to characterize the effect of G-CSF treatment on the marrow microenvironment.
