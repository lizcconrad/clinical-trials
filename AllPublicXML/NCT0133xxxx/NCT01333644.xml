  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the central hypothesis of the investigators study that HIV disease is a
      pro-inflammatory condition, and that years of inflammation result in premature &quot;aging' of the
      immune system (&quot;immunosenescence&quot;). Just as these changes are thought be causally associated
      with heart disease in the very old,the investigators postulate that these changes will be
      associated with early heart disease in the untreated and perhaps treated HIV disease. To
      address this hypothesis, the investigators will measure immunosenescence in a large cohort of
      patients who span the entire disease process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV controllers: positive for HIV by standard antibody serological determinations with
             undetectable HIV RNA level (&lt; 75 copies RNA/mL) in absence of therapy

          -  HIV non-controllers: detectable HIV RNA levels in absence of therapy

          -  Highly active anti-retroviral therapy responders (HAART responders): on combination
             antiretroviral therapy with undetectable HIV RNA levels.

          -  HIV-seronegative participants will also be studied.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treated individuals that changed antiretroviral regimen within 12 weeks prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Individuals who have started or stopped antihypertensive medication or lipid lowering
             medication or changed doses of these drugs within 12 weeks of the study will be
             excluded.

          -  As nitroglycerin is administered to assess endothelium-independent vasodilation, we
             also plan to exclude patients who have taken sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil
             within 72 hours of the endothelial function study, or who are hypotensive (systolic BP
             &lt;100).
