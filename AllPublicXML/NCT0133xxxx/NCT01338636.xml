    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is assess whether ambrisentan can help people with exercise-
      induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (EIPAH). The investigators also want to find out if
      ambrisentan is safe to take without causing excessive side effects.

      EIPAH population: These participants may provide a unique window into the pathogenesis of
      PAH. Our data suggest that these participants may represent an early phase of PAH with an
      abnormal vascular response.

      The study includes an assessment of the potential impact of ambrisentan on the exercise
      capacity Advanced Level-3 cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and the World Health
      Organization functional class (WHO FC).
