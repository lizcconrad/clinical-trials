  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The topological perception theory proposed a precise description for how one organizes the
      visual world that eliminates the vagueness of subjective phenomenology. In addition, the
      topological theory challenges the dominant computational view on the part-to-whole hierarchy
      of visual information processing. Lines of evidence from adult psychophysics, brain imaging
      data, and even honeybee's behavior have supported the notion that the global topological
      properties are the very primitives of visual representation. However, the question of how the
      sensitivity to topological properties originates during development has not been explored
      much. In a previous study, the investigators found that 2- to 6 month old infants could
      reliably discriminate stimuli based on topological differences, but failed to do so based on
      geometric differences. Using familiarization/novelty preference procedure, the present study
      intends to explore the visual sensitivity for topological properties in newborn infants.
      Experiment 1 focuses on whether neonates can discriminate a disk (no hole) and a ring (with a
      hole) that are topologically different, and/or a disk (no hole) and a triangle (no hole) that
      are geometrically different. Experiment 2 focuses on whether neonates can detect a change in
      the number of holes and/or the size of the hole. If newborn infants are only sensitive to
      topological properties and not to geometric properties, this will be a strong proof for the
      claim that topological property is the very &quot;primitive&quot; visual representation at empirical as
      well as theoretical level.
