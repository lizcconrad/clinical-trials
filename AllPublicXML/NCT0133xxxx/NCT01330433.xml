  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-evaluator study that will evaluate the
      effectiveness of a surgical sealant (CoSeal) composed of biocompatible polyethylene glycol on
      the formation of mediastinal and pericardial adhesions in children undergoing staged surgical
      reconstruction (potential procedures include: Blalock-Taussig Type Operation, Classical Glenn
      Procedure, Bidirectional Glenn Procedure, Norwood). Additionally, bleeding will be evaluated
      by drainage post-operatively through surgical site drainage output.

    <description>Severity of adhesions at seven predefined sites (pericardial or retrosternal, inferior or diaphragmatic region, right lateral or arterial region, region around great vessels). Severity of adhesions is graded as 0 = no adhesions, 1 = filmy and avascular, 2 = requiring blunt dissection, 3 = requiring sharp dissection, 4 = requiring extensive sharp dissection. Adhesion scores for each patient will be derived from the sum of adhesion severity scores at each site, from 0 (no adhesions) to 28 (cohesive adhesions at all sites).</description>
