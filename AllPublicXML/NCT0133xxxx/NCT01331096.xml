  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in Pisa will undergo thyroid gland surgery. In the protocol group anesthesia will be
      performed using an automated anesthesia delivery system; preoperative and intra-operative
      assessment of patients will be performed via video-conferencing from Montreal, which will
      also monitor and control anesthesia delivery via distant Internet connection - as supervision
      of functioning of the automated anesthesia delivery system. In the control group anesthesia
      will be performed in a standard fashion with manual control of the syringe pumps infusing
      anesthetics drugs.

      The hypothesis is that Tele-anesthesia, considered as preoperative assessment and anesthetic
      control of an automated anesthesia delivery system is feasible and reliable via standard
      means of internet communication (distant control via virtual network) and performed as well
      or even better than manual control of the anesthetic drugs infusion.

    <measure>Performance of closed-loop system for propofol administration, controlled remotely, compared with the performance of propofol manually administered to maintain in both case the level of hypnosis close to the BIS target.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Hypnosis is monitored during the surgery according to the brain activity values provided by an objective monitoring parameter, called Bispectral Index (BIS). A BIS target of 45 is aimed trough the surgery. Performance of propofol hypnosis will be determined clinically by recording the % of sedation time during which the actual BIS is within 10% of the target BIS (excellent control), within 11 -20% (good control), between 21-30% (fair control) and beyond 30% of target (inadequate control).</description>
