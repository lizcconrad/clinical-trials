  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence that our current consumption of salt is the major factor increasing
      blood pressure (BP). The current salt intake in most countries in the world is 9 to 12 grams
      per day (g/d), whil the World Health Organization's recommendation is &lt; 5 g/d.

      The aims of the present study is to determine if the overconsumption of salt influences the
      bp in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or frequently elevated bp.

      Each study subject will complete questionnaires, and their usual dietary salt intake is
      estimated from food composition on 3 completed food diaries. This is also compared with a
      24-hour urine sample collection.

      Based on these results, the study subject receives personal advice to decrease sodium
      consumption and will change the diet for at least 28 days. During this diet, bp will be
      measured and food diaries will be completed. After the intervention, a questionnaire and a
      24-hour urine sample collection will be collected.
