  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, many hospitals have progressively perceived the importance of corporate
      social responsibility (CSR). More and more hospital superintendents thus have realized that
      they should have a CSR strategy to deal with various stakeholders. Hospital, as a health care
      sector, is a labor-intensive industry. The management of hospitals should view its employees
      as salient stakeholders as well as a sort of precious asset by which hospital can possess a
      unique competition advantage in the operation. It is therefore important for superintendent
      to understand an employee's perspective on CSR and its impact on employees' work attitudes
      and organizational performance.

      Based on the stakeholder theory and social identity theory, this study attempts to employ a
      survey approach to understand the superintendents and employees' perceptions of CSR, and to
      explore the effects of CSR on organizational commitment of employees and organizational
      performance. The samples are taken from the senior managers (such as the superintendent and
      vice superintendent) and employees in the hospitals of which the number of beds are more than
      200. The structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to confirm the research framework and
      to test the hypotheses. The results will provide a reference for the management and
      regulators of hospitals to set up the CSR policies, and contribute to senior managers on the
      CSR strategy and human resource development with regard to hospitals.
