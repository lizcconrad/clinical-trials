    <textblock>
      The aims are to 1) compare two probiotic treatments (multi-strain synbiotic vs. multi-strain
      probiotic) on bifidobacteria fecal colonization counts at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of life, 34
      weeks corrected gestation age (CGA) ; 2) compare infants successfully colonized with
      probiotic organisms to infants not successfully colonized at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of life, 34
      weeks CGA on infant outcomes and on stress biomarker patterns at birth, day of life (DOL) 1,
      DOL 7; 3) determine long-term safety and outcomes of probiotic treatments at 6, 16, and 24
      months CGA.

      Feeding Intolerance and other GI issues are a major concern in a NICU hospitalized
      population. Successful colonization with probiotic bacteria is thought to impact the
      incidence of GI related issues. This study will study the impact of prebiotics on the
      colonization of a population of VLBW infants in the NICU setting.
