    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a major adverse effect of chemotherapy.
      This study is determining the incidence of vomiting/retching of the standard induction
      chemotherapy regimen for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are also receiving an
      antiemetic known as aprepitant.

      The standard frontline chemotherapy for patients with AML consists of cytarabine given as a 7
      day continuous infusion plus 3 days of an anthracycline, most commonly daunorubicin, on days
      1-3. This is known as the 3+7 regimen. Antiemetic treatments are usually given to patients
      for nausea and vomiting. Granisetron (a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) is used on the 3
      daunorubicin days and other antiemetics can be used for breakthrough nausea/vomiting.

      This study will test that the prophylactic use of aprepitant, in addition to the standard
      antiemetic regimen used at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), will reduce the incidence of
      delayed onset vomiting/retching by Day 5 in AML patients receiving the standard 3+7 regimen,
      compared to retrospective data using this regimen.
