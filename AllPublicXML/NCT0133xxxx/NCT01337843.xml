      This research will evaluate the efficacy of a new online self- help intervention, the
      Wellness Workbook, for individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to use the Wellness Workbook or alternative self-help materials and
      assessed at baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks) and at follow-up (18 weeks). Outcome
      measures include pain-related disability and pain severity.

      This research will evaluate the efficacy of a new online self- help intervention, the
      Wellness Workbook, for individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP). The Wellness Workbook
      is an interactive online intervention that uses evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) strategies, behavioral activation and mindfulness training to increase chronic pain
      patients' quality of life. 198 patients with chronic low back pain will be randomly assigned
      to use the Wellness Workbook or alternative self-help materials for 10 weeks. Participants
      will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks) and at follow-up (18 weeks).
      Outcome measures include pain-related disability, pain severity, physical activity,
      mindfulness and pain-related attitudes and beliefs.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower pain related disability and interference scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As compared to the control group participants, CLBP patients who use the WW intervention will report lower pain-related disability and lower pain interference scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fewer pain-related disabling beliefs and attitudes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As compared to the control group participants, CLBP patients who use the WW will report fewer pain-related disabling beliefs and attitudes, have better self-efficacy for managing pain and negative affect and will score higher on mindfulness/present moment awareness. They will also have higher physical activity scores and lower depression scores.</description>
