  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of our research program is to develop an effective and cost-saving
      mind-body therapy to help patients with FM. The objective of this pilot study is to gather
      pilot data of the effect on pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life in FM patients
      using a specific type of qigong exercise, i.e. &quot;six healing sound&quot; qigong. Changes in
      relevant brain activity will be monitored in study subjects before and after the qigong
      exercise program, which may help us in better understanding the underlying mechanism of the
      qigong exercise. Data collected in this pilot study will help the investigators in
      preparation for a future clinical trial with a larger sample size. Our central hypothesis for
      the future clinical trial is that qigong exercise will lead to a significantly greater
      improvement in pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life in the experimental group
      compared to the control group.

    <description>The study will include one week baseline phase, 6-week intervention phase, and a 3-month follow-up evaluation. Subjects in the intervention group will go through three training sessions during the baseline phase, weekly group exercise sessions once per week and daily home exercises two times each day during the intervention phase, and a follow-up evaluation in three months after the intervention phase.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control group will be monitored during the baseline and intervention phase without participating in the interventional exercise.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of primary FM, based on the 1990 American College of
             Rheumatology criteria (Wolfe et al, 1990),

          -  between the ages of 18 and 70 years;

          -  willing to withdraw from CNS-active therapies commonly used to treat FM; willing to
             discontinue treatment with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, biofeedback,
             tender- and trigger-point injections, acupuncture, and anesthetic or narcotic patches;

          -  with a raw score &gt; 4 on the physical function component of the Fibromyalgia Impact
             Questionnaire (FIQ) (Burckhardt et al, 1991);

          -  and a mean visual analog scale (VAS) pain score &gt; 40 on a scale from 0 to 100.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  severe psychiatric illness;

          -  a current major depressive episode (as determined by a Beck Depression Inventory (Beck
             et al, 1961) score &gt;25);

          -  significant suicide risk;

          -  abuse of alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other drugs; a history of behavior that would
             prohibit compliance for the duration of the study;

          -  active cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, or autoimmune
             disease (except Hashimoto's or Graves' disease that had been stable for 3 months
             before screening);

          -  current systemic infection; active cancer (except basal cell carcinoma); unstable
