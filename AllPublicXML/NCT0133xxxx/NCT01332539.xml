    <textblock>
      observational, non-interventional study in 120 patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy,
      comprising two phases: a 3-month retrospective and a 6-month prospective. As control group,
      120 patients with controlled partial epilepsy will be enrolled. The objective of the study is
      to describe the burden of illness in this epileptic population both in terms of costs and of
      quality of life. Costs and quality of life will be also compared between the two populations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients

          -  Diagnosis of partial epilepsy, defined as active, drug-resistant in accordance to the
             2010 ILAE (International League Against Epilepsy) definition and actually taking an
             add-on therapeutic regimen.

          -  Able and willing to give the written informed consent (to be obtained before any study
             assessment)

        For each drug-resistant patient, will be enrolled a patient with the same diagnosis and
        actually taking an add-on therapy but with controlled epilepsy according to the 2010 ILAE
        definition.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient currently included in a clinical trial for an AED (Anti-Epileptic Drug)

          -  Hospital record data on epilepsy not available in the Investigator's files

          -  Patient unable to fill in self-questionnaires (quality of life instrument)

          -  Patient currently hospitalized

          -  Patient who, according to the Investigator's judgment, is not able to follow the study
             procedures
