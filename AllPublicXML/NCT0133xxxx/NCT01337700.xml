  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) include Autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome and Pervasive
      Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). These are developmental disorders
      beginning prior to three years of age. Recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates
      suggest that ASD affects up to 1 in 100 individuals and up to 1 in 50 boys. There are very
      substantial costs associated with caring for patients with ASD, and ASD has the highest
      Caregiver Burden Scores of any condition. There are three core symptom domains of ASD,
      including social deficits, repetitive behaviors and language deficits. Patients can also have
      associated symptoms of attentional deficits, disruptive behaviors and intellectual
      disability. There is currently no Food and Drug administration (FDA) approved treatment for
      the core symptoms of autism, but risperidone and aripiprazole have FDA approval for
      disruptive behaviors associated with autism.

      This is a 12 week randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of Milnacipran in adults
      with ASD or Aspergers Syndrome. Milnacipran is said to play a role in the activation and
      normalization of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system, of which is hypothesized to play a
      role in behavior adaptations and performance.

    <measure>Change in Score on Conners Adults Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change will be measured in each subject's score on the Conners from baseline through study end (week 12). It is a clinically expert rating scale used to measure attention dysfunction. It offers good psychometric properties and psychopathological item content focused on inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Change in subjects on placebo, will be compared to those receiving the study drug.</description>
