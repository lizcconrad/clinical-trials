  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing functional organ preservation
      surgery (FOPS) vs. radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy as the first treatment modality for
      patients with head an neck squamous cell carcinoma arising in the oropharynx, larynx and
      hypopharynx. This study has a hypothesis that the FOPS is an effective treatment strategy to
      preserve the organ function without compromising oncologic safety and survival.

      This prospective study compare the following items between two groups:

        -  Functional outcomes: laryngeal, pharyngeal, and quality of life

        -  Oncological outcomes: survivals, locoregional controls

        -  Combined imaging and molecular biomarkers with follow-up data

      The functional organ preservation surgery (FOPS) is defined as a surgery preserving the
      laryngeal or pharyngeal function regardless of open or transoral route. The FOPS may include:

        -  Radical tonsillectomy or other oropharyngeal resection

        -  Partial laryngectomy or pharyngectomy

        -  Transoral laser microresection

        -  Transoral robotic surgery (TORS)

        -  Reconstructive surgery may be combined with primary resection

        -  Neck dissection may be indicated in some patients

        -  Postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy may be indicated in some patients
           according to their pathologic reports.

      The standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is generally used but radiotherapy (RT) alone
      may be indicated for some patients under tumor-board discussion. The salvage surgery may be
      indicated for patients with residual or recurrent diseases after CRT or RT.
