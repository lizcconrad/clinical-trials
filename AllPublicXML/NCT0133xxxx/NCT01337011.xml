    <description>The application of CD133pos cells intra-myocardial via the NOGA system and intra-coronary leads to a significant improvement of LV function as measured by cardiacMRI at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline in patients with no contra-indications for MRI (i.e. ICD or CRT). Significant improvement is defined by an absolute increase of LVEF of 5%.</description>
