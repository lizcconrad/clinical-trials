  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calprotectin is a cytosolic component of neutrophils .Fecal calprotectin(FC) is a useful
      marker for exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease in children .FC may be a useful marker
      for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

      NEC is one of the most common ,deadliest and enigmatic intestinal problems encountered mostly
      in premature infants. The precise pathophysiology of NEC is unclear ,but major factors
      thought to play an important role include an immature intestine ,an inflammatory response to
      intestinal microbes,enteral feedings and intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.Diagnosis of
      NEC is not easy clinically and up to now there is not a simple laboratory test to
      differentiate NEC at an early stage from other conditions in the neonate.

      Arginine is the substrate for NO production in the gut and its deficiency may cause
      vasoconstriction and gut injury and thus predispose to NEC. In previous studies arginine
      supplementation was found to reduce the incidence of NEC in premature infants but more
      studies are needed for the use of arginine supplementation for the prevention of NEC.

      The investigators aim is to measure the fecal calprotectin in very low birth weight (VLBW)
      infants during the first month of life as an inflammatory marker of the bowel and evaluate
      whether premature infants receiving arginine supplements had lower calprotectin values
      compared to the premature infants that did not .

      The investigators hypothesize that arginine supplementation in preterm infants reduces the
      inflammation of the gut which will be shown by the lower fecal calprotectin values of the
      premature infants receiving arginine supplementation.
