  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study will evaluate the rate of
      cardiovascular events with tocilizumab in comparison to etanercept in participants with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Participants will be randomized to receive intravenous (IV) 8
      milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) tocilizumab every 4 weeks or subcutaneous 50 milligrams (mg)
      etanercept weekly, with or without non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug
      (DMARD).
