    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab, as one new agent used in advanced esophageal carcinoma, has been shown to be
      effective and safe in some studies with head-neck cancers. Advanced esophageal carcinoma have
      poor prognosis and majority of patients resistant to chemotherapy in China. In the
      investigators phase II clinical trial proceeded before,the combination of paclitaxel with
      cisplatin showed good tolerance and efficacy to esophageal carcinoma. The investigators then
      initiated a prospective phase II clinical trial with Nimotuzumabplus paclitaxel/cisplatin as
      the 1st line treatment in advanced esophageal carcinoma to observe the efficacy and safety of
      the combination.
