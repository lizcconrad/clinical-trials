  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is find out if researchers can use genetic testing on tumor
      samples to predict if tumors will respond to breast cancer treatments. The tumor sample will
      be tested to learn if certain genes are activated (turned on) in the tumor. Researchers hope
      that the activation of these genes may predict if the tumor will be sensitive or resistant to
      routine breast cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.

      This is an investigational study. The test that will be performed on your breast cancer tumor
      sample is an investigational test.

      Up to 1100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      This study will involve performing a test on a sample of tumor. If you agree to take part in
      this study, you will have a tumor biopsy before you receive any drugs to treat breast cancer.
      The sample of the tumor will be will be taken at one of the following times:

        -  At the time of a planned biopsy to learn if you have breast cancer.

        -  At the time of planned surgery to remove a known breast cancer.

        -  If the breast cancer has been previously biopsied and your doctor plans to give you
           breast cancer treatments before surgery, you will have a biopsy before starting these
           drugs.

      The amount of tumor collected for this study will be about the size of the tip of a pencil.

      If you are going to have surgery to remove the breast cancer before receiving breast cancer
      treatments, a small piece of the tumor will be removed and sent for testing. If you are going
      to have a planned needle biopsy, an extra core sample and/or fine needle sample will be
      taken. If you are going to have a research biopsy, an ultrasound or mammogram will be used to
      find the tumor and a needle will be inserted into the tumor to collect a piece of tissue.

      After the genetic testing is complete, researchers will use the results to learn how well
      this test is able to give results that can be used to predict response to breast cancer drugs
      and therapy.

      Test Results:

      Because this is an investigational test, neither you or your doctor will be told the results
      of this test. This test will also not be used to guide your doctor's choice of therapy. This
      study will only look at how well this test was able to predict the response of the tumor to
      breast cancer treatment.

      For 5 years, the study staff will review your medical record to see how you are responding to
      any breast cancer therapies that you receive. If you are treated outside MD Anderson, you
      will be called and asked how you are doing. This phone call should take about 5 minutes.

      To protect your privacy, all information stored as part of this study will be kept secure and
      confidential.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after the 5 years of follow-up.

    <description>Success is defined as the ability to classify patients into 1 of 4 cohorts (Groups A-D) based on results from genomic analyses of their breast cancer sample. Feasibility will be defined as achieving a minimum success rate from acceptable samples of primary tumor in a sufficiently large cohort of eligible patients (n=300) spanning at least 12 months of patient accrual.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient can undergo biopsy or surgery of a primary tumor site for suspected or
             proven invasive breast cancer of clinical Stage I to III; stage IV patients will be
             allowed and included in the feasibility assessment, but will not be included in
             outcomes analysis for secondary objectives 1.2.4, 1.2.5 and 1.2.6.

          2. The clinical or radiologic primary tumor size is at least 1 cm diameter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has proven HER2-positive breast cancer, defined as a pathology report of
             amplification of the gene or 3+ score for immunohistochemical staining.

          2. The patient has received prior systemic therapy or radiation therapy for breast
             cancer.

          3. The patient has a prior history of invasive or metastatic cancer within 5 years of
             diagnosis of breast cancer, excluding squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin.

          4. The patient had prior excisional biopsy of the primary invasive breast cancer.

          5. There is hematoma or biopsy site changes that obscure the primary tumor.

          6. Patients deemed medically ineligible for any adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Patients
             with ER+ tumors deemed medically eligible for hormonal therapy, but not chemotherapy
             will be considered eligible for this protocol. Patients with ER- tumors who are not
             candidates for adjuvant anthracycline based chemotherapy will be considered ineligible
             for this protocol. Patients who undergo biopsy and are later found to be ineligible
             for adjuvant therapy will be assessed for the primary objective, but will be excluded
             from the secondary objectives.
