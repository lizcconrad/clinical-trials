      The overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects of a
      community-based lifestyle behavior intervention (LSBI) that is designed to improve diet,
      reduce weight and increase physical activity (PA) of Latino women who are predominantly
      Spanish-speaking immigrants. It is hypothesized that middle-aged overweight/obese Latinas
      participating in a LSBI conducted by promotoras will demonstrate a greater decrease in BMI
      and a higher increase in physical activity than those in a control condition, Women in the
      LSBI also are expected to demonstrate improvements in selected physiologic outcomes (blood
      pressure [BP], measures of cholesterol and blood sugar, waist circumference), and
      self-reported lifestyle behaviors (diet, PA). of these participants are also e

      Overweight/obesity and physical inactivity are two significant predictors of illness and
      death from cardiovascular (heart) disease (CVD)in Latina adults. These risk factors may be
      reduced or eliminated through prevention efforts that focus on heart-healthy diets, weight
      reduction, and PA. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a 6-month
      community-based lifestyle behavior intervention (LSBI) conducted by promotoras and a control
      condition (disaster preparedness and home safety program) on BMI (primary outcome) and
      selected physiologic outcomes (secondary outcomes i.e., physical activity, blood pressure,
      measures of cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, waist circumference, self-reported lifestyle
      behaviors - diet and physical activity) of Latinas who are overweight/obese. Exploratory
      analysis will examine the relationship between theoretical variables (stage of change and
      support for nutrition and physical activity), the LSBI and selected outcomes (BMI,
      self-reported lifestyle behaviors). The LSBI includes group education and individual teaching
      and coaching.
