    <textblock>
      This study will look at the ability of ST101 to treat symptoms in subjects with Essential
      Tremor. This study will also examine the safety and tolerability of the drug. This study is
      evaluating one dose level of ST101 versus placebo in a cross-over fashion. This means that
      all patients will receive both ST101 and placebo, but they will receive it in a random (by
      chance) order.

    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) is a slowly progressive, chronic neurological disorder characterized by
      a 4- to 12-Hertz tremor, which can involve the arms, head, voice and lower extremities.
      Although the hallmark of the disorder is thought to be the kinetic tremor, ET patients
      usually also manifest a postural tremor as well. Kinetic tremor (tremor with voluntary
      movements) may interfere with fine motor skills (e.g., writing, eating, drinking from a cup,
      pouring liquids); and depending upon its severity, may result in significant disability and
      diminished quality of daily living. Essential tremor represents an area of unmet medical need
      and this study is designed as a safety, tolerability and proof-of-concept investigation of
      the ability of ST101 to improve tremor. In this 2-stage study, subjects will be randomly
      assigned to either ST101 or placebo in Stage 1, and will receive the alternate treatment in
      Stage 2.

    <measure>Washington Heights-Inwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor (WHIGET) Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3, Week 5, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The WHIGET Rating Scale is a 6-item scale. Ratings are performed for the right and left side for each activity. Each subject is videotaped in the same manner performing set activities, which are then rated. Rated tasks involve fine motor skills. Each item is scored by an independent, central, blinded reader, and the item scores are summed to provide a total score. Total score range is from 0 to 48, with an increase in score reflecting an increase in ET severity.</description>

    <measure>Functional Disabilities Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Weeks 3, 5, 8</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-Item functional scale that assesses the following functional domains: Speaking/Phonation, Feeding (other than liquids), Bringing Liquids to Mouth, Hygiene, Dressing, Writing, Working, and Social Activities. Higher scores indicate worsening of disease.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-point Likert scale with Marked Worsening to Marked Improvement at the extremes, and Unchanged in the center. Scores range from -3 to +3 wherein negative scores indicate worsening, while positive scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Subject Clinical Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A global visual analog scale (VAS) which is a 100 mm horizontal line on which the subject indicates their overall assessment of response to study drug by making a mark on the horizontal line.</description>
