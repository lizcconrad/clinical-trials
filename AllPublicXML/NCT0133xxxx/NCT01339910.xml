  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a Phase III, multicenter trial comparing outcomes after allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) between patients receiving myeloablative conditioning (MAC)
      versus reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to RIC will receive one of two regimen types: the combination of
      fludarabine (120-180 mg/m^2) and busulfan (less than or equal to 8 mg/kg or IV equivalent)
      (Flu/Bu) or fludarabine (120-180 mg/m^2) and melphalan (less than 150 mg/m^2) (Flu/Mel).
      Patient randomized to MAC will receive one of three regimens: busulfan (16 mg/kg oral or 12.8
      mg/kg IV equivalent) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) (Bu/Cy); or, busulfan (16 mg/kg PO or
      12.8 mg/kg IV) and fludarabine (120-180 mg/m^2) (Bu/Flu); or, cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg)
      and total body irradiation (greater than 1200-1420cGy) (CyTBI). A total of 356 patients (178
      to each arm) will be accrued on this study over a period of four years. Patients will be
      followed for up to 18 months from transplantation.

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the trial is to compare 18 month overall survival rates of the two groups of patients starting from the time of randomization to the RIC or MAC arms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>time from randomization to relapse, death, initiation of non-protocol AML or MDS therapy, loss to follow up or end of study whichever comes first</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-free survival will be at different time points. Patients are considered a failure if they die or suffer from disease relapse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment-related Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-related mortality (TRM) is defined as death occurring in a patient from causes other than disease relapse. Individuals who relapse are censored for the event of TRM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>Neutrophil engraftment is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500 µL for 3 consecutive measurements on different days. The first of the 3 days will be designated the day of neutrophil engraftment. Platelet engraftment is defined as achieving platelet counts greater than 20,000 and 50,000/µL for consecutive measurements over 7 days without requiring platelet transfusions. The first of the 7 days will be designated the day of platelet engraftment. Subjects must not have had platelet transfusions during the preceding 7 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Donor Cell Engraftment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 100 and 18 months post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>Donor cell engraftment will be assessed by donor recipient chimerism studies. For this protocol, mixed chimerism will be defined as the presence of donor cells, as a proportion of the total population of less than 95% in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. Full donor chimerism is defined as greater than 95% donor donor cells. Mixed or full donor chimerism will be evidence of donor engraftment. For this protocol, graft rejection is defined as the inability to detect or loss of detection of greater than 5% donor cells as a proportion of the total population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) of Grades II-IV and III-IV</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>The first day of acute GVHD onset at a certain grade will be used to calculate cumulative incidence curves for that GVHD grade (e.g., if the onset of grade I acute GVHD is on Day 19 post-transplant and onset of grade III is on Day 70 post-transplant, time to grade III is Day 70). This endpoint will be evaluated through 100 days and compared between treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic GVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The first day of chronic GVHD onset will be used to calculate cumulative incidence curves. Rates and severity of chronic GVHD will be compared between treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Primary Graft Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined by lack of neutrophil engraftment by 28 days. Rates of primary graft failure will be compared between treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Secondary Graft Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined by initial neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline in neutrophil counts less than 500/µL unresponsive to growth factor therapy. Rates of secondary graft failure will be compared between treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Toxicities Greater Than Grade 3</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>All toxicities greater than or equal to Grade 3 will be tabulated by grade for each treatment arm, by type of toxicity as well as the peak grade overall. Toxicity frequencies will be described for each time interval as well as cumulative over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Infections</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 18 months post transplant or until death</time_frame>
    <description>The number of infections and the number of patients experiencing infections will be tabulated by type of infection, severity, and time period after transplant. The cumulative incidence of severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections will be compared between the two treatment arms at 6, 12, and 18 months from transplant or until death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune Reconstitution</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 100 days, 12 months and 18 months post transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative assessments of peripheral blood CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 positive lymphocytes will be done through flow cytometric analysis at baseline , 100 days, 12 months and 18 months post transplantation. Results will be tabulated according to time from transplant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life (HQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to transplant, 100 days, 12 and 18 months or until death</time_frame>
