      The purpose of this study is to determine proportion of patients presented a search allelic
      imbalance of expression of genes BRCA 1 and 2 in population with hereditary breast and/or
      ovarian cancer risk and negative for deletion mutation BRCA 1 and 2 genes

    <description>The main objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of patients with allelic imbalance at the level of expression of BRCA1 in a population meeting the criteria suggestive of a hereditary predisposition to breast and / or ovarian cancer , and negative for deleterious mutations of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2.</description>

    <measure>Study the variability of the measurement of the allelic expression depending on the position of SNPs</measure>
    <time_frame>blood sample at baseline, no follow-up in this study</time_frame>
    <description>Study the variability of the measurement of the allelic expression depending on the position of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the gene, in order to extend this research to variants of unknown significance whatever their position in the gene.</description>

    <description>Estimate the proportion of patients with allelic imbalance at the level of expression of the BRCA2 gene in the same population.</description>

    <measure>Observe the possible effect of age</measure>
    <time_frame>blood sample at baseline, no follow-up in this study</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of allelic imbalance of expression will be compared depending on the age of the witnesses in the control population. The potential effect of age on the presence or absence of allelic imbalance of expression will be observed.</description>
