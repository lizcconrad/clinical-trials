  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Subjects with advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors,
             refractory to any standard therapy, have no standard therapy available, or subjects
             must have actively refused any treatment which would be regarded standard, and / or if
             in the judgment of the investigator, experimental treatment is clinically and
             ethically acceptable

          -  At least 1 tumor lesion measurable by computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) according to RECIST 1.1

          -  Estimated creatinine clearance 60 mL/min according to Modification of Diet in Renal
             Disease Study Group (MDRD) formula(2)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Subjects with a history of hypertension should be on a stable anti-hypertensive
             treatment for more than 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A signed
             informed consent must be obtained prior to any study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with potentially curable disease will be explicity excluded from
             enrollment into the study

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug (active investigational medicinal product or
             excipients of the preparations) or any agent given in association with this study

          -  History of cardiac disease: congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA Class II, unstable angina
             (anginal symptoms at rest), new-onset angina (within the past 3 months prior to study
             entry), myocardial infarction within the past 3 months prior to study entry, or
             cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are
             permitted)

          -  Moderate or severe hepatic impairment, i.e. Child-Pugh class B or C(3)

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic hepatitis B or C

          -  Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the subject is &gt;3 months from
             definitive therapy, has no evidence of tumor growth on an imaging study within 4 weeks
             prior to study entry, and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the time
             of study entry. Subjects must not be on acute steroid therapy or taper off steroid
             therapy (chronic steroid therapy is acceptable provided that the dose is stable for 4
             weeks prior to study entry and following screening CT / MRI scan). Subjects with
             neurological symptoms should undergo a CT / MRI scan of the brain to exclude new or
             progressive brain metastases. Spinal cord metastasis is acceptable

          -  Previous or coexisting cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from the
             cancer evaluated in this study EXCEPT cervical cancer in-situ, treated basal cell
             carcinoma, superficial bladder tumors [Ta and Tis], or any cancer curatively treated
             &gt;3 years prior to study entry

          -  Anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry. Mitomycin C or
             nitrosoureas should not be given within 6 weeks of study entry. Anticancer therapy is
             defined as any agent or combination of agents with clinically proven anti tumor
             activity administered by any route with the purpose of affecting the malignancy,
             either directly or indirectly, including palliative and therapeutic endpoints.
             Accepted exceptions are bisphosphonates, Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)
             agonists for prostate cancer, and mitotane for adrenal carcinoma.

          -  Radiotherapy to target lesions within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Palliative radiotherapy will be allowed as described in Section 6.9 of this protocol.
             Radiotherapy to the target lesions during study will be regarded as progressive
             disease

          -  Use of biological response modifiers, such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
             (G-CSF), within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Granulocyte-colony
             stimulating factor (G-CSF) and other hematopoietic growth factors may be used in the
             management of acute toxicity such as febrile neutropenia when clinically indicated or
             at the discretion of the investigator, however, they may not be substituted for a
             required dose reduction
