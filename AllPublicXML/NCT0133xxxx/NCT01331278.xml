    <textblock>
      The custom cutting guides personalized for each patient via pre-operative MRI will result in
      significantly faster intraoperative time with comparable knee alignment accuracy, cost, knee
      function, and patient satisfaction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  must be scheduled to undergo TKA with no bilateral TKA planned within 6 weeks of the
             initial surgery date

          -  must be capable and willing to provide informed consent

          -  must have flexion contracture less than 15 degrees.

             extension stress

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  medical condition or personal circumstances that will prevent participation and
             completion of the follow-up visits at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months post-op

          -  currently participating in or has participated in (within 30 days prior to inclusion
             in this study) another clinical trial of an investigational drug, biologic, device, or
             procedure

          -  known pre-operative systemic infections, uncontrolled diabetes, or diseases or
             conditions that are known to interfere with the wound healing process

          -  Knee alignment deformities greater than 7 degrees varus or valgus

          -  known prior knee revisions or previous surgeries deemed to compromise the TKA incision
             exposure

          -  known medical conditions prohibiting the use of MRI or nickel allergy, sensitivity, or
             hardware in the region of the knee
