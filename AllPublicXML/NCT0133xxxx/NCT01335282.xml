      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a history of more than two millenniums. It has been a
      common practice in China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea and is becoming increasingly popular
      worldwide in recent decades However, there is no general consensus for treatment of many
      diseases among TCM practitioners. In some specialties, such as neurology, there is not enough
      well documented case reports for practitioners to make reference with. Different
      practitioners may give different opinions according to their own experience and patients
      often feel frustrated about that.

      Therefore, it is worth recording cases of neurological diseases, with accurate western
      medicine diagnosis and TCM theory explained. Possible TCM treatments can be suggested
      accordingly. Being an academic research supervised by western medicine doctor, this study can
      help to suggest more objective opinion with least conflict of interest.

      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a history of more than two millenniums. It has been a
      common practice in China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. In recent decades, it is becoming
      increasingly popular worldwide(Victor S. Sierpina 2005). Studies in Hong Kong, showed that
      TCM is quite common among children in Hong Kong, with about a quarter of children consulting
      a pediatrician are concurrently using Chinese Medicine.(Lee 2006; Li 2006).

      However, there is a lack of standardized protocol for treatment of many diseases among TCM
      practitioners. In some specialties, such as neurology, there is not enough well documented
      case reports for TCM practitioners to make reference. Different TCM practitioners may give
      different opinions according to their own experience and patients often feel frustrated about
      that.

      Therefore, it is worth recording cases of neurological diseases, with accurate western
      medicine diagnosis and TCM theory explained. Possible TCM treatments can be suggested
      accordingly. Being an academic research supervised by western medicine doctor, this study can
      help to suggest more objective opinion with least conflict of interest.
