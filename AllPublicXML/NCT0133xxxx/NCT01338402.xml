      The purpose of this study was to assess the ocular response to and performance of the
      cosmetically printed silicone hydrogel contact lens AIR OPTIX® COLORS compared to FRESHLOOK®
      COLORBLENDS.

      The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 was an adaptation phase where participants
      wore AIR OPTIX® AQUA contact lenses bilaterally (same product in both eyes) on a daily wear
      basis for 1 week. In Phase 2, participants wore AIR OPTIX® COLORS and FRESHLOOK® COLORBLENDS
      contact lenses contralaterally (different product in each eye) on a daily wear basis for 4
      weeks.
