  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug that is under investigation during this study is BAY85-3934 which is intended to be
      used as a treatment for patients suffering from renal anemia due to chronic kidney disease
      (stage 3 and 4).

      The purpose of this study is to provide safety and tolerability information on the drug.
      Other objectives of the study are to investigate the effect of the drug on the body
      (pharmacodynamics) as well as the absorption, breakdown, metabolism, distribution and
      excretion (pharmacokinetics) by measuring the concentration in blood and urine.

      The study will be conducted in one study center in the United Kingdom and several centers in
      Germany. 84 (of which 36 are optional) patients who meet the inclusion criteria will
      participate in the study. BAY 85-3934 will be given following a combined single / multiple
      dose escalation design in seven (of which three are optional) dose steps.
