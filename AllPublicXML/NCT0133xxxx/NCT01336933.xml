    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy and pralatrexate works in
      treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Drugs used in chemotherapy work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate in a Phase II study a preliminary estimate of the complete response (CR) rate
      of a new chemotherapy regimen involving Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, Vincristine and
      Prednisone (CEOP) alternating with Pralatrexate (P) as front line therapy for patients with
      Stage II, III and IV Peripheral T-Cell NHL not otherwise specified (NOS), Anaplastic large
      cell lymphoma (ALK negative), Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, Enteropathy associated
      T-cell lymphoma, Hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma followed by an optional stem cell
      transplant with high dose chemotherapy and Autologous stem cell transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate partial response (PR). II. To evaluate overall response (CR+PR). III. To
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of the regimen. IV. To assess the 2 year event free
      survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) using this regimen.

      V. To assess the percentage of patients who intended to receive transplant versus those who
      actually proceeded with transplant.

      VI. To evaluate the ability to collect peripheral blood stem cells after this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1,
      etoposide IV on days 1-3 or orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-3, and prednisone PO QD on
      days 1-5 (CEOP administration). Patients also receive pralatrexate IV over 3-5 minutes on
      days 15, 22, and 29 (P administration). Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with CR or PR, per investigators discretion, may then undergo hematopoietic stem
      cell collection and administration of standard preparative regimen followed by hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years (transplant
      patients) or periodically.
