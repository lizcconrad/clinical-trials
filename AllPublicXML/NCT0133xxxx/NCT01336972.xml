  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial was to determine the short-term effects of tolvaptan in patients
      with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) at various levels of renal
      function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal function was assessed during screening with the estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR), which was calculated with the 4-variable modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD)
      equation using a minimum of 2 creatinine measurements. The eGFR values were used to
      categorize participants into 1 of 3 mutually exclusive strata (&gt; 60 [Group A], 30 to 60
      [Group B], and &lt; 30 [Group C] mL/min/1.73 m^2). Each of the 3 groups received the same
      tolvaptan treatment.

      During the 3-week treatment period, participants were up-titrated on a weekly basis from
      45/15 mg to 60/30 mg to 90/30 mg (AM and PM [8 hours later] split-dose) to the maximally
      tolerated dose. The 3-week treatment period was followed by a 3-week post-treatment period
      during which no study medication was administered.

      The effects of the highest tolerated split-dose of tolvaptan on renal hemodynamics and
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed throughout the 6 weeks of the
      study. The reversibility of changes during the post-treatment period after withdrawal of the
      drug was determined and the acute transitory effects on kidney volume were also explored.

    <description>Renal function measurements were performed using the constant infusion method with 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran. A priming solution containing 20 mL infusion solution (0.04 MBq of 125I-iothalamate and 0.03 MBq of 131I-hippuran) was given at 08:00 hours, followed by a constant infusion of 6 to 12 mL/h, with the lowest infusion rates in subjects with impaired renal function, based on previously known serum creatinine concentrations. Plasma concentrations of both tracers were allowed to stabilize during a 1.5-hour equilibration, which was followed by two 2-hour periods (09:30 to 11:30 hours and 11:30 to 13:30 hours) for simultaneous clearances of 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran. Blood was drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours post consumption of water/tolvaptan (08:30 hours). The mGFR was corrected for voiding errors.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Measured Glomerular Filtration Rate (mGFR) After 3 Weeks of Tolvaptan Treatment and at 3 Weeks Post Treatment.</title>
        <description>Renal function measurements were performed using the constant infusion method with 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran. A priming solution containing 20 mL infusion solution (0.04 MBq of 125I-iothalamate and 0.03 MBq of 131I-hippuran) was given at 08:00 hours, followed by a constant infusion of 6 to 12 mL/h, with the lowest infusion rates in subjects with impaired renal function, based on previously known serum creatinine concentrations. Plasma concentrations of both tracers were allowed to stabilize during a 1.5-hour equilibration, which was followed by two 2-hour periods (09:30 to 11:30 hours and 11:30 to 13:30 hours) for simultaneous clearances of 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran. Blood was drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours post consumption of water/tolvaptan (08:30 hours). The mGFR was corrected for voiding errors.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Effective Renal Plasma Flow (ERPF) After 3 Weeks of Tolvaptan Treatment and at 3 Weeks Post Treatment.</title>
        <description>Renal function measurements were performed using the constant infusion method with 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran. A priming solution containing 20 mL infusion solution (0.04 MBq of 125I-iothalamate and 0.03 MBq of 131I-hippuran) was given at 08:00 hours, followed by a constant infusion of 6 to 12 mL/h, with the lowest infusion rates in subjects with impaired renal function, based on previously known serum creatinine concentrations. Plasma concentrations of both tracers were allowed to stabilize during a 1.5-hour equilibration, which was followed by two 2-hour periods (09:30 to 11:30 hours and 11:30 to 13:30 hours) for simultaneous clearances of 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran. Blood was drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours post consumption of water/tolvaptan (08:30 hours).</description>

        <description>Renal function measurements were performed using the constant infusion method with 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran. A priming solution containing 20 mL infusion solution (0.04 MBq of 125I-iothalamate and 0.03 MBq of 131I-hippuran) was given at 08:00 hours, followed by a constant infusion of 6 to 12 mL/h, with the lowest infusion rates in subjects with impaired renal function, based on previously known serum creatinine concentrations. Plasma concentrations of both tracers were allowed to stabilize during a 1.5-hour equilibration, which was followed by two 2-hour periods (09:30 to 11:30 hours and 11:30 to 13:30 hours) for simultaneous clearances of 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran. Blood was drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours post consumption of water/tolvaptan (08:30 hours).</description>
