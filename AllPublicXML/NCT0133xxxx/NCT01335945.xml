    <textblock>
      CUC10-PAN09 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryoablation therapy on the relief of
      epigastric/abdominal pain associated with pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CUC10-PAN09 is a Supportive Care, Phase 1 multicenter, prospective, single arm study with
      subjects serving as their own control. This study is to enroll patients who will undergo
      cryoablation of the Celiac Plexus. Subjects will be followed for 3 months post their
      cryoablation procedure.

      Cryoablation is the process of destroying tissue by the application of extremely cold
      temperatures. Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems are used as a surgical tool in the fields of
      general surgery, dermatology (skin), neurology (nerves), chest surgery (including lung),
      Ears-Nose-Throat (ENT), gynecology, oncology (cancer), proctology (colon/rectal) and urology
      (kidney).
