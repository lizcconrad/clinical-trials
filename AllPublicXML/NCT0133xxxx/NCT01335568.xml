      This clinical investigation of the hepatocyte matrix implant is an evaluation blinded
      non-randomized and monocentric pilot study of Phase I, which is conducted as a therapeutic
      investigation. Randomization is not possible due to ethical and practical reasons. This study
      has already been approved in Switzerland and has been adapted to Indonesian Law and disease.

      This new treatment procedure has already been successfully used on the basis of compassionate
      use in Germany. The hepatocyte matrix implant is a new patented procedure consisting of
      bio-matrix technology. A formaldehyde-free special matrix consisting of self-dissolving
      polymers is applied as a carrier substance and is cultivated with human autologous cells
      using a special technique. Clinically the bio artificial liver replacement tissue for
      patients with end-stage hepatic disease has been developed as a first application. In this
      procedure autologous hepatocytic tissue and pancreatic tissue is removed (liver resection and
      pancreatic biopsy) from the patient in a first surgical procedure. The tissue is sent to a
      specialized Cell Culture Laboratory. The laboratory is GMP certified for this procedure. The
      cells are processed according to SOPs in a special perfusion procedure and prepared on
      several platelets of matrices (platelets of 20 mm diameter and 4mm thickness). After
      completion of the laboratory process the bio tissues are implanted into the mesentery of the
      small intestine during a second operation. The cells are growing controlled on the matrix,
      take on the capillaries of the patient and thus connect to the blood circulation. The
      implanted cells multiply by a specific factor and independently take over the metabolic
      function of the original liver after two to four weeks. In the following process the carrier
      matrix dissolves completely and implanted cells develop into liver cell tissue.
