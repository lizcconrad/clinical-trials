  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an experimental drug called EZN-4176 to determine the anticancer
      effects when it is given to patients with an advanced form of prostate cancer called
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Goals of this phase I study include finding out
      the dose of EZN-4176 that can be safely given without serious side effects and to determine
      the amount of EZN-4176 that should be given in future studies.

      This study will be conducted in two phases:

        -  Phase 1a will involve dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The
           MTD will be determined on the basis of the results from the safety evaluation.

        -  Phase 1b will involve cohort expansion at one or more dose levels to determine the
           recommended Phase 2 dose. The recommended Phase 2 dose, which may differ from the MTD,
           will be determined on the basis of results from safety, activity, and pharmacologic and
           correlative studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Capable of understanding protocol requirements &amp; risks &amp; providing written informed
             consent

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic prostate
             adenocarcinoma

          3. Ongoing gonadal androgen-deprivation therapy with LHRH analogs or orchiectomy.
             Patients without orchiectomy must receive effective LHRH analog therapy during the
             study

          4. Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL

          5. Progressive disease after androgen deprivation - with all 3 of the following
             criteria:PSA evidence of progressive prostate cancer; PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL increasing on at
             least 2 successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart. If confirmatory PSA &lt; screening
             PSA, additional test for increasing PSA is needed

          6. Patients receiving anti-androgen agent as part of primary androgen ablation: disease
             progression after stopping the anti-androgen agent. This disease progression is
             defined: 2 consecutive increasing PSAs ≥ 2 weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft
             tissue progression. Flutamide patients: at least one of the PSAs ≥ 4 weeks after
             stopping flutamide. Bicalutamide or nilutamide patients: at least one PSA ≥ 6 weeks
             after stopping the anti-androgen agent.

          7. Patients who failed standard therapy or who, after physician discussion, wish to delay
             chemotherapy

          8. Age ≥ 18 yrs

          9. ECOG Score: 0-1

          4. Male patient of reproductive capacity unwilling to use methods appropriate to prevent
             pregnancy. In the UK, double-barrier contraception required. Patients should continue
             to use contraception for 3 months after stopping EZN-4176 due to potential for
             prolonged half-life of EZN-4176 in the liver.

             first dose of EZN-4176

          8. Initiation of bisphosphonates within 4 weeks of enrollment. Patients receiving stable
             doses of bisphosphonates with subsequent tumor progression may continue to receive
