      This is a Phase 1, dose escalation trial evaluating the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of ABT-767 in subjects with advanced Breast Cancer 1 or 2 gene (BRCA1 or
      BRCA2)-mutated solid tumors and high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      This is a Phase 1, dose escalation trial evaluating the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of ABT-767 in subjects with advanced BRCA1 or BRCA2-mutated solid tumors and
      high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. ABT-767 is a potent
      oral inhibitor of the enzymes poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP-1 and PARP-2).
      Malignancies with deficiencies in homologous repair, such as BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 deficient
      tumors, are more dependent on PARP for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair than normal cells
      and, thus, are thought to be more sensitive to PARP inhibition. The study design is a
      single-arm dose escalation study to determine dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated
      dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of orally administered ABT-767 in subjects with
      BRCA mutations and malignancies. In order to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      ABT-767 at the RPTD, 20 additional subjects will be enrolled in an expanded safety cohort
      consisting of BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutated Breast cancer and Ovarian cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Subjects must have histological or cytological confirmation of locally advanced or
             metastatic solid tumor, and a documented Breast Cancer Gene 1 or 2 mutation, or high
             grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

          3. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 to 2

          4. Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function as follows: a.
             Bone Marrow: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC ≥ 1,500/mm3 (1.5 ≥ 109/L); Platelets ≥
             100,000/mm3 (100 ≥ 109/L); Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL (1.4 mmol/L) (hemoglobin unsupported
             by transfusion b. Subject has adequate renal function as demonstrated by serum
             creatinine value of ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and either an estimated
             creatinine clearance value of ≥ 50 mL/min as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula
             or a creatinine clearance value of ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on a 24-hour urine
             collections c. Subject has adequate liver function as demonstrated by serum bilirubin
             ≤ 1.5 x ULN and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5
             ULN. For subjects with liver metastasis, AST and ALT &lt; 5 x ULN. Partial Thromboplastin
             Time (PTT) must be ≤ ULN and INR &lt; 1.5. - Subjects on anticoagulant (such as Coumadin)
             are allowed on study and will have PTT and International Normalize Ratio (INR) as
             determined by the Investigator.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to
             study entry, for the duration of the study participation, and for 90 days following
             completion of therapy. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 21 days prior to initiation of treatment and a negative urine
             pregnancy test on the first day of study drug administration. Post-menopausal women
             must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing
             potential.

             (PARP) inhibitor.

          6. Clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) or any medical condition which in the
             opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk for
             toxicities.

          7. Psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.
