  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common running injury and is believed to be
      associated with higher than normal knee joint loading. Footwear has been developed that may
      decrease these knee loads in healthy subjects, but their effects on patients with PFPS are
      unknown. In this study, we aim to test the effects of such footwear on patients with PFPS. We
      hypothesize that patients who receive the footwear intervention will show a decrease in knee
      joint loading, and consequently will show improvements in subjective levels of perceived knee
      pain over a period of six weeks compared to a control condition.

    <measure>Knee joint internal abduction moments of force during running at 4m/s</measure>
    <time_frame>First day of joining the study</time_frame>
    <description>Motion analysis trials will be conducted on each subject with both the control and intervention footwear. Inverse dynamics calculations will reveal the internal joint loading for each subject. Knee joint moments will be compared within subjects for each footwear condition.</description>

    <measure>Change in subjective levels of perceived knee pain over six weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon initial recruitment to the study, and once per week for six weeks thereafter</time_frame>
    <description>Pain levels will be recorded by 100mm visual analog scale during weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the study to monitor the efficacy of the intervention. Final change in pain will be compared between groups.</description>
