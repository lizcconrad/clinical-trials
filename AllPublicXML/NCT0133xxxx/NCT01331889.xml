  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid infusion of red blood cells is known to result in hyperkalemia in the body. However,
      potassium concentration in the blood mixture (usually made of RBC, FFP and normal saline) in
      the reservoir of rapid infusion system and its effect on the plasma potassium change during
      rapid transfusion are unknown. This study is designed to investigate these changes while
      massive transfusion is performed during liver transplantation surgery.

    <measure>potassium concentration in the Fluid Management System (FMS) reservoir</measure>
    <time_frame>after transfusion of 150 ml of blood mixture</time_frame>
    <description>During bolus transfusion (300ml) of blood mixture, blood sample is taken from the side port of infusion line of Fluid Management System (FMS) when 150 ml of blood mixture was transfused. Because the priming volume of the internal circuit is approximately 100 ml, blood sample that was taken after 150 ml transfusion represents the content in the reservoir.</description>

    <time_frame>before and after transfuison of 300 ml of blood mixture</time_frame>
    <description>Just before transfusion starts, blood samples are taken from the central venous catheter and arterial line at the same time to measure baseline values. At the immediate end of transfusion, blood samples are taken again from the same sites to measure the resultant changes.</description>
