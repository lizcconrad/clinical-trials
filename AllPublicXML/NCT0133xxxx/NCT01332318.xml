        <title>Change From Baseline (Day -1) in Overall Lane Position Variability (LPV) on Day 16 (Tmax)</title>
        <description>Lane position variability (LPV) was defined as the standard deviation of lane position, and was measured from the center line of the 26 foot wide 2-lane paved road to the center of the vehicle. Change from baseline in overall LPV was calculated as the Day 16 mean LPV over the 1-hour drive minus the Baseline mean LPV over the 1-hour drive. The Day 16 measurement is at the time of maximum concentration (Tmax) for both GEn and DPH.</description>

        <description>Alertness VAS was completed immediately before and after each simulated driving assessment. Participants indicated their alertness by marking a vertical line on a horizontal scale anchored by responses &quot;extremely sleepy&quot; and &quot;extremely alert.&quot; VAS score was determined by measuring the distance in millimeters (mm) from the left hand end of the line to the point the participant marked. Scores ranged from 0-100 mm, with higher scores indicating more alertness and lower scores indicating more sleepiness. Change score was calculated as the Day 14, 15, or 16 VAS score minus the Baseline VAS score.</description>

        <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a questionnaire designed to evaluate daytime sleepiness. Participants were asked to rate how likely they were to doze or fall asleep during 8 activities on a scale of 0 (&quot;would never do&quot;) to 3 (&quot;high chance of dozing&quot;). The total score ranges from 0-24, with a score greater than 10 representing excessive daytime sleepiness (an increased chance of dozing).

Change from baseline was calculated as the Day 14 total score minus the Baseline total score.</description>

        <description>The BAC was designed as a comprehensive measure of cognitive function, including 6 individual tests: Verbal Memory Recall, Digit Sequencing, Token Motor Task, Verbal Fluency, Symbol Coding, and Tower of London. The composite/total BAC score is calculated by scoring each individual test, comparing each score to a healthy control sample (matched for sex and age category) to create z-scores, summing the z-scores, and rescaling the sum. The composite score range is -2127.8 to 1878.8, with higher scores indicating better cognition.</description>

        <description>Participants (par.) were presented with sets of numbers of increasing length and asked to tell the experimenter the numbers in order from lowest to highest. The task has 7 levels; the first level had 2 digits in the set (e.g., 5, 2); the second level had 3 digits in the set, etc. The number of times the par. correctly arranged the numbers was recorded as the score for each level. The DSS is the sum of the 7 level scores (range: 0-28). The scaled test score was calculated as indicated for the Verbal Memory Test and ranges from -6.68 to 2.73; higher scaled scores indicate better cognition.</description>

          <description>Participants (par.) were presented with sets of numbers of increasing length and asked to tell the experimenter the numbers in order from lowest to highest. The task has 7 levels; the first level had 2 digits in the set (e.g., 5, 2); the second level had 3 digits in the set, etc. The number of times the par. correctly arranged the numbers was recorded as the score for each level. The DSS is the sum of the 7 level scores (range: 0-28). The scaled test score was calculated as indicated for the Verbal Memory Test and ranges from -6.68 to 2.73; higher scaled scores indicate better cognition.</description>

        <description>Participants were given 100 plastic tokens and asked to place them in a container, 2 at a time, as quickly as possible for 60 seconds. The number of tokens correctly placed in the container was the Token Motor Task score (range: 0-100). The BAC was conducted prior to each simulated driving test. The Token Motor Task scaled test score was calculated as indicated for the Verbal Memory Test. Change from baseline was calculated as the Day composite score minus the Baseline composite score. The scaled test score range is -6.95 to 3.35, with higher scaled scores indicating better cognition.</description>

        <description>Participants were given a list of numbers (numerals 1-9) that were each associated with a unique symbol. Participants decoded a list of 110 symbols as quickly as possible in 90 seconds. The total number of symbols correctly decoded was the Symbol Coding Score (range: 0-110). The Symbol Coding scaled test score was calculated as indicated for the Verbal Memory Test. Change from baseline was calculated as the Day composite score minus the Baseline composite score. The scaled test score range is -7 to 10.08, with higher scaled scores indicating better cognition.</description>

        <description>Participants (par.) were asked to look at 2 pictures simultaneously; each picture showed 3 different colored balls arranged on 3 pegs. Par. were to estimate the number of times the balls in 1 picture would have to be moved to make the arrangement of balls identical to that of the second picture. Par. were allowed 20 seconds to respond to each pair of pictures. The number of correct items was the TOL Score (range: 0-22). The TOL scaled test score was calculated as indicated for the Verbal Memory Test. The scaled test score range is -7.53 to 2.76; higher scaled scores indicate better cognition.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (Day -1) to Day 14 (Evening) and Day 16 (at Tmax) and Change From Baseline (Day 1) to Day 15 (Morning After Dose) in the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (PghSD) Sleep Quality</title>
        <description>The PghSD assessed a participant's previous night's sleep. Sleep quality was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Participants indicated their sleep quality by marking a vertical line on a horizontal scale anchored by responses &quot;very bad&quot; and &quot;very good.&quot; VAS score was determined by measuring the distance in millimeters (mm) from the left hand end of the line to the point that the participant marked. Scores ranged from 0 to 100 mm with higher scores indicating better sleep quality and lower scores indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
