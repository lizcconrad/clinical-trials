      The purpose of this study is to develop a predictive antiretroviral pharmacokinetic model of
      mucosal fluid and tissue distribution in genital tract fluid, rectal fluid and 3 mucosal
      tissues. This will be accomplished by determining the pharmacokinetic disposition and dose
      proportionality of four antiretrovirals (tenofovir, emtricitabine, maraviroc, and
      raltegravir) in human rectal and cervicovaginal fluid and rectal, cervical, and vaginal
      tissue.
