      The purpose of this study was to compare the use of lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC)
      alone vs. continuing a failing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen in HIV
      infected children, adolescents and young adults. The study was to see if there were changes
      in the HIV virus and if there were differences in immune function, viral load and medication
      side effects between the two groups over 28 weeks. Participants were assigned to either take
      3TC or FTC alone or continue on his/her current failing HAART regimen. During the first 28
      weeks of this study, if the participant was randomized to the continue HAART arm, he/she was
      not switched to a different or new, potentially suppressive HAART regimen, but continued on
      the current failing HAART regimen. However, if continuing HAART, the participant might be
      switched to a new regimen if their provider felt that it was clinically needed or the
      participant met certain study endpoints (e.g., drop in CD4, increase in viral load).

      At the end of 28 weeks, the participant had the choice of remaining on the assigned study
      group medication(s) or starting a new HAART regimen prescribed by his/her doctor. Then, they
      would be followed for another 24 weeks to compare the difference in immune function, viral
      load and medication side effects between the different groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no clear consensus for managing virologic failure. Generally, failure of
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy due to non-adherence is
      associated with high rates of NNRTI resistance, while failure of protease inhibitor
      (PI)-based therapy due to non-adherence carries a much lower risk of PI resistance. In the
      setting of incomplete adherence and virologic failure despite adherence education, an optimal
      strategy would be one that effectively bridges the period between the cessation of the
      failing regimen of highly active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and initiation of a new HAART
      regimen. This would provide time for interventions to improve adherence to be effective while
      minimizing accumulation of additional drug resistance mutations. Given the compelling need
      for an effective bridging strategy, the limited evidence for the safety and efficacy of this
      bridging regimen, and the high level of acceptability of studying 3TC or FTC monotherapy as
      an effective alternative, P1094 proposed to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT)
      comparing use of 3TC or FTC monotherapy as a short-term bridging regimen vs. continuation of
      non-suppressive HAART in non-adherent subjects.

      This study closed early due to lack of accrual, with only 33 of the target 344 participants
      enrolled. Therefore analyses, including the analysis of the primary outcome, are descriptive.
      Only analyses for Step 1 could be done (Step 2 was observational). The following secondary
      analyses could not be performed:

      Changes in Genotypic HIV Drug Resistance From Baseline Changes HIV Replication Capacity [Time
      Frame: 28 and 52 weeks] Changes in CD4 Percent and CD4+ T Cell Count [Time Frame: 52 weeks]
      Changes in HIV-1 RNA Levels [Time Frame: 52 Weeks] Changes in Immune Activation [Time Frame:
      28 and 52 Weeks] Number and Percent of Subjects With Adverse Clinical Outcomes [Time Frame:
      52 Weeks] Adherence as Measured by 3-day Recall [Time Frame: 52 Weeks]

             collected at different time points

          -  Treatment experienced patients must have demonstrated failure on the current HAART
             regimen for 2 months or longer. These patients must have been on ARVs for at least a
             total of 6 months prior to entry. Thus, if the failing regimen was the first ARV
             regimen, then the patient must have been on that initial regimen for a minimum of 6
             months total.

          -  CD4+ T cell count greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm3 (confirmed on at least two
             occasions within 6 months of study entry, including the screening value)

          -  Documentation of the M184V mutation on genotypic testing at any time prior to study
             entry

          -  In the best judgment of the clinical site team, concerns about the subject's ability
             to adhere made it unsuitable to initiate a new optimal HAART regimen for at least 6
             months.

          -  Subject had not become adherent despite site's adherence interventions

          -  Female subjects of reproductive potential engaging in sexual activity that could lead
             to pregnancy had to agree to avoid pregnancy during the entire 52 week trial and to
             consistently and appropriately use at least two of the following contraception
             methods: condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, IUD, hormonal-based
             contraception. A list of acceptable methods can be found at the FDA Birth Control
             Guide (http://www.fda.gov/womens).

          -  Parent/legal guardian or subject able and willing to provide signed informed consent
             when applicable

             mg/kg/per day or greater than 20 mg total daily dose of prednisone in the 2 weeks
             preceding screening. Subjects for whom long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy
             (greater than 2 weeks) was anticipated were excluded. [Note: non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory agents and inhaled, nasal, and topical corticosteroids were not
             excluded as immunosuppressive therapy.]

          -  Prior immunization with an HIV-specific vaccine

          -  Greater than or equal to 1 CDC class C event within the past 12 months.

             confirmed on two occasions within 3 months of screening).

          -  Active opportunistic infections, including active tuberculosis (TB).

          -  Current treatment for active systemic TB. If recent, infection must have completed
             treatment course. INH treatment for latent TB is allowed.

          -  Viral load greater than 250,000 copies/mL at screening.

          -  Known greater than or equal to Grade 4 laboratory toxicities within 30 days prior to
             study entry, except with approval of the study team.

          -  For subjects who were not taking 3TC or FTC at the time of screening: Documented prior
             intolerance or adverse effect reasonably attributed to 3TC or FTC that resulted in
             permanent discontinuation.

          -  Problems with non-adherence attributed to modifiable structural barriers, such as lack

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from 17 sites in the United States, Argentina, Brazil and Thailand. Enrollment occurred from May 10, 2011 to January 16, 2013.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants were HIV-infected, ≥8 to &lt;25 years of age with documentation of the M184V HIV resistance mutation, were failing their current antiretroviral regimen and were persistently non-adherent. Participants were randomized equally to the two study arms.</pre_assignment_details>
