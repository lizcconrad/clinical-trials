  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is the sixth most common malignancy and the third most common cause
      of cancer-related death worldwide. The incidence of HCC is rising in Europe and the United
      States and is expected to continue to increase during the next 2 to 3 decades. The expected
      survival rate is still decimal, especially in patients with advanced HCC. However, in recent
      years, several treatment methods for patients with advanced HCC, including antiangiogenic
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and DC bead transarterial
      chemoembolization, have been developed. Among these new treatment methods, concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy has also proved to increase patient's survival rate. It is important to
      predict treatment response before treatment or immediately after treatment because there are
      several other treatment options as mentioned above. Recently, there have been several reports
      that MR perfusion parameters such as Ktrans can predict treatment response in cervical cancer
      and colorectal cancer. Therefore the purpose of the investigators study is to evaluate the
      feasibility of predicting treatment response by MR perfusion, contrast enhanced ultrasound
      parameters and biomarkers (IL-6, IL-12 and VEGF) in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma who undertake concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
