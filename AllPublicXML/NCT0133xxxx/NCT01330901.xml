    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at investigation of efficacy and safety of ustekinumab (monoclonal
      antibody against interleukin 12 and 23) treatment in patients with active ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) fulfilling the modified New York criteria who have had an inadequate
      response to standard therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or do not
      tolerate or have a contraindication for NSAIDs.

      This study is a prospective, open-label, proof-of-concept clinical trial that will be
      conducted in a referral center for patients with AS in Berlin. Eligible patients will be
      treated with ustekinumab 90 mg given subcutaneously at weeks 0, 4, and 16. The entire study
      period accounts 28 weeks. Assessment of the primary outcome parameter will be performed at
      week 24. The patients will be closely monitored throughout the study on a total of 9 visits.

             NSAIDs intolerance/contraindication.

          4. Active disease as defined by a BASDAI value of ≥4 at screening despite concomitant
             treatment with an NSAID or without NSAIDs in case of intolerance/contraindication.

          5. Able and willing to give a written informed consent and comply with the requirements
