      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of a decompression using
      the FDA cleared iO-Flex® System on-label in treating patients with spinal stenosis and stable
      grade I degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis using a precision estimate assuming a 55%
      positive response rate.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center (up to 30 sites) controlled clinical
      study enrolling 100 subjects following a pre-specified protocol with no site enrolling more
      than 30 subjects. All eligible subjects providing written informed consent and meeting study
      eligibility criteria will receive a facet preserving decompression using the FDA cleared
      iO-Flex® system on label. Treatment success using the iO-Flex® System will be analyzed using
      a precision estimate assuming a 55% positive response rate.

      In addition to baseline characteristics and procedural parameters, subject outcomes will be
      assessed at 6 weeks, 6-, 12-, and 24 months. The study will have an extended follow-up phase
      with annual follow-up contact through 5 years to evaluate retreatment for the original
      indication at these late time points.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult (&gt; 18 years of age)

          2. Leg/buttock pain, with or without back pain

          3. Grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis (≤25% slippage)

          4. NRS pain score for leg pain of 4/10 or greater

          5. ODI score of 30/100 or greater

          6. Failed non-operative medical management for a period of at least 6 months

          7. Confirmed clinical diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis

          8. Confirmation of central and/or lateral recess stenosis with or without foraminal
             stenosis, at one level or at two adjacent levels from L2-S1, with concordant symptoms.
             Subjects with central and/or lateral recess stenosis and spondylolisthesis at one
             level, may have symptomatic central, lateral recess or foraminal stenosis treated at
             one adjacent level. A &quot;below-the pedicle&quot; pass to decompress a third segment can be
             completed provided laminotomies are performed at no more than 2 levels. Subjects that,
             following an intraoperative decision, have a 3-level laminotomy and decompression will
             not be considered enrolled. Confirmation of spinal stenosis is shown on MRI or CT scan
             with evidence of nerve root impingement (displacement or compression) by either
             osseous or non-osseous elements.

          9. Ability to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in this clinical

             intervention.

          5. Subjects for whom removal of the midline structures is planned, likely or is the
             result of an intraoperative decision; every attempt should be made to spare the
             supraspinous, interspinous and facet capsular ligaments.

          6. Significant instability of the lumbar spine as defined by ≥ 4mm translational motion
