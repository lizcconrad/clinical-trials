  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b open-label study evaluating the preliminary safety and maximum tolerated
      dose of a new formulation of INNO-206 administered at doses of 230 mg/m2, 350 mg/m2 and 450
      mg/m2 (165, 260, 325 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents, respectively) through intravenous
      infusion on Day 1 every 21 days for up to 6 cycles.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 cycles (every 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be based on adverse events, tolerability, physical examinations, vital signs, ECG results, laboratory test results. MTD: If 2 of 5 subjects an any dose level experiences a grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity, or a platelet count &lt;25,000/uL or a neutrophil count &lt;500/uL lasting &gt;7 days and/or associated with fever &gt;38.5C, 3 more subjects will be entered at that dose level. If 2 of 3 of the additional subjects experience any of the above adverse events, the dose level immediately below will be identified as the MTD.</description>
