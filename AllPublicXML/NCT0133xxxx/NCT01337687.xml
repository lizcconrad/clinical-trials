  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in
      speech and communication, impaired social functioning and repetitive behaviors and restricted
      interests. Oxytocin (OT) is peptide that is known for its peripheral effects on facilitating
      uterine contractions and milk let-down; however, studies, mainly with rodents and non-human
      primates, has found that OT is involved in affiliative behaviors, including sexual behavior,
      mother-infant and adult-adult pair-bond formation, separation distress, and other aspects of
      social attachment. Moreover, OT is known to play an important role in repetitive behaviors
      and stress reactivity. Given that repetitive behaviors and deficits in social interaction are
      core symptom domains of autism, and that OT is involved in the regulation of repetitive and
      affiliative behaviors, it is believed that OT may play a role in the etiology of autism.
      Moreover, preliminary data obtained by Hollander and colleagues suggests that OT may be of
      value in treating core autism symptoms. Specifically, synthetic oxytocin administered via
      intravenous infusion to adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) produced significant
      reductions in repetitive behaviors and facilitated social cognition/memory in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled cross-over laboratory challenge.

      Encouraged by these findings, the primary aim of this study is to investigate the safety and
      therapeutic efficacy of intranasal OT in treating repetitive behaviors and social
      functioning/cognitive deficits in adults with ASD. This research embraces a translational
      approach to develop a novel treatment for core ASD symptoms; given that there are currently
      no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication treatments for core ASD symptoms,
      this research addresses an important unmet need in the field. The goal of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment
      (INOT)administration in adults with ASD.
