  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to investigate cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis in Belgian
      children with opportunity to receive Rotarix™ to monitor the potential occurrence of genetic
      drifts (point mutations) in the vaccine strain and the occurrence of genetic shifts
      (re-assortments) between vaccine and naturally circulating wild-type strains in Belgium
      population after the introduction of Rotarix™. The study will also detect if there is any
      alteration in rotavirus pathogenicity conferred by re-assortment and if the mutated vaccine
      strain is still efficacious in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis.

      This study is conducted in two phases: Phase I and Phase II. Phase I will be retrospective
      and consist of re-using the data collected in RotaBel (EPI-ROTA-111426) study. Phase II will
      be prospective and consist of maintaining the active surveillance system to identify
      rotavirus cases in several hospitals in Belgium.
