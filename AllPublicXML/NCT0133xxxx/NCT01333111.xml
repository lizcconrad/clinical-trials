  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, Japan and North America. The aim of this
      trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy, including pharmacokinetics (the rate at which
      the body eliminates the trial drug), of NNC-0156-0000-0009 (nonacog beta pegol) when used for
      treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia B.

    <measure>Haemostatic Effect of NNC-0156-0000-0009 When Used for Prophylaxis of Bleeding Episodes, Assessed as Success/Failure Based on a Four-point Scale for Haemostatic Response</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after treatment start for patients on prophylaxis</time_frame>
    <description>Haemostatic response after treatment of a bleed with nonacog beta pegol was evaluated on a 4 point scale as excellent, good, moderate or poor. A success rate was calculated based on counting good or excellent as successes and poor and moderate as failures.
Excellent - abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection
Good - noticeable pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection
Moderate - probable or slight beneficial effect within the first 8 hours after the first injection but requiring more than one injection within 8 hours
Poor - no improvement, or worsening of symptoms within 8 hours after two injections.
The success rate and 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported here.</description>

    <measure>Number of Bleeding Episodes Per Patient During Routine Prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after treatment start for patients on prophylaxis</time_frame>
    <description>The number of bleeding episodes per patient during routine prophylaxis was assessed using the individual annualised bleeding rates (spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes per patient per year).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Factor IX Trough Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after treatment start for patients on prophylaxis</time_frame>
    <description>The mean pre-dose factor IX levels was measured with the one-stage clotting assay during the trial. Lowest factor IX activity recorded during single-dose and steady state, immediately before next dose was given. The analysis was based on a mixed model on the log-transformed plasma factor IX activity with subject as a random effect. The estimated mean factor IX trough level was presented back-transformed to the natural scale.</description>

          <description>Subjects were randomised to either prophylaxis 10 U/kg or 40 U/kg arm. Subjects in this arm received 10 U/kg nonacog beta pegol dose once weekly (every 7th day ± 24 hours) for a period of 52 weeks. Nonacog beta pegol was given as an intravenous bolus injection with the maximum injection rate at 4 mL/min. Mild and moderate bleeding episodes were treated with 40 U/kg.

        <title>Haemostatic Effect of NNC-0156-0000-0009 When Used for Prophylaxis of Bleeding Episodes, Assessed as Success/Failure Based on a Four-point Scale for Haemostatic Response</title>
        <description>Haemostatic response after treatment of a bleed with nonacog beta pegol was evaluated on a 4 point scale as excellent, good, moderate or poor. A success rate was calculated based on counting good or excellent as successes and poor and moderate as failures.
Excellent – abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection
Good – noticeable pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection
Moderate – probable or slight beneficial effect within the first 8 hours after the first injection but requiring more than one injection within 8 hours
Poor – no improvement, or worsening of symptoms within 8 hours after two injections.
The success rate and 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported here.</description>

Subjects in this arm received 40 U/kg nonacog beta pegol dose once weekly (every 7th day ± 24 hours) for a period of 52 weeks. Nonacog beta pegol was given as an intravenous bolus injection with the maximum injection rate at 4 mL/min. Mild and moderate bleeding episodes were treated with 40 U/kg. Severe bleeding episodes were treated with 80 U/kg.</description>

          <title>On-Demand (28 Weeks)</title>
          <description>Subjects enrolled in this on-demand arm were treated for bleeding episodes on demand with nonacog beta pegol during a period of 28 weeks. Nonacog beta pegol was given as an intravenous bolus injection with the maximum injection rate at 4 mL/min. Mild and moderate bleeding episodes were treated with 40 U/kg. Severe bleeding episodes were treated with 80 U/kg.</description>
