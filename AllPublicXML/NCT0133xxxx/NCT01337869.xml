  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilonidal sinus is a cyst on the natal cleft of the buttocks that often contains hair and
      skin debris. The condition is common and requires surgery to be cured. Several surgical
      procedures are described in literature. Limberg Flap technique is frequently used technique
      for this disease all over the world. However, Bascom Cleft Lift Technique is relatively newer
      technique. The purpose of this prospective randomized study is comparison of these techniques
      about patient satisfaction for postoperative period.

    <description>Patients are positioned prone. The skin incision is drawn on the natal cleft, marking out the area of skin to be excised. The skin from this side of the natal cleft is then elevated. The skin on the opposite side of the cleft then is undermined to a distance required to allow primary closure of the defect away from the midline without tension. The elevated skin island is excised. The sinuses remaining in the deeper tissues are curetted thoroughly. Hemostasis is maintained. A 12F low-suction drain is sited and fat of the natal cleft then is approximated by using an absorbable suture. The wound is closed with a 3-0 polypropylene suture.The drain remains in situ to time that drainage amount decreases below 20 ml/day. The suture is removed in the clinic 10 day after surgery.</description>

    <description>Patients are positioned prone. The area to be excised is mapped-out, and the flap is designed. The area to be excised is mapped on the skin in a rhomboid form. The skin incision is deepened to the presacral fascia. Tissue is removed en bloc. After removing the rhombic excision, the Limberg fascia cutaneous flap is prepared through the right or left-side gluteus maximus fascia. The flap is fully mobilized and transposed medially to fulfill the rhombic defect without any tension. Hemosthasis is accomplished. A 12F low-suction drain is sited and wound is closed in two layers: the subcutaneous tissue with absorbable suture and the skin with 3/0 polypropylene. drain remains in situ to time that drainage amount decreases below 20 ml/day. The suture is removed in the clinic 10 day after surgery.</description>
