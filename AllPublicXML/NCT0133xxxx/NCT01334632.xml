  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus injury after shoulder surgery with continuous interscalene block is 2.4% at 1
      month and 0% at 6 months, but may be higher with a systematic postoperative neurological
      examination. Indeed, femoral neuropathy after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is
      24% at 6 weeks in a cohort of 20 consecutive patients systematically screened with an
      electromyogram. Brachial plexus injury may be the consequence of the surgery (direct lesion
      by traction) or the continuous interscalene block. The goal of this study is to define the
      etiology of this postoperative neuropathy.

    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff surgery is associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain. Among
      different analgesic strategies, continuous interscalene block is reported to be an efficient
      method, reducing opioid consumption and allowing rapid rehabilitation; however, patients may
      develop a transient neuropathy after surgery, which could have a significant impact on active
      patients. This study is designed to compare the incidence of brachial plexus injury in two
      groups of patients: one with a continuous interscalene block, and one with a patient control
      analgesia of morphine (self-iv administration of morphine). All patients will have a clinical
      neurological exam with a preoperative electromyogram in order to rule out a pre-existing
      neuropathy. Another clinical neurological exam with electromyogram will be performed between
      4 and 6 postoperative weeks and, if pathological repeated at 6 months, 9 months and 12
      months. The surgery will be done under general anesthesia for all patients.
