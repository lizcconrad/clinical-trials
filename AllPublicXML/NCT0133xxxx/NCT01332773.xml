      To show whether the artery first approach leads to equal or less rate of positive resection
      margins in pancreatic head cancer than the standard technique (ppWhipple only with standard
      Kocher's manoeuvre)

      This is a prospective non-randomized trial with two study groups. The trial is designed to
      show if the ARTERY FIRST approach reduces the rate of R1 resections in patients undergoing
      surgery for cancer of the pancreatic head.

      After the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreatic head by clinical, laboratory and imaging
      evaluation patients who are scheduled for resection will be screened for inclusion into the
      trial. Informed consent is obtained at least on the day before surgery and patients meeting
      the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study.

    <description>The basic principle of the &quot;artery first&quot; approach is the early identification of the SMA at its origin at the aorta with the further resection then being guided by its anatomic course.
The dissection is carried cephalad along the aorta until the origin of the SMA is reached. The posterior and right aspect of the SMA is then dissected over a few centimeters. On the right side of the SMA a replaced or accessory right hepatic artery, if present, will be identified and preserved. This maneuver should be done, if infiltration of the SMA is suspected as the procedure can be terminated at this point. Once the situation at the SMA is assessed and resectability is confirmed resection will be done.</description>

    <description>A wide Kocher manoeuver is performed to fully mobilize the duodenum and the head of the pancreas. The colonic mesentery on the right side is separated from the anterior surface of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas. The size of the tumor and its relation to the superior mesenteric artery, the celiac trunk, the mesentery, the portal vein, and the superior mesenteric vein is assessed. If resectability is given a Kausch-Whipple's resection is performed.</description>
