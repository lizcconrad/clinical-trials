             (amenorrhea &gt; 1 year and FSH &gt; 30 mU/ml) OR if not clinically sterile unwilling to use
             a reliable contraception method.

          -  Female subject with a positive urine pregnancy test.

          -  Male subject unwilling to use condom for active prevention of pregnancy from first
