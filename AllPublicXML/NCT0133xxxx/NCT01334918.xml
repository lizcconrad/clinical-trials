    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT) and Single
      Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with
      regadenoson in order to detect the presence or absence of reversible defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be randomized to one of two imaging sequences: rest/stress SPECT on Day
      1 followed by stress/rest MDCT on Day 2 or stress/rest MDCT on Day 1 followed by rest/stress
      SPECT on Day 2. All stress scans will involve the injection of regadenoson as the
      pharmacologic stress agent.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Reversible Defects</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The number of reversible defects categorized into absence or presence of ischemia (0-1 versus ≥2), as assessed by the central imaging laboratory for both SPECT and MDCT.
The 17-segment model for standardized myocardial segmentation was used for myocardial perfusion readings for SPECT and MDCT. At rest and stress, each segment was scored on a 0 to 4 scale according to the amount of contrast or radiotracer the myocardium in the segment absorbed:
0: normal perfusion
1: slightly reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
2: moderately reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
3: severely reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
4: absent contrast/radiotracer uptake.
The median score from the 3 blinded readers for each segment was used. If the stress score was ≥ 2 and the rest score was less than the stress score, the segment was counted as having a reversible defect. A participant was classified as ischemic in the presence of 2 or more segments with reversible defects, excluding segment 17.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Image Quality of Scans by Modality and Reviewer</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Overall image quality was assessed by three independent blinded readers for each modality (single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)). Image quality was rated on a 4-point scale as either excellent, good, fair or poor at rest using SPECT and MDCT and under stress using regadenoson SPECT and regadenoson stress computed tomography perfusion (CTP).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Using the 17-segment scoring system, a segment scored above 1 (i.e., 2 to 4) and equal at rest and stress was counted as having a fixed defect.
At rest and stress, each segment was scored on a 0 to 4 scale according to the amount of contrast or radiotracer the myocardium in the segment absorbed:
0: normal perfusion

        <title>Number of Participants With Reversible Defects</title>
        <description>The number of reversible defects categorized into absence or presence of ischemia (0–1 versus ≥2), as assessed by the central imaging laboratory for both SPECT and MDCT.
The 17-segment model for standardized myocardial segmentation was used for myocardial perfusion readings for SPECT and MDCT. At rest and stress, each segment was scored on a 0 to 4 scale according to the amount of contrast or radiotracer the myocardium in the segment absorbed:
0: normal perfusion
1: slightly reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
2: moderately reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
3: severely reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
4: absent contrast/radiotracer uptake.
The median score from the 3 blinded readers for each segment was used. If the stress score was ≥ 2 and the rest score was less than the stress score, the segment was counted as having a reversible defect. A participant was classified as ischemic in the presence of 2 or more segments with reversible defects, excluding segment 17.</description>

          <description>Overall image quality was assessed by three independent blinded readers for each modality (single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)). Image quality was rated on a 4-point scale as either excellent, good, fair or poor at rest using SPECT and MDCT and under stress using regadenoson SPECT and regadenoson stress computed tomography perfusion (CTP).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Reversible Defects in the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery (LAD)</title>
        <description>The number of reversible defects in the LAD categorized into absence or presence of ischemia (0–1 versus ≥2), as assessed by the central imaging laboratory for both SPECT and MDCT.
The 17-segment model for standardized myocardial segmentation was used for myocardial perfusion readings for SPECT and MDCT. At rest and stress, each segment was scored on a 0 to 4 scale according to the amount of contrast or radiotracer the myocardium in the segment absorbed:
0: normal perfusion
1: slightly reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
2: moderately reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
3: severely reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
4: absent contrast/radiotracer uptake.
The median score from 3 blinded readers for each segment was used. If the stress score was ≥ 2 and the rest score was less than the stress score, the segment was counted as having a reversible defect. A participant was classified as ischemic in the presence of ≥ 2 segments with reversible defects, excluding segment 17.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Reversible Defects in the Left Circumflex Coronary Artery (LCX)</title>
        <description>The number of reversible defects in the LCX categorized into absence or presence of ischemia (0-1 versus ≥2), as assessed by the central imaging laboratory for both SPECT and MDCT.
The 17-segment model for standardized myocardial segmentation was used for myocardial perfusion readings for SPECT and MDCT. At rest and stress, each segment was scored on a 0 to 4 scale according to the amount of contrast or radiotracer the myocardium in the segment absorbed:
0: normal perfusion
1: slightly reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
2: moderately reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
3: severely reduced contrast/radiotracer uptake
4: absent contrast/radiotracer uptake.
The median score from 3 blinded readers for each segment was used. If the stress score was ≥ 2 and the rest score was less than the stress score, the segment was counted as having a reversible defect. A participant was classified as ischemic in the presence of ≥ 2 segments with reversible defects, excluding segment 17.</description>
