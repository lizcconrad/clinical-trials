      The disorders that affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) are responsible for the diverse
      symptoms. Objective: To evaluate whether or not the relationship between signs or symptoms of
      TMD and presence of harmful habits. The investigators evaluated 244 adolescents enrolled in
      public school . The investigators used the questionnaire for selection of orofacial pain and
      temporomandibular disorders, recommended by American Academy of Orofacial Pain to assess the
      presence or absence of signs and symptoms of TMD.

      For the assessment of signs and symptoms of TMD and parafunctional habits, 244 adolescents
      between 10 and 20 years of age and enrolled in a municipal school system were analyzed. The
      participants were submitted to the self-explanatory questionnaire for screening recommended
      by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain for the determination of orofacial pain and TMD.
      This questionnaire is made up of ten guided questions with yes or no responses to the most
      frequent signs and symptoms of orofacial pain and TMD. According to the Academy, three or
      more affirmative responses are an indication of TMD. Patient history and a detailed clinical
      exam were performed for the assessment of the presence or absence of parafunctional habits.

      The frequency of signs and symptoms was analyzed and the data were described based on gender
      and age. The SPSS 12.0 program was used for the statistical analysis and the data were
      treated using the chi-square test.
