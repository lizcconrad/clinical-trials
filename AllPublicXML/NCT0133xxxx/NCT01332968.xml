  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized study will assess the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab
      (RO5072759) in combination with chemotherapy compared to rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) with
      chemotherapy followed by obinutuzumab or rituximab maintenance in participants with untreated
      advanced indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After the end of the induction period, participants
      achieving response (Complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) will undergo a
      maintenance period continuing on the randomized antibody treatment alone every 2 months until
      disease progression for a total of 2 years. Anticipated time on study treatment is up to
      approximately 2.5 years. After maintenance or observation, participants will be followed for
      5 years until progression. After progression, participants will be followed for new
      anti-lymphoma therapy and overall survival until the end of the study.

        <title>Event-Free Survival (Overall Study Population)</title>
        <description>Event-free survival in the overall study population was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date to disease progression/relapse, death from any cause, or initiation of a new anti-lymphoma treatment (NALT) on the basis of investigator assessment assessments with the use of Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. Disease progression/relapse was defined as at least 50% increase in nodal lesions or &gt;/=50% increase in any node &gt; 1 centimeter (cm) or &gt;/= 50% increase in other target measurable lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules) and/or appearance of any new bone marrow involvement and/or appearance of any new lesion &gt; 1.5 cm or &gt;/= 50% increase in any previously involved node with a diameter &lt;/= 1 cm such that it is now &gt;1.5 cm. Tumor measurements were obtained by CT/MRI. Reported is the percentage of participants with event.</description>

        <description>The FACT-Lym TOI Score for the follicular lymphoma population was derived from the following 3 individual FACT-Lym questionnaire subscale scores: Physical Well-being (range: 0-28), Functional Well-being (range: 0-28) and Lymphoma (range: 0-60). The FACT-Lym TOI Score is the sum of the 3 individual subscales (range 0-116). Higher scores indicate better outcomes. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

The induction period was followed by either a maintenance or observation period for responders or non-responders, respectively. Responders received rituximab monotherapy every 2 months for 2 years during the maintenance period. Non-responders received no protocol specified treatment during the 2-year observation period. Finally, participants were followed during a 5-year follow-up period. The chemotherapy regimen (CHOP or CVP or bendamustine) for individual participant was chosen by the site prior to initiation of the study.</description>

The induction period will be followed by either a maintenance or observation period for responders or non-responders, respectively. Responders will receive rituximab monotherapy every 2 months for 2 years during the maintenance period. Non-responders will receive no protocol specified treatment during the 2-year observation period. Finally, participants will be followed during a 5-year follow-up period. The chemotherapy regimen (CHOP or CVP or bendamustine) for individual participant will be chosen by the site prior to initiation of the study.</description>
