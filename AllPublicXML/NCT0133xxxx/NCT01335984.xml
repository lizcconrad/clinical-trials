      This is a multi-centered, randomized, parallel group, interventional &amp; open label clinical
      trial accessing efficacy of intervention effect by smart care system over existing treatment
      group for lowering blood pressure of hypertension patients taking anti-hypertension drug.

      1. Objectives : To evaluate superiority in blood pressure lowering effect of the Smart Care
           Service compared to the conventional treatment in hypertensive patients receiving any
           conventional antihypertensive medication

        2. Test and control group

             -  Control group : The subject group who is receiving any conventional treatment
                (hospital visit).

             -  Test groups

           Conventional treatment + remote monitoring group:

           The subject group who is receiving the health care services using conventional treatment
           (hospital visit) and remote monitoring.

           Remote visit + remote monitoring group:

           The subject group who is receiving remote visit and remote monitoring using
           videotelephony

        3. Target Subject: Hypertensive patients receiving any conventional antihypertensive
           medication

    <description>The subjects who are assigned in the Telemonitoring group will be provided Blood Pressure monitor, body composition analyzer, and remote monitoring device.
The subjects who are assigned in the Telemonitoring group should visit the site once per every 2 months (8 weeks), and they should measure their blood pressure using a provided blood pressure monitor twice a day during study period (once after first morning urination and once before going to bed). After measurement of blood pressure and body composition, the subjects should make the transmission terminals of remote monitoring device situate near transmission terminal of Smart Care PC and transmit measured information through Smart Care PC into a centralized server of Smart Care Center.</description>

    <description>The subjects who are assigned in the Telemonitoring &amp; Telemedicine group should perform the same remote monitoring procedures as the subjects in the Telemonitoring group.
Since the remote visit substitute for a face to face visit, subjects should reserve the time for remote visit in each clinical trial center. A primary doctor or remote medical doctor should provide medical consultation to the subjects through videotelephony using the remote monitoring device and then issue electronic prescriptions.</description>

The subjects who are assigned in the control group should perform the same blood pressure measurement (2 times a day) same as the test group during the study, and measured results should be recorded in a diary of self blood pressure measurement. In addition, the subjects should visit the site once per every two months (8 weeks).</description>
