      Primary Outcome Measures:

      • To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with Azacitidine in patients with
      transfusion-dependent, low risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) 0 int-1,
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) without chromosome 5 (5q) deletion. The main objective will be
      based on the erythroid haematologic response according to International Working Group (IWG)
      2006 criteria.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Haematologic response, bases on the following parameters: platelets, and neutrophils
           according to International Working Group (IWG) Criteria.

        -  Medullary and cytogenetic response according to International Working Group (IWG) 2006
           criteria.

        -  The effect of treatment response on quality of life, through the Functional Assessment
           of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-an) questionnaire.

        -  Overall survival, Event-Free Survival and the Acute Leukaemia Transformation Rate.

             syndromes (MDS).

          5. Have been treated with demethylating drugs at any moment prior to inclusion in the
