  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NETU-08-18 is a two-arm clinical study assessing efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of
      netupitant and palonosetron, two antiemetic drugs, versus oral palonosetron, both given with
      oral dexamethasone. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that netupitant and
      palonosetron are more effective than palonosetron alone, to prevent nausea and vomiting
      induced by moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy after administration of repeated cycles
      of chemotherapy.

      NETU-08-18 is a two-arm clinical study assessing efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of
      netupitant and palonosetron, two antiemetic drugs, versus oral palonosetron, both given with
      oral dexamethasone. Study is organised in two phases: cycle-1 and a multi-cycle extension.
      Safety assessment is performed separately in cycle 1 (arm 1 and arm 2) and in multi-cycle
      extension (arm 3 and arm 4).
