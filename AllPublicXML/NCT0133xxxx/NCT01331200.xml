      The purpose of this study is to study the safety and feasibility of mobilization of acute
      ischemic stroke patients treated with IV-tPA between 12-24 hours of treatment.

      Abstract:

      Introduction

      Historical precedence exists demonstrating that early intensive care unit (ICU) mobilization
      of patients reduces risks of complication and lengths of hospital stay, and may improve
      long-term health status of patients.

      Objective

      To determine the safety of early mobilization by physical and/or occupational therapy in
      acute ischemic stroke patients within 24-hours of IV-tPA infusion and to examine if early
      mobilization leads to shortened ICU and hospital length of stay.

      Methods

      Prospective study of incidence of adverse response and functional mobility status of study
      patients mobilized by occupational and/or physical therapy between 12- 24 hours after IV-tPA
      infusion with comparison of ICU and hospital Length of Stay data between study group and
      pre-study patients who were mobilized by occupational and/or physical therapy services at no
      pre-determined time after IV-tPA infusion. Additionally, patients will be contacted by study
      personnel approximately 3 to 5-days and 30-days post-infusion for completion of Modified
      Rankin Scale stroke disability survey as follow up of stroke recovery.

      Setting

      Medical and surgical intensive care units at Mayo Clinic Florida.

      Patients

      All patients with acute ischemic stroke who receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator
      (IV-tPA) infusion, survive to discharge from the hospital, are hemodynamically stable, and
      are mobilized by physical and/or occupational therapy within 24 hours post-tPA infusion.
