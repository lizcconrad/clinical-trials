  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researcher develop non-invasive imaging modalities for assessment of port wine stain
      during laser therapy treatment of Port Wine Stain. The imaging modalities will be used to
      guide immediate retreatment of regions of persistent perfusion during the procedure.

      The researcher can use imaging system operates by projecting low-power near-infrared
      structured light patterns on to the tissue of interest in a non-contact, reflection geometry
      and then capturing the reflectance with a camera.The system can image the depth-resolved
      optical properties of in-vivo tissues, allowing rapid, non-invasive visualization of
      sub-surface structures of Port Wine Stain.
