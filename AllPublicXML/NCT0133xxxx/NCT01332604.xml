  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib, dose-escalation study designed to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral GDC-0980 administered in combination with
      capecitabine and with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy with bevacizumab added on at Cycle 5 in patients
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
