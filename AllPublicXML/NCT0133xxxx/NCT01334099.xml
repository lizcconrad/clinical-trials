      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose of CP-675,206 when given in
      combination with radiation. Patients will be given local radiation to one tumor site and an
      intravenous infusion of CP-675,206.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Canadian women. In 2007 an estimated 22,300 women
      will be diagnosed and 5300 will die of the disease. Despite advances in therapy, metastatic
      disease remains an incurable illness, with a median survival of only 2 years. Standard
      systemic treatment options for metastatic disease include chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.
      Radiation is frequently used in the metastatic setting for palliation of symptoms, with the
      most frequent site of radiation being bone. Response rates to first line chemotherapy are in
      the range of 30%, however these responses are not durable. Currently there are no curative
      options for metastatic disease, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic approaches.

      CTLA4 is a receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells and regulatory T cells.
      CTLA-blockade has been tested in clinical trials using humanized monoclonal antibodies, and
      some biological responses have been reported. The anti-tumor immune response may be further
      augmented by the combination of CTLA4-blockade with radiation, with the potential to mediate
      regression of metastases outside of the field of radiation. The primary goal of this study
      therefore is to establish the safety of CTLA4-blockade using the antibody CP-675, 206 in
      combination with radiation. This trial is being conducted as a prelude to a planned phase II
      trial of CP-675,206 in combination with radiation in metastatic breast cancer.
