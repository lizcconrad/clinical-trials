  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppression is a key intervention in patients with solid organ transplant and is
      usually achieved by combination therapy with systemic CsA or tacrolimus with azathioprine,
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or corticoids. However, the outcomes after lung transplantation
      are poor when compared with those after heart, kidney, or liver transplantation, with a
      survival rate of only 55% for recipients of lung transplants.

      Additional application of aerosolised L-CsA should suppress T-cell activation in the lung
      tissue and subsequently BOS development. The overall purpose of this phase-II/III study is to
      obtain efficacy and safety data of L-CsA in the prevention of BOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventive therapeutic intervention by L-CsA is primarily aimed to suppress T-lymphocyte
      suppression and inflammatory responses and secondly to prevent fibrotic effects making it
      more likely to be effective in early stages of BOS. Early development of BOS, which mostly
      will not be diagnosed, and acute organ rejections are strongly patho-physiological
      associated. Prevention of the very early development of chronic rejection by L-CsA post LTX
      may be the ideal starting point for IMP application.
