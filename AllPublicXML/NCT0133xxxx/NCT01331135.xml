  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best treatment for recurrent cancers or those that do not respond to therapies is not
      known. Typically, patients with these cancers receive a combination of cancer drugs
      (chemotherapy), surgery, or radiation therapy. These treatments can prolong their life but
      may not offer a long-term cure.

      This study proposes using a drug called Sirolimus in combination with common chemotherapy
      drugs to treat patients with recurrent and refractory solid tumors. Sirolimus has been found
      to inhibit cell growth and to have anti-tumor activity in pediatric solid tumors in previous
      studies and, therefore, has the potential to increase the effectiveness of the chemotherapy
      drugs when given together.

      This study wil investigate the highest dose of Sirolimus that can be given orally with other
      oral chemotherapy drugs. Cohorts of 2 subjects will be started at the minimum dose. The dose
      will be increased in the next 2 subjects as long as there were no major reactions in the
      previous groups. This study will also seek to learn more about the side effects of sirolimus
      when used in this combination and what effects the drug has on the white cells and the immune
      system. Successful use of this drug will impact the cancer population greatly by providing an
      increased chance of survival to those with resistant or recurrent cancers.

      Sirolimus, is a potent immunosuppressive drug that is approved for use in prevention against
      allograft rejection following solid organ transplant. It has anti-tumor effects mainly by
      blocking signals which drive cells from G1 to S phase during cell cycle through inhibition of
      mTOR, thus inhibiting cell growth. Sirolimus, as well as other mTOR inhibitors, has shown
      anti-tumor activity in pediatric solid tumor xenografts. Children with relapsed and/or
      refractory solid tumors are in need of novel therapeutic approaches. One option for these
      patients is the use of prolonged exposure to low dose antiangiogenic chemotherapy, with
      agents such as etoposide and cyclophosphamide. In this phase I trial the feasibility and
      optimal dosing for daily sirolimus, in combination with daily celecoxib, and low dose
      etoposide alternating with cyclophosphamide, will be determined in children with relapsed and
      refractory solid tumors. p70S6 kinase inhibition will be used as a surrogate for mTOR
      inhibition. The potential immunosuppressive effect of sirolimus administered on this schedule
      will be assessed by serial lymphocyte subsets and assessment of memory T cell number.
