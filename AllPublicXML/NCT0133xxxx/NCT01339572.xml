  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will investigate the effectiveness of plerixafor in the up-front setting in
      avoiding a second round of mobilization and whether this translates into a clinical and
      economic benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood stem cells are now considered the standard source of stem cells for
      autologous stem cell transplants. Unfortunately, there is still a 20-30% chance that
      inadequate numbers of stem cells will be collected, resulting in prolonged recovery of cell
      counts after transplantation and increased transfusion dependence. There is also a
      significant economic burden associated with remobilization and a risk that delays in
      collecting sufficient numbers of stem cells can result in an increased chance of disease
      recurrence prior to transplantation.

    <measure>Rate of successful collection with early introduction of plerixafor in patients predicted to be poor mobilizers</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2 of apheresis</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study will be the rate of successful collection with early introduction of plerixafor in patients predicted to be poor mobilizers based on peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts or CD34+ cell collection efficiency after 2 consecutive days of apheresis. Success will be defined as the ability to avoid a second mobilization attempt. Results will be compared to matched historical controls.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Economic impact</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2 of mobilization and Day +100 after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The economic impact of plerixafor use will be divided into two phases, mobilization and transplantation. The comparator arm for the mobilization phase would be matched historical controls. The comparator arm for the transplant phase will be patients who did not require plerixafor for mobilization during the study period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinetics of CD34+ mobilization with early introduction of plerixafor</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1 and Day 2 of apheresis</time_frame>
    <description>The kinetics of CD34+ cell counts during mobilization in this setting is unknown. We will attempt to determine mobilization kinetics by following peripheral blood CD34+ counts daily starting from first day of plerixafor administration until completion of apheresis. Kinetics will be analyzed according to the following parameters:
Peripheral CD34 cell counts on each day of apheresis.
Total CD34 cells collected on each day of apheresis
Multiple myeloma vs. NHL.</description>

    <measure>Graft composition</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1 and Day 2 of apheresis</time_frame>
    <description>Graft composition will be analyzed on each day of successful apheresis. Cell populations to be quantitated include total CD3+ lymphocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, CD8+ lymphocytes.</description>
