      The goal of this study is to determine the progression-free survival and objective response
      rate in subjects with either stage IIIB with pleural effusion NSCLC or stage IV NSCLC who are
      treated with up to six cycles of paclitaxel plus carboplatin and either tamibarotene or
      placebo. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive tamibarotene, 6 mg/m2, divided as
      twice daily orally, or an equal number of matching placebo tablets, starting 1 week before
      chemotherapy and continuing through all 6 cycles and beyond. Subjects will be assessed for
      response on Day 50, Day 113, then every other month using the Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Subjects must have pathological findings consistent with primary non-small cell lung
             cancer of any histology.

          -  Subjects must have either stage IIIB with pleural effusion or IV NSCLC with
             radiographically measurable disease (RECIST 1.1 criteria). Women non-smokers with
             stage IV NSCLC should be screened for EGFR mutation and if positive be excluded from
             the study and placed on an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

          -  Subjects must have an ECOG Performance Status ≤2.

          -  If corticosteroids are required for controlling cerebral edema, subjects must be on a
             stable dose for at least 1 week.

          -  Subjects must have recovered from any toxicity of prior therapies.

          -  Subjects must be at least 4 weeks removed from surgery or radiation therapy.

          -  Subjects must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Subjects must have adequate bone marrow function (defined as an absolute neutrophil
             count of ≥1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count ≥100,000 cells/mm3), liver function with
             total bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL, and serum creatinine ≤1.5 x institutional ULN.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Tamibarotene, as with all retinoids, is teratogenic. Therefore, female subjects of
             childbearing potential must agree to use 2 effective methods of contraception
             (hormonal, barrier method of birth control, or abstinence) and sexually-active male
             subjects must agree to use an effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control or abstinence) while participating in this study and for six
             months afterwards. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             ≤1 week prior to registration.

          -  Subjects must be able to swallow tablets.

             absolute arrhythmia or ventricular arrhythmias classified as Lown III, IV or V.

          -  History or signs of active coronary artery disease with or without angina pectoris
             (i.e. myocardial infarction with 6 months prior to enrollment, uncontrolled angina,
             electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia).

          -  Subjects who have a serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the
             investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment
             according to this protocol or may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring
             requirements of the study.

             chemotherapy-radiation for locally advanced disease allowed if completed &gt;12 months
             prior to randomization.

          -  Subjects with brain metastases are only eligible if treated and neurologically stable

          -  Subjects with hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;1000 mg/dL).

          -  Subjects with elevated liver function tests if AST is ≥2.5x the institutional or
             central laboratory's upper limit of normal for subjects without liver metastases, or
             &gt;5x the institutional or central laboratory's upper limit of normal for subjects with
             liver metastases.

          -  Subjects with HbA1c ≥8.0.

          -  Subjects taking vitamin A either as a supplement or as part of a multivitamin unless
