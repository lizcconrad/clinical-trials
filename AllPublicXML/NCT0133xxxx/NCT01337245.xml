      The purpose of this study is to see whether a new F(ab')2 antivenom will prevent injury and
      death from the bite of a coral snake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coral snake bites may be trivial in effect, or they may cause profound and life-threatening
      respiratory paralysis, depending on the severity of the envenomation. Venom toxins target the
      neuromuscular junction, where effects typically become apparent hours following the bite, by
      which time the clinical syndrome may be irreversible. Unless neurotoxicity is prevented,
      ventilatory paralysis may cause death or require intensive care for weeks after the bite.
      Prevention of paralysis, historically, has involved treating all bite victims with antivenom.

      This protocol will enable the therapeutic use of a new F(ab')2 antivenom in the management of
      coral snake envenomation.

      Following a coral snake bite, patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and who provide
      informed consent will receive 5 vials of antivenom intravenously over no less than 30
      minutes. Blood assays for venom levels and clinical assessments of neurologic status before
      and after treatment will be conducted and patients will be followed for 22 days for safety
      and survival endpoints.

      The primary endpoint of this Phase 3 trial will be survival, for comparison with a historical
      mortality rate of 15%.
