    <textblock>
      This protocol will evaluate the biodistribution and dosimetry of [124I]FIAU in both healthy
      volunteers and patients with prosthetic joint infections. This pilot study will also
      investigate the safety and tolerability of [124I]FIAU.

    <description>Subjects will be dosed with [124I]FIAU at Time 0 on Day 0, and a PET-CT scan will be conducted immediately after the injection. Imaging will be repeated at 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after dosing.
All images generated will be reviewed for biodistribution and dosimetry.</description>

          1. Unable to comply with study requirements

          2. Indication in the opinion of the principal investigator for surgery within 48 hours of
             presentation.
