      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADX48621 in
      Parkinson's disease patients following four weeks of dosing.

      The secondary objectives of the study include the evaluation of the efficacy of ADX48621
      compared with placebo in reducing levodopa induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's;
      the evaluation of the effect of ADX48621 on symptoms of Parkinson's disease and patient
      ability to function, and the evaluation of the effect of coadministration of ADX48621 on
      L-dopa efficacy.

    <textblock>
      First study of ADX48621 in male and female Parkinson's disease patients with levodopa-induced
      dyskinesia. Four weeks, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose titration from 50 mg once daily
      up to 100 mg three times daily, at the start of week 4. Safety and tolerability assessed by
      adverse events enquiry, heart rate and blood pressure, 12-lead ECG, haematology and
      biochemistry. Efficacy assessments include Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS),
      Unified Parkinson's Disease rating Scale (UPDRS) patient PD symptom diaries, Hospital Anxiety
      Depression Scale (HADS), patient and clinician global impression of change in PD and
      dyskinesia (PGIC and CGIC).
