      The overall objective of this study is to increase the number of dark skin tone individuals
      in the data set and evaluate if this increase in dark skin tone data has an impact on the
      accuracy of the SCOUT DS Diabetes Risk Score (DRS).

    <measure>Validation of the SCOUT DS algorithm comparing it to Oral Glucose Tolerance Test in dark skinned individuals</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study endpoint is the relative true positive and relative true negative fractions between the SCOUT DS and FPG test for detecting abnormal glucose tolerance (2 hr OGTT value ≥ 140 mg/dL).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare SCOUT DS and FPG to HbA1c</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoint is to evaluate the receiver operator characteristic area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of SCOUT DS, FPG, and A1C test for detection of abnormal glucose tolerance.</description>
