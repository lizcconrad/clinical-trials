      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of Ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of CKD-501 in healthy subject.

    <textblock>
      From day 1 to day 5, Ketoconazole 200mg is administered twice daily to Group 1 patients
      during period 1. Then on day 5,CKD-501 0.5mg is co-administered Group 1 patients at period 1.
      After 28 day-break, period 2 will CKD-501 0.5mg administered on day 5. Period 2 will not
      Ketoconazole administered.

      Group 2 is administered in reverse order.
