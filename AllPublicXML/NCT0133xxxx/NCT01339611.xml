    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test if patients under oral anticoagulation therapy who are going
      to participate in the education program will have better Health-related quality of life,
      higher rate in pharmacological treatment adherence and better self efficacy to manage the
      treatment.

      Patients who are going to use oral anticoagulant will participate in an individual
      orientation, using instructional material (slides and illustrative booklet) during
      hospitalization period. After the discharge 2 phone calls will be done (after: a week and
      four weeks) focusing on the strategies to improve patient's self-efficacy to manage the oral
      anticoagulation. There will be a personal contact among researcher and participants when the
      patients return at the oral anticoagulant ambulatory, two months after the treatment start.
      At this time the following variables of interest will be evaluated: Health-related quality of
      life; adherence to treatment and patients' self-efficacy.
