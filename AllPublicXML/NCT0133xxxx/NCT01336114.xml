  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) involves complex tridimensional deformities of the
      spine. In case of progressive curve deformity, the use of spinal bracing remains the standard
      non operative treatment of moderate AIS. Most of the time, the different types of braces
      don't take into account the individual biomechanical properties of each patient's spine.
      Actually, it is essential to better understand the effect of the loads applied on the trunk
      and on the spine, and a 3D geometrical modelisation of these components is essential. Many
      studies have been publishing concerning the use of radiographs for the geometrical
      reconstruction of the spine, and more recently the EOS system. But even then, it is still
      necessary to obtain an important number of geometrical data and discretisation is still a
      long procedure.

    <description>The torso shape reconstruction is realized thanks to the system Model Maker(Proteor®) on adolescent idiopathic patients. Model Maker allows to reconstruct the external shape of the human body from about 20 images steaming from a standard digital camera.The spine reconstruction is has for her obtained by means of a software interface, from tow standard clinical X-rays in the digital format (frontal and sagittal) and images were used by Model Maker for the external shape reconstruction.</description>

    <measure>Recording of pressure from the brace</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The recording of pressure from the brace is done through a web of pressure positioned in the brace. It is a structure &quot;teck scan (Expert-Seat, Ergoresearch Inc)&quot; containing polymeric pressure sensors. The pressure exerted by the brace on the trunk is registered in different positions (standing, lying).</description>
