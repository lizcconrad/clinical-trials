  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research is to determine the effect of ultrasound imaging
      biofeedback on urine leakage, pelvic floor muscle contractions, and quality of life in women
      with stress urinary incontinence. This study will include women 20 years or older with stress
      urinary incontinence.

      The study will involve 2 groups: pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercises with biofeedback using
      transabdominal Rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) (Group A) and PFM exercises alone
      (Group B). The participants will perform 16 exercise sessions over a period of 8 weeks. Group
      A will perform 3 pelvic floor exercises using the transabdominal RUSI to provide biofeedback.
      Group B will perform the same 3 pelvic floor exercises without biofeedback.

      All participants involved in the study will complete a general medical information
      questionnaire. In addition, all participants will have their PFM contraction assessed using
      an ultrasound machine placed over the lower abdomen, quality of life assessed with a written
      questionnaire, and given a 7-day bladder diary to complete prior to, at 4-weeks, and at
      completion of the study.

    <description>Pelvic floor muscle lift and length of pelvic floor muscle contraction will be measured using transabdominal ultrasound imaging. Ability to maintain continence during a cough will be measured by asking the participant to stand, contract the pelvic floor muscles, and cough. The participant will state whether or not they leaked urine.</description>
