    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated, pharmacological
      study with a parallel design. Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention and presenting high platelet reactivity as
      assessed with the Verify Now P2Y12 assay-Accumetrics(Platelet Reactivity Units -PRU≥235) at 2
      hours post-clopidogrel 600mg LD (Day 0), as assessed with the Verify Now P2Y12 assay, will be
      randomized after informed consent, in a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups:

      Group Α: Clopidogrel 150mg per day,starting from Day 1 until Day 5 (5 days after
      randomization) Group Β: Prasugrel 60 mg immediate loading (on Day 0) followed by 10mg/day
      starting from Day 1 until Day 5 (5 days after randomization).

      Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed 2 hours after randomization (Day 0), 24 h
      after randomization (Day 1) and on Day 5. Documentation of major adverse cardiac events
      (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure with PCI or CABG)and
      serious adverse events (bleeding, other adverse events)will be performed until Day 5.
