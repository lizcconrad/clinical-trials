      Metformin plus paclitaxel for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer: a randomized
      phase II trial

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      METTAX is a phase II randomized trial that aim to evaluate the addition of metformin to
      paclitaxel in patients that failed to curative-intent treatment for Head-and neck neoplasms.

      Patients eligible for this protocol will be randomized to paclitaxel 175mg/m2 plus metformin
      or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end-point is
      disease control (complete response, partial response or stable disease, according to RECIST
      1.1) in the 12th week. Secondary end-points are PFS, OS, response rate and safety. Molecular
      markers in samples collected before and under treatment will be tested for correlation with
      clinical outcomes.

    <description>We will measure the number of subjects without progressive disease (complete response, partial response or stable disease) 6mo after the start of therapy, also after 1 and 2 years from the start of therapy. PFS will also be analysed with log-rank test, and reported as HR with respective 95% CI and p value, and median PFS will be estimated with kaplan-meyer method. All calculations will be performed 6 months after the last patient recruited. Also, the survival rate at year one and two will be calculated.</description>

    <description>We will measure the number of subjects without death (any cause) 6mo after the start of therapy, and also after 1 and 2 years from the start of therapy. OS will also be analysed with log-rank test, and reported as HR with respective 95% CI and p value, and median OS will be estimated with kaplan-meyer method. All calculations will be performed 6 months after the last patient recruited. Also, the survival rate at year one and two will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Number of patients with Grade 3-5 Adverse Events in each arm, for each category of AE</measure>
    <time_frame>6 mo after the last enrolled patients</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be assessed using NCI CTCAE v3. The number of patients in each arm experiencing grade 3-5 AE (for each AE) over the total number of subjects will be measured, and the proportion of patients experiencing AE in each arm will be compared using uncorrected chi-sq test. AE will be recorded in baseline and in each visit, and the worst grade AE will be considered.</description>
