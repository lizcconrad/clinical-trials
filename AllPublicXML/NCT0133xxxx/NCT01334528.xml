  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to explore the degree to which performance consistency on
      neuropsychological measures varies in a sample of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation
      Enduring Freedom (OEF) Veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with
      persistent self-reported symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild TBI outcome studies are traditionally limited to single administration or
      baseline/post-injury assessment models and they often fail to show enduring deficits among
      persons complaining of such problems. It may be the case that our standard approach to
      deficit measurement in mTBI has confounded our ability to elicit the actual impairment. The
      proposed study could generate an assessment paradigm shift (performance over time) and afford
      professionals the direction to better assess and ultimately serve persons with mTBI.
      Additionally, research on the impact of PTSD symptoms on throughput and cognitive performance
      has been mixed (Bremner et al., 1995; Brenner et al, 2010; Vasterling et al., 1998, 2002,
      2006) and the proposed study will yield additional data in that area.

    <description>The ANAM4™ Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Battery is a selection of tests from the ANAM4™ library (C-SHOP, 2007) believed to be especially sensitive to mild TBI. This battery was designed to aid in the assessment of general cognitive function following a suspected brain injury or other cognitive insult. The ANAM4 TBI battery includes the following tests: Simple Reaction Time, Procedural Reaction Time, Matching to Sample, Code Substitution-Learning, Code Substitution-Delayed Memory and Mathematical Processing and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.</description>
