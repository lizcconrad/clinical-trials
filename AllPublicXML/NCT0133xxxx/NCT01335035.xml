  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to establish the efficacy and safety of deferasirox in patients
      with iron overload from 6 to 18 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT).

      The purpose of this study is to assess the mean change in serum ferritin after 52 weeks of
      treatment with deferasirox, in patients with iron overload (defined with serum ferritin
      levels ≥ 1000 ng/ml and receiving &gt; 20 RBC concentrates) after allogeneic HSCT.
