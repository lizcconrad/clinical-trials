    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase III study is to assess the long-term safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of flexibly dosed retigabine Immediate Release (IR) as adjunctive therapy in adult
      subjects with partial-onset seizures. In addition, those subjects who successfully completed
      20 weeks of adjunctive treatment with retigabine IR in the parent study, RGB113905, and who
      were thought to have benefitted from treatment will be provided continued access to
      retigabine IR.

    <textblock>
      RTG113413 is an open-label, multicentre extension study of RGB113905. This study will enroll
      adult subjects with partial-onset seizures (POS) who successfully completed 20 weeks of
      adjunctive treatment with retigabine IR (4-weeks Titration Phase and 16-weeks Flexible Dose
      Evaluation Phase) in the parent study, RGB113905 and who were thought to have benefitted from
      the treatment.

      The Screening Visit (Visit 1) will be performed on the same day as the final visit of the
      parent study (Visit 7/Week 20). Subjects entering the extension study will initially receive
      the same dose of retigabine IR and concurrent antiepileptic drug (AED) as they were receiving
      on the final visit of the parent study. After the first week of the extension study, the
      subject's retigabine dose can be adjusted based on efficacy and tolerability. The overall
      daily dose of retigabine IR must be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day
      (maximum). In addition, the dose and the number of concurrent AEDs can be adjusted to meet
      the individual needs of the subject. Retigabine IR monotherapy is not permitted. If
      concurrent AED therapy is removed, the subject must be withdrawn from the study.

      Subjects in this study will be eligible to receive retigabine IR treatment until one of the
      following criteria have been met: 1) regulatory approval and commercial availability of
      retigabine IR or 2) retigabine IR is not approved by the regulatory authorities or 3) the
      study is terminated by the sponsor for reasons including, but not limited to, safety issues
      or 4) subject is withdrawn or withdraws consent or 5) subject has received retigabine IR
      treatment for a total of 3 years and options i-iv have not been met. After the Screening
      Visit, subjects will be required to attend 4 further clinic visits at Weeks 13, 26, 39, and
      52 in the first year of the study and a total of 3 clinic visits at approximately 4-monthly
      intervals during each of the second and third year of study. Upon completion or early
      withdrawal, subjects will begin a 3-week taper period and then return for a follow-up visit.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect or is associated with liver injury or impaired liver function. TEAE refers to an AE for which the onset was on or after the date of the first retigabine dose in this study and on or before 30 days after the last retigabine dose date. AEs that started in the parent study that increased in severity during this study were also considered treatment-emergent. The analysis was performed on Safety Population, which included participants who took at least one dose of study medication after they had enrolled into this OLE study.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants with partial-onset seizures (POS) who successfully completed the 20 weeks of treatment in parent study NCT01336621 were recruited in this open-label extension (OLE) study. The data from the treatment phase are presented here; the data from the Safety Follow Up Continuation phase will be added once the study has been completed.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Screening was performed on the same day as the final visit of the parent study NCT01336621. A total of 98 participants completed the parent study and opted to enter into this study. All participants received at least one dose of retigabine immediate release (IR) tablets.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Retigabine IR</title>
          <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious AEs (TESAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect or is associated with liver injury or impaired liver function. TEAE refers to an AE for which the onset was on or after the date of the first retigabine dose in this study and on or before 30 days after the last retigabine dose date. AEs that started in the parent study that increased in severity during this study were also considered treatment-emergent. The analysis was performed on Safety Population, which included participants who took at least one dose of study medication after they had enrolled into this OLE study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Parameter Including PR Interval, QRS Duration, Uncorrected QT Interval, Corrected QT by Bazett's Formula (QTcB), Corrected QT by Fridericia's Formula (QTcF) and RR Interval</title>
        <description>Single measurements of 12-lead ECG were obtained in supine position after at least 10 minutes of rest using an ECG machine to measure parameters including PR interval, QRS duration, uncorrected QT interval, QTcB, QTcF and RR interval. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

Chemistry parameters for which PCC values were identified were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (if value &gt;=3 * upper limit of normal [ULN]), alkaline phosphatase (alk.phosphatase) (if value &gt;=3*ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (if value &gt;=3*ULN), calcium (if value &lt;=1.8962 or &gt;=2.8692), carbon-di-oxide (CO2) (if value &lt;=18 or &gt;=36), chloride (if value &lt;=92 or &gt;=112), creatine kinase (if value &gt;=3*ULN), direct bilirubin (if value &gt;=1.5*ULN), glucose (if value &lt;=2.7755 or &gt;=11.102), lactate dehydrogenase (LD) (if value &gt;=3*ULN), magnesium (if value &lt;0.36 or &gt;2.50), potassium (if value &lt;=3.0 or &gt;=6.0), sodium (if value &lt;=127 or &gt;=153), total bilirubin (if value &gt;=1.5*ULN), total protein (if value &lt;45 or &gt;100), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (if value &gt;=14.28). Only those participants with data available at specific time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

            <title>Retigabine IR</title>
            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Hematology Parameters of PCC</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate hematology parameters. Number of participants with clinical hematology parameters of PCC at 'any visit post-Baseline' are presented. Hematology parameters for which PCC values were identified were eosinophils (if value is &gt;0.8), hematocrit (if value is &lt;=0.32 for males and &lt;=0.28 for females), platelet count (if value is &lt;=100 or &gt;=550), total neutrophils (if value is &lt;=1.8), white blood cells (WBC) (if value is &lt;=2.8 or &gt;=16). Only those participants with data available at specific time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants at specific time points. Number of participants with urinalysis parameters of PCC at 'any visit post-Baseline' are presented. Urinalysis parameters for which PCC values were identified were albumin/creatinine ratio (if value is &gt;11.3), red blood cells (RBC) (if value is 3-5 or higher), WBC (if value is 5-10 or higher for male and 10-15 or higher for females), specific gravity (if value is &lt;1.001 or &gt;1.035) and potential of hydrogen (pH) (if value is &lt;4.6 or &gt;8.0). Only those participants with data available at specific time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alk. Phosphatase, ALT, AST, Creatine Kinase and LD Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters including alk. phosphatase, ALT, AST, creatine kinase and LD. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters including direct bilirubin, total bilirubin and creatinine. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in BUN/Creatinine Ratio</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters including BUN/creatinine ratio. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters including calcium, chloride, CO2, glucose, potassium, magnesium, sodium and BUN. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical hematology parameters including absolute basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, platelet count and WBC count. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical hematology parameters including hemoglobin and MCHC. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematocrit Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical hematology parameters including hematocrit. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Corpuscle Hemoglobin (MCH) Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical hematology parameters including MCH. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Corpuscle Volume (MCV) and Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical hematology parameters including MCV and MPV. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in RBC Count</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical hematology parameters including RBC count. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Percent Basophils, Percent Eosinophils, Percent Lymphocytes, Percent Monocytes, Percent Neutrophils and RBC Distribution Width (RDW) Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in clinical hematology parameters including percent basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and RDW. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urine Albumin Creatinine Ratio</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in urinalysis parameters including albumin creatinine ratio. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urine Albumin Levels</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in urinalysis parameters including albumin levels. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urine Creatinine Levels</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in urinalysis parameters including creatinine levels. Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Eligible participants continued on the same maintenance dose of retigabine IR and the concurrent anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) as they were taking at Visit 7 (Week 20) in the parent study NCT01336621. After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

AUA SS score is the sum of the responses to these seven questions. The total score for all questions was classified as mild (0 to 7), moderate (8 to 19), or severe (&gt;19). Baseline was defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation or Behavior Assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Score</title>
        <description>Number of participants with suicidal ideation or behavior during treatment were assessed using the C-SSRS score scale. It is a brief questionnaire designed to assess severity and change in suicidality by integrating both behavior and ideation using a semi-structured interview to probe participant responses. Participants are classified with respect to extent of suicidal ideation, extent of suicidal behavior, and with respect to self-injurious behavior.</description>

After the first week of the study, the dose of retigabine IR could be increased or decreased by 50-150 milligrams per day (mg/day) on a weekly basis. The overall daily dose of retigabine IR was to be maintained between 300 mg/day (minimum) and 1200 mg/day (maximum).</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in 28-day Partial-onset Seizure Frequency</title>
          <description>The seizure frequency was recorded in daily seizure calendar by participants during the treatment period. Percent change from Baseline in 28-day partial onset seizure frequency was presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Baseline assessments in this OLE study are defined by and taken directly from the Baseline assessments in the parent study NCT01336621. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value divided by Baseline value into 100.</description>
