    <textblock>
      To evaluate COPD-related clinical outcomes and total healthcare utilization in commercially
      insured (at least 40 years with a subanalysis of those aged 65 years and older) COPD
      population associated with the use of fluticasone/salmeterol combination (FSC) 250/50mcg
      compared to other initial maintenance therapies (IMTs), specifically, tiotropium bromide
      (TIO), and either ipratropium bromide or ipratropium bromide/albuterol (IP).

      This is a hypothesis testing study

      Ho: There is no difference in time to first COPD-related events between FSC and TIO and FSC
      and IP Ha: There is a difference in time to first COPD-related events between FSC and TIO and
      FSC and IP

      Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP Ha: There
      is a difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and TIO and FSC and IP

      All population i.e. at least 40 years: Each initial maintenance treatment (IMT) cohort (FSC
      250/50mcg dose only, IP, and TIO) includes patients aged 40 years and older with at least 9
      months of continuous enrollment (6 months pre-index and at least three months post-index)
      with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COPD [International Classification of Disease, 9th
      revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 491.xx, 492.xx or 496.xx]. Patients are
      observed such that everyone provides minimum 6 months of pre index baseline data and minimum
      3 months post index (risk analysis) and minimum 12 months post index for cost analysis.
      Patients must receive either a 30-day supply of FSC or IP or TIO as the initial IMT
      medication, indicating &quot;intent to treat.&quot; Patients may not also have a prescription filled
      for the other IMT medication within 60 days of the index date, or for the combination therapy
      budesonide/ formoterol (BFC), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a long acting beta agonist
      (LABA). Six months of observation (continuous enrollment) prior to the index date is assessed
      to confirm that the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as to identify
      baseline characteristics and covariates. Cost analysis was done using a 12 months fixed
      follow up period. Outcome measures are assessed during the post-index period

      Elderly cohort 65+: Identical methods and design were used for subanalyses in patients aged
      65 years and over except comparison was FSC vs. TIO only.

      75+ cohort: Identical methods and design were used for subanalyses in patients aged 75 years
      and over except comparison was FSC vs. TIO only.

    <description>The first COPD event occurring after 30 days from initial treatment arm prescription was measured.

    <description>Medical costs are associated with COPD-related medical care (claims submitted with a primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis of COPD) and pharmaceutical care (treatment arm medications, oral corticosteroids, oral antibiotics, short-acting beta-agonists, long-acting beta-agonists [LABA], inhaled corticosteroids [ICS], ICS/LABA combinations, etc.. Means are adjusted for age, sex, geographic region, pre-initial treatment comorbidities, and COPD-related utilization. Total costs are the sum of medical care and pharmacy costs.</description>
