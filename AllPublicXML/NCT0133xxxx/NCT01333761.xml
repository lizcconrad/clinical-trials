      The CARDIOX Flow Detection System is designed to detect the presence of indocyanine green
      (ICG) dye in the blood and is being investigated to establish its efficacy in detecting the
      presence of right to left cardiac shunt (RTLS). The CARDIOX system will be compared against
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for sensitivity and specificity, as well as
      transcranial doppler (TCD) for positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement.

    <description>The Cardiox Shunt Detection system consists of a sensor placed in contact with the outer ear, similar to a finger probe used to detect oxygen levels in blood. Through an intravenous line, ICG (indocyanine green) at a dosage of 10 mg (2 mL of 5 mg/mL ICG solution) per test, is administered into the right or left antecubital fossa. The presence of ICG in the veins within the outer ear are detected, and the results are displayed on a monitor. All patients will also be evaluated with TCD and TEE for the presence of RTLS.</description>
