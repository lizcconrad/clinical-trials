  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients in the Kaiser Permanente HIV registry
      wil be followed in the usual clinical care to estimate the rates of specified clinical
      events. The rates will be stratified by relevant characteristics like age, CD4 counts, HIV
      Viral Load (VL), HIV medication history. The rates in the HIV infected cohort wil be compared
      with the rates of these events in patients in the Kaiser Permanente database who are not
      infected with HIV.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All HIV infected patients in the database will be included without any sampling. A random
      sample of non-HIV infected patients will be included as comparator.

    <measure>Incidence Rate of Malignancies</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 835</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence rate of malignancies was calculated as the number of events divided by person-time. Only the first diagnosis of each event per participant was included.Person-time was calculated as the sum of all time contributed by each individual who were Kaiser Permanente (KP) member from the date of HIV care initiation at that institution or January 1, 1996 for KP Northern California(KPNC) and January 1, 2000 for KP Southern California(KPSC) if in care prior to this date. Malignancies included acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies and non-AIDS defining malignancies.AIDS-defining malignancies included invasive cervical cancer,invasive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and kaposi's sarcoma;non-AIDS defining malignancies cancers ascertained from the KP cancer registries.Overall data for non-AIDS and AIDS defining malignancies, along with individual data for AIDS-defining malignancies was reported. Incidence rate was computed as the number of events per 100,000 person-years.</description>

        <title>Incidence Rate of Malignancies</title>
        <description>Incidence rate of malignancies was calculated as the number of events divided by person-time. Only the first diagnosis of each event per participant was included.Person-time was calculated as the sum of all time contributed by each individual who were Kaiser Permanente (KP) member from the date of HIV care initiation at that institution or January 1, 1996 for KP Northern California(KPNC) and January 1, 2000 for KP Southern California(KPSC) if in care prior to this date. Malignancies included acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies and non-AIDS defining malignancies.AIDS-defining malignancies included invasive cervical cancer,invasive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and kaposi's sarcoma;non-AIDS defining malignancies cancers ascertained from the KP cancer registries.Overall data for non-AIDS and AIDS defining malignancies, along with individual data for AIDS-defining malignancies was reported. Incidence rate was computed as the number of events per 100,000 person-years.</description>

          <title>Incidence Rate of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-Defining Opportunistic Infections</title>
          <description>Incidence rate of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections (OI) was calculated as the number of events divided by person-time.Only the first diagnosis of each event per participant was included.Person-time was calculated as the sum of all time contributed by each individual who were KP member from the date of HIV care initiation at that institution or January 1,1996 for KPNC and January 1,2000 for KPSC if in care prior to this date.OI were those that occurred on immune-compromised participants.AIDS-defining infections included:wasting syndrome;pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia;recurrent pneumonia;cytomegalovirus;HIV-related encephalopathy;esophageal candidiasis;mycobacterium avium complex;cryptococcosis;mycobacterium tuberculosis;progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy;lung candidiasis;toxoplasmosis of brain;coccidiomycosis;histoplasmosis;recurrent salmonella septicemia;chronic isosporiasis;cryptosporidiosis.Incidence rate was computed as the number of events per 100,000 person-years.</description>

          <description>Incidence rate of all-cause mortality was calculated as the number of events divided by person-time. Only the first diagnosis of each event per participant was included. Person-time was calculated as the sum of all time contributed by each individual who were KP member from the date of HIV care initiation at that institution or January 1, 1996 for KPNC and January 1, 2000 for KPSC if in care prior to this date. Incidence rate was computed as the number of events per 100,000 person-years.</description>
