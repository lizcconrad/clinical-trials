      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Botulinum toxin type A(Meditoxin®) on
      bruxism using polysomnography and determine which site is most appropriate for injection to
      obtain maximal effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bruxism is an oral habit consisting of involuntary non-functional gnashing, clenching,
      grinding of teeth and is a very common condition in the general population. Various treatment
      modalities such as occlusal splints, pharmacologic agent and cognitive-behavioral therapy
      have been investigated for the management of bruxism, but none is reported to be fully
      effective. Recently locally injected botulinum toxin has been used in various movement
      disorders, but its usefulness and objective effects on nocturnal bruxism have not been
      evaluated using objective measures such as polysomnography. Moreover, there is no systematic
      study about which site is most appropriate for injection to obtain maximal effects.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of botulinum toxin type A into masseter
      muscle or both masseter muscle and temporal muscle on nocturnal bruxism using polysomnography
      and the changes in the bruxism events on polysomnography.

    <measure>The change of bruxism events</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks after Botulinum toxin type A injection</time_frame>
    <description>Before and after injection, we compared the change of bruxism event in polysomnography by sleep laboratory criteria.
&lt;Sleep laboratory criteria&gt;
- Mean SB EMG potential : &gt;10% or 20% of the maximal clench while awake (masseter muscles)
In M group, Botulinum toxin was injected into masseter muscle. In TM group, Botulinum toxin was injected into masseter muscle and temporal muscle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of masticatory force(%)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks after Botulinum toxin type A injection</time_frame>
    <description>We evaluated the change of subjective masticatory force before and after the injection. We asked the subject that &quot;when the masticatory force before injection is represented 100%, what the masticatory force after injection?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks after Botulinum toxin type A injection</time_frame>
    <description>We asked the subject about change of pain if the subject has pain on masseter muscle due to myogeneous problem. Pain score was chosen from a scale of zero to 10, where zero represented 'no pain' and 10 represented 'the worst pain they had ever experienced' (Numerical rating scale, NRS)</description>

    <description>In this study, the botulinum toxin type A (Meditoxin®)was supplied as a freeze-dried powder of 200U, and was reconstituted with 4ml of sterile saline to a concentration of 5U/0.1ml.
After pre-injection polysomnography, botulinum toxin type A was injected into each side bilaterally using a 1ml-syringe with a 29-gauge, and a 1/2-inch needle. The &quot;M group&quot; had an injection in masseter muscle. The &quot;MT group&quot; had an injection in masseter and temporal muscle. A total of 25U of botulinum toxin type A was injected into each site.
After 4 weeks, the subjects had a post-injection polysomnography.</description>
