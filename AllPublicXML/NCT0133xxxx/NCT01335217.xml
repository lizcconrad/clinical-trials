  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 20-subject, dose finding study to examine the use of external trigeminal nerve
      stimulation (TNS) as an adjunctive treatment for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD)
      co- occurring with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when added onto antidepressant
      medications. Our primary objective is the examination of TNS in this patient population.

      To accomplish our specific aims, the investigators will test the following specific
      hypotheses:

        1. Subjects will show improvement in ratings of mood, PTSD, and other symptoms during the
           eight-week period.

        2. Subjects will show improvement in ratings of life functional capacity and quality of
           life with TNS.

        3. Subjects will report the TNS treatments to be acceptable in terms of side effects and
           burden of using the device.

      A total of 20 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) co-occurring with Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD), ages 18 to 75 years, will be consented and join this project at UCLA.

      The project will use TNS in under open-label conditions, using the same stimulation
      parameters as have been used in prior studies in MDD by itself and in treatment-refractory
      epilepsy. Subjects will be seen every two weeks during the 8 week study. At the end of the 8
      weeks, the TNS systems will be returned and the adjunctive treatment will end. The co-primary
      endpoints are the changes in depression severity and in PTSD severity from enrollment to the
      week 8 visit.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Outpatients with non-psychotic, unipolar Major Depressive Disorder AND Posttraumatic
             Stress Disorder, assessed via the MINI structured interview

          2. A score of ≥ 14 on the HAM-D17 with Item 1 (depressed mood) ≥ 2

          3. A score of ≥ 50 on the CAPS (Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV)

          4. A history of treatment failure with at least one adequate trial of an antidepressant
             over the previous 6 weeks, with no change in antidepressant medication or dose within
             the previous 6 weeks, and ongoing use of at least one antidepressant (which will
