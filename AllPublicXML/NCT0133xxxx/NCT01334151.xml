  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the speed of absorption and onset of action
      of BIOD-105 and BIOD-107 and compare them to Humalog®.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess other pharmacokinetic characteristics of
      BIOD-105 and BIOD-107 and compare those to Humalog®, to assess other pharmacodynamic
      characteristics of BIOD-105 and BIOD-107 and compare those to Humalog®, and to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of BIOD-105 and BIOD-107 compared to Humalog®.

    <description>The speed of absorption will be assessed by the time to reach 50% of maximum insulin concentration (TINS-50%-early, time before CINS max) and the onset of action will be assessed by the time to reach 50% of the maximum glucose infusion rate (TGIR-50%- early).</description>
