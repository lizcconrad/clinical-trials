  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to examine COPD-related outcomes for patients with comorbid
      depression/anxiety who are on combination fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate
      compared to those receiving anticholinergics.

      The prevalence of comorbid depression/anxiety in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) is estimated to be high and range from 10-40%, given that the risk of
      depression/anxiety symptoms is almost 3 times higher in patients with versus without COPD.
      Additionally, patients with comorbid COPD and depression/anxiety have higher COPD-related
      healthcare utilization and costs compared to those without depression/anxiety. Therapy with
      maintenance medications for COPD has been recommended to prevent future adverse COPD
      outcomes, but the impact of initiating these interventions has not yet been evaluated in a
      higher-risk population with comorbid COPD-depression/anxiety. The present study compares the
      risk of COPD exacerbations and COPD-related costs in patients initiating maintenance
      medications for treatment of COPD in a comorbid COPD/depression-anxiety population.
      Maintenance medications include inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting beta agonist
      (LABA), combination drug product of ICS+LABA, and anti-cholinergics (AC) including tiotropium
      (TIO) and ipratropium or combination ipratropium-albuterol (collectively abbreviated as IPR).

      This was a retrospective cohort study using a large administrative database (study period:
      1/1/2003 through 6/30/2009). Date of first FSC or ACs (tiotropium; ipratropium alone or in
      combination with albuterol) was defined as the index date. Managed care enrollees (aged &gt;40
      years) having at least one medical claim with a primary diagnosis of COPD (ICD code 491.xx,
      492.xx and 496.xx) and a diagnosis of depression (at least one claim with depression/anxiety
      or at least one prescription claim for depression/anxiety) in one-year pre-index and within
      60-days post-index were defined in the comorbid population. Patients were continuously
      eligible throughout the one-year pre and post-index periods. Negative binomial models were
      used to analyze number of COPD-related events [hospitalization (IP), emergency department
      (ED), office visits with oral steroid and/or antibiotic prescription within 5 days (OV+Rx)]
      and logistic regression was used to examine risk of COPD events between the two cohorts.
      COPD-related costs were compared between the two cohorts using - generalized linear model
      with log-link/gamma distribution after adjusting for baseline differences.

      Specifically the study hypothesis for the primary outcome being tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in risk of any COPD-related exacerbation between FSC and AC
      cohorts Ha: There is a difference in risk of any COPD-related exacerbation between FSC and AC
      cohorts

      Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and AC cohorts Ha: There is a
      difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and AC cohorts

    <description>The number of participants with a COPD-related exacerbation was identified during the follow-up period. Four types of COPD-related exacerbations were defined: COPD-related hospitalization, ER visit, physician visit with a prescription (Rx) for oral corticosteroid or antibiotic within 5 days of the visit, or combined occurrence of COPD-related hospitalization/ER visit.
