    <textblock>
      This study is being done because the study doctor is trying to develop a new test which will
      help transplant doctors monitor patients with high panel reactive antibodies (PRA). The test
      would be used to monitor patients' PRA when doctors are trying to lower it through a process
      known as desensitization. Desensitization lowers high PRA levels and allows patients to
      receive transplants. This is a single center study to evaluate and optimize the use of a new
      laboratory test to detect and measure the immune system's functioning.

      Sensitization to HLA antigens is the main barrier to solid organ transplantation. Currently,
      HLA sensitization is monitored by testing patients' serum against a panel of HLA antigens
      (whether those will be presented on cell surface or on solid phase matrixes) and calculating
      the % of positive responses. Such result give indication of the relative breadth of
      sensitization but not on it &quot;depth&quot; - the relative strength of specific antibodies, nor does
      it provide any information regarding the memory B cells / plasma cells that can manufacture a
      specific HLA directed antibody.

      This is a single center study to evaluate and optimize the use of in-vitro assay to enumerate
      B cells producing human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-specific antibodies. The proposed assay is
      based on principles used for enumeration of specific cytokine producing memory T cells - an
      ELISPOT assay. The investigators are currently using the T cell ELISPOT assay in our
      laboratory.

      The investigators believe that the proposed assay will provide biologically relevant immune
      measures that are crucial for the long term outcome of transplantation in highly sensitized
      patients.

      Highly sensitized patients encompass a high risk patient group among transplant recipients.
      The proposed assay is designed to predict the fate of DSA producing (or capable of producing)
      memory and plasma cells. Thus, it should allow prediction and early detection of activation
      of the humoral arm of the immune system, specifically against the donor. This, in turn, may
      prompt early intervention and preservation of the allograft. Three tubes of blood will be
      drawn twice, 8-12 weeks apart, during clinic or standard of care dialysis visits following
      optimization. Subjects undergoing desensitization will have three tubes of blood drawn seven
      times over the course of two years for the analysis.

    <description>B cells will be tested for their ability to produce IgG and tetanus antibodies (as controls) and HLA specific antibodies corresponding to those detected by the flow PRA assay. In subjects not undergoing desensitization, 3 tubes (30 ml) of blood will be drawn twice (total of 60 ml blood taken) 8-12 weeks apart. In subjects undergoing desensitization 3 tubes (30 ml) of blood will be taken at 7 points; enrollment, anticipated midpoint of desensitization, prior to transplant, 3, 6, 12 and 24 Months post-transplant (total of 210 ml blood taken).</description>

    <description>Transplant subjects give blood at specified time points. Sensitization to HLA antigens is a barrier to transplant. Several U.S. institutions have protocols for desensitization where patients are treated with IV immunoglobulins (IVIg) and plasmapheresis (PP) to reduce circulating HLA-directed antibody levels. Labs provide doctors information on circulating donor-specific antibody (DSA) levels. These results are the main indicator whether to proceed with transplant. However, no information is given on the fate of the B cells that produce the DSA.</description>

      Subjects will serve as a source of B-lineage cells, which will be tested for their ability to
      produce IgG, tetanus antibodies, (as controls) and HLA specific antibodies that coorespond to
      those detected by the flow PRA assay. They will be retained until they are used up.
