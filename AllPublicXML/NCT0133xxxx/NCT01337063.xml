  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients often have problems after they leave the hospital, in part because errors are made
      in the medications they are prescribed. The goal of this project is to develop a more
      accurate and safe medication prescription process when patients enter and leave the hospital
      and implement this process at six U.S. hospitals. The investigators will measure the success
      of the project and develop lessons learned so this process can be applied to other hospitals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unintentional medication discrepancies during transitions in care (such as hospitalization
      and subsequent discharge) are very common and represent a major threat to patient safety. One
      solution to this problem is medication reconciliation. In response to Joint Commission
      requirements, most hospitals have developed medication reconciliation processes, but some
      have been more successful than others, and there are reports of pro-forma compliance without
      substantial improvements in patient safety. There is now collective experience about
      effective approaches to medication reconciliation, but these have yet to be consolidated,
      evaluated rigorously, and disseminated effectively.

      This project's findings should provide valuable lessons to all hospitals regarding the best
      ways to design and implement medication reconciliation interventions to improve medication
      safety during transitions in care.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

      Aim 1: Develop a toolkit consolidating the best practice recommendations for medication
      reconciliation

      Aim 2: Conduct a multi-center mentored quality improvement project in which each site adapts
      the tools for its own environment and implements them

      Aim 3: Assess the effects of a mentored medication reconciliation quality improvement
      intervention on unintentional medication discrepancies with potential for patient harm

      Aim 4: Conduct rigorous program evaluation to determine the most important components of a
      medication reconciliation program and how best to implement it

    <description>The primary outcome will be determined by a study pharmacist who will take a &quot;gold standard&quot; medication history on 5 patients per week, then compare that history to the medical team's medication history, to admission orders, and to discharge orders. Any unintentional medication discrepancies in orders will be recorded. A physician adjudicator will then make a final determination regarding whether an error occurred, the type of error, the potential for patient harm, and the potential severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months prior to implementation of intervention to 21 months during intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Satisfaction will be assessed using data from the HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey. This survey is already administered to a sample of patients from all hospitals; we will measure both global satisfaction and questions related to medications (e.g., &quot;before giving you any new medications, how often did hospital staff tell you what the medicine was for,&quot; and &quot;before giving you any new medications, how often did hospital staff describe possible site effects in a way you could understand.&quot;)</description>

    <description>Based on expert recommendations from a recent conference on medication reconciliation sponsored by the Society of Hospital Medicine and funded by AHRQ, investigators will engage a steering committee and conduct a second conference to operationalize these recommendations into a set of &quot;best practice&quot; guidelines, standards, and tools to be adapted by each of 6 participating sites. After training mentors and developing data collection tools, a mentored quality improvement project will be conducted for 21 months, in which each site works to improve medication reconciliation using the toolkit and with mentorship in the form of two site visits and monthly phone calls.</description>
