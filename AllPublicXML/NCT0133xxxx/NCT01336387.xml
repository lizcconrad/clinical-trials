    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of retinoid 9cUAB30
      in healthy volunteers. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from
      forming. The use of retinoid 9cUAB30 may keep cancer from forming.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective is to determine the toxicities and recommended phase II dose of
      9cUAB30. The co- primary objective is to characterize the urine and plasma single dose and
      steady state pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 in normal volunteers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 with toxicity. II. To compare observed
      toxicity between placebo controls and each dose level. III. To assess for any change in
      single dose PK after repeat dosing (Day 1 vs. Day 36).

      IV. To assess the following potential biomarkers of UAB30:

        -  Telomerase activity (measurement of telomeric repeats) in PBMCs.

        -  Gene expression of DNA methyltransferase in PBMCs.

        -  Gene expression of CYP2B6 in PBMCs.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive retinoid 9cUAB30* orally (PO) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Participants receive placebo* PO on days 1-28.

      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      *NOTE: Participants receive doses on days 8, 15, 22 and 29 after they have fasted for 12
      hours.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 7 and 30.

          -  The effects of 9cUAB30 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason,
             women must agree to use TWO effective forms of birth control for the duration of study

                    -  Copper IUD (e.g. ParaGard)

               -  Note: because of the decreased effectiveness of low dose progesterone-only
                  contraceptive methods when used with retinoids, the following hormonal methods
                  are NOT acceptable:

                    -  Low dose progesterone only oral contraceptive pill (&quot;mini pills&quot; e.g.
                       MicronorÂ®, Nor-Q.D., Ovrette)

                    -  MirenaÂ® Hormonal Implanted Uterine Device (IUD)

               -  In addition to the above method of contraception, one of the following methods of
                  contraception will ALSO be used for the duration of study participation and for
                  30 days following the last dose of study medication:

                    -  Diaphragm, cervical cap, or cervical shield with spermicide

                    -  Contraceptive sponge (e.g. Today Sponge)

                    -  Condom (male or female type) plus spermicide

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within the
             current menstrual cycle and within 7 days before starting drug

          -  Participants must have the ability to understand, and the willingness to sign, a
             written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants may not be taking medications that might interact with 9cUAB30; detailed
             list of potentially interacting medications

          -  Participants may not be taking lipid lowering agents

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Participants with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition of retinoids

          -  Participants with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with 9cUAB30, breastfeeding must be discontinued
             for the duration of study participation and for one month after the last dose of the
             study agent if the mother is treated with 9cUAB30

          -  Individuals known to be HIV-positive may not participate in this study; the uncertain
             immune status of HIV-positive people and the potential risks of taking part in this
             study are too great to justify this non-treatment therapy

          -  Individuals with a history of cancer diagnosis or reoccurrence &lt; 5 years from study
             entry may not participate; however, individuals with a history of squamous or basal
             cell carcinoma of the skin &lt; 5 years from study entry will not be excluded from this
             study; the effects of this study agent on the immune system of people at risk for
             recurring cancer are unknown
