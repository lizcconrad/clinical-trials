    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a pilot study for a clinical research trial to establish the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and the most effective recruitment
      strategies prior to the full study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eight week pilot will be conducted to establish the feasibility of implementing
      motivational interviewing as a means to counsel African Americans with peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) to increase their walking. Additionally, we will determine the acceptance of
      culturally sensitive print material on managing PAD. Finally, we will utilize the pilot to
      develop best practice methods for successfully carrying out the full study.

    <measure>Change from baseline to eight weeks in 6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will walk as far as possible for 6 minutes in a marked corridor. They will be permitted to slow down, stop, and to rest as necessary, but the time will continue to run. They will be given standardized encouragement at each minute and their ending point will be marked with tape. The laps will be counted and the total distance in feet will be recorded. The onset of claudication, number of times the participant needed to stop, and rate of perceived exertion will be recorded throughout the test.</description>

    <description>Each participant will wear an accelerometer for one week at baseline to collect their current level physical activity.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  African American (determined by self-report)

          -  Lived most of their life in the United States

          -  Resting ABI &lt;0.95

          -  English Speaking

          -  Has a telephone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently walking for exercise at least 5 days per week (i.e., a PACE score ranging
             from 5-8)

          -  Prior major amputation (foot or lower leg) or critical leg ischemia (tissue loss,
             gangrene, or ulcers)

          -  Rest pain with ABI &lt;0.4 and non-palpable femoral pulses without prior evaluation by a
             vascular surgeon, given the need for evaluation for the role of more invasive therapy
             prior to recommending walking therapy

          -  Leg revascularization within 3 months of enrollment or plans for revascularization
             during the study period

          -  Use of supplemental oxygen

          -  Myocardial infarction within the preceding 3 months

          -  Resting blood pressure &gt; 200/110 mmHg

          -  Exercise-induced coronary ischemic symptoms, or exercise-induced ST depression &gt; 2.0
             mm

          -  Inability to walk for 2 minutes; the rationale being that people who cannot walk for 2
             minutes would not be able to complete the necessary submaximal treadmill test, which
             is used to screen for coronary ischemic symptoms. We will also exclude anyone who can
             walk for 20 minutes or more during the submaximal treadmill test. Anyone who can
             complete the submaximal test would not have significant walking impairment and would
             not get that much out of the study.

          -  Short Physical Performance Battery score of 10 or higher as such persons do not have a
             clinically significant impairment in mobility; therefore, we will exclude anyone who
             scores a 10 or higher (out of a maximum of 12 points).
