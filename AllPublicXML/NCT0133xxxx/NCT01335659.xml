      The investigators studied the relations between coronary angiography (CAG), intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) in coronary ostial lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiographic evaluation for ostial lesions is reported to be inaccurate in the assessment of
      the functional and clinical significance of a lesion. The investigators studied the relations
      between coronary angiography (CAG), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and fractional flow
      reserve (FFR) in coronary ostial lesions.
