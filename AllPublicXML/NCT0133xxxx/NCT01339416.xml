      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients in the HIV registries of Johns Hopkins
      University, University of North Carolina and Vanderbilt University will be followed in the
      routine clinical care to estimate the rates of prespecified clinical events in this
      population.

    <measure>Incidence Rate of Malignancies</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 626</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence rate of malignancies was calculated as the number of events divided by person-time. Only the first diagnosis of each event per participant was included. Person-time was calculated as the sum of all time contributed by each individual from the date of HIV care initiation at that institution or January 1, 2000 if in care prior to this date. Malignancies included acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies and non-AIDS defining malignancies. AIDS-defining malignancies included invasive cervical cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and kaposis sarcoma; non-AIDS defining malignancies included but not limited to Hodgkin's disease, lung cancer, liver cancer, anal cancer, melanoma of the skin, leukemia, renal cancer, and prostate cancer. Overall data for non-AIDS defining malignancies and individual data for AIDS-defining malignancies was reported. Incidence rate was computed as the number of events per 100 person-years.</description>

          <title>Incidence Rate of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-Defining Opportunistic Infections</title>
          <description>Incidence rate of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections was calculated as the number of events divided by person-time. Only the first diagnosis of each event per participant was included. Person-time was calculated as the sum of all time contributed by each individual from the date of HIV care initiation at that institution or January 1, 2000 if in care prior to this date. Opportunistic infections were those that occurred on immune-compromised participants. AIDS-defining infections included: esophageal candidiasis; pneumocystes jiroveci; non-tuberculous mycobacterium infection; AIDS dementia complex; disseminated cryptococcosis; cytomegalovirus (all sites); wasting syndrome; toxoplasmosis; cytomegalovirus retinitis; mycobacterium tuberculosis; Progressive (Prog.) multifocal leukoencephalopathy; histoplasmosis; cryptosporidiosis; recurrent pneumonia; herpes simplex infection; extra-pulmonary coccidioidomycosis; salmonella septicemia; isosporiasis.</description>

Person-time was calculated as the sum of all time contributed by each individual from the date of HIV care initiation at that institution or January 1, 2000 if in care prior to this date. Rhabdomyolysis was a condition of muscle fibers breakdown.</description>
