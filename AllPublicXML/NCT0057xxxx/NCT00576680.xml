      This research study will test the safety of RAD001 in combination with temozolomide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Participants will take RAD001 by mouth daily. They will also take temozolomide by mouth
           daily for one week, followed by a one-week break period. This one-week on/one week off
           schedule for temozolomide will continue for the duration of the treatment.

        -  After the first month of treatment, there will be a 7-day observation period during
           which no study medication will be taken to observe for any side effects.

        -  During all treatment cycles (1 cycle is 28 days in length) participants will have a
           physical exam and will be asked questions about their general health and specific
           questions about any problems they may be experiencing. Initially, participants will come
           in every other week. At each of these visits, blood work will be taken to monitor the
           participants health.

        -  After every 2 months of treatment, participants will have a CT scan or MRI done to see
           how the medication is working.
