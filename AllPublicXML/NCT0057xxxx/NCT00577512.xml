    <textblock>
      This study is being done in an attempt to improve the remission rate and the survival time
      for subjects with high-risk myeloma. It is hoped that by giving higher doses of commonly used
      chemotherapy drugs and by giving courses closer together (before the myeloma comes back or
      gets worse), subjects in this study will have better outcomes.

      This study has the following goals:

        -  To find out how many subjects treated with high dose DTPACE (Dexamethasone, Thalidomide,
           CisPlatin, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide, and Etoposide. (HD DTPACE) on this protocol
           will have a complete response or near complete response that lasts for 6 months or
           longer.

        -  In subjects achieving a response, to find out how long the response will last.

        -  To learn more about the side effects of this treatment.

      Up to 75 subjects, male or female, age 18 and older, regardless of race or ethnicity, will
      participate in this study at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) only.

      The treatment in this study is divided into 3 parts

        -  High dose DTPACE and stem cell collection if you do not already have sufficient stem
           cells stored.

        -  High dose DTPACE and stem cell re-infusion.

        -  Velcade, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone (sometimes known as VTD) Maintenance therapy.
