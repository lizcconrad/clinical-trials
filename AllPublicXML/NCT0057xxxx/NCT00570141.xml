      OASIS Wound Matrix (Oasis) will be applied to wounds, with sequential biopsy of healing
      wounds to explore the mechanism of action.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound types will be Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) and Venous Stasis Ulcers (VSU).

    <measure>Decrease in Wound Area From Baseline After 12 Weeks of Treatment or Until Wound Closure, Whichever Occurred First.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Wound measurements were made weekly, spaced 7 +/- 1 day apart, up to 12 weeks or until the wound healed, whichever occurred first.
The final measurement taken was subtracted from the baseline to assess the decrease in wound area after treatment.
Final calculation is mean baseline measurement minus final measurement at 12 weeks (or when wound healed, whichever occurred first)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Wounds Closed</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Wound healing was assessed weekly, spaced 7 +/- 1 day apart, up to 12 weeks or until the wound healed, whichever occurred first.
The outcome value was based on the percent of wounds which were closed at the end of the study (at 12 weeks). The percent wounds closed were calculated for each wound type: Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) and Venous Stasis Ulcers (VSU).</description>
