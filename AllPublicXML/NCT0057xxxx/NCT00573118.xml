  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital and acquired thrombophilia were identified as risk factors for thrombosis in
      systemic vessels.Thrombophilias have also been recently found to be associated with
      preeclampsia, intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR), placental abruption, intrauterine
      fetal death (IUFD) and repeated pregnancy loss.These severe pregnancy complications are
      thought to result from thrombotic events occurring in the uteroplacental circulation.
      Accumulating data have established an association between elevated plasma activity of factor
      VIII and thrombosis although the mechanism is still not defined and elevated factor VIII
      activity is now regarded as being equivalent to thrombophilia.

      We intend to investigatthe association between factor VIII levels and severe pregnancy
      complications which are considered to result from placental vascular pathology, i.e.,
      preeclampsia, IUGR, placental abruption and IUFD. We hypothezise that the prevalence of
      elevated factor 8 will be higher among women with pregnancy complications compared to
      controls.
