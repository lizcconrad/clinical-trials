  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation dermatitis is a common side-effect of radiation therapy in cancer patients who
      frequently can experience redness, pain, crusting, and even ulceration of the skin causing
      suffering and treatment interruption. A recent retrospective study by DeLand demonstrated
      that administering light emitting diode (LED) photomodulation after each radiation treatment
      for breast cancer decreased radiation dermatitis in a majority of patients. LED
      photomodulation is a process by which specific sequences of light are used to regulate or
      manipulate cell activity without causing heat or damage to the skin. Each LED treatment is
      painless and is completed in usually less than one minute. LED photomodulation may reduce the
      suffering associated with radiation treatments, improve cosmetic outcome in radiation fields,
      and eliminate breaks in radiation treatments which may be required because of severe
      ulcerating reactions.

      This study will attempt to replicate the findings of Dr. DeLand's study by randomly assigning
      at least 40 breast cancer patients to either a treatment group or to a control group. The
      treatment group will receive LED photomodulation treatments before and after each radiation
      treatment with the Gentlewaves Select™ handheld high energy 590nm LED array using specific
      sequences of pulses used in other studies; the treatment group will also receive 7 additional
      treatments over 2 weeks after their radiation treatment course is completed. The control
      group will receive no LED treatment but will use the exact same skin care regimen as the
      treatment group. In addition to weekly evaluation and grading of skin reactions, subjects
      will be photographed under standardized conditions weekly and then photographs will be
      evaluated and graded by blinded dermatologists.
