    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together
      with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with cancer that has spread to other parts
      of the body or that cannot be removed by surgery. Irinotecan hydrochloride can kill cancer
      cells by damaging the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is needed for cancer cell survival and
      growth. Veliparib may block proteins that repair the damaged DNA and may help irinotecan
      hydrochloride to kill more tumor cells. Giving irinotecan hydrochloride together with
      veliparib may kill more cancer cells.

      PORTION) III. To determine the safety profile of irinotecan in combination with ABT-888: the
      incidence of adverse events (AEs) and clinically significant changes in laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and vital signs. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) IV. To
      determine the safety profile of irinotecan in combination with ABT-888 at the recommended

      the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of each drug for irinotecan (once weekly intravenously
      in 2 of 3 weeks), in combination with ABT-888 (twice daily orally for intermittent dosing
      days 1 to 4 and days 8 to 11 of each cycle), determined by evaluating the feasibility,

      cells (PBMC) by measurement of PAR levels. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) II. DNA
      damaging effects of irinotecan and the combination of irinotecan with ABT-888: levels of

      tumor tissue. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) III. Relevance of cytochrome P450 family 2,
      subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) and 2C19 polymorphisms, uridine 5'-diphosphosphate (UDP)
      glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) polymorphism, and ATP-binding
      cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2 (ABCG2) polymorphism to the pharmacokinetics of
      irinotecan and/or ABT-888. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) IV. To explore whether a
      positive gamma-H2AX response in tumor tissue at 4-6 hours (hrs) is reflected in circulating
      tumor cells (CTCs) between 8-24 hrs but not at 4-6 hrs, as predicted. (EXPANSION PORTION) V.
      To explore whether PARP inhibition increases gamma-H2AX response of CTCs to plasma drug by
      4-6 hrs after CPT-11. (EXPANSION PORTION) VI. To explore whether PARP inhibition increases
      gamma-H2AX response of tumor cells to tissue drug level, as indicated by CTCs at 8-24 hrs
      after CPT-11. (EXPANSION PORTION) VII. To explore when the gamma-H2AX response peak in CTCs
      occurs, indicating a response in tumor. (EXPANSION PORTION) VIII. To explore whether there is
      a tumor switch between gamma-H2AX and excision repair cross-complementation group 1
      (ERCC1)-mediated repair in the presence of PARP inhibition, (i.e., repeat initial PBMC and
      tumor findings). (EXPANSION PORTION) IX. To perform analysis of CTCs at day 15 to help guide
      alteration in ABT-888 drug administration schedule (continuous administration). (EXPANSION
      PORTION) X. To sequence the genome and transcriptome from both normal and tumor tissue from
      each study patient in the expansion cohort to evaluate point mutations, structural changes
      and copy number events. (EXPANSION PORTION) XI. To evaluate the damaging effects of
      irinotecan and the combination of irinotecan with ABT-888 by examining levels of Rad51
      formation in tumors. (EXPANSION PORTION) XII. To evaluate the percentage of breast cancer
      stem cells (BCSC) in serial breast tumor biopsies before and after irinotecan alone and after

      XIII. To perform molecular profiling of the tumor cell and BCSC populations before and after
      irinotecan alone and after 1 cycle of treatment with the combination of irinotecan and
      ABT-888. (EXPANSION PORTION) XIV. To compare Rad51 foci in aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive
      (ALDH+) stem cell populations to the bulk tumor cells. (EXPANSION PORTION) XV. To develop
      assays to detect trapping of PARP1 and 2 in tumor biopsy tissue in response to treatment with
      irinotecan plus a PARP inhibitor, in this case ABT-888. (DOSE ESCALATION FOR INTERMITTENT
      ABT-888 PORTION) XVI. Additional exploratory assay to be named later. (DOSE ESCALATION FOR

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for three months following completion of
             study therapy; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  All patients must provide archival tissue block or paraffin sample from archival
             tissue block (approximately 10 sections) for use in pharmacodynamic correlative
             studies (NOT required for patients enrolled on the dose escalation for intermittent
             ABT-888 portion of the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier;
             patients who have been administered ABT-888 as part of a single or limited dosing
             study, such as a phase 0 study, should not necessarily be excluded from participating
             in this study solely because of receiving prior ABT-888

          -  Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within 4 weeks of
             study entry

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to the following:

               -  Camptothecin derivatives (e.g., topotecan [topotecan hydrochloride], irinotecan,
                  or exatecan [exatecan mesylate])

               -  Any ingredients contained within the liquid irinotecan solution (e.g., sorbitol)
                  or

               -  Any antiemetics or antidiarrheals appropriate for administration with study
                  therapy (e.g., loperamide or dexamethasone)

          -  Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic,
             radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for
             medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an
             anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); these medications must
             have been started 1 month prior to enrollment on this study; in addition, men
             receiving treatment for prostate cancer will be maintained at castrate levels of
             testosterone by continuation of luteinizing-releasing hormone agonists

          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures

          -  Patients with known active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial; patients with prior treated brain metastases are allowed, providing that they
             were not accompanied by seizures and that a baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) scan prior to study entry demonstrates no current evidence of brain metastases;
             all patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases must be stable for &gt; 3
             months after treatment and off steroid treatment prior to study enrollment

          -  Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte
             counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen)

          -  Any patient requiring cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)
             isoform-inducing drugs (e.g. phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, rifampin,
             rifabutin, ketoconazole, St. John's wort) will be excluded; CYP3A4-inducing drugs
             should be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the first cycle of irinotecan

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:

               -  Ongoing or active infection

               -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure

               -  Unstable angina pectoris
