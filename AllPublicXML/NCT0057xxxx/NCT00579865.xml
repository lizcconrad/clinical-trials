    <textblock>
      You may have symptoms like itching, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, fevers and
      chills. The treatment you will receive to relieve the blockage is also intended to relieve
      symptoms and improve your quality of life. The purpose of this study is to find out if
      relieving the blockage in your bile duct improves your quality of life.

      Malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) may arise in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic
      carcinoma, primary gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or metastatic disease to
      the liver or portal lymph nodes. MBO is often accompanied by significant symptoms that may
      result in impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQL), including pruritus, fever,
      nutritional deficits, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue. Approaches to the
      relief of MBO include surgical bypass and/or resection, percutaneous drainage with or without
      biliary stenting, or endoscopic stenting. The non surgical procedures may be done prior to
      attempted curative resection or for palliation in individuals with unresectable or recurrent
      disease.
