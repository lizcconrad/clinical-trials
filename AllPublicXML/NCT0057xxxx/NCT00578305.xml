    <textblock>
      This 3 arm study assessed the efficacy of rituximab (MabThera®/Rituxan®) in the prevention of
      progression of structural joint damage in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis who
      had an inadequate clinical response to methotrexate. Participants were randomized to receive
      rituximab 500 mg intravenously (iv), rituximab 1000 mg iv, or placebo iv on days 1 and 15
      every 24 weeks in the main study; all participants received concomitant methotrexate at a
      stable dose of 12.5-25 mg/week throughout the study. Further courses of rituximab were
      provided to eligible participants. Structural joint damage was assessed by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) at baseline and at intervals during the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There were 3 phases in the study: A 52 week long main study, a study extension phase, and a
      48 week long safety follow-up phase.

      The first course of treatment with placebo or rituximab was initiated on Day 1 of the 52 week
      long main study. A second course of treatment was initiated after Week 24, if the participant
      met eligibility criteria. After Week 52, eligible participants received further treatment
      courses at intervals ≥ 6 months in the study extension phase. No treatments were administered
      in the safety follow-up phase.

      Participants had to meet the following eligibility criteria to receive rituximab in the study
      extension phase.

        -  Minimum of 24 weeks had passed since the first infusion of the last course of study
           medication.

        -  C-reactive protein-based Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28-CRP) ≥ 2.6.

        -  Absolute neutrophil count not below 1.5 x 103/μL.

        -  Patient had not developed contraindications for receiving rituximab, such as:

                cardiovascular disease, nervous system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine or
                gastrointestinal disorders.

             2. Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of, or currently active), including
                known history of HIV infection.

             3. Known active infection of any kind (excluding fungal infections of nail beds), or
                any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization, or treatment with iv
                anti-infectives within 4 weeks prior to infusion or completion of oral
                anti-infectives within 2 weeks prior to infusion.

        -  Patient was not pregnant or breast feeding.

        -  Patients who entered the study and were found to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
           negative, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive, were to be negative for hepatitis
           B viral DNA (&lt; 29 IU/mL) and were to have aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine

    <measure>Change in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Erosion Score From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The erosion score was determined according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring (RAMRIS) system in magnetic resonance images with and without gadolinium of 15 anatomical locations in each wrist and 10 locations in each hand in the hand and wrist with the most arthritic activity. If there was no difference in disease activity between the hands, the dominant hand was used. Images were assessed by 2 experienced blinded musculoskeletal radiologists. Each location was scored in 0.5 increments from 0 to 10 with each integer unit increment representing a 10% loss of articular bone using the following scale. 0.0=normal, no erosion; 0.5=1-5% erosion; 1.0=6-10% erosion; 1.5=11-15% erosion; 2.0=16-20% erosion; etc, up to 10.0=96-100% erosion. The individual scores were summed and normalized to a range of 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating more erosion. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) at Weeks 24 and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatic arthritis (RA) and includes swollen and tender joint counts, C-reactive protein level (CRP), and general health (GH) status. The index is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × √(TJC28)) + (0.28 × √(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(CRO)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints, GH = a participant's global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end = no disease activity [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms], right end = maximum disease activity [maximum arthritis disease activity]). The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change of the DAS28 score from Baseline was used to determine the EULAR responses. For a post-Baseline score ≤ 3.2, a change from Baseline of &lt; -1.2 was a good response, &lt; -0.6 to ≥ -1.2 was a moderate response, and ≥ -0.6 was no response. For a post-Baseline score &gt; 3.2 to ≤ 5.1, a change from Baseline of &lt; -0.6 was a moderate response and ≥ -0.6 was no response. For a post-Baseline score &gt; 5.1, a change from Baseline &lt; -1.2 was a moderate response and ≥ -1.2 was no response. A good response could not be achieved for post-Baseline scores &gt; 3.2. DAS28=(0.56×√(TJC28))+(0.28×√(SJC28))+(0.7×log(CRP))+(0.014×GH), where TJC28=tender joint count (JC) and SJC28=swollen JC (28 joints), GH=a participant's global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end=no disease activity, right end=maximum disease activity), and CRP=C-reactive protein level.

        <title>Change in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Erosion Score From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>The erosion score was determined according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring (RAMRIS) system in magnetic resonance images with and without gadolinium of 15 anatomical locations in each wrist and 10 locations in each hand in the hand and wrist with the most arthritic activity. If there was no difference in disease activity between the hands, the dominant hand was used. Images were assessed by 2 experienced blinded musculoskeletal radiologists. Each location was scored in 0.5 increments from 0 to 10 with each integer unit increment representing a 10% loss of articular bone using the following scale. 0.0=normal, no erosion; 0.5=1-5% erosion; 1.0=6-10% erosion; 1.5=11-15% erosion; 2.0=16-20% erosion; etc, up to 10.0=96-100% erosion. The individual scores were summed and normalized to a range of 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating more erosion. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Erosion Score From Baseline to Weeks 12 and 52</title>
          <description>The erosion score was determined according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring (RAMRIS) system in magnetic resonance images with and without gadolinium of 15 anatomical locations in each wrist and 10 locations in each hand in the hand and wrist with the most arthritic activity. If there was no difference in disease activity between the hands, the dominant hand was used. Images were assessed by 2 experienced blinded musculoskeletal radiologists. Each location was scored in 0.5 increments from 0 to 10 with each integer unit increment representing a 10% loss of articular bone using the following scale. 0.0=normal, no erosion; 0.5=1-5% erosion; 1.0=6-10% erosion; 1.5=11-15% erosion; 2.0=16-20% erosion; etc, up to 10.0=96-100% erosion. The individual scores were summed and normalized to a range of 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating more erosion. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The synovitis score was determined according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring (RAMRIS) system in magnetic resonance images of 3 wrist regions and 5 metacarpophalangeal joints in the hand and wrist with the most arthritic activity. If there was no difference in disease activity between the hands, the dominant hand was used. Images were assessed by 2 experienced blinded musculoskeletal radiologists. Each location was scored in 0.5 increments from 0 to 3 with each integer unit increment representing a 33% enhancement of the maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment using the following scale: 0.0=normal, no synovitis; 0.5=1-17% estimated volume of enhancement; 1.0=18-33%; 1.5=34-50%; 2.0=51-67%; 2.5=68-83%; 3.0=84-100% estimated volume of enhancement.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With no Newly Eroded Joints at Weeks 24 and 52</title>
          <description>No newly eroded joints was defined as no new erosions in joints which were scored 0 at baseline. The erosion score was determined according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring (RAMRIS) system in magnetic resonance images with and without gadolinium of 15 anatomical locations in each wrist and 10 locations in each hand in the hand and wrist with the most arthritic activity. If there was no difference in disease activity between the hands, the dominant hand was used. Images were assessed by 2 experienced blinded musculoskeletal radiologists. Each location was scored in 0.5 increments from 0 to 10 with each integer unit increment representing a 10% loss of articular bone using the following scale. 0.0=normal, no erosion; 0.5=1-5% erosion; 1.0=6-10% erosion; 1.5=11-15% erosion; 2.0=16-20% erosion; etc, up to 10.0=96-100% erosion.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Improvement in Osteitis at Weeks 24 and 52</title>
          <description>There were 2 definitions of improvement in osteitis. A participant met the criterion for definition 1 when there was a drop in the magnetic resonance imaging osteitis score from Baseline &gt; 0.5. A participant met the criterion for definition 2 when there was a drop in the magnetic resonance imaging osteitis score from Baseline &gt; than the smallest detectable change. The osteitis score was determined according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) rheumatoid arthritis MRI (RAMRIS) scoring system in magnetic resonance images with and without gadolinium of 15 anatomical locations in each wrist and 10 locations in each hand in the hand and wrist with the most arthritic activity. If there was no difference in disease activity between the hands, the dominant hand was used. Images were assessed by 2 experienced blinded musculoskeletal radiologists.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) at Weeks 24 and 52</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatic arthritis (RA) and includes swollen and tender joint counts, C-reactive protein level (CRP), and general health (GH) status. The index is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × √(TJC28)) + (0.28 × √(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(CRO)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints, GH = a participant’s global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end = no disease activity [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms], right end = maximum disease activity [maximum arthritis disease activity]). The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Low Disease Activity (Disease Activity Score 28 [DAS28] ≤ 3.2) at Weeks 24 and 52</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants who had low rheumatic arthritis disease activity at Weeks 24 and 52, as measured by a DAS28 score ≤ 3.2, is reported. DAS28 is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × √(TJC28)) + (0.28 × √(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(CRO)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints, GH = a participant’s global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end = no disease activity [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms], right end = maximum disease activity [maximum arthritis disease activity]), and CRP = C-reactive protein level. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Major Clinical Response at Week 52</title>
        <description>A major clinical response was defined as an improvement of at least 70% in the American College of Rheumatology score from Baseline at Week 52. Improvement must be seen in tender and swollen joint counts (28 assessed joints) and in at least 3 of the following 5 parameters: Separate participant and physician assessments of participant disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a visual analog scale (VAS, the extreme left end of the line “no disease activity” [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms] and the extreme right end “maximum disease activity”); participant assessment of pain in previous the 24 hours on a VAS (extreme left end of the line “no pain” and the extreme right end “unbearable pain”); Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (20 questions, 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do); and C reactive protein level.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Weeks 24 and 52</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI assesses how well the patient is able to perform 8 activities: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The patient answers 20 questions with 1 of 4 responses with the past week as the time frame: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The highest score for any question in a category determines the category score. The total score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
