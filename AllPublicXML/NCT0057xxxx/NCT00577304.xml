  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      Topical AmphiMatrix with Nitroglycerin (MQX0503) to relieve Raynaud's symptoms and increase
      blood flow to the fingers.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to determine, in a controlled fashion, the ability of a
      topical formulation of Nitroglycerin, MQX-503, to improve the patient's health assessment as
      indicated by patient and physician assessments, decrease the frequency of Raynaud's events,
      decrease the duration of Raynaud's events, and decrease the symptoms (pain, tingling,
      numbness) in the fingers of Raynaud's patients. The study will include patients with moderate
      to severe primary Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP) and with moderate to severe Raynaud's Phenomenon
      secondary to autoimmune diseases, such as scleroderma.
