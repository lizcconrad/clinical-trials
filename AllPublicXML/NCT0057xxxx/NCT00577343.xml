    <textblock>
      Hospital acquired and community acquired methicillin resistant staph aureus (MRSA) has become
      an important health issue for in recent years. Up to two thirds of patients that are
      hospitalized may be colonized with MRSA. The prevalence in the community is also on the rise
      and affects the young and healthy. It is unclear what the true prevalence of MRSA is in our
      own hospital and outpatient setting. This information would be relevant to how healthcare
      staff adhere to contact and universal precautions. : The purpose of this study is to
      determine the prevalence of MRSA in patients that have gastrointestinal endoscopy and
      endoscopic ultrasound.
