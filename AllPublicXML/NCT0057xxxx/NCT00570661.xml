  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study has been designed in order to evaluate safety and tolerability of ITF2357
      in patients with active SOJIA with inadequate response or intolerance to standard therapy
      with oral steroids and methotrexate, with or without previously used biologic agents, and to
      have a preliminary evaluation of efficacy of ITF2357 in the treatment of SOJIA.

      ITF2357 will be administered orally at the daily cumulative dose of 1.5 mg/kg: this dose in
      children/young adults is considered roughly equivalent to the dose of 1 mg/kg/day in adults,
      which so far has been proven to be free of any relevant safety concerns both in healthy
      volunteers and in patients.

    <description>ITF2357 will be supplied as hard gelatine capsule for oral administration at the dose strengths of 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20 and 50 mg, identifiable by different colours. The dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day will be achieved by administration, at 12-hour interval, of an appropriate number of capsules of definite strength(s) as specified here below</description>
