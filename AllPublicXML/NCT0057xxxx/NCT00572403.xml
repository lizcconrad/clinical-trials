  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project will look at the relationship between baseline variables, and the new
      onset of microalbuminuria and the response to treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker,
      losartan, in a cohort of 246 early hypertensives and normotensives who are being brought back
      for a 4-5 year follow up visit as part of a continuing project. We hypothesize that the new
      onset of microalbuminuria is associated with higher blood pressure levels at baseline and 1
      year as well as being associated with elevated left ventricular mass index. The rate of new
      onset microalbuminuria in non-diabetics is not established and this prospective study will
      provide data.

      The primary objective of this research project is to determine risk factors related to the
      development of microalbuminuria. The secondary objective is to determine whether uric acid
      levels at the final visit are correlated with the onset of microalbuminuria. Of participants
      returning for a 4-5 year follow up visit as part of a continuing project, we will examine the
      proportion that have developed microalbuminuria. Subjects found to have microalbuminuria will
      be offered therapy with the ARB losartan and will be followed at three months to determine if
      there has been a reduction in levels.
