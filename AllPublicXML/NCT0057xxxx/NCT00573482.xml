    <textblock>
      The dramatic rise in overweight and obesity during the past several decades can be explained
      by environmental changes that foster increased energy intake and decreased energy
      expenditure. There are several reasons to suggest that the most effective approach to weight
      gain prevention is the incorporate reduced-fat eating into an overall strategy of lowering
      the energy density of the diet. Our energy density manipulations will be designed to reduce
      both the fat content and the caloric density of foods served at a cafeteria, which serves as
      the &quot;food environment&quot; for hospital employees.

    <description>The intervention group received the education in REDE techniques.
The intervention in this study comprised four components:
Four group education sessions to introduce the REDE principles of eating;
Approximately 10 new lower energy-dense foods were introduced in the employee cafeteria daily at lunchtime;
Food labels for all foods sold in the employee cafeteria at lunch time, which provided the energy density, calories, and macronutrient content of the prepared cafeteria foods. Prior to the intervention almost no foods had food labels.
Price reductions for lower energy density items. Both groups were exposed to the food labels and the new lower ED foods, but only the intervention group received the education sessions about how to take advantage of the new labels and cafeteria foods and only they were eligible for the price reductions.</description>
