  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to retrospectively and prospectively review patients who have
      undergone this technique looking at age of the patient, magnitude of the curve
      preoperatively, postoperatively and over time, diagnosis, pulmonary function, surgical
      procedures, complications, and spinal growth.

      The hypothesis is that Shilla growth permitting spinal instrumentation coupled with a
      surgical technique of aggressive correction of the apex of the scoliotic curve wil allow for
      natural growth of the spine in a guided fashion with a limited number of future surgeries
      required.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional &quot;growing rod&quot; constructs of spinal instrumentation to treat severe scoliosis in
      young children require a return to the operating room every six to nine months until skeletal
      maturity. The Shilla system allows for more spinal growth with fewer surgical procedures
      necessary for lengthenings. This is a major advantage over existing growth permitting systems
      and allows surgery to be performed at younger ages with better deformity correction without
      concerns of repeated surgeries.
