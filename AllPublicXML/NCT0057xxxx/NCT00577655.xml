  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Percent Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Observed up to Two Hours Post Dose (FEV1max%0-2) on Day 22</measure>
    <time_frame>35±5 and 10±2 min prior to dosing, and at 5±2, 15±5, 30±5, 45±5, 60±10, 120 ±10 post dosing on Day 22 or last observation</time_frame>
    <description>The FEV1 test is conducted by having a person empty their lungs of air into a mouthpiece attached to a sensor that measures the amount of air blown measured in liters. A standardized spirometer was used with the subject in the sitting or standing position (orientation had to be consistent for each subject during study visits) and wearing a nose clip. Whenever possible, evaluations were performed by the same respiratory therapist on the same calibrated spirometer at approximately the same time (±2 hrs).
The maximum percent change from baseline in FEV1 observed up to 2 hours following completion of dosing using Day 22 baseline. The baseline FEV1 was defined as the average of the two test-day pre-dose baseline FEV1 values.
The reason for the two primary endpoints was that FEV1 is difficult to obtain in children below 7 years of age.</description>

    <description>The PEF test is conducted by having a person blow as hard as they can into a mouthpiece attached to a sensor that measures the rate of air blown.

    <description>The FEV1 test is conducted by having a person empty their lungs of air into a mouthpiece attached to a sensor that measures the amount of air blown measured in liters. Values are then expressed as the percentage of FE1 values predicted for a 'normal' population. Predicted FEV1 values were computed and adjusted for age, height and gender according to Eigen et al. for subjects 4-5 years of age and to Quanjer et al. for subjects aged 6-11 years using American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.
The area under-the-effect curves for percent-predicted FEV1 were calculated according to the trapezoidal rule and were based on actual (not scheduled) measurement times.</description>

    <measure>Weekly Average Highest (Worst) Daily Asthma Symptom Scores for Weeks 1, 2 and 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3</time_frame>
    <description>Highest daily asthma symptom scores by study week. For this assessment, patients self-evaluate and record on the diary card the following asthma symptoms experienced during the day (i.e. last 12-14 hours): wheeze, shortness of breath, cough, tightness of chest. The worst of these symptoms were scored daily on a four-point scale:
0 = No symptoms occurred
1 = Symptom occurred but did not interfere with daily activity
2 = Symptom occurred but was sometimes annoying or interfered with daily activity
3 = Symptom present even at rest and was annoying or interfered with daily activity</description>

    <description>Participants measured their PEF as trained by taking as deep a breath as possible, placing their mouth firmly around the mouthpiece of the flow meter to form a tight seal, and exhaling as hard and as fast as possible. Subjects repeated the process twice at intervals of approximately 30 seconds, and then recorded the highest of the three PEF values on the diary card.</description>

        <title>Maximum Percent Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Observed up to Two Hours Post Dose (FEV1max%0-2) on Day 22</title>
        <description>The FEV1 test is conducted by having a person empty their lungs of air into a mouthpiece attached to a sensor that measures the amount of air blown measured in liters. A standardized spirometer was used with the subject in the sitting or standing position (orientation had to be consistent for each subject during study visits) and wearing a nose clip. Whenever possible, evaluations were performed by the same respiratory therapist on the same calibrated spirometer at approximately the same time (±2 hrs).
The maximum percent change from baseline in FEV1 observed up to 2 hours following completion of dosing using Day 22 baseline. The baseline FEV1 was defined as the average of the two test-day pre-dose baseline FEV1 values.
The reason for the two primary endpoints was that FEV1 is difficult to obtain in children below 7 years of age.</description>

        <title>Maximum Percent Change From Baseline in Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Observed up to Two Hours Post Dose (PEFmax%0-2) on Day 22</title>
        <description>The PEF test is conducted by having a person blow as hard as they can into a mouthpiece attached to a sensor that measures the rate of air blown. A standardized spirometer was used with the subject in the sitting or standing position (orientation had to be consistent for each subject during study visits) and wearing a nose clip. Whenever possible, evaluations were performed by the same respiratory therapist on the same calibrated spirometer at approximately the same time (±2 hrs).
The maximum percent change from baseline in the PEF observed up to 2 hours following completion of dosing using Day 22 baseline. The baseline PEF was defined as the average of the test-day pre-dose baseline PEF values.
The reason for the two primary endpoints was that FEV1 is difficult to obtain in children below 7 years of age.</description>

        <description>The FEV1 test is conducted by having a person empty their lungs of air into a mouthpiece attached to a sensor that measures the amount of air blown measured in liters. Values are then expressed as the percentage of FE1 values predicted for a 'normal' population. Predicted FEV1 values were computed and adjusted for age, height and gender according to Eigen et al. for subjects 4-5 years of age and to Quanjer et al. for subjects aged 6-11 years using American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.
The area under-the-effect curves for percent-predicted FEV1 were calculated according to the trapezoidal rule and were based on actual (not scheduled) measurement times.</description>

Time to maximum FEV1 is defined as the number of minutes required for the baseline FEV1 to increase to the highest FEV1 post dose during the 6 hour observation period.
Median time and confidence intervals obtained via separate Kaplan-Meier estimates for each study day.</description>

For this assessment, patients self-evaluate and record on the diary card the following asthma symptoms experienced during the day (i.e. last 12-14 hours): wheeze, shortness of breath, cough, tightness of chest. The worst of these symptoms were scored daily on a four-point scale:
0 = No symptoms occurred
1 = Symptom occurred but did not interfere with daily activity
2 = Symptom occurred but was sometimes annoying or interfered with daily activity

P-value, mean and confidence interval calculated from a 0 inflated mixed poisson regression model with fixed effect terms for treatment, week, treatment by week interaction, baseline as a covariate and a random term for subject. The null hypothesis is that the ratio equals 1. Estimated means are conditional upon the random effect, assume a random effect of 0 and a covariate value at the average.</groups_desc>
