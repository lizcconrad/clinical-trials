  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether eradication treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori followed by therapy with esomeprazole for a total of 8 weeks extends the
      time to relapse in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

      A relapse is defined by two consecutive symptom scores of the Eraflux questionnaire within 14
      days that are equal or above the critical value of 25.

      The secondary objectives are

        1. To compare the time to relapse in the two H. pylori positive study groups with the H.
           pylori negative control group

        2. To compare the pattern of inflammation and atrophy in the two H. pylori positive
           treatment groups with the naturally H. pylori negative control group at relapse.

        3. All the above objectives analyzed for the efficacy subset that is the per-protocol
           patients broken down by effective H. pylori-eradication.

      Secondary endpoints will be analyzed by the following parameters and their interactions:

        1. Treatment : Eradicated, Non-eradicated, Hp-negative control

        2. Esophagitis at study start: grades 0, A/B and C/D

        3. Gender

        4. Alcohol intake

        5. NSAID/ASA intake (for histological results)

        Inclusion criteria:

        For inclusion in the study the subject must fulfill all of the following criteria:

          1. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years.

          2. Chronic symptoms (&gt;8 weeks) suggestive for GERD, as defined in Table 2 with or without
             reflux esophagitis grade A-D (Los Angeles classification)

          3. Indication for endoscopy due to GERD symptoms is given

          4. Written informed consent

        Table 2: Lead GERD criteria

        For inclusion in the study, all of the following lead GERD criteria should hold:

          -  At least one of the symptoms heartburn or regurgitation.

          -  At least 8 weeks ongoing symptoms.

          -  At least 3 times a week.

          -  At least moderate intensity, corresponding to light impairment in daily life and
             occasional need for drugs.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study:

          1. Severe organic esophageal disease other than reflux esophagitis (e.g. carcinoma,
             esophageal stenosis).

          2. Gastric or duodenal ulcers

          3. Patients with visible Barrett's mucosa; no histological confirmation is required for
             exclusion

          4. History of previous esophageal or gastric surgery

          5. Alcohol or drug abuse

          6. Severe organic or psychiatric disease

          7. Pregnancy or lactation

          8. Women with child-bearing potential if no medically accepted contraceptive measures are
             used

          9. Contra-indication to amoxicillin, clarithromycin or esomeprazole (Nexium)

         10. Need for concomitant medication which could interfere with the investigational
             products (substrates of CYP3A4)

         11. Suspected or confirmed poor compliance

         12. Participation in a clinical study within 8 weeks prior to enrollment.
