  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how to help survivors of bone marrow transplant
      and stem cell transplant (BMT/SCT) with emotional distress. BMT/SCT has become a more common
      type of treatment for cancer or hematological disorder (blood disease). For this reason,
      there is concern that adjustment after treatment may be difficult for many persons. We have
      found that about 25% of BMT/SCT survivors still feel anxious and distressed about their
      illness and its treatment after at least one year following transplant. This study is one of
      the first to study the impact of counseling on BMT/SCT survivors. The study is being carried
      out at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Mount Sinai Medical Center, and Hackensack
      University Medical Center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of bone marrow and stem cell transplantation (BMT/SCT) in the treatment of cancer has
      increased five-fold over the last decade. Among the cancers treated with BMT/SCT are
      Hodgkin's Lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemias such as acute
      lymphoblastic (ALL), acute myelogenous (AML), chronic lymphocytic (CLL), and chronic
      myelogenous (CML). With the development of non-myeloablative transplants (either &quot;mini&quot; or
      reduced intensity transplants) for patients unable to tolerate standard BMT/SCT, the use of
      this procedure is expected to increase substantially over the next five years. BMT/SCT
      adversely affects almost every aspect of the patient's life (1;2). A standard (fully
      ablative) transplant involves conditioning with dose intensive chemotherapy, with or without
      total body irradiation.

      Although various medical regimens and supportive psychosocial services are used to reduce the
      intensity of these side effects, symptoms may persist. Moreover, the drugs used to control
      side effects often have aversive side effects of their own. Thus, patients must tolerate a
      protracted course of treatment that is highly aversive and invasive at a time when their
      lives are disrupted and they are fearful about their survival. A common complaint among
      survivors is that such problems go unaddressed, and these types of adjustment problems appear
      to become most intense in the first year post treatment, when physical functioning has
      stabilized and contact with the BMT/SCT clinical care team wanes (5;10).

    <description>CBT, we will interview you again after you have completed the 10 sessions. We call these follow-up interviews, and they include several phone calls and a questionnaire you would be asked to complete and then mail in. Each follow-up interview will take between 60 and 210 minutes. If you wish, these follow-up interviews can be done over different days. We will do the follow-up interviews three times; at approximately 4 months, 7 months, and 10 months after you complete the baseline interview.</description>

If you receive Usual Care you will be offered 10 sessions of CBT at no charge at the end of the study.</description>
