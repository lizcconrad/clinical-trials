      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical information is collected by chart review of &quot;case&quot; and &quot;control&quot; patients.

          -  A &quot;case A&quot; patient is defined as follows: One or more clinical cultures are positive
             for an ESBL producing bacteria and the organism is piperacillin/tazobactam resistant.

          -  A &quot;case B&quot; patient is defined as follows: One or more clinical cultures are positive
             for an ESBL producing bacteria and the organism is piperacillin/tazobactam
             susceptible.

          -  Additionally, 1 control patient in the hospital at the same time as the case patients
             will be randomly selected for each case and are not in either case group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &lt; 18 years of age
