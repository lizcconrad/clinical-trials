  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal adolescence requires a successful resolution of identity crisis, which results in the
      development of satisfying relationships, success in school/work pursuits, and achievement of
      personal goals. Adolescents, who do not resolve this crisis, are at high risk for problems in
      those areas of functioning. Transference Focused Psychotherapy for Adolescents (TFP-A) is a
      treatment that specifically addresses these issues, permitting adolescents to develop
      satisfying friendships, more appropriate interactions with authority, and achieve realistic
      life goals.

      This study will evaluate the application of TFP-A, (a empirically validated treatment for
      adults with identity disturbance), to adolescents exhibiting the same behavioral and identity
      pathology. Subjects will be females; ages 14-21, with behaviors associated with identity
      problems, interpersonal difficulties with teachers, parents and/or peers, and live with their
      families. These adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment cells, TFP-A or
      Treatment as Usual (TAU). Subjects in TFP-A will receive weekly individual therapy for six
      months. The TAU group will receive standard individual therapy in the Outpatient Department.
      Both will receive medication as necessary. All subjects will participate in initial, weekly,
      and bi-monthly assessments during the six-month treatment period, and participate in a
      naturalistic follow-up study for an additional six months.

      Hypothesis:

      Adolescents with identity problems as seen in interpersonal, school, and/or family
      difficulties in the Transference Focused Psychotherapy for Adolescents (TFP-A) group will
      reduce these problem behaviors and improve management of their feelings and moods compared to
      adolescents with identity problems in the treatment as usual control group (TAU).

    <description>Specific aspects of TFP-A involve the setting up of a treatment contract/collaboration between patient and therapist to deal with the likely threats both to the treatment and to the patient's well being that may occur in the course of the treatment. After the behavioral symptoms of identity pathology are contained through structure and limit setting, the psychological structure that is believed to be the core of identity pathology are analyzed. In particular, treatment would involve the family in setting up the contract parameters, provide a psychoeducational component to the family and patient, inclusion of school personnel as appropriate to reinforce contract parameters, place an emphasis on the technique of clarification to understand specific emotional states.</description>

    <description>The Control Group is treatment as usual in the outpatient clinic. Treatment in this arm will be carried out by therapists in the Outpatient Department. Treatment will be determined by the therapist(s) and carried out according to their particular orientation and their assessment of patient's needs. It is expected based on clinic data that the majority of patients will be seen at least one time per week.</description>
