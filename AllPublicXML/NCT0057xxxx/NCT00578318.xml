    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to better understand how African American families identify and
      treat emotional and behavioral concerns associated with depression in their adolescent youth.
      The goals of the study included (a) identifying factors associated with participation in
      psychiatric research and treatment and (b) developing an intervention to increase
      participation in psychiatric research and treatment.

      The aim of this study was to obtain an in-depth understanding of African Americans'
      perceptions of barriers to adolescent and family engagement in psychiatric treatment and
      research utilizing a mixed methods approach in two Phases. Phase I consisted of data
      collected via surveys, focus groups and individual interviews with African American adults
      and youth. The data generated in Phase I provided a foundation for the domains incorporated
      into manual development and therapist training procedures of the subsequent intervention
      phase of the project (Phase II).

      After the research team developed the depression treatment engagement intervention, the
      intervention was pilot tested in a sample of depressed African American youth and families
      (Phase II)
