  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human tooth pulp has many nerve fibers and is a common source of pain. This study
      examines nerve fibers within normal and painful samples and identifies changes that can
      contribute to the generation of pain.

    <textblock>
      The human tooth pulp is a rich source of pain fibers and is a common site of pathology that
      is often accompanied by spontaneous and stimulus-induced lingering pain. A common treatment
      modality includes the extraction of the offending tooth diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis.
      Extracted teeth represent an abundant source of normal and diseased human nociceptors and the
      evaluation of these tissues represents a powerful model to study human pain mechanisms since
      the character of pain, pain levels, and response to stimuli can be documented prior to
      extraction.

      The overall objective of this study is to correlate changes in the expression of Sodium
      Channels (NaCh) with clinical responses to hot and cold thermal stimuli, and the expression
      of the associated receptors/transducers responsible for receiving that stimulus in extracted
      teeth with severe and spontaneous pain. Teeth requiring extraction in the clinical setting
      will be used for this study.

      The research questions are: 1.) To evaluate quantitatively the overall NaCh and Nav 1.3, 1.6,
      1.7, 1.8 1.9 isoform expressions in nerves of normal teeth as compared to diseased teeth 2.)
      To evaluate quantitatively hot/cold VR1 and CMR1 receptor expression in nerves of normal
      teeth as compared to the nerves in the modality-specific pain groups of diseased teeth 3.) To
      investigate the ultrastructural localization of NaCh isoforms in different fiber types and at
      sites that may be involved in pain generation.
