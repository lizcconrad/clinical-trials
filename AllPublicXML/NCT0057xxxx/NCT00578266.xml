  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who have failed to respond to
      immunosuppressive therapy and lack an HLA identical family member, our objectives are to make
      an initial assessment of the safety and efficacy of allogenic stem cell transplantation from
      either a matched unrelated donor or a mismatched reacted donor using the conditioning regimen
      of Cytoxan, reduced total body irradiation (TBI) and Campath IH. The principle measures of
      safety and efficacy will be :

        1. Patient survival probability at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

        2. Incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), as well as incidence of acute GVHD and
           chronic GVHD within 6 months and 2 years.

        3. Engraftment at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years

      The objective of this trial is to make an initial assessment for this new treatment regimen
      and to show it is equal or superior to the current standard practice. With this initial
      assessment be hope to gain information suggesting further study of this regimen or
      discontinuation of this regimen before exposing large numbers of patients to this new
      treatment option. We also will gain experience with this new regimen giving insights as to
      possible modifications in dosing and monitoring and selection of patients for future
      treatment in case of positive results. For this initial study we plan to enroll up to 24
      patients.
