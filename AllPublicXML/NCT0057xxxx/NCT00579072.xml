  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if therapy with hormones (such as Lupron, Casodex,
      Zolodex or Degarelix) change a person's thinking abilities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To find out if this treatment changes things like memory, learning, or concentration. This
      study is being done to learn more about the effects of this treatment and to help men in the
      future who use the hormones Lupron, Casodex, Zolodex or Degarelix.

      If you choose to take part, you will be asked to do the following:

      Fill out questionnaires that ask about:

        -  Your age, eduction, race, and income

        -  Depression

        -  Stress

        -  Energy level

        -  Pain

        -  Memory

        -  Ability to perform daily tasks such as eating, dressing, and taking a shower

      Research staff will evaluate you on the following:

        -  Memory

        -  How you prefer to learn new information

        -  Copying designs such as rectangles, squares, and circles

        -  How quickly you think

        -  Your attention span

        -  How well you plan and organize shapes and colors into specific categories

    <description>Take part in this study because subject has prostate cancer and are over 64 years old. To run this study,need men from two groups. First, we need men who are about to start hormone treatment. Second, we need men who do not plan to use this treatment in the future. We will use this second group as a control group and compare this group to the men who are using this treatment.</description>

    <description>We will use a 6-month longitudinal design to assess the short-term cognitive effects of androgen ablation therapy. We will collect 6-month longitudinal data on 170 men with prostate cancer. All 170 men will be hormone naïve at the start of this study (Hormone Naïve Group). These 170 men will consist of two subgroups. The first subgroup will comprise 70 men with prostate cancer age 65 and older scheduled to start androgen ablation therapy. Their cognitive functioning will be assessed prior to starting androgen ablation therapy or within 21 days after initiation, (i.e. baseline) and then 6 months later (Androgen Ablation Subgroup).The second subgroup will serve as a control group, and consist of 100 men with prostate cancer age 65 and older who are at least 1-year post definitive localized treatment with no evidence of disease and no plan to start androgen ablation therapy (No Androgen Ablation Subgroup).</description>

    <description>To supplement the pilot data collected in Aim 1, Aim 2 we will utilize a group comparison design to assess the long-term cognitive effects of androgen ablation therapy. We will collect data on the cognitive functioning of 110 men with prostate cancer age 65 and older who have been on continuous androgen ablation therapy for 1-3 years (2-Year Androgen Ablation Group). These men will complete the study battery once (i.e., the neuropsychological battery, psychosocial questionnaires, and a functional status battery). We will compare the cognitive functioning of these 110 men in the 2-Year Androgen Ablation Group to the 170 men with prostate cancer who are hormone naïve (Hormone Naïve Group).</description>

Fifteen participants from the No Androgen Ablation Subgroup and 15 participants from the Comparison Androgen Ablation Subgroup will be recruited for this portion of the study. The fMRI will be scheduled either the same day as the neurocognitive assessment or within eight weeks of the neurocognitive testing. The fMRI will be performed only once at baseline.</description>
