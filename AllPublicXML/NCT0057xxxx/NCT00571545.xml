  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We proposed to examine the effect of an aerobic exercise intervention on depression in
      persons with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). We will compare persons with chronic brain injury
      who are assigned to receive the exercise intervention with those in the control group to
      determine the effect of exercise on levels of depression and specific symptoms related to
      depression including anxiety, pain, sleep, and cognition. In addition, the effect of exercise
      on activity, participation level, and quality of life will be examined.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. Participation in an aerobic exercise intervention will decrease the severity of
           depression in persons with chronic TBI.

        2. Participation in an aerobic exercise intervention will lead to improvements in negative
           symptoms associated with depression including anxiety, insomnia, pain, and impaired
           cognitive functioning.

        3. Participation in an aerobic exercise intervention will be related to improvements in
           activity and participation for patients with TBI.

        4. Participation in an aerobic exercise intervention will lead to improvements in
           perceptions of quality of life.
