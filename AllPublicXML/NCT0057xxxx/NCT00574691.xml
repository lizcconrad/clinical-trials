      Multi-center (up to 6 European sites), non-blinded, non-randomized, feasibility study with a
      2-month enrollment period and 30-day clinical follow-up.

      60 patients (plus up to 36 &quot;roll-in&quot; device training patients) undergoing diagnostic or
      interventional coronary or peripheral procedures utilizing a 7F arterial puncture in the
      common femoral artery. Patients are excluded if they have a previous target artery closure
      with any closure device, recent myocardial infarction or thrombolytic therapy, treatment with
      thrombin-specific anticoagulants or low molecular weight heparin, fluoroscopically visible
      calcium or atherosclerosis ≤ 1 cm of puncture site, or planned target site access ≤ 30 days.
