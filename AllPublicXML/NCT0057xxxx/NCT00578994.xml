      The purpose of this study is to collect information on complications and survivorship of
      patients implanted with the Oxford™ Meniscal Unicompartmental Knee System at multiple sites
      in the United States.

      Study Objective

      To provide a prospective 2-year post-operative evaluation of complications and 9-year
      long-term survivorship analysis of patients implanted with the Oxford™ Meniscal
      Unicompartmental Knee System at multiple sites in the United States.

      Study Design

      The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized post approval study.
      There are two phases to this study:

        1. A complications study where patients will be followed for at least 2 years to record all
           complications that may occur, and

        2. A survival study that will record at yearly intervals out to 9 years whether or not the
           device is still in place or if it has been removed for any reason.

      Phase 1 requires clinical follow-up (0-2 year) and patients will be evaluated at pre-defined
      intervals up to 2 years post-operative. Information gathered in phase 1 includes all adverse
      events and survival data.

      Phase 2 (3-9 year) only gathers survival data through patient directed mailing and/or phone
      call.

        A Multi-center study conducted in the United States of patients who meet the FDA approved
        indications for use. The Oxford Meniscal Unicompartmental Knee System is intended for use
        in individuals with osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis limited to the medial compartment
        of the knee and is intended to be implanted with bone cement.
