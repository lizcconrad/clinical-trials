    <textblock>
      This medication is used for procedural sedation and sedation for diagnostic imaging. The
      purpose of this study is to find out what happens to pentobarbital in the body after it is
      given to children who have had heart surgery.

      This clinical trial of pentobarbital admistered as a bolus dose for procedural or imaging
      seddation will determine the PK of the drug in neonates, infants,, and children who are
      postoperative from cardiac surgery. Pediatric patients hsopitalized in the CICU who would
      receive IV bolus doses of pentobarbital as standard of care are eligible.
