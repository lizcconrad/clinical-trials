  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to help us learn more about the roles of genes and cancers that run
      in families. Sometimes, we are born with genes that are changed or altered. Gene changes are
      called mutations. Mutations may be passed down from parent to child. Some mutations cause a
      high risk for cancer. There are two major genes for breast and ovarian cancer. These genes
      are called BRCA --for breast cancer. If you have a mutation in these genes special actions
      may be needed. For a person with a known mutation, we will suggest ways to screen for cancer
      or prevent it. Not everything is known about cancer genes and mutations. The cancer screening
      we suggest may not always be effective. The aim of this study is to explore these questions.
      If you agree we will stay in touch with you to follow your medical history. We will also ask
      you about your family.

      This will allow us to measure the cancer risks of known mutations. The study will also look
      for other cancer genes we do not know about. Whether or not you take part in this study, you
      may have gene testing. If you take part in this study and wish to know, we will tell your
      BRCA gene test results.

      The investigators may perform genetic testing on the blood or saliva sample in one of two
      ways: analysis for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes alone or as part of a panel of
      genes associated with breast cancer predisposition. New technologies are being employed for
      identification of patients with a susceptibility for developing breast cancer and thus
      analysis of multiple genes at one time may be offered to you. If this multi-gene testing
      applies to the patient, a question and answer sheet about this testing will be provided to
      them by their genetic counselor.

      Blood, Saliva, Buccal cell, Urine or Stool Tissue analysis and correlation of germline
      findings with somatic alterations within the tumor will be performed on a subset of
      individuals who have tumor tissue stored under protocol #06-107. Patients will be asked to
      fill out a baseline questionnaire on other medical, hormonal, and environmental risk factors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Families referred for genetic counseling consultation at Memorial Hospital

          -  Individuals self-referred or physician referred for genetic counseling due to a
             concern about increased risk for breast cancer, regardless of family history or ethnic
             origin.

          -  Individuals enrolled in MSK protocol 97-029 &quot;Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in
             Jewish Women Affected by Breast Cancer&quot; who wish to have full sequencing or who wish
             to have commercial testing in addition to testing done as part of that study.

          -  Individuals who present for genetic counseling consultation at Memorial Hospital after
             undergoing genetic testing at an outside institution.

          -  Member of a family with breast cancer who wishes to provide a DNA sample for research
             purposes

          -  Individuals enrolled on protocol 12-245 with germline variants in genes associated
             with risk for breast or ovarian cancer, or absent such variants in the presence of a
             family history or other phenotypic features of interest including but not limited to:
             triple negative breast cancer, early onset of disease, and/or synchronous or
             metachronous breast and ovarian cancer.
