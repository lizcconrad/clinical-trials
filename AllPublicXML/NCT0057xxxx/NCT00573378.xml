  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) who have
      achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) on imatinib (IM) or nilotinib (N) can then be
      treated with a combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and interferon-α2b
      (PEG-IFN-a2b, [IFN]) for 2 years, subsequently have their therapy discontinued, and then
      maintain a durable molecular response off all therapy. Relapse-free survival (RFS) rate 1
      year after discontinuation of the TKI and IFN will be the measurement of this objective.

    <description>Patients will receive pegylated interferon α-2b (Pegintron®) (PEG-IFN-α2b) 150 µg subcutaneously, once a week. Patients and/or caregivers identified by the patient will be taught how to perform subcutaneous injections of the PEG-IFN-α2b by trained nurses in the chemotherapy infusion center at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. Those patients who do not feel comfortable receiving the injections outside of the cancer center, or are deemed unreliable in administering injections per the training nurse, will return to the cancer center infusion room on a weekly basis to receive subsequent injections.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic
             myeloid leukemia in chronic phase by having met all of the following criteria at the
             time of their initial diagnosis:

          -  Cytogenetic confirmation of Philadelphia chromosome or variants of the t(9;22)
             translocations. Patients may have secondary chromosomal abnormalities in addition to
             the Philadelphia chromosome.

          -  Peripheral blood or bone marrow blast count &lt; 10%.

          -  Peripheral blood basophil count &lt; 20%.

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 x 109/L.

          -  If the peripheral blood counts are unavailable from the time of their original
             diagnosis, but there is no evidence of accelerated- or blast-phase disease from prior
             clinical or other medical records, then they will be allowed to participate.

          -  Patients must be eighteen years of age or older.

          -  Patients must be actively receiving treatment for their CML with a a tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor, either imatinib or nilotinib.

          -  Patients may be receiving imatinib mesylate. Patients must be on imatinib mesylate for
             a minimum of 2 years, and be on a stable dose for at least one consecutive year
             leading up to enrollment.

          -  Patients may be receiving nilotinib (Tasigna) as frontline therapy or as second line
             therapy if the reason for the switch from imatinib to nilotinib was intolerance to
             imatinib. Patients cannot have been switched from imatinib to nilotinib because of a
             concern or demonstration for resistance to frontline imatinib. Patients must be on
             nilotinib for a minimum of 2 years, and be on a stable does for at least one
             consecutive year leading up to enrollment.

          -  Patients must have an ongoing complete hematologic response (CHR) on a a TKI (imatinib
             or nilotinib), defined as follows:

          -  WBC ≤ 10 x 109/L.

          -  Platelet count &lt; 450,000 x 109/L.

          -  No blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood.

          -  No evidence of disease-related symptoms and extramedullary disease, including the
             liver and spleen.

          -  Patients must have a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) on a TKI (imatinib or
             nilotinib) for a minimum of 1 year leading up to enrollment. Complete cytogenetic
             response is defined as 0% Ph+ cells in metaphase, in the bone marrow and/or a negative
             peripheral blood FISH analysis for the Bcr-Abl gene fusion, and an ongoing CCyR must
             be confirmed by bone marrow aspirate cytogenetics and/or peripheral blood FISH for
             Bcr-Abl within 4 weeks of starting treatment.

          -  Patients may have a negative quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) for BCR-ABL at the time of
             enrollment, but if the qPCR is positive, patients cannot have greater than 1% bcr-ABl
             / Abl /ABL transcript, present in 2 consecutive qPCR analyses, performed at least 3
             months apart, in the 6 to 12 months leading up to enrollment.

          -  Patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1500/mm3 and/or a platelet count &lt;
             100,000/mm3.

          -  Patients with serum bilirubin, SGOT[AST], SGPT[ALT], or serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x the
             upper limit of normal (ULN).
