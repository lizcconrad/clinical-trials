      The purpose of this study is to determine the difference in response to bisphosphonate
      therapy in patients receiving excess glucocorticoids compared to patients with postmenopausal
      or male osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      postmenopausal women and osteoporotic men who are at high risk of fracture and in men and
      women with excess glucocorticoid administration.

    <textblock>
      Aminobisphosphonates are extensively used to prevent fractures in patients with osteoporosis
      (1-6). Treatment with these drugs leads to decreases in bone resorption and biochemical
      markers of bone turnover and progressive increases in bone mineral density (BMD). The
      increase in BMD in response to bisphosphonate therapy in glucocorticoid-treated patients is,
      however, less than half that measured in women and men with osteoporosis unrelated to
      glucocorticoid drugs even though the patients with osteoporosis are usually older. The goal
      of this objective is to determine the contribution of increased osteoclast survival to the
      diminished response to bisphosphonate therapy in patients receiving excess glucocorticoids
      compared to patients with osteoporosis.
