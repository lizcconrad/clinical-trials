      PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to learn more about multifocal
      lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia (MLT). MLT is a rare vascular disorder
      characterized by multiple congenital skin and visceral lesions, profound thrombocytopenia,
      and gastrointestinal bleeding. The skin lesions may appear red, brown or blue, often
      misdiagnosed as hemangiomas. The gastrointestinal tract, liver, and lungs are the most common
      internal organs involved. The severe thrombocytopenia (low platelets) is believed to be the
      result of platelet trapping within the skin and visceral vascular lesions. Severe and chronic
      gastrointestinal bleeding is common during infancy and early childhood. Although a relatively
      newly described entity, MLT was likely previously reported as hemangiomas, blue rubber bleb
      nevus syndrome, diffuse hemangiomatosis, Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, and hereditary
      hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The term cutaneovisceral angiomatosis with thrombocytopenia is
      also a term used for this same disease. This study is a longitudinal cohort study of MLT to
      collect detailed clinical data on the distribution of disease, disease severity, and
      complications. This data will be used to create diagnostic criteria and an evaluation
      protocol for infants with this disease

      After informed consent is obtained a detailed question will be mailed to participating
      patients and families. This questionnaire will also be available electronically through an
      educational website. Data collected will include photographs of skin lesions, video images of
      gastrointestinal lesions, demographic data, clinical information, therapeutic interventions,
      glass slides of tissue biopsies, and collection of DNA. Enrollment will be patient family
      driven and modeled after several successful registries of rare diseases.
