  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand how to apply cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
      (CMR) to women with small artery heart disease by looking at the CMRs of women without heart
      disease. The investigators will study 40 women with no heart disease to learn more about the
      usefulness of CMR.

      Women suffer more than men from this disorder of the small vessels compared to the large
      vessels. This results in delays in diagnosis, missed opportunities for treatment, and likely
      contributes to the increased death rate from heart disease in women compared to men. Current
      testing for small vessel disease is invasive and not performed routinely and women are often
      not initiated on appropriate lifesaving treatment. New imaging and noninvasive technology
      exists that may improve this situation. Imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging (CMR) can now show the inner layers of the heart where the small vessel abnormality
      and myocardial ischemia exist. These techniques, while promising, have not been tested to
      determine if they can be used to diagnose and treat the small vessel coronary heart disease
      condition. They also have not been studied extensively in women without heart disease.

      Gadolinium, the contrast agent that will be given Intravenously to all study participants
      during the cardiac MRI procedure, is contraindicated to patients with renal impairment. Even
      though it will only be given once to each of our patients, the investigators still wanted to
      establish the fact that these study participants have &quot;normal&quot; or good renal functioning by
      doing BUN and Creatinine blood tests prior to the administration of this contrast agent to
      their system. By adding these lab tests, the investigators will be more cautious to the
      well-being and safety of the study participants.

      The investigators will be recruiting women aged 35-65 years with no known heart disease or
      heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Participants will
      discuss the cardiac magnetic resonance procedure with a research doctor and if they agree,
      will fill out questionnaires related to their health, have blood draw and then undergo the
      CMR procedure. This can be completed in 1 or 2 visits. No follow up is needed.

      The women will be consented and enrolled. They will:

        1. fill out baseline demographic and health history questionnaires;

        2. have an exercise treadmill test (ETT) To rule out any underlying ischemic heart disease;

        3. undergo rest-stress CMR testing (up to 3 scans);

        4. peripheral arterial tonometry; and

        5. have blood drawn for hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),creatinine, and research
           protein quantitation with mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
           (ELISA) for sensitive quantitation of cardiovascular biomarkers.
