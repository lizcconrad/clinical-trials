  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the results of two CT scans of the chest performed
      within minutes of each other. We will compare several different measurements of lung cancer
      tumors. This study will help show whether we can get accurate results when we compare
      measurements on different CT scans. This information is important for patients with cancer,
      who often have more than one CT scan during their treatment.

      Standard criteria for tumor response assessment have used uni-dimensional or bi-dimensional
      measurements as a surrogate for volume determination. Modern CT scan techniques, in
      combination with algorithms developed at MSKCC, allow the calculation of tumor volume. This
      protocol is designed to evaluate the reproducibility of the calculated volume of pulmonary
      masses on separate CT scans obtained on the same day in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Patients with NSCLC undergoing non-contrast CT scan of the chest will have a
      second, non-contrast CT scan of the chest performed. Uni-dimensional, bi-dimensional, and
      volume measurements for the primary NSCLC lesion will be determined on both scans and the
      values compared.

    <description>Patients with NSCLC undergoing non-contrast CT scan of the chest will have a second, high resolution, non-contrast CT scan of the chest performed on the same day. The scans will be performed on the same CT scanner, generally within 30 minutes. Unidimensional, bi-dimensional, and volume measurements for the primary NSCLC lesion will be determined on both scans and the values compared. After completing the second scan, the patient will have completed participation in the protocol.</description>
