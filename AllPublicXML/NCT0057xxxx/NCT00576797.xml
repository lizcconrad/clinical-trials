  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human vagina contains a large number of normal bacteria. These bacteria are important
      because provide protection against other bacteria that may cause disease. Several important
      diseases are linked to abnormal bacteria in the vagina. Women with abnormal bacteria in the
      vagina are more likely to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that
      causes AIDS. Also women with unusual bacteria in their vagina are more likely to deliver a
      premature baby when they are pregnant. For these reasons, it is important to have a better
      understanding of the normal bacteria of the vagina.Some bacteria found in the vagina can not
      be grown in a laboratory. Our preliminary studies indicate a very wide variety of bacteria in
      the vagina. Also we have shown there are some differences between African American and
      Caucasian women. The goal of our study is to study the bacteria in the vagina of normal women
      using the latest technology. This technology involves study the bacterial DNA present in the
      normal microbes in the vagina

      The normal vaginal bacteria in healthy women of reproductive age plays a key role in
      preventing successful colonization by &quot;undesirable&quot; organisms including those responsible for
      bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, sexually transmitted diseases and urinary tract
      infections. Our long-term goal is to develop an accurate understanding of the vagina
      microbial ecosystem in normal, healthy women as an essential prerequisite for comprehending
      how the normal microflora reduces the risk of acquiring these common vaginal infections.

      Four hundred women will be recruited such that there will be equal distribution among four
      self-declared ethnic groups (Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic and Asian). These
      groupings were selected based on the original Forney study that identified different
      distributions supergroups of dominant vaginal microflora between African-American and
      Caucasian women.

      The experimental focus of this proposal is to use a combination of culture-independent
      methods (T-RFLP of 16S rRNA, 16SrRNA and recA genes sequence analysis and community genomics)
      to develop tools aimed at advancing our understanding of the composition and role of
      individual organisms and communities that make up the ecosystems of human vaginas . The
      specific aims are designed to develop genomic tools for the research and clinical scientific
      community to study the ecology of the human vaginal microflora
