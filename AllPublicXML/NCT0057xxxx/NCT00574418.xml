  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A preliminary study to determine the efficacy of using energy specific far infrared (FIR)
      radiation for the treatment of uterine fibroids.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are the most common neoplasms of the female pelvis. These benign tumors are
      generally oval in shape and often highly vascular. On MR imaging exams, uterine fibroids are
      easily identifiable. They occur in 20-25% of women of reproductive age and can cause a
      variety of problems generally described as either bleeding or mass effects from the fibroid.

      We are postulating that energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the uterus will shrink
      the benign tumors.
