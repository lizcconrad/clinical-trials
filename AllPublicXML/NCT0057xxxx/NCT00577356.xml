      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and bad, the combination of
      docetaxel with CG1940/CG8711 (immunotherapy drugs) have on destroying prostate cancer before
      removal the prostate (prostatectomy).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have clinical stage 1-3 disease and no radiographic evidence of
             metastatic disease

          -  Nomogram Prediction: Patients must have a Kattan nomogram predicted probability of
             being free from biochemical progression at 5 years after surgery of &lt;60%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent or prior treatment with radiation, cytotoxic or biologic therapy for
             prostate cancer, prior hormonal therapy (except finasteride or dutasteride for
             obstructive voiding symptoms)

          -  Male patients unwilling to use effective means of contraception are excluded.
             Contraception should be continued for 3 months after treatment.

          -  Prior malignancy will not exclude the patient. (Patients can not have active cancer or
             be undergoing active treatment). The Principal Investigator will make final decision
             regarding eligibility since the end point is pathological complete response.
