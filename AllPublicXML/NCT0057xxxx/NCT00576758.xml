  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of weekly intravenous obinutuzumab [GA101
      (RO5072759)] monotherapy, in patients with relapsed CD20+ indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either GA101 or rituximab, given as four weekly
      infusions. At the conclusion of the initial trial patients may be eligible to continue
      therapy up to 24 months. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3- 24 months, and the
      target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <description>Overall response was defined as Complete Response (CR), Complete Response/Unconfirmed (CRu) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by investigator at end of induction treatment. Computed tomography imaging was used for the primary assessment of tumor response per 1999 criteria by Cheson.
CR was defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disease-related symptoms and normalization of biochemical abnormalities of NHL.
CRu was CR plus one or more of the following: A residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameter (tumors)(SPD) and/or indeterminate bone marrow.
PR was defined as 50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD. No new sites of disease.</description>

    <description>Computed tomography imaging was used for the primary assessment of tumor response per 1999 criteria by Cheson. CR is defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disease-related symptoms and normalization of biochemical abnormalities of NHL. All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size. The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT scan, must have regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical examination. Any macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should no longer be present. Other organs considered to be enlarged before therapy due to involvement by lymphoma, such as liver and kidneys, must have decreased in size. If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must be cleared on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy of the same site.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Overall Response At the End of Induction Period</title>
        <description>Overall response was defined as Complete Response (CR), Complete Response/Unconfirmed (CRu) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by investigator at end of induction treatment. Computed tomography imaging was used for the primary assessment of tumor response per 1999 criteria by Cheson.
CR was defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disease-related symptoms and normalization of biochemical abnormalities of NHL.
CRu was CR plus one or more of the following: A residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameter (tumors)(SPD) and/or indeterminate bone marrow.
PR was defined as 50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD. No new sites of disease.</description>

          <description>Overall response was defined as Complete Response (CR), Complete Response/Unconfirmed (CRu) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by investigator at end of induction treatment. Computed tomography imaging was used for the primary assessment of tumor response per 1999 criteria by Cheson.
CR was defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disease-related symptoms and normalization of biochemical abnormalities of NHL.
CRu was CR plus one or more of the following: A residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameter (tumors)(SPD) and/or indeterminate bone marrow.
PR was defined as 50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD. No new sites of disease.</description>

        <description>Computed tomography imaging was used for the primary assessment of tumor response per 1999 criteria by Cheson. CR is defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disease-related symptoms and normalization of biochemical abnormalities of NHL. All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size. The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT scan, must have regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical examination. Any macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should no longer be present. Other organs considered to be enlarged before therapy due to involvement by lymphoma, such as liver and kidneys, must have decreased in size. If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must be cleared on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy of the same site.</description>

        <description>Overall response was defined as Complete Response (CR), Complete Response/Unconfirmed (CRu) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by investigators during study treatment (induction or extended treatment phase). Computed tomography imaging was used for the primary assessment of tumor response per 1999 criteria by Cheson.
CR was defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disease-related symptoms and normalization of biochemical abnormalities of NHL.
CRu was CR plus one or more of the following: A residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameter (tumors)(SPD) and/or indeterminate bone marrow.
PR was defined as 50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD. No new sites of disease.</description>

          <title>Event Free Survival</title>
          <description>Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time between date of randomization and the date of disease progression/relapse, death, or start of a new anti-leukemic therapy.
Progression was defined as a ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node and/or the appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy.
Relapse was defined as the appearance of any new lesion or increase by ≥ 50% in the size of previously involved sites and/or a ≥ 50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node greater than 1 cm in its short axis or in the SPD of more than one node.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at the time of diagnosis. If no EFS event occurred, EFS was censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. If no tumor assessment is available patient was censored at the date of the first study drug administration.</population>

B-cell recovery was defined as the time point when the CD-19 values return to ≥ 50% of baseline levels. The number of participants with B-cell recovery from End of Induction (treatment) Phase to 6 months of Follow-up is reported in two categories: Recovery with Progressive Disease (PD) or Recovery without PD. PD required one of the following: 50 % increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes, Appearance of new palpable lymph nodes, 50 % increase in the longest diameter of any previous site of lymphadenopathy, 50 % increase in the enlargement of the liver and/or spleen or Transformation to a more aggressive histology.</description>

          <description>Blood was sent to a central laboratory for the evaluation of cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) by flow cytometry. B-cell recovery was defined as the time point when the CD-19 values return to ≥ 50% of baseline levels. The number of participants with B-cell recovery from End of Induction (treatment) Phase to 6 months of Follow-up is reported in two categories: Recovery with Progressive Disease (PD) or Recovery without PD. PD required one of the following: 50 % increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes, Appearance of new palpable lymph nodes, 50 % increase in the longest diameter of any previous site of lymphadenopathy, 50 % increase in the enlargement of the liver and/or spleen or Transformation to a more aggressive histology.</description>
