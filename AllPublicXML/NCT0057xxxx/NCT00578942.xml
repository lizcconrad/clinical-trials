  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic transplantation is used to treat many malignant and non-malignant diseases, though
      the potential toxicities of the procedure remain high. We and others have shown that a less
      toxic preparative regimen allows reliable allogeneic engraftment for allogeneic
      transplantation.

      The primary purpose of this treatment trial is to follow subjects undergoing allogeneic
      transplantation for long term outcomes. The regimen used has been tested in our prior phase I
      / II trial which has completed accrual. The issues of engraftment and rate of graft versus
      host disease have been answered and our success has led to this regimen being a standard
      approach for less toxic allogeneic therapy.

      Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may cure or ameliorate illnesses of many types;
      however the toxicity of the procedure limits its broad applicability. Hematologic
      malignancies of all types have shown responses. Those with marrow failure, such as aplasia,
      and hemoglobinopathies have further shown responses in multiple trials as well. Even patients
      with certain solid tumors, such as breast, renal cell, and melanoma have shown partial or
      complete responses to allogeneic therapy. The limiting effect of the historical methods of
      aggressive induction for allogeneic therapy were extremely toxic, requiring limiting those
      offered allogeneic therapy to the healthiest of the ill patients. Work over the last decade
      has shown that less toxic agents targeting the immune system effectively allowed engraftment
      with less effects on the patient's liver, lungs, and other vital organs. We and others have
      completed multiple trials showing the effective use of these less toxic, non-myeloablative,
      regimens for allogeneic therapy. Trials with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide at standard
      doses (patients are not ablated and recover blood counts in 2 weeks) allow for 80% of
      patients to engraft donor cells. Some groups have added low doses of radiation to this
      combination, with 80-100% allogeneic engraftment. The lessened toxicity of this approach has
      been confirmed in multiple studies, including our own data with the specific schema in this
      treatment plan reviewed below. Phase I results with this combination: Our group has combined
      the above combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with the antibody CAMPATH 1H. This
      antibody is given to the patient to purge the immune system and prevent rejection. It also
      purges the T cells in the donated stem cells to minimize graft versus host disease (GVHD).
      This approach has been proven successful in multiple trials using standard more toxic
      ablative procedures. Our approach over the last 3 years has been very successful using this
      antibody with the less toxic non-myeloablative procedure and our trials have completed. We
      have presented our preliminary results, with data on long term follow up for outcomes being
      collected. We have shown that 100% of patients with a malignancy or marrow failure treated
      with this regimen in our early phase trial engrafted donor cells. There was only an 8% severe
      GVHD risk, though the risk for infection remains high with a risk of fungal and viral
      infection about 5% each. Despite working with older, more infirmed patients, only 3/40
      patients died within the first 100 days from therapy. Similar approaches on matched unrelated
      donors have been reported by other groups as well. As the phase I feasibility trial is
      complete and the outcomes encouraging, this protocol will follow the same general treatment
      plan and allow further information to be gained for long term follow up of subjects treated
      with this approach.

    <description>Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was graded according to the consensus criteria and NCI common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v2.0 or 3.0 was used for all other toxicities. Recognizing that acute GVHD pathology in the nonablative and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) setting may occur late, we tabulated skin, gut and liver toxicity consistent with acute GVHD (aGVHD) at anytime in the year following the infusion as aGVHD. Toxicities were formally recorded for all patients twice weekly for the first 100 days, at each follow up visit, and as needed intercurrently.</description>

    <description>Response Assessment included physical exam and evaluation of peripheral blood and bone marrow. There's no widely accepted criteria for response other than complete response (CR).
CR for malignant hematologic diseases is met if all the following are met for &gt;/= 1 month:
absence of pathologic lymphadenopathy by physical and radiographic exam
absence of constitutional symptoms due to disease
Polymorphonuclear leukocyte count &gt; 1,500/uL; platelet count &gt;50,000/uL; and hemoglobin &gt;10.0 g/dL
bone marrow aspirate/biopsy done after (a) through (c) have been met, &gt;/= 30% cellularity and an absence of abnormal lymphoid nodules or cells by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, etc.
molecular markers of disease must be negative by polymerase chain reaction, Fluorescence in situ hybridization, cytogenetics etc.
CR for solid tumors requires complete resolution of disease on physical exam and radiographs. CR for marrow failure is normal white cell, platelet and hematocrit values.</description>

          -  Subjects must be &gt;/=17 years of age

          -  Subjects must also have a resting multigated acquisition (MUGA) and/or ECHO and
             pulmonary function test (PFT) with diffusion capacity of lung (DLCO) performed before
             transplant and found to be acceptable according to the treating institution's
             guidelines. The required minimum standards include MUGA and/or ECHO showing an
             ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and PFTs showing DLCO of 40%. Those with an EF 40-50%,
             undergo cardiac evaluation and consultation. Also, those with DLCO 40-50%, undergo
             pulmonary evaluation and consultation.

          -  Specific populations for each disease category:

        A) Hematologic malignancies Those with high risk or relapsed hematologic malignancy
        (including myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas, myeloma or myelomatous like
        diseases, myeloproliferative disease, myelodysplasia). Those with good risk disease (first
        remission acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv 16 M4 Eos, M3 AML with t(15;17); or t(8;21)
        in first remission are not eligible).

             aplastic anemia (idiopathic or secondary) according to the accepted 'Camitta criteria'
             would be candidates.

Recognizing that acute GVHD pathology in the nonablative and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) setting may occur late, we tabulated skin, gut and liver toxicity consistent with acute GVHD (aGVHD) at anytime in the year following the infusion as aGVHD.

Preparative regimen: Begins on day -5 and consist of 4 days of daily fludarabine at 30 mg/m2/d infused over 30 minutes, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/d infused over 1 hour, 5 days of Campath-1H at 20 mg/d in 250 ml of D5 normal saline or normal saline infused over 3 hours.

absence of constitutional symptoms due to disease
Polymorphonuclear leukocyte count &gt; 1,500/uL; platelet count &gt;50,000/uL; and hemoglobin &gt;10.0 g/dL
bone marrow aspirate/biopsy done after (a) through (c) have been met, &gt;/= 30% cellularity and an absence of abnormal lymphoid nodules or cells by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, etc.
molecular markers of disease must be negative by polymerase chain reaction, Fluorescence in situ hybridization, cytogenetics etc.
CR for solid tumors requires complete resolution of disease on physical exam and radiographs. CR for marrow failure is normal white cell, platelet and hematocrit values.</description>
