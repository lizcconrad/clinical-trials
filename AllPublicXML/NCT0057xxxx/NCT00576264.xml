  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the genotype (genetic composition) and
      phenotype (physical appearance) of cells derived from the abdominal cavity to determine
      whether stem cells are present.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the presence and characterization of stem cells in
      human peritoneal cavity. Peritoneal lavage fluid from patients who undergo elective open
      abdomen will be collected for this purpose. Peritoneal lavage is normally a routine part of
      abdominal surgical procedure and usually is discarded after surgery. The patient will undergo
      surgical procedure as usual and there will be no added procedures during surgery.

      This study will collect and analyze peritoneal fluid for the existence and characteristics of
      stem cells from 15 patients undergoing scheduled elective intra-abdominal surgery by
      designated surgeons at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The types of abdominal surgery could be
      open abdominal surgery or laparoscopic surgery. Peritoneal washing is routinely done in
      abdominal surgeries. We will collect these fluids to analyze whether stem cells exist in
      human peritoneal cavity. The fluids will be collected in a sterile fashion. The collected
      fluid will be further processed in the laboratory for the purpose of the study.

      Medical record review will be conducted. Information collected will include age, gender, past
      and current medical history, current indication for intra-abdominal surgery, substance
      exposure history, medication history which will be obtained from review of patients' medical
      records. The information will be maintained using coded entry and there will be no link
      between patient identifiers to the study codes.
