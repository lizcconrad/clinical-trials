  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide physicians with additional information not available
      with standard imaging methods for breast disease.

      As part of the MRI examination ordered by your physician, a new method of analyzing the
      images or pictures will be used. This new method is called spectroscopy and is used routinely
      on other parts of the body such as the prostate and brain. Pictures produced with this
      sequence may look slightly different than the regular MRI pictures. Using spectroscopy data,
      it may be possible to distinguish benign conditions of the breast from malignant tumors and
      provide more precise information than can be obtained with regular MRI.

      Our aim is to perform MR Spectroscopy (MRS) on 150 evaluable patients at the end of their
      routine breast MRI examination using a software package from General Electric Medical Systems
      Milwaukee, WI). This will add time to the routine examination but will not involve additional
      injections of contrast. We will analyze the spectroscopic data to determine if benign lesions
      can be reliably differentiated from malignant ones.

    <description>Conventional images will be taken with standard pulse sequences. These images will be used for the diagnostic examination for which the patient will have been scheduled. Following the diagnostic study, a pulse sequence designed to obtain spectroscopy data will be used.This will be used on the existing magnets 1.5T and 3T. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has 1.5T and 3T magnets. The patient will have only one injection of contrast (gadolinium-DTPA) for the initial diagnostic study. No additional contrast will be administered. The additional sequence should take about 10 minutes, depending on breast size.</description>
