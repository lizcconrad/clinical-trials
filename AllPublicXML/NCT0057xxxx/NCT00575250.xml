      We wish to investigate whether a weekly, 2½ hour group-based osteoporosis education
      intervention (the Osteoporosis Prevention and Self-Management Course), is different to one
      session course (1x 2½ hours) on osteoporosis knowledge, confidence to eat calcium-containing
      foods, confidence to exercise, and amount of exercise undertaken after three and nine months
      of follow-up in people aged over 50 years who have already had a bone fracture.

      Instruments used to determine change after 3 and 9 months:

      Osteoporosis knowledge: Osteoporosis Knowledge Assessment Test (Winzenberg et al. BMC
      Musculoskelet Disord 2003) Calcium intake: Food frequency questionnaire (Angus et al. J Am
      Diet Assoc 1989) Calcium and exercise self-efficacy: Osteoporosis Self-Efficacy Scale (Horan
      et al Res Nurs Health 1998) Physical activity: CHAMPS II (Stewart et al. J Gerontol A Biol
      Sci Med Sci 2001)
