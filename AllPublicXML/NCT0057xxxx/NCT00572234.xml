    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine dependence is a significant drug use disorder in the Midwest. While a number
      of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments have been studied, no specific treatments for
      methamphetamine have been identified. This study is a collaborative pre-clinical and clinical
      partnership examining bupropion in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 40% of adults seeking substance use disorders (SUD) treatment in Nebraska report
      methamphetamine is their drug of choice. In preliminary studies examining bupropion in
      methamphetamine use, it was well tolerated, reduced craving for methamphetamine and reduced
      methamphetamine related euphoria. Investigators at the University of Nebraska Medical Center
      and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln have initiated studies examining bupropion in animals
      and humans as a potential intervention in addictive disorders. Pre-clinical studies in the
      Co-Investigator's laboratory were the first to demonstrate the potential utility of bupropion
      as a pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine use disorders (MUD) while the Principal Investigator
      studied bupropion as a smoking cessation aid in alcoholics.

      The primary goal of this study is to establish an interdisciplinary and translational
      collaboration to test bupropion in persons in treatment for methamphetamine dependence and to
      inform pre-clinical studies so as to enhance their practical applicability to clinical
      settings. The pilot clinical study will examine the treatment effect and safety of a 12 week
      course of bupropion in persons with methamphetamine use disorder. Concurrently, we will
      examine the efficacy of bupropion on methamphetamine self-administration in animal models
      which better simulates clinical approaches.
