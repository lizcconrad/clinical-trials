    <textblock>
      We are doing this study to see if using an over the counter mild laxative, SennaS, there is a
      difference in time required to have a bowel movement in women who are having surgery for
      prolapse (when your uterus and/or vagina drop after childbirth or with age) and/or
      incontinence (when you leak urine or stool without your control) as compared to a sugar pill
      or placebo.

    <textblock>
      Right now, doctors use mild laxatives and stool softeners to help you have a bowel movement
      earlier and with less pain after surgery. Sometimes if the stool softener or mild laxatives
      do not work, you may need to use stronger laxatives or enemas. We want to see if specifically
      using SennaS is better for having a bowel movement soon after surgery and with less pain.
      SennaS is FDA approved for constipation. It has a stool softener and a mild laxative and has
      been shown to be safe and effective for treating constipation.

    <description>Senna+Docusate: dose will be 8.6 mg senna concentrate with 50 mg docusate. The participants will take the medication as follows: 1. Drink 4-6 glasses of fluid a day for the first two weeks after surgery 2. Take 2 SennaS tabs at bedtime the first night home from the hospital 3. If no bowel movement that next morning, take 2 tabs after breakfast. 4. If no bowel movement by evening, take 3 tabs at bedtime 5. If no bowel movement that next morning, take 3 tabs after breakfast 6. Once you do have a bowel movement, use the regimen described in the step two steps prior to the last one you used as your daily regimen. So, if you had a BM the morning after 3 tabs at bedtime, use steps 2 &amp; 3 (2 tabs at night and in the morning) until the first-postoperative visit.</description>
