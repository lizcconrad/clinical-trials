  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether valproate is effective in the treatment of
      benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms in subjects receiving maintenance treatment for opiate
      dependence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Finland, 90% of subjects with opioid dependence are dependent on benzodiazepines too.
      Concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines has increasingly caused deaths.

      Benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment usually comprises gradual drug discontinuation. In one
      study, valproate was shown to improve benzodiazepine discontinuation success in chronic
      benzodiazepine users. In the present study, the effectiveness of gradual benzodiazepine
      discontinuation combined with valproate treatment and carried out in an inpatient setting is
      compared with gradual discontinuation without pharmacological augmentation.
