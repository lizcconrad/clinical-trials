  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on women undergoing termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies (TOPFA).
      Psychological consequences of such terminations may be even greater than those associated
      with spontaneous losses of pregnancy because of shame and guilt which can result in social
      isolation. Currently, there is little support for women after they have left hospital. In
      this study, 50 TOPFA women will be randomly assigned to an intervention group and 50 to a
      control group. By completing four questionnaires at the time of induction of labour, total
      sample will be assessed for depression, stress and &quot;hardiness&quot;; they will be reassessed at 3,
      6, and 12 months. Total sample will be interviewed by phone at 6 and 12 months. We hope to
      determine whether a telephone-based intervention (a biweekly supportive call) can decrease
      the emotional distress experienced by women undergoing termination of pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that: 1)women in the intervention group will show lower rates of depression
      and stress and a significant increase in hardiness over time at 6 and 12 months
      post-termination compared with the control group; 2) women who score low on hardiness
      initially will experience more psychological distress at 6 and 12 months than subjects who
      score higher initially, irrespective of group; 3) women who have anxious/avoidant attachment
      styles will not show an improvement in psychological distress over time, irrespective of
      group.
