    <description>A cancer care facility or 'agency' is the study's unit of analysis. Data about participating agencies will be collected by electronic survey. Agencies will be identified using the NYSDOH's existing mailing list of care facilities located in the five boroughs of New York City, referral databases and resource guides created by the American Cancer Society (ACS), the New York Hospital Directory</description>

        We assume that the collective network of cancer care and support services can be
        represented with data from no more than 300 New York City agencies, across all five
        boroughs. Theseagencies would include hospitals, clinical diagnostic centers, and
        community-based organizations.

          -  To be eligible to participate in the study, an agency must:

               1. Be a current provider of either:

                    -  General health services (GHS), such as primary care, health education and
                       wellness, mental health services, home health care, palliative care, or
                       cancer screening and diagnosis;

                    -  Cancer-specific medical treatments (CMT), such as cancer surgery, radiation,
                       chemotherapy, hormonal therapy; experimental therapies; cancer pain and
                       symptom management; rehabilitation services; post-treatment monitoring and
                       surveillance; or prophylactic treatments, such as chemoprevention; or

                    -  Any type of specialized 'post-cancer' or 'after-cancer' medical care or
                       support services (SMC) (i.e., psychotherapeutic, relationship and family,
                       psycho-educational,wellness and quality of life)

               2. Be located within the five boroughs of New York City

               3. Have been serving cancer patients for 12 months or longer, and

               4. Be willing and able to identify an English-speaking representative, 21 years of
                  age or older as its designated key informant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will limit this study to provider agencies such as hospitals, diagnostic centers,
             clinics, health and human service agencies, and grassroots community organizations and
             public service settings that offer programs for cancer survivors. Independent
             practitioners or private practice settings will not be surveyed. Our survey questions
             are intended for major health services organizations and are not appropriate for
             private practices settings.

        We will use our screening questionnaire to determine where or not a given agency should be
        included or excluded from the study AGENCY SCREENER.
