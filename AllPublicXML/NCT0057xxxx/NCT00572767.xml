      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of Dextro-amphetamin added to physiotherapy on
      motor recovery in patients after stroke. The study is a double-blinded placebo-controlled
      randomised controlled trial.

      Patients after a first-ever ischemic stroke will receive Dexamphetamine (10mg) twice per week
      for a duration of five weeks after a baseline phase of two weeks.

      The outcome measure focuses on motor recovery and will be assessed:

        -  one and two weeks before study intervention (baseline phase)

        -  five times during the study intervention

        -  one week after study intervention (follow-up)

        -  once after six and twelve months after start of the study intervention (follow-up).

The treatment of the control group will be the same as for the experimental group except the content of the drug capsule.</description>
