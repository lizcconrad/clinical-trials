    <textblock>
      This study will examine the course of patients with progressive rheumatoid arthritis
      associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) treated with rituximab for safety and
      progression-free survival at 48 weeks. Safety of rituximab therapy in this disease will be
      assessed through patient history, physical exams and laboratory parameters.

        -  Twelve male/or female patient with RA-associated lung disease (6 of each nonspecific
           interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) histological
           subtype) will be enrolled

        -  The study involves 12 visits over 48 weeks

        -  Rituximab will be administered intravenously at Day 1 and Day 15 with repeat dosing at
           six months.

    <measure>Change in Lung Fibrosis Score as Observed on High Resolution Computerized Tomography (HRCT) Scans, From Baseline to 48 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three serial HRCT scans of each patient were scored independently and simultaneously by two core radiologists, who were blinded to the sequence in which three scans were obtained (at screening, 24 and 48 weeks). The HRCT scoring sheet scored different domains of abnormality such as, linear opacities, consolidation, ground-glass density, etc. Radiographers reported composite impression based on scoring according to worsening, no worsening or improvement of relevant domains.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of RA Disease Activity Scores as Measured by the DAS28 Score at Baseline and 48 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of RA disease activity calculated using variables such as swollen joint count, the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and patient reported assessment of health.
Using this data, the DAS28 calculation provides a number on a scale from 0-10 indicating the current activity of a patient's RA. A DAS28 score above 5.1 means high disease activity whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Remission is achieved by a DAS28 score lower than 2.6.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Change in Health Associated Quality of Life From Baseline to 48 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage change from baseline to week 48 in a participant's perception of the impact of health on his or her quality of life was collected on the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The HAQ measures a person's ability to function with arthritis. The questionnaire is divided into 8 categories (Dressing and Grooming, Arising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip and Activities) which include several questions for each category. The category score is determined by the highest score of the set of questions for each category. The disability score is determined by adding the scores for all categories and dividing by 8. The disability scale ranges from 0 (best - without any difficulty) to 3 (worst - unable to do much).</description>

        <title>Assessment of RA Disease Activity Scores as Measured by the DAS28 Score at Baseline and 48 Weeks</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of RA disease activity calculated using variables such as swollen joint count, the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and patient reported assessment of health.
Using this data, the DAS28 calculation provides a number on a scale from 0-10 indicating the current activity of a patient's RA. A DAS28 score above 5.1 means high disease activity whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Remission is achieved by a DAS28 score lower than 2.6.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Change in Health Associated Quality of Life From Baseline to 48 Weeks</title>
        <description>The percentage change from baseline to week 48 in a participant's perception of the impact of health on his or her quality of life was collected on the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The HAQ measures a person's ability to function with arthritis. The questionnaire is divided into 8 categories (Dressing and Grooming, Arising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip and Activities) which include several questions for each category. The category score is determined by the highest score of the set of questions for each category. The disability score is determined by adding the scores for all categories and dividing by 8. The disability scale ranges from 0 (best - without any difficulty) to 3 (worst - unable to do much).</description>
