    <description>The subjects will continue the treatment with HOE 901 in the same way as they have done in the previous study. Based on the investigator's assessment and the approved SPC in Belgium/Luxembourg, the dosage can be adjusted individually. HOE 901 is to be injected once daily. HOE 901 must not be mixed with any other insulin, including regular human insulin or fast-acting insulin analogues.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects treated with HOE901 and who, in the judgement of the investigator, have

          -  Subjects treated with HOE 901 in a previous clinical study with HOE 901 for whom a
             change of basal insulin would destabilise glucose metabolism.

          -  Subjects who are likely to comply with the investigator's instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of an uncooperative attitude.
