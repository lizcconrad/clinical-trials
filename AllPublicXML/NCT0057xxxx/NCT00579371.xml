      We hypothesize that the following improvements to islet transplantation will increase the
      islet mass successfully isolated and allow for engraftment from a single pancreas. The
      improvements are:

        -  Using Two-Layer method preservation to improve pancreas quality before islet isolation

        -  Maintaining isolated islets in culture before transplantation

        -  Using a steroid-free immunosuppression regimen

        -  Transplanting the best combination of donor and recipient possible after HLA screening
           and final crossmatching

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Group 1: Diagnosis of Type-1 diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years with at least one
             of the following complications:

               -  Metabolic lability/instability (two or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia) or
                  two or more hospital visits for diabetic ketoacidosis during the previous year

               -  Progression of secondary complications of diabetes as determined by The Nebraska
                  Medical Center/University of Nebraska Medical Center staff endocrinologists

          -  Group 2: Diagnosis of Type-1 diabetes with successful renal transplant on
             steroid-free, FK506/rapamycin-based immunosuppression

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe co-existing cardiac disease

          -  Active alcohol or substance abuse, including cigarette smoking

          -  Psychiatric disorder making the subject not a suitable candidate for transplantation

          -  History of medical non-compliance

          -  Active infection, including hepatitis C and B, HIV, and tuberculosis (or suspected
             tuberculosis)

          -  Any history of malignancy except squamous or basal cell skin cancer

          -  BMI &gt;28 kg/meter-squared, or body weight &gt;80kg at screening visit, or &gt;85kg on the day
             of transplantation (due to the difficulty of obtaining a sufficiently large islet mass
             to adequately treat either large patients or those whose obesity elevates their
             insulin needs)

          -  Positive C-peptide response to intravenous glucose tolerance test and Mixed Meal
             glucose tolerance test: any C-peptide &gt;0.3 ng/mL post infusion

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Age less than 19 or greater than 70 years

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 meter-squared for Group 1 and creatinine
             clearance &lt;40 mL/min/1.73 meter-squared for Group 2 (those subjects currently on
             immunosuppression due to previous kidney transplant)

          -  Macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion rate &gt;300 mg/24h) for Group 1 and
             macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion rate &gt;600mg/24h) for Group 2

          -  Baseline Hb &lt;10 gm/dL

          -  Baseline liver function tests outside of normal range

          -  Presence of gallstones or hemangioma in liver on baseline ultrasound exam

          -  Positive pregnancy test, intention of future pregnancy, or presently breast-feeding

          -  Evidence of sensitization on PRA

          -  Insulin requirement &gt;0.7 IU/kg/day or HbA1c &gt;15%

          -  Hyperlipidemia

          -  Under treatment for a medical condition requiring chronic use of steroids

          -  Use of Coumadin or other anticoagulant therapy (except aspirin) or PT-INR&gt;1.5

          -  Diagnosis of Addison's disease

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Group 2 Subjects:

          -  Any history of organ transplantation other than kidney or pancreas

          -  Any previous graft lost to rejection

          -  Any history of early, multiple, or vascular renal allograft rejection
