  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research includes the evaluation of a checklist and on-site screening devices to
      pre-select drivers suspected of being drug-impaired. The reliability of a limited number of
      promising on-site screening devices will be investigated. The devices tested will have to be
      promising regarding both reliability and practicality. In addition to the scientific
      evaluation of the checklist and the oral fluid screening devices, the time consumption of the
      selection procedure as a whole (checklist + oral fluid screening) will be evaluated.

      Outcome of the study will be recommendations for the roadside selection procedure of drivers
      suspected of drug-related impairment. The recommendations will concentrate on the reliability
      of the selection procedure.

      The study is part of an EU project DRUID. Two other countries in Europe take part to this
      study along with Finland.
