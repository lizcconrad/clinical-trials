  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the use of a material (Alloderm collagen mesh) during
      the stomal formation operation (surgery that will create a mouth-like opening on the surface
      of the body to an internal organ). The main purpose of this research study is to see if using
      this material will lower the hernia rate compared to normal repair without this material. The
      secondary purpose is to evaluate if using this material will increase or decrease
      complication rates.

      This study seeks to examine the ability of an implantable collagen matrix to reduce the
      incidence of parastomal hernia formation. Patients will be randomized preoperatively by a
      computer generated random allocation to either receive collagen mesh at the time of stoma
      formation, or to have stoma formation without mesh. Stomas without mesh will be made in the
      standard surgical fashion dictated by the type of stoma: ileostomy, colostomy, ileal conduit.
      Patients randomized to receive mesh will undergo stoma formation in an identical fashion, and
      will have a 8 cm x 12cm piece of AlloDerm mesh placed as a tissue reinforcement at the stoma
      site and extending under the midline incision. Patients will be followed with physical
      examinations at approximately 2weeks post-op, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 months post-op, and will
      undergo CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis at 12 and 24months to determine hernia
      occurrence.

    <description>Patients randomized to receive mesh will undergo stoma formation and will have a 8 cm x 12 cm piece of AlloDerm graft placed as a tissue reinforcement around the stoma and extending under the midline incision. The mesh will be trimmed to provide a minimum of 3cm of overlap around the stoma in all directions. The mesh will be secured with transabdominal number one Prolene (Ethicon, Inc) sutures every 4cm around the mesh. Additional fixation will be provided with Protack spiral tacks (US Surgical, Inc) every 1cm around the mesh. The midline fascia will be closed with running number one Prolene sutures. Skin will be closed in standard fashion.</description>
