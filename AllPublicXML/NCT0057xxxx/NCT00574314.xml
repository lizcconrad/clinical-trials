  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women have been disproportionately underrepresented in clinical research. Few of the many
      drugs approved by the FDA have been adequately tested in women. Most common health conditions
      experienced by both women and men are managed by treatments that have been developed and
      tested most in men.

      A new barrier to enrolling women in clinical trials is in effect: HIPAA (the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act). The positive benefit of HIPAA—protecting a person's
      health information from abuse—is laudable, but it comes at a cost: it will deny investigators
      the benefit of access to chart (medical record) review in order to gather data to answer
      clinical questions. In the past, investigators were allowed access to patient's charts
      because the hospital consent form included a clause indicating that the patient's information
      may be used for research.

      The investigators propose to overcome this crisis and challenge with a proven method of
      identifying individuals who would be willing to consider participating in a clinical trial:
      The Women's Guild Health Research Registry. In keeping with the focus of the Women's Health
      Program, we would propose to enroll only women. The registry will allow qualified
      investigators to identify potential study participants. This idea has been effective at
      improving the quantity and quality of women able and willing to participate in trials.

      The investigators will also allow other approved sites to utilize the Registry via the
      approved procedure of submitting an IRB approved protocol which will be reviewed by our
      Internal Review Committee. This protocol's inclusion/exclusion criteria will be used to query
      the database for eligible participants. The participants will be contacted by the Registry
      staff to ascertain their interest in this research protocol and their agreement to release
      their contact data to the investigator will be obtained.

      Investigators will be charged at the time they approach the registry for assistance. The
      charge is intended to cover the cost of maintaining the registry now that initial funding has
      been exhausted.
