  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single dose of gabapentin, given before
      cesarean section, will reduce pain in the initial 24 hours after surgery. Gabapentin has been
      very effective at treating pain after knee and hip operations, hysterectomies, and many other
      types of surgeries. We believe that it may be effective for treating pain after cesarean
      sections, but it has never been studied for this purpose.

    <textblock>
      A cesarean section is a surgical procedure and, like all surgeries, there is pain after the
      operation. The purpose of this study is to find out if patients have less pain after a
      cesarean delivery when they receive a single dose of a gabapentin before the surgery. We are
      also interested in whether or not the dose of gabapentin reduces the need for other
      pain-killing medication during this time.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either gabapentin or a placebo. In addition,
      all patients will receive the usual standard of care and medication for pain (intrathecal
      morphine,oral paracetamol and diclofenac). At 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the operation,
      patients will be asked about their pain and satisfaction with pain management. The dose of
      gabapentin given is thought to be safe for the baby, and we plan to investigate whether the
      gabapentin has any effect on the baby's pain response when given his/her vitamin K injection.
      Gabapentin has also been shown to reduce long-term pain that can develop, and patients will
      be followed up at 6 weeks to be asked about their pain at that time.
