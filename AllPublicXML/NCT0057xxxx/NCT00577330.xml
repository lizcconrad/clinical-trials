    <textblock>
      Myalgesin is a botanical preparation consisting of celery seed extract,extract of dried
      Boswellia serrata, and dried extract of Phellodendron bark. Component of these extracts have
      been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to inhibit cyclooxygenase and
      5-lipooxygenase. The study is based on the hypothesis that oral administrration of this
      botanical will support joint function in people with osteoarthritis of the knee and improve
      symptoms and mobility as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC)
      Osteoarthritis Index.

             carry out usual activities without handicap,class 2 is ability to adequately conduct
             usual activities despite handicap of discomfort or limited mobility of one or more
             joints,and class 3 is limited ability to carry out usual activities. (American
             Rheumatism Association functional class)

          -  Documented radiographic changes of osteoarthritis on a previous knee radiograph

          -  Presence of chronic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia or reflex sympathetic
             dystrophy, that may interfere with the assessment of joint symptomatology.
