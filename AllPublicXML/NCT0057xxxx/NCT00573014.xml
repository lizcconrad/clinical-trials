    <textblock>
      The optimal method of clearing the cervical spine in obtunded trauma patients is unclear.
      Computed tomography (CT) identifies most injuries but may miss ligamentous injuries. Magnetic
      resonance (MR) imaging has been widely used to exclude ligamentous injuries. We postulate
      that with the new generation of CT scanners, MR imaging is not needed to rule out significant
      injuries. Our protocol for clearing the cervical spine in obtunded trauma patients depends on
      CT alone. We are prospectively following these patients and performing a clinical examination
      when they are awake to show this is a safe approach.

      All OBTPs with gross movement of all four extremities admitted to MetroHealth Medical Center
      (MHMC), the regional Level I Trauma Center in Cleveland OH, who underwent a CT CS at MHMC
      between October 2006 and September 2008 will be included. Prospective data will be collected
      on these patients including age, gender, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on
      admission, results of CT CS, GCS at the time of collar clearance, day of collar clearance,
      collar complications, date of reexamination, and results of reexamination. We will define an
      obtunded patient as a patient who was unable to reliably describe the presence or absence of
      CS symptoms in the opinion of the examining physician. Patients needed to have gross movement
      of all four extremities to be included in the study; if they did not, they were excluded. The
      presence or lack of sensory examination was not evaluated for the purposes of this study. We
      will define cervical collar complications as skin breakdown identified either by the skin
      care team during weekly rounds in the intensive care unit or by the treating physician at any
      time.

    <description>One hundred ninety-seven patients had their collars removed and CS cleared at a mean of 3.3 days. Removal of CS precautions in OBTPs with gross movement of all extremities is safe and efficacious if CT CS is negative for injury. Supplemental MRI CS is not needed in this patient population.

        Subjects will include all patients (including children) after blunt trauma in whom cervical
        spine injury has not been ruled out admitted to MetroHealth Medical Center from
        10/1/2004-9/30/2006. We are excluding patients with an obvious neurologic deficit
        attributable to the cervical spine. We are excluding patients with abnormalities of the
        cervical spine that are identified on either plain films or CT. We are also excluding those
        patients in whom the cervical spine can be cleared clinically due to normal mental status.
