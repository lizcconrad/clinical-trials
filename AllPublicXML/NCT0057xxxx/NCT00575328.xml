    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether Maca Root is effective for treating
      sexual dysfunction in females that is caused by the treatment for bipolar disorder. An
      additional aim of the study is to document the safety and tolerability of maca root, as well
      as any potential side effects that it causes. We suspect that Maca Root will result in a
      significant reduction in sexual dysfunction when compared to a placebo group.
