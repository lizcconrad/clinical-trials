  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is find whether the addition of N-acetylcysteine (antioxidant)
      to dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade involving angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor and AT-1 angiotensin II receptor blocker leads to the reduction of proteinuria,
      main prognostic marker of chronic kidney disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the progression of
      chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) may retard CKD
      progression. Dual pharmacological blockade of the RAAS with ACEI and ARB is recommended as a
      standard renoprotective management at least in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD.
      However, neither ACEI nor ARB, even in high doses or in concomitant usage, abrogate the
      progression of CKD completely. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with CKD off
      dialysis. Additional antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) may prove to be such beneficial
      therapeutic concept. To shed more light on this issue, we performed a randomised open
      controlled study to evaluate the influence of triple N-acetylcysteine and RAAS therapy on
      surrogate markers of kidney injury, i.e. proteinuria, markers of tubular involvement and
      kidney fibrosis.

    <description>N-acetylcysteine (ACC) 1200 mg In the 8-weeks run-in period angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonists were administered to achieve the target blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. Next, they were randomly assigned to add (or not) 1200 mg N-acetylcysteine in two active treatment periods lasting 8 weeks each</description>
