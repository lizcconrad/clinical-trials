  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical Prostatectomy (removal of the prostate) or radiation therapy provide excellent
      outcomes for patients with localized (confined to one area) disease, yet there is still no
      effective treatment once the disease has spread beyond the prostate gland. Typically, a serum
      PSA test is done to diagnose prostate cancer. Following diagnosis, a prostate biopsy and
      other tests help to classify the patient's disease according to the likelihood of a
      recurrence. However, these assessments are imperfect. There is a need to identify and
      evaluate prostate biomarkers that will provide exact information regarding the likelihood of
      a recurrence (prediction) of prostate cancer.

      The Inter-SPORE Prostate Biomarkers Study (IPBS) was established to prospectively collect and
      analyze biological specimens to predict and validate outcomes after treatment for prostate
      cancer. The study population will consist of patients scheduled to receive standard of care
      therapy for localized prostate cancer, either radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy
      (XRT; includes external beam radiation, brachytherapy, or both). Seven hundred (700) patients
      (350 RP, 350 XRT) will be recruited from 11 SPORE sites over a two-year interval. We will
      collect serum, plasma, lymphocytes, and prostate tissue samples for distribution to
      collaborating biomarker validation sites at other prostate SPOREs, along with clinical and
      epidemiologic data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males, 35 years of age or older, with histologically confirmed prostate
             adenocarcinoma, that is clinically localized to the prostate gland.

          -  Biopsy performed at the SPORE institution.

          -  No prior therapy for prostate cancer (patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy after
             collection of blood and biopsy samples are eligible).

          -  The patient should have 2 or more cores involved with carcinoma. The minimum amount of
             tumor submitted should be 5 mm, or at least 40% of the core involved with tumor. (This
             amount can be made up from 2 positive cores if 1 core is insufficient).

          -  Patients with clinical stage T1-T2a NXM0 prostate cancer who elect to be treated with
             RP or XRT (includes external beam radiation, brachytherapy, or both) at the SPORE
             institution.

          -  Patients with a nomogram predicted 5-year probability of freedom from biochemical
             recurrence (Kattan 1998) of less than or equal to 85% (patients with intermediate risk
             of recurrence).

          -  Ability and willingness to sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in a therapeutic clinical trial with an experimental agent.

          -  Previous cancer of any kind except non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Previous surgical or minimally invasive treatment for enlarged prostate (e.g. TURP,
             TUNA, TUIP, laser, microwave)

          -  Use of anti-androgen drugs during the 6 months prior to diagnosis

          -  Use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors during the 6 months prior to diagnosis
