      The main purpose of the study is to determine the accident risk when driving under the
      influence of psychoactive substances, including alcohol (DUI). Other aims are to find out the
      prevalence of psychoactive substances in road traffic and to obtain information on the role
      of these substances in road traffic accident causations.

      For the purposes of the study, drivers of motorised vehicles are randomly stopped and
      interviewed and breath alcohol is recorded. Also, an oral fluid sample is taken and
      psychoactive substances are investigated in the laboratory. For cases, drivers injured in
      traffic accidents are asked to participate to the study. A whole blood sample and, if
      possible, an oral fluid sample is taken and psychoactive substances are determined in the
      laboratory. Also, people diseased in road traffic accident are included in the study. The
      information required for these subjects are taken from a register database.

      The study is part of an EU-project DRUID. Altogether 13 European countries take part to the
      study.

      Whole blood and oral fluid are collected for the study. However, no DNA determinations are
      done at any point of the study. The laboratory where the samples are analysed does not
      analyse DNA. DNA is not relevant for this study.
