      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study for the treatment of head and neck
      cancer(HNC), to assess the ability of EN3285 to prevent or delay the onset of severe oral

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in patients
      receiving chemoradiotherapy (ChemoRT) for the treatment of head and neck cancer(HNC), to
      assess the ability of EN3285 to prevent or delay the onset of severe oral mucositis(OM). The
      study includes a treatment period of up to 8 weeks, based on the patients' prescribed
      treatment plan, with a follow-up period of 12 months following completion of radiotherapy
      (RT).
