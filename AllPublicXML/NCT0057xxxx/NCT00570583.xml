    <textblock>
      Late-life depression (LLD) and cognitive impairment (CI) are significant public health
      problems among older adults, and their co-occurrence markedly increases disease burden and
      dementia risk. This highlights the importance of identifying and treating CI in LDD; however,
      current lack of reliable prognostic information from clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic data
      impedes research on targeted prevention and treatment. Two critical ways to close current
      knowledge gaps in predicting cognitive diagnostic outcomes of LLD involve: 1) increasing the
      number of diagnostic cases available to existing studies, and 2) using those studies to
      identify clinical, imaging, and genetic predictors that will improve future diagnosis. We
      intend to do both in the current proposal. We plan to study the following SPECIFIC AIMS:

      Aim 1: Identify baseline clinical-behavioral predictors of cognitive diagnostic outcomes in
      LLD.

      Working hypothesis: During acute LLD, CN will be associated with more frequent EOD and higher
      negative life stress than PCI and AD; PCI will be associated with EOD and higher frailty than
      CN and AD; AD will be associated with LOD, greater appetite loss, lower anxiety, and greater
      memory impairment than CN and PCI.

      Aim 2: Use multimodal neuroimaging at baseline to identify patterns associated with cognitive
      diagnostic outcomes in individuals with LLD. Working Hypothesis: CN will be associated with
      greater white matter integrity compared with PCI and AD; PCI will be associated with lower
      white matter integrity and network abnormalities in anterior cingulate cortex compared with
      CN; AD will be associated with lower hippocampal volume compared with CN and PCI.

      Aim 3: (exploratory): Explore interrelationships among candidate genes, cognitive diagnostic
      outcomes, and proposed phenotypic components relevant to LLD. Exploratory Hypotheses: 1) COMT
      val158met polymorphism will be associated with CN; 2) 5-HTTPRL and APOE Îµ2 polymorphisms will
      be associated with frailty; 3) genetic variation (SNPs) in TPH2 and AGTR1 will be associated
      with risk factors of AD: LOD, episodic memory, hippocampal volume, and appetite loss.

      Central hypothesis: the 5-year likelihood of each cognitive diagnostic outcome is associated
      with distinct clinical, cognitive, and neural phenotypes during acute LLD, which in turn have
      distinct genotypic correlates.

      Specifically, CN individuals will have earlier first onset of depression (EOD) relative to
      AD, more negative life stress during acute depression compared with AD and PCI, and greater
      white matter integrity; CN will also be associated with the AA genotype of the COMT val158met
      polymorphism, which may confer both neuroprotection and higher stress sensitivity. PCI will
      have more EOD relative to AD, greater frailty, and lower white matter integrity than NC. AD
      will be associated with later age of depression onset (LOD), greater appetite loss, lower
      anxiety, smaller hippocampal volume, and greater memory impairment. To test these hypotheses,
      we propose the following
