  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a cause of treatment failure in many cancer patients. MDR
      refers to a phenotype whereby a tumor is resistant to a large number of natural
      chemotherapeutic drugs. Having prior knowledge of the presence of such resistance would
      decrease morbidity from unsuccessful therapy and allow for the selection of individuals who
      may benefit from co-administration of MDR inhibiting drugs. The Tc-99m labeled single photon
      emitting radiotracers sestamibi and tetrofosmin have shown some predictive value. However,
      positron-emitting (PET) radiotracers, which allow for dynamic, quantitative imaging, hold the
      promise of more accurate and specific identification of MDR tumors.

      Objective:

      To obtain human safety data, to demonstrate imaging feasibility with FPAC, to obtain human
      biodistribution and to obtain preliminary evidence of breast tumor uptake concordance with
      response to therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      18F flouropaclitaxel (FPAC) distribution in malignant tumors is expected to be similar to
      that of paclitaxel. It is proposed that by monitoring the influx and efflux of FPAC in vivo
      using PET imaging, we will be able to determine if a tumor retains the drug (is drug
      sensitive) or pumps it out (is drug resistant). The efflux rate of FPAC in the tumor should
      be proportional the amount of Pgp present and therefore should be a predictor of treatment
      failure. If this method is successful at identifying MDR, patients can be spared a course of
      ineffective chemotherapy and can be started on alternative drugs or, if available, an
      effective MDR modulator can be administered prior to treatment.

      In order to validate the biodistribution in non-human primate, 3 normal volunteers will be
      recruited to participate in a dosimetry PET imaging protocol.

      Often, patients with breast cancer are treated with chemotherapy prior to definitive surgical
      removal of the primary tumor. Three patients with breast cancer who are candidates for this
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy will also be recruited to participate in this study, in order to
      demonstrate the feasibility of tumor imaging. As these patients will be receiving
      chemotherapy (likely paclitaxel), a preliminary correlation with FPAC uptake and tumor
      response can also be attempted in this pilot study.

      Primary Objective

      --To obtain human dosimetry and monitor for potential physiologic effects following 4-[F-18]
      fluoropaclitaxel (FPAC) administration

      Secondary Objectives

        -  a.To characterize tracer uptake in tumors and normal tissues and develop robust methods
           for analysis of FPAC kinetics in breast tumors

        -  b.To optimize the imaging protocol for FPAC, and, if feasible, reduce to 1 or 2 static
           scans

        Normal Volunteers

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this study. Because no dosing or
             adverse event data are currently available on the use of FPAC in patients &lt;18 years of
             age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric
             single-agent trials, if applicable.

               -  All subjects must sign a written informed consent document and a Health Insurance
                  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization in accordance with
                  institutional guidelines.

               -  If female, the subject must be postmenopausal for a minimum of one year, or
                  surgically sterile, or be within 14 days of onset of a menstrual period or have a
                  negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin (ßHCG) blood test.

               -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/μL

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/μL

               -  platelets &gt;100,000/μL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 2.5 times the
                  institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR, in subjects with creatinine
                  levels above institutional normal, creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with a known bleeding disorder

               -  Subjects who have received chemotherapy within 1 year of entry into study

               -  Subjects with a history of liver or kidney disease

               -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents

               -  Subjects having severe claustrophobia or other condition that would make them
                  unable to lie still for the duration of the study

               -  Subjects with immunodeficiencies that predispose a subject to specific or
                  non-specific mediator release

               -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to
                  ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
                  angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
                  that would limit compliance with study requirements

               -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating or who suspect they might be pregnant.
                  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
                  infants secondary to treatment of the mother with FPAC, breastfeeding should be
                  discontinued if the mother receives FPAC.

          -  Subjects must have a history of histologically or cytologically confirmed breast
             cancer with estimated lesion size of &gt;1cm.

               -  Subjects must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this study. Because no dosing
                  or adverse event data are currently available on the use of FPAC in patients &lt;18
                  years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for
