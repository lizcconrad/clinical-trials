  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of walnuts, walnut-oil, almonds
      and fish oils on blood sugar and insulin levels in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients.
      The hypothesis is that a diet rich in these foods will improve insulin resistance in women
      with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common disease that affects 1 out of 16 women. Metabolic and
      endocrine abnormalities seen in PCOS include insulin resistance, androgen excess and
      infertility. This study focuses on the insulin resistance aspect because increased insulin
      resistance leads to premature onset of impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes whereas
      decreased insulin resistance reduces androgen excess, improves the ovarian function and
      increases fertility. Although insulin resistance can be treated with insulin-sensitizing
      drugs, PCOS clinically manifests during adolescence and the long-term safety of the
      drug-treatment can be a concern. Thus, improving insulin resistance with effective
      nutritional approaches would be very desirable. Epidemiological studies and animal
      experiments suggest that replacement of dietary saturated fats with monounsaturated (MUFA)
      and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fats improves insulin resistance.
