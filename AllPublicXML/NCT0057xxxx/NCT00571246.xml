      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of topiramate (250mg) or lamotrigine
      (250mg) versus placebo in reducing alcohol consumption and decreasing symptoms of PTSD in
      patients with comorbid AD and PTSD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a high rate of comorbidity with alcohol dependence (AD) and post traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). The rates of PTSD among individuals with AD are at least twice as high as
      those in the general population. In addition, alcohol dependence is the most common comorbid
      condition in men with PTSD. Despite this, little is known about how to best treat individuals
      with comorbid AD and PTSD. The use of anticonvulsants represents a novel approach to
      treatment that may target symptoms of both AD and PTSD. Both Topiramate and Lamotrigine act
      on the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. Topiramate has GABAergic effects by robustly
      increasing brain GABA, and antiglutamatergic effects by inhibiting glutamate function that
      might antagonize alcohol's rewarding effects in AD and could contribute to the regulating of
      reexperiencing and arousal symptoms in PTSD. Lamotrigine is a glutamate-inhibiting
      anticonvulsant that has shown efficacy in some dually diagnosed patients with alcohol
      dependence, and in patients with PTSD. Neither topiramate nor lamotrigine have been used to
      treat patients with comorbid PTSD and AD. Methods: Ninety men and women with a current
      diagnosis of AD and PTSD will be enrolled in a 16-week trial. They will be assigned, in a
      double-blind fashion, to either topiramate, lamotrigine or placebo. Significance: This
      project will be the first to compare anticonvulsants (topiramate and lamotrigine) to placebo
      as effective treatments for reducing alcohol consumption and PTSD symptoms in patients with
      AD and PTSD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females between the ages of 18-60 years old.

          2. Current alcohol abuse or dependence

          3. Current PTSD

          4. Patients with current alcohol dependence, with at least one recent episode of heavy
             drinking (defined as 5 or more drinks per drinking episode) over the past 14 days, and
             during a consecutive 30-day period within the 90 days prior to baseline evaluation.

          5. Individuals who are on a stable dose (no less than 2 weeks) of antidepressant
             medication.

          6. Medically and neurologically healthy on the basis of history, physical examination,
             EKG, screening laboratories (CBC w/ differential, TSH, Free-T4, ASAT, ALAT, GGT, BUN,
             creatinine, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, total protein, albumin, electrolytes,
             VDRL, urinalysis, beta-HCG)

          7. For women, negative pregnancy test and use of acceptable method of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant or lactating.

          2. Individuals with a current unstable medical condition such as neurological,
             cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, liver, or thyroid pathology (LFT &gt; 3 times normal,
             abnormal BUN and creatinine, and unmanaged hypertension with BP &gt; 200/120) which in
             the opinion of the physician would preclude the patient from fully cooperating or be
             of potential harm during the course of the study (includes those with a history of
             glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, urethral obstruction, cerebral arteriosclerosis,
             pyloric stenosis).

          3. Patients who meet current SCID criteria for a major Axis I diagnosis (Bipolar
             Disorders, Schizophrenia and Schizophrenia-type Disorders).

          4. History of substance dependence (other than alcohol, tobacco or cannabis) by DSM-IV
             criteria in the last 90 days.

          5. Individuals taking mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications.

          6. Individuals with a history of allergies to topiramate or lamotrigine.
