    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how the pancreas functions after transplantation
      and particularly why high blood sugar levels develop. It will also analyze the effect of the
      medicines used to prevent rejection on blood sugar levels.

      The hypothesis to be tested is that hyperglycemia more than six months after successful
      pancreas transplant results from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin resistance, or both.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type I diabetes mellitus (DM1) is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of the
      in sulin-secreting beta cells. Insulin replacement has been the cornerstone of therapy for
      patients with DM1. However, pancreas transplantation, utilizing the whole pancreas as a means
      to replace the destroyed beta cells, has become a therapeutic alternative. The goal of
      pancreas transplantation is the establishment of long-term euglycemia, thereby preventing or
      allowing for the repair of end-organ complications.

      Maintenance of the pancreas allograft over many years remains the goal in following pancreas
      transplant recipients over time. The onset of hyperglycemia less than one year after
      transplant is usually due to issues of surgical technique or acute rejection. HOwever, the
      onset of hyperglycemia fter one year of pancreas transplant is more problematic because the
      underlying causes are less clear and have been less well characterized. Currently, there is
      no protocol for definitively identifying the causes of hyperglycemia in pancreas transplant
      recipients over one year. This project will systematically characterize beta cell function
      and peripheral tissue response to insulin in patients who have received an earlier successful
      pancreas transplant who have developed hyperglycemia.
