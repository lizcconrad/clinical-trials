      To become eligible for therapy the following criteria must be fulfilled:

        -  No age or gender limit

        -  Patients with atypical malignant brain tumors.

        -  Must have a Karnofsky performance of at least 60%

        -  Hematologic studies and chemistry profiles will be within the parameters of the protocol

        -  Tumor specimen of adequate size to yield protein concentration, tumor lysate peptide
           must be generated in sufficient quantity and patient must have no prior sensitivity to
           the components of the dendritic cell vaccine.

        -  Patients are excluded if they have systemic disease, presence of acute infection, known
           history of autoimmune disorder and pregnancy.
