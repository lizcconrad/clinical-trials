  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza causes epidemics of respiratory infection in young children each winter. Young
      children, particularly those under 6 months of age are most vulnerable to suffering from
      complications secondary to influenza infection. Consequently, influenza vaccine has been
      recommended for children 6-59 months of age. Influenza vaccine is not approved for use in
      children under 6 month of age who are at highest risk. Therefore, the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended
      vaccination of household contacts of children under 6 month of age - a cocooning strategy.

      The current study is a hospital-based study to assess the effectiveness of a program to
      vaccinate birth mothers and household contacts of newborns with influenza vaccine. We propose
      to study both birth mothers and household contacts of newborns delivered at Durham Regional
      Hospital and Duke University Medical Center, birthing hospitals serving Durham and
      surrounding counties in central North Carolina. We will implement several strategies to
      increase vaccine coverage rates at Durham Regional Hospital utilizing Duke University
      Hospital as a comparison setting. Strategies will include: standing vaccine orders for birth
      mothers, vaccine reminders for household contacts, and a hospital based influenza vaccine
      clinic to increase vaccine accessibility for household contacts. Vaccine coverage rates will
      be assessed utilizing a survey method (maternal interview at the birthing hospital and a
      follow-up telephone contact 6-8 weeks later). We hypothesize that influenza vaccine coverage
      rates for new mothers and household contacts of newborns delivered at the intervention
      hospital will be higher when compared to coverage rates in the comparison hospital.
      Demographic determinants of vaccine coverage and reasons for refusal of influenza vaccine
      will also be assessed.
