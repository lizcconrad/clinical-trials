      The purpose of this study is to determine and confirm the role of bone marrow transplantation
      in the treatment of disorders of the red cell and hemoglobin including sickle cell anemia,
      thalassemia and diamond blackfan anemia.

      The trial proposed is a single armed phase II treatment protocol designed to examine the
      engraftment,toxicity and graft-versus-host disease following a novel cytoreductive regimen
      including cyclophosphamide and Busulfan for the treatment of patients with Severe Sickle Cell
      Anemia,Thalassemia, and Diamond Blackfan Anemia using stem cell transplants derived from
      HLA-genotypically identical siblings.

      Patients will be conditioned for transplantation with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/day x 4
      days), and busulfan [(if &lt; 4 years of age 1 mg/kg 4 times per day x 4 days), (if &gt; 4 years of
      age 0.8 mg/kg 4 times per day x 4 days)]. Patients will receive Methotrexate &amp; Cyclosporin-A
      for prophylaxis against GvHD and GCSF to promote engraftment.

      The preferred source of stem cells from related HLA-matched related donors will be unmodified
      bone marrow stem cells.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with severe HOMOZYGOUS SICKLE CELL ANEMIA or SICKLE/BETA THALASSEMIA

          -  Neurologic event (stroke or hemorrhage).

          -  Abnormal cerebral MRI scan and cerebral arteriogram or MRI angiographic study (MRA)
             and impaired neuropsychologic testing.

          -  Recurrent acute chest syndrome (&gt; 2 episodes)

          -  Stage I-II sickle chronic lung disease

          -  Sickle cell nephropathy (moderate or severe proteinuria or GFR 30-50% of predicted for
             age.

          -  Major visual impairment in at least one eye with bilateral proliferative retinopathy.

          -  Osteonecrosis of multiple bones

          -  Chronic debilitating pain secondary to vasoocclusive crisis (&gt;= 3 episodes per year
             for &gt;= 3 years) Recurrent priapism

          -  Allo-immunization with the development of antibodies following chronic transfusion
             therapy

          -  Patients with HOMOZYGOUS SICKLE CELL ANEMIA or SICKLE/BETA THALASSEMIA with the
             following criteria will be considered for accrual on this protocol

          -  Patients &lt; 2 years with high WBC counts and/or &gt;1 episode of dactylitis and/or a Hgb &lt;
             7 g/dl

          -  History of death from sickle cell disease in sibship of patient

          -  Patients with BETA-THALASSEMIA MAJOR with Lucarelli class 1 or 2 risk status i.e with
             only 0-2 of the following factors: hepatomegaly, portal fibrosis, or poor chelation
             therapy

          -  Patients with DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA who have failed conventional therapy.

          -  Patients must have an HLA-compatible related donor. The donor must be healthy and able
             to undergo general anesthesia. Donors with heterozygous sickle cell anemia (hemoglobin
             AS) or with heterozygous thalassemia are acceptable donors.

          -  At the time of referral for transplantation, patients must be in good clinical
             condition without any evidence of infections and a Karnofsky or Lansky pediatric
             performance scale &gt; 70%

          -  Each patient and donor must be willing to participate as a research subject and must
             sign an informed consent form after having been advised as to the nature and risk of
             the study prior to entering the protocol. Parents or legal guardians of patients who
             are minor will sign the consent form after being advised of the nature and risks of
             the study

             clearance &lt; 70 ml/min/1.73 m2 (or serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x Normal) or by a glomerular
             filtration rate &lt; 30% of predicted normal for age

             echocardiogram, and/or ejection fraction of &lt; 50% on echocardiogram or RNCA.

             supine bicycle ergometer are eligible

          -  Major liver dysfunction: SGOT &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal. Hyperbilirubinemia will not
             be used as an exclusion criteria because of the hemolytic component of the bilirubin.
             Patients with active hepatitis or severe liver fibrosis will also be excluded

          -  Severe residual functional neurologic impairment
