  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about why patients with diabetes have increased
      heart attacks, strokes and other illnesses due to blood clots causing blockage of a blood
      vessel. The proposed protocol will study the separate and combined effects of hyperglycemia
      and hyperinsulinemia on endothelial function and fibrinolytic balance in Type 2 DM. Our
      hypothesis is that hyperglycemia, rather than hyperinsulinemia, is responsible for the
      dysregulation of fibrinolytic balance in diabetics.

      This study will test the hypothesis that hyperglycemia will impair, while hyperinsulinemia
      will improve endothelial function and vascular fibrinolytic balance in type 2 DM. As
      discussed above, their roles in the increased prevalence of thrombotic events occurring in
      diabetics have not been defined. More recent data supports insulin as profibrinolytic and
      hyperglycemia to cause endothelial dysfunction. Conclusive studies are lacking in diabetic
      subjects. Furthermore, preliminary data from this lab indicates that in non-diabetic
      controls, hyperglycemia results in a prothrombotic state by increasing plasma PAI-1 and
      reducing tPA levels. The proposed protocol will study the separate and combined effects of
      hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on endothelial function and fibrinolytic balance in Type 2
      DM.
