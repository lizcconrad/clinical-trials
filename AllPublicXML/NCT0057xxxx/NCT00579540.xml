  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flax seed oil, fish oil, and soy bean oil, are commonly recommended supplements for
      Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). These oils have different chemical structures and
      biological actions. It is not yet known which of these oils has the most beneficial effects
      in PCOS patients because they have never been compared to each other head to head. In this
      study the researchers hope to learn more about the effects of these oils on blood sugar and
      insulin levels.

      The aim is to investigate whether n-3 PUFA's can be used to prevent postprandial hypoglycemia
      and its unfavorable consequences, such as stimulation of cortisol and adrenal androgen
      secretion, in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.
