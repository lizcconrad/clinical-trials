    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the stroke volume variation measured using the commercially available
      LiDCO monitor provides a reasonable estimate of volume when compared to standard measures.
      This study will collate data that is already being collected by the bedside nurses.

      Objective: To compare measurement of stroke volume variance with intake/output measurements,
      weight, BUN/Creatnine values, and central venous pressure.

      Design: Non-experimental, non-randomized observational comparative study.

      Setting: The sixteen bed Neurocritical Care Unit at Duke University Hospital.

      Patients: 45 adult (over 18 years) subjects with intracranial pathology who require volume
      resuscitation. Only patients with current LiDCO monitoring will be considered eligible for
      inclusion in the study.

      Interventions: This is an observational study. Subjects will receive standard-of-care
      treatment without additional intervention.

      Data Analysis: All data will be collected by the principal investigator / study coordinator.
      Personal patient information will be removed (deidentified) from the permanent data
      collection records to protect patient confidentiality. Data collected will be entered into a
      Microsoft Excel electronic spreadsheet and will be saved on a USB Disk drive to be stored in
      a locked cabinet in the investigator's office. Statistical analysis using SAS v9.1, (Cary,
      NC) will be conducted with a level of significance set at .05 (alpha) using standardized
      comparative analysis techniques.
