  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, where patients with an advanced
      form of blood cancer are treated with haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor
      cell (PBPC) transplant after which they are randomised to receive either placebo or a
      keratinocyte growth factor (Palifermin or Kepivance®).

      The function of Kepivance® is to stimulate the growth of epithelial cells. This drug has also
      been suggested to have an ability to help improve the reconstitution, or development, of the
      immune system after the transplantation.

      The hypothesis is that the patients T-cell dependent humoral immune response to recall
      antigen (PrevenarTM) will be higher in in palifermin treated patients than in the placebo
      control group
