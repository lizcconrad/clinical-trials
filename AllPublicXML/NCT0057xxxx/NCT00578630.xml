  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop tests that will allow us to determine who will react
      differently to the drugs used to treat cancer. We also want to see who will react differently
      with preparing for a bone marrow transplant.

      The title of this study is interindividual genetic variability as a determinant of
      chemotherapy toxicity and response in pediatric oncology/bone marrow transplantation
      patients. We will collect blood from pediatric oncology/bone marrow transplantation patients
      who are going to receive chemotherapy in order to assess several defined genetic
      polymorphisms that may be involved in chemotherapy toxicity and response. The polymorphisms
      will be assessed on normal mononuclear cells by a combination of techniques. We will
      determine whether these polymorphisms occur in pediatric oncology/bone marrow transplantation
      patients and their correlation with different clinical features during and following therapy
      including toxicity and response. The presence or absence of polymorphisms will be correlated
      with patient outcome and tumor recurrence.
