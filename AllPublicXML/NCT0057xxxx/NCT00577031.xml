  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a first-line regimen of
      Avastin and XELOX (oxaliplatin + Xeloda) in patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or
      rectum. Patients will receive 21-day cycles of treatment, comprising Avastin 7.5mg/kg iv on
      day 1, oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 iv on day 1, and Xeloda 1000mg/m2 po twice daily on days 1-14,
      for a maximum of 6 months. Patients with stable disease or complete or partial response may
      continue on Avastin therapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease
      progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS): Percentage of Participants With Progressive Disease or Death</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1 of every cycle until disease progression or death up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time period in months from the start of study treatment to the first observation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Data for participants with no tumor assessments after baseline but who were still alive at the time of the clinical cutoff were censored at Day 1. Participants who underwent surgery after experiencing a sufficient shrinkage of the tumor, had any relapse, new occurrence of colorectal cancer, or who died were all considered as having had an event. Participants who underwent surgery without any such event were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment that documented neither a relapse nor a new colorectal cancer had occurred. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 9 weeks (every 3 cycles) until end of treatment, disease progression, or withdrawal up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR according to RECIST. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must have decreased to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.
The K-Ras and/or the B-Raf gene mutation status of participants was evaluated by the central laboratory using tumor samples. Wild-type participants did not have a mutation in either gene.</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Raw-Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 9 weeks (every 3 cycles), at end-of-treatment up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (QoL) assessments were used to derive pre-specified QoL scores according to the QoL manual &quot;EQ-5D-3 Level (3L)&quot; user guide for instrument version 4.0. The EQ-5D is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value. The visual analog scale (VAS) component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state. The overall health score absolute changes were calculated for each participant as follows: (score at the end of treatment minus score at baseline). EQ-5D health states were converted into EQ-5D-3L raw index value by applying the scoring algorithm based on the European EQ-net VAS set. The raw index was chosen instead of rescaled index, since the questionnaire was used in order to obtain a quality of life assessment. The raw index scores ranged from 0 (worst health state) to 100 (best health state).</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS): Percentage of Participants With Progressive Disease or Death</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time period in months from the start of study treatment to the first observation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Data for participants with no tumor assessments after baseline but who were still alive at the time of the clinical cutoff were censored at Day 1. Participants who underwent surgery after experiencing a sufficient shrinkage of the tumor, had any relapse, new occurrence of colorectal cancer, or who died were all considered as having had an event. Participants who underwent surgery without any such event were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment that documented neither a relapse nor a new colorectal cancer had occurred. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR according to RECIST. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease.

        <description>PFS was defined as the time period in months from the start of study treatment to the first observation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Data for participants with no tumor assessments after baseline but who were still alive at the time of the clinical cutoff were censored at Day 1. Participants who underwent surgery after experiencing a sufficient shrinkage of the tumor, had any relapse, new occurrence of colorectal cancer, or who died were all considered as having had an event. Participants who underwent surgery without any such event were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment that documented that neither a relapse nor a new colorectal cancer had occurred. Median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response of CR or PR by Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (K-Ras)/V-Raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B (B-Raf) Mutation Status</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR according to RECIST. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must have decreased to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.
The K-Ras and/or the B-Raf gene mutation status of participants was evaluated by the central laboratory using tumor samples. Wild-type participants did not have a mutation in either gene.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, every 9 weeks (every 3 cycles) until end of treatment, disease progression, or withdrawal up to 5 years</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population; only participants with a known K-Ras and/or B-Raf gene mutation status and at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment. Number (n) equals (=) number of participants with either wild-type or K-Ras/B-Raf gene mutation.</population>

        <title>European Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Raw-Index Score</title>
        <description>Quality of life (QoL) assessments were used to derive pre-specified QoL scores according to the QoL manual “EQ-5D-3 Level (3L)&quot; user guide for instrument version 4.0. The EQ-5D is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value. The visual analog scale (VAS) component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state. The overall health score absolute changes were calculated for each participant as follows: (score at the end of treatment minus score at baseline). EQ-5D health states were converted into EQ-5D-3L raw index value by applying the scoring algorithm based on the European EQ-net VAS set. The raw index was chosen instead of rescaled index, since the questionnaire was used in order to obtain a quality of life assessment. The raw index scores ranged from 0 (worst health state) to 100 (best health state).</description>
