      This is a pilot trial designed to assess safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent conjugate
      vaccine for use in patients with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer. This trial is based
      on the results of eight dose-seeking phase I monovalent glycoprotein and carbohydrate
      conjugate vaccine trials in a patient population with minimal tumor burden despite a rising
      biomarker, PSA, who have failed primary therapy such as surgery or radiation. We know that a
      rising PSA is indicative of micrometastatic disease - a state to which the immune system may
      maximally respond. Based on these trials, we have identified three glycolipid antigens, Globo
      H, Lewisy and GM2 and three mucin antigens, glycosylated MUC-1, Tn(c), and TF(c) for
      inclusion into a multivalent trial. As a result of these vaccinations, most patients
      generated specific high titer IgM and IgG antibodies against the respective antigen-KLH
      conjugates. Our previous work has shown the monovalent vaccines to be safe with local
      erythema and edema but minimal systemic toxicities. Our data from approximately 160 men who
      participated in our earlier monovalent vaccine trials against the aforementioned antigens
      have shown that a treatment effect in the form of a decline in PSA log slopes compared with
      pretreatment values could be seen in patients with minimal tumor burden. The multivalent
      vaccine will consist of the lowest dose of synthetic glycoprotein and carbohydrate antigens
      shown to elicit high titer IgM and IgG antibodies in patients with biochemically relapsed
      prostate cancer. A phase III double blind randomized trial with two hundred forty patients is
      planned based on the safety and immunogenicity data accrued from this pilot trial.

      The primary endpoints of this study will be the safety of the vaccine and the humoral
      response to each of the antigens. The secondary endpoint will be to evaluate post-therapy
      changes in PSA.

    <description>Treatment schedule and dose: Thirty patients will be treated with specified doses of each carbohydrate or peptide constituent as has been determined. QS21 will be administered at the standard dose of 100 ug.
Sites: The vaccine conjugate will be administered subcutaneously on a rotating basis to random sites on the upper arms and upper legs.
Dose modifications: If a patient experiences a Grade III or greater local or Grade II or greater systemic toxicity at any time a decrease by 50% in all components of future vaccinations will be administered for that patient. Any evidence of autoimmunity, however, will result in a cessation of immunization in that patient.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prostate cancer that is histologically confirmed.

          -  Patients must show biochemical progression after primary therapy, including surgery or
             radiation (with or without neo-adjuvant androgen ablation). This detection of PSA
             following treatment must occur within two years.

          -  Patients who have had intermittent hormonal treatment, following primary therapy, who
             have non-castrate levels of testosterone (&gt;50 ng/ml) are eligible. Hormonal status
             will be recorded on the basis of serum testosterone levels.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;60%.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as defined by:

               1. WBC &gt; or = to 3500/mm3, platelet count &gt; or = to 100,000 mm3.

               2. Bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/100 ml or SGOT &lt;3.0 X's the upper limit of normal.

               3. Creatinine &lt; or = to 2.0 mg/100 ml or creatinine clearance &gt; or = to 40 cc/min.

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxicity of any prior therapy, and not received
             chemotherapy or radiation therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the trial.

          -  No history of an active secondary malignancy within the prior five years except for
             nonmelanoma skin cancer. Patients with history of melanoma in situ will be permitted
             since these lesions behave in a manner similar to compound nevi.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III/IV), or
             severe debilitating pulmonary disease.

          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  An infection requiring antibiotic treatment.

          -  Narcotic dependent pain.

          -  Anticipated survival of less than 6 months.

          -  Positive stool guaiac excluding hemorrhoids or history of documented radiation induced
             proctitis.

          -  Allergy to seafood.

             performed at MSKCC.
