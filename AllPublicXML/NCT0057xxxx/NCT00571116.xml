    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide when given
      together with disulfiram in treating patients with metastatic and progressive melanoma. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as disulfiram and arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the tolerability of disulfiram and arsenic trioxide administration as a
      therapeutic combination. (Phase IB)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. Determine the response rate (complete and partial responses) and time to progression of
      previously treated patients with metastatic malignant melanoma when treated with disulfiram
      plus Arsenic Trioxide. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide.

      Patients receive disulfiram orally (PO) twice daily and arsenic trioxide intravenously (IV)
      over 1-2 hours on Monday through Friday, alternating two weeks on treatment followed by two
      weeks off treatment. Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have bidimensionally measurable disease. All measurable lesions must be
             assessed (by physical examination, CT scan, radionuclide scan or plain X-ray) within
             28 days prior to registration. Non-measurable sites must be assessed within 42 days
             prior to registration. The subject's disease status must be completely assessed and
             reported.

          -  All subjects must undergo a CT of abdomen and chest within 28 days prior to
             registration.

          -  All subjects must undergo either a CT or MRI of the brain within 28 days of
             registration. Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastasis are eligible for this
             protocol but their metastasis must be clinically stable and asymptomatic. Subjects
             with Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis must have been evaluated by neurosurgery
             prior to entry to confirm that they are a candidate for this trial. Treatment of
             symptomatic CNS metastasis that is required before protocol entry.

          -  Subjects must have progressed based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) criteria after at least one prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy,
             biologic/immunotherapy, or a combination regimen) for metastatic disease. This
             includes development of any new lesion or a 20% increase in the sum of the subject's
             measurable disease compared to their previous nadir. New CNS metastasis could be the
             reason for disease progression, but they must be stable clinically and satisfy
             criteria delineated in section 5.4. Prior systemic therapy must have been completed at
             least 28 days before registration.

          -  Subjects may have received prior biologic or immunotherapy given in an adjuvant
             fashion. Prior adjuvant therapy must have been completed at least 28 days prior to
             registration

          -  Subjects may have received prior radiation therapy. If all known sites of disease have
             been previously radiated, there must be objective evidence of progression for the
             subject to be eligible. Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 28 days
             before registration.

          -  Subjects may have received prior surgery. Prior surgery must have been completed at
             least 28 days before registration.

          -  Performance status must be 0-2 according to Southwest Oncology Group Criteria

        Performance Status:

        GRADE SCALE

        0 Fully active; able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction.

             of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work.

          2. Ambulatory and capable of all self care but unable to carry out any work activities.
             Up and about more than 50% of waking hours.

          5. Dead

               -  Subjects must have a normal ECG, without evidence of congestive heart failure.

                    1. Normal heart rate (less than 100 per minute)

                    2. Normal sinus rhythm

                    3. Normal interval from the beginning of the Q wave to the termination of the S
                       wave, representing the time for ventricular depolarization (QRS) interval

                    4. Subjects with QT prolongation &gt; 500msec on their ECG will be considered
                       ineligible.

                       Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Pregnant or nursing women are not eligible to participate in this trial because
                  the safe use of this drug in pregnancy has not been established.

               -  Subjects with severe myocardial disease or coronary occlusion, psychoses, and
                  hypersensitivity to disulfiram or other thiuram derivatives used in pesticides
                  and rubber vulcanization are excluded from the study.
