      Phase I of the study (motion and quality assurance [QA] study) is being used to determine
      intrafraction target motion and define quality assurance procedures for single fraction
      spinal radiosurgery. The Phase II portion of the study is being used to estimate the
      palliative response (pain or relief of neurologic symptoms) and local control for single
      fraction radiosurgery delivered with TomoTherapy and to assess the acute and late toxicity of
      spinal radiosurgery.

      Optimal radiation plan is generated that treats the tumor (CTV) and spares normal tissue,
      especially the spinal cord. Motion and QA study will determine intrafraction motion for phase
      II portion of the study.

      Dose prescription to tumor is based upon maximal dose received by 0.5 cc of spinal cord and
      whether patient has had prior radiation therapy to that area:

      Phase I - Motion and QA Study: 20-25 Gy in 5 fractions/10-20 patients/previous RT = &lt;50% CTV
      dose/No previous RT = &lt;80% CTV dose.

      Phase II - 9-24 Gy in 1 fraction/30 total in order to have 20 evaluable patients (15 patients
      with prior RT and 15 without prior RT/previous RT = 8 Gy/No previous RT = 10 Gy.

      # Motion and QA study will treat CTV to 20-25 Gy in 5 fractions to study intrafraction motion
      for QA of single fraction administration. This will define treatment margins for single
      fraction radiosurgery.

      *Previous RT:

        -  greater than six months since completion of RT

        -  at least 20 Gy, but no more than 50 Gy

    <description>Physician's subjective report of palliative pain relief. The maximal benefit patient received (best response) is reported. Scale is pain described as &quot;worse&quot;, &quot;stable&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, or &quot;completely resolved&quot;.

    <description>Patients will be fitted in a custom immobilization device. A CT simulation scan will then be performed to pinpoint intended radiosurgery target producing a computer optimized radiation plan to be confirmed by planning radiation physicist. Patient will then be placed in their immobilization device and aligned with the treatment planning position. Patient then receives radiosurgery. Treatment delivery will be divided into components of 3-5Gy with repeat CT based localization in between each of these components. For all patients, a nominal prescription dose of 24Gy will be entered into the tomotherapy cost function. Once the plan that provides maximal spinal sparing has been generated, the plan will be renormalized to produce no more than 8Gy (prior RT) or 10Gy (no prior RT) to 0.5cc of spinal cord by dividing the single fraction treatment into fractions of 3-5Gy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All subjects must have history of histologically confirmed neoplasm or
             radiographically-diagnosed AVM. Patients without a prior tissue diagnosis but who have
             a radiographically characteristic lesion are eligible if there is consensus agreement
             of the diagnosis in the UAB Neuro-oncology Tumor Board.

          2. ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2

          3. Age greater than 18

          4. Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks

          5. Subjects given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 7 days of treatment

          2. Insufficient recovery from all active toxicities of prior therapies

          3. Epidural spinal cord compression requiring immediate neurosurgical decompression. If a
             patient requires immediate surgery for neurologic compromise, they may still be
             eligible post operatively if tumor was incompletely resected.

          4. Patient is non-ambulatory. Optimization of pretreatment neurologic function with
             steroids is allowed. Ambulation with assistance of walker or cane is allowed.

          5. Patient is pregnant and it is judged by the treating Radiation Oncologist that spinal
             radiosurgery would place the fetus in unacceptable danger.

        <description>Physician's subjective report of palliative pain relief. The maximal benefit patient received (best response) is reported. Scale is pain described as &quot;worse&quot;, &quot;stable&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, or &quot;completely resolved&quot;.

            <description>Patients will be fitted in a custom immobilization device. A CT simulation scan will then be performed to pinpoint intended radiosurgery target producing a computer optimized radiation plan to be confirmed by planning radiation physicist. Patient will then be placed in their immobilization device and aligned with the treatment planning position. Patient then receives radiosurgery. Treatment delivery will be divided into components of 3-5Gy with repeat CT based localization in between each of these components. For all patients, a nominal prescription dose of 24Gy will be entered into the tomotherapy cost function. Once the plan that provides maximal spinal sparing has been generated, the plan will be renormalized to produce no more than 8Gy (prior RT) or 10Gy (no prior RT) to 0.5cc of spinal cord by dividing the single fraction treatment into fractions of 3-5Gy.
