  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this pilot study is to describe the angiographic prevalence and pattern
      of internal pudendal artery (and associated inflow vessel) atherosclerosis in patients with
      erectile dysfunction who are non-responsive to PDE-5 inhibitors (i.e., Viagra) who are
      referred for clinically-indicated cardiac catheterization.

      The specific aim of this study is to determine if the deep penile arteries can be seen
      angiographically from the iliac arteries to delineate penile vasculature. Significant
      obstructive atherosclerotic disease of the deep penile arteries may be present in impotent
      males. The etiology of erectile dysfunction is multifactorial and may involve vascular
      disease, endocrine disorders, neurologic disease, prescription medications, psychological
      issues and/or trauma in any given patient. Vascular disease in patients with erectile
      dysfunction may be due to trauma, congenital anomalies, or atherosclerosis.

        Subjects will include males who are scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization or
        peripheral arteriography at UC Davis Medical Center who have erectile dysfunction and poor
        response to oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (Viagra, Cialis and Levitra) as determined
        by their response to a standardized questionnaire. Dissatisfaction will be defined as a
        score of 21 or less on the ILEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire).
