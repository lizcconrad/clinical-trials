  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new program to help the patient and the caregiver
      make decisions about treatment for lung cancer. We need to know if a new information program
      is helpful to patients. The way that we will do this is by comparing it with the usual
      information program that we now provide.

      Patient are asked to make difficult decisions about their treatments. These decisions may
      include when to change treatments or when to stop treatment altogether. Most patients ask a
      family member or close friend to help them with these difficult decisions. A &quot;caregiver&quot; is
      someone they can count on to give support (either emotional or physical) over a period of
      time. The doctors and nurses will also help patients and their caregiver to make these
      decisions.

      They will tell them the risks with each treatment, the success with each treatment, and how
      much time there is for making each decision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with advanced lung cancer and their caregivers struggle with treatment
      decisions, such as when to say &quot;enough.&quot; Patient preparation for facing termination of
      cancer-directed therapy for the number one cause of cancer mortality for both men and women
      in the U.S. is not well handled in most clinical practices. Sparse literature validates that
      this concern is often denied by investigators. Failure to engage in a systematic, informed
      decision-making process, even in the initial stage of treatment, may often result in patients
      looking back and saying, &quot;Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't make the same choice&quot; The
      long-term goal of this program of research is to enhance patient care for lung cancer by
      oncology health professionals and to promote patient empowerment to make informed choices,
      defined as the ability to actively understand and influence one's health status. For this
      study, shared decision making is defined as a tailored, interactive process (emphasizing
      beliefs/personal values) in which the patient is informed enough to ask pertinent questions
      and to participate in the final decision at his/her own preference and comfort levels. The
      intent is to test a decision aid for patients with advanced lung cancer to help facilitate
      informed decisions about treatments that affect quality of life, including termination of
      cancer-directed treatment.

    <description>Enhance Care (EC) will receive a decision aid with seven components: social support, anticipatory guidance, adhering to the patient's preference for participation in treatment decision making, a quality decision-making process tutorial, normalization (using a CD program), structured time with oncology professionals to discuss difficult decisions, and values clarification of 3 decisions throughout treatment. Self-report measures will be used for all participants in addition to probes for the taped interviews with EC. The outcome measures are quality decision making and decisional conflict. Two panels (decision making and lung cancer) will review the protocol twice. The plan will include serially screening the appointment roster. The decision aid will be administered during three clinic visits.</description>

    <description>As an intentional control, the usual care group will receive standard care related to lung cancer and treatment; they will not receive any oral, written, or recorded information related to decision making. Usual care includes anticipatory guidance related to the disease and treatment (e.g., what to do about treatment side effects, signs of an infection, why a treatment would be changed or stopped) using patient education materials normally used in the MSKCC, TOS, Outpatient Clinic.</description>
