      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with the
      omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) improves the behavior of children with autism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a neurodevelopmental disability with an increasing prevalence. Traditional medicine
      does not offer any cures for autism; thus, many parents of children with autism are attracted
      to complementary and alternative therapies, one of which is dietary supplementation with the
      long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is a critical
      structural lipid of brain cell membranes and differences in brain DHA content may influence
      synaptic function, particularly in nutritionally-sensitive areas of the brain, such as the
      cerebellum and hippocampus, which may be brain structures involved in the etiology of autism.
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating whether DHA
      supplementation is an effective treatment for children with autism. Eighty children with
      autism will be randomized to receive 200mg of DHA or placebo for 6 months. Outcome variables
      will include total plasma fatty acid patterns and scores on parent and investigator-completed
      behavioral and developmental rating scales at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of
      supplementation. Differences between groups after 6 months will be evaluated using regression
      methods. Regression analysis will be used to detect correlations between plasma total fatty
      acid DHA contents and scores on the various outcome measures. Results from this study will
      either provide evidence for a breakthrough biomedical treatment alternative for children with
      autism or evidenced-based advice to desperate parents in regard to their choices of potential
      treatments for their children with autism
