  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to study the concept of &quot;energy starvation&quot; in heart failure by evaluation of
      patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) (heart failure with reduced heart
      pump function due to causes other than heart attack). We will use a combination of positron
      emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to study metabolism, anatomy, function,
      blood flow and efficiency, before and after 6 months' treatment with the drug spironolactone
      which blocks the deleterious effects of the hormone aldosterone on the myocardium (heart
      muscle).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary results showed reduced subendocardial myocardial perfusion reserve in NIDCM
      compared to normal subjects, and that the degree of impaired perfusion reserve was related to
      the oxidative metabolic rate as measured by positron emission tomography.
