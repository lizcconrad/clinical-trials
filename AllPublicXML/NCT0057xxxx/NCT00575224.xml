      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      the drugs Pegasys and Copegus when used for hepatitis C genotypes 6, 7, 8, and 9. Patients
      are randomly assigned (by chance) to either Treatment Group A (Pegasys and Copegus for 24
      weeks) or Treatment Group B (Pegasys and Copegus for 48 weeks).

               -  A history of preexisting psychiatric condition, especially severe depression, or
                  a history of severe psychiatric disorder, such as major psychoses, suicidal
                  ideation and/or suicidal attempt are excluded. Severe depression would include
                  the following: (a) subjects who have been hospitalized for depression, (b)

                  depression may be considered for entry into the protocol provided that a
                  pretreatment assessment of the subject's mental status supports that the subject
                  is clinically stable. The Investigator will formulate a management plan for each
                  of the subjects that will become a part of the subject's medical record. The
                  management plans may be developed in conjunction with a health care professional
                  trained in psychology. For these subjects, the Investigator will review the
                  subject's mental status at every visit.

                  documented pulmonary hypertension.

               -  Immunologically mediated disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn's
                  disease, ulcerative colitis], rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia
                  purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma,
                  severe psoriasis, clinical cryoglobulinemia with vasculitis).

               -  Clinical gout.

               -  Any patient with an increased baseline risk for anemia (e.g. thalassemia other
                  than thalassemia trait, spherocytosis, history of GI bleeding, etc) or for whom
                  anemia would be medically problematic

               -  Patients in whom, in the judgment of the investigator, an acute decrease in
                  hemoglobin by up to 4 g/dL (40 g/L) (as may be seen with ribavirin therapy) would
                  not be well-tolerated.

               -  History of immunologically mediated disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease,
                  idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic
                  anemia, scleroderma, severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis etc.)

          -  Substance abuse, such as alcohol (greater than or equal to 80 gm/day), IV drugs and
             inhaled drugs. If the subject has a history of substance abuse, to be considered for
             inclusion into the protocol, the subject must have abstained from using the abused
             substance for at least 12 months. Stable subjects enrolled in a methadone maintenance
             program for at least one year may be enrolled if they are otherwise eligible and are
             monitored throughout the study for illicit drug use.

          -  Subjects not willing to abstain from the consumption of alcohol.

          -  Subjects with severe retinopathy (e.g. CMV retinitis, macular degeneration) or
             clinically significant retinal abnormalities.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent or abide by the requirements of
             the study.

          -  Any other condition, which in the opinion of the Investigators would make the subject
             unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the subject participating in and
             completing the protocol.
