  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that lymphocyte depletion by Campath-1H and rituximab will
      obviate the need for long-term calcineurin inhibitors in renal transplantation. Most
      successful strategies to date have relied on the use of either tacrolimus or cyclosporine for
      an indefinite period of time. However, the advantage of a long term, calcineurin inhibitor
      free regimen may include improved renal allograft function, a lower incidence of
      hypertension, diabetes, and less drug related side effects. This is a non-randomized
      open-label pilot trial in 30 adult renal transplant patients. Subjects will receive 2 doses
      of Campath-1H (30mg given on Day 0 and Day 1) and a single dose of Rituximab (375mg/m2) on
      Day 0, given intra-operative. Subjects will take maintenance doses of prednisone and enteric
      coated mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic™). Subject will also be given cyclosporine (Neoral®)
      therapy for approximately 2 weeks (10-20 days).
