  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many post Acute Coronary Syndrome(ACS) patients do not take their medications (including
      aspirin) as prescribed, leading to an increase in mortality. Patients enrolled in this study
      will be enrolled into one of two groups. Patients in the first group will have their
      medication adherence measured, but will receive all other care as usual. Patients in the
      second group will also have their medication adherence measured, but they will receive
      telephone-delivered problem solving therapy (PST) in addition to their usual care. The two
      groups will be combined to determine the Minimally Effective Dose (MED) and the Maximally
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) for adherence to aspirin. The medication adherence of the PST group will
      improve by 20% (&lt;55% to &gt;75%).

    This was a dosing study to determine acceptability. Participants found protocol burdensome and
    so we terminated.

    <description>Participants will complete Baseline and 30-day assessment visit. At both visits BDI II, Self-Efficacy Questions, AEs Assessment, and Treatment Satisfaction will be assessed. A MEMS cap will be used during the 30-day period to asses medication adherence to their prescribed aspirin.
Usual Care: Participants assigned to UCC will only receive the pre- and post-assessment session, and any adherence education or encouragement that is regularly provided by their treating physicians.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete Baseline and 30-day assessment visit. At both visits BDI II, Self-Efficacy Questions, AEs Assessment, and Treatment Satisfaction will be assessed. A MEMS cap will be used during the 30-day period to asses medication adherence to their prescribed aspirin. After Baseline, there is an initial session telephone session with PST therapist. Subsequent treatment sessions provide a context for the patient to discuss the problems and difficulties they face and that give rise to medication non-adherence.</description>

    <description>Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) is a behavioral approach that teaches patients how to systematically solve their own behavioral difficulties. During telephone treatment sessions, the patient will discuss the problems and difficulties they face and that give rise to medication non-adherence.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical eligibility:

               1. Patient presenting for staged intervention with positive cardiac history OR

               2. Patient with stable CAD who received cardiac admission but does not report chest
                  pain. OR

               3. Patient with stable CAD who has had a cardiac admission in the past.

          2. Patient is non-adherent to prescribed medication.

        The following exclusion criteria have been set for either safety concerns or concerns that
        patients will not be able to complete the protocol:

          1. inability to communicate in English or Spanish

          2. unwilling to be randomized or to have aspirin in a separate bottle if they use a pill
             box

          3. unavailability for the 1 month period of the study (including being unavailable by
             phone and/or traveling out of the country)

          4. medically unable to receive aspirin (e.g. allergy, contra-indicated, etc)

          5. deemed unable to comply with the protocol (either self selected or by indicating
             during screening that s/he could not complete all requested tasks). This includes
             patients with a level of cognitive impairment indicative of dementia, and patients
             with current alcohol or substance abuse.

          6. deemed to need immediate psychiatric assessment (e.g., must be hospitalized, or have
             some other psychiatric intervention conducted within 72 hours).

          7. active psychosis, bipolar disorder, or any overt personality disorder
