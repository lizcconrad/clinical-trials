    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective study is to determine the clinical and economic impact of
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in staging NSCLC. Aims: 1) Determine the accuracy of EUS in
      staging NSCLC 2) Measure 5-year survival 3) Measure quality of life in patients that undergo
      surgery 4) Determine the cost benefit of EUS in staging NSCLC.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject with presumed or known potentially resectable NSCLC

          -  Due to the nature of NSCLC, children (&lt;18 year of age) will not be considered

          -  Men, women, and minorities

          -  Subjects must be able to safely undergo conscious sedation for the EUS procedure

          -  Subjects must be surgical candidates

          -  Subjects must not have an uncorrectable coagulopathy and must be able to refrain from
             the used of aspirin one week prior to the EUS

          -  Patient must provide signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of previously treated lung, head &amp; neck, or esophageal cancer
             are not eligible if the histologic cell type is determined to be the same as what is
             biopsied during the EUS-FNA

          -  Uncorrectable coagulopathy

          -  Significant co-morbidities such as uncontrolled heart failure, or severe chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that would limit their survivability to surgery

          -  Evidence of significant active infection (e.g. pneumonia, peritonitis, wound abscess)

          -  Evidence of serious ongoing illness such as uncontrolled metabolic disease (diabetes
             mellitus, hypothyroidism, etc.) or cardiac condition

          -  Evidence of dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the giving and
             understanding of informed consent, and no evidence of psychiatric illness that would
             preclude adequate compliance with this protocol
