    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year randomized, dose masked, three-arm controlled, pilot study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the intravitreal FA implants (0.59mg and 2.1mg), when compared to
      laser photocoagulation in the treatment of patients with diabetic macular edema.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant macular edema as defined by the ETDRS.

          -  A best corrected visual acuity between +0.30 and +1.00 logMAR (70 and 35 letters or
             approximately 20/40 to 20/200) as measured on an ETDRS chart.

          -  Subjects with laser treatment status/history as follows: [1] Naïve to laser
             photocoagulation or Focal laser photocoagulation more than 16 weeks prior to screening
             or PRP more than 24 weeks prior to screening, [2] No laser scars within 500µm (4x the
             width of a retinal vein at the disc margin) of the central macula.

          -  The subject's ocular media had to be sufficiently clear to allow for quality fundus
             photography.

          -  If aphakic or pseudophakic, lens removal had to have occurred at least 40 weeks prior
             to screening.

          -  Subjects had to be males or non-pregnant females of at least 18 years.

          -  Subjects had to display the ability and willingness to comply with treatment, follow
             up process, and sign an Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had previous grid macular photocoagulation for diffuse macular
             edema.

          -  Presence of posterior hyaloid membrane, epiretinal membranes, fibrovascular
             proliferation, and vitreopapillary traction, which causes tractional distortion on the
             macula as demonstrated by OCT or funduscopy.

          -  History of or current retinal detachment requiring surgical treatment or a scleral
             buckle.

          -  Diabetic Retinopathy that required immediate PRP.

          -  Ocular disease other than diabetic retinopathy that could confound the outcome of the
             study (e.g., age-related macular degeneration, drug toxicity, uveitis, hypertensive
             retinopathy, ischemic maculopathy, etc.).

          -  Glaucoma, or history of glaucoma in either the study eye or the fellow eye.

          -  Ocular hypertension, or history of ocular hypertension requiring IOP lowering
             treatment.

          -  A media opacity that precludes visualization and/or diagnosis of the status of the
             eye.

          -  Concurrent coumadin therapy or known bleeding diathesis.

          -  Subjects requiring chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy or systemic
             immunosuppressive therapy to manage non-ocular disease.

          -  Concurrent treatment with a new investigational drug.

          -  Subjects with a best-corrected visual acuity worse than +1.0 logMAR (20/200 or 35
             ETDRS letters) in the fellow eye.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Females of childbearing potential considering becoming pregnant during the course of
             the study and those not taking effective contraception/precautions to avoid pregnancy.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to fluorescein, known allergies to steroids or any
             component of the intraocular device.

          -  Subjects with photophobia that will preclude the ability to do fundus evaluations.
