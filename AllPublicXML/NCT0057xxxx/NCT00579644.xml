      The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination of methotrexate and minocycline
      works better than methotrexate alone in early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Specific aims of
      this study are:

      A. To demonstrate that the combination of minocycline and methotrexate is well tolerated when
      used in the first year of RA.

      B. To compare the efficacy of the combination of minocycline and methotrexate with
      methotrexate and placebo therapy in early sero-positive RA patients.
