  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of Epoetin alfa therapy (short term
      versus long term) with and without a home-based individualized exercise program that
      incorporated aerobic and strength resistance training for patients being treated with
      high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral bloodstem cell transplantation (PBSC T) for
      multiple myeloma. The endpoints for the study included the number of attempts at and total
      number of days of stem cell collection, number of RBC and platelet transfusions during the
      transplantation period, time-to-recovery after transplantation, and response to intensive
      therapy for multiple myeloma.

          <description>Participants received standard care for multiple myeloma which included: For the Short term study: Total Therapy II Chemotherapy Regimen (See Protocol) and Stem Cell Harvest. For the Long term study: Total Therapy II Chemotherapy Regimen (See Protocol) and melphalan with autologous peripheral-blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). For both the short and long term studies, red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions were administered as needed, in addition to Epoetic Alfa (EPO) when hemoglobin levels dropped during high dose chemotherapy. The usual EPO dose is 150 units/kg of body weight, three times per week, or 40,000 units weekly, with suggested target hemoglobin range of 10-12 g/dl. Study participants were asked to remain as active as possible but not prescribed an individualized exercise program. Participants were stratified by thalidomide administration and by age (&lt;=60 versus &gt;60).Participants who received thalidomide also received low-molecular weight heparin</description>

For the Long term study: Total Therapy II Chemotherapy Regimen (See Protocol) and melphalan with autologous peripheral-blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). For both the short and long term studies, red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions were administered as needed, in addition to Epoetic Alfa (EPO) when hemoglobin levels dropped during high dose chemotherapy. The usual EPO dose is 150 units/kg of body weight, three times per week, or 40,000 units weekly, with suggested target hemoglobin range of 10-12 g/dl. Study participants were asked to remain as active as possible but not prescribed an individualized exercise program. Participants were stratified by thalidomide administration and by age (&lt;=60 versus &gt;60).Participants who received thalidomide also received low-molecular weight heparin</description>

          <title>Usual Care</title>
          <description>Participants received standard care for multiple myeloma which included: For the Short term study: Total Therapy II Chemotherapy Regimen (See Protocol) and Stem Cell Harvest. For the Long term study: Total Therapy II Chemotherapy Regimen (See Protocol) and melphalan with autologous peripheral-blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). For both the short and long term studies, red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions were administered as needed, in addition to Epoetic Alfa (EPO) when hemoglobin levels dropped during high dose chemotherapy. The usual EPO dose is 150 units/kg of body weight, three times per week, or 40,000 units weekly, with suggested target hemoglobin range of 10-12 g/dl. Study participants were asked to remain as active as possible but not prescribed an individualized exercise program. Participants were stratified by thalidomide administration and by age (&lt;=60 versus &gt;60).Participants who received thalidomide also received low-molecular weight heparin</description>
