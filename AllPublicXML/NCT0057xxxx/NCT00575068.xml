    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody (IDEC-114) is
      effective in the treatment of follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This drug has never
      been studied in patients with lymphoma, however, it has been studied in psoriasis patients at
      various dose levels and schedules.
