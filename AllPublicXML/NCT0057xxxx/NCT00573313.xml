  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies in animal models have established that the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver
      disease (ALD) is regulated in part by the effects of chronic alcohol abuse on hepatic
      methionine metabolism. The hypothesis of the clinical study was that provision of the
      methionine metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) would correct abnormal hepatic methionine
      metabolism thereby effectively treating ALD. The two goals of the clinical research were a)to
      determine the clinical relationship of aberrant hepatic methionine metabolism to ALD by
      comparisons of patterns of serum methionine metabolites in groups of ALD patients, alcoholics
      without liver disease, and normal healthy subjects, and b) to determine the treatment effects
      of SAM on patterns of serum methionine metabolites and on the histopathology and biochemical
      features of liver injury in ALD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We assessed a total of 297 potential ALD candidates, from whom 40 were enrolled in the study.
      In addition, we enrolled 26 gender matched active alcohol drinkers without liver disease (AD)
      and 28 age and gender matched healthy control subjects (HS). Of the original 40 ALD subjects
      who provided initial enrollment data, 3 declined to proceed with the trial. Therefore, 37 ALD
      patients were randomized to receive SAM at a dose of 400 mg or placebo three times daily for
      24 weeks. However 11 of these dropped out after initial evaluation, leaving 26 ALD patients,
      13 in each arm, who completed the 24 week trial.

    <description>Biochemical values for liver function tests and histopathology scores were obtained at week 0 and 24 of the treatment trial, and changes in each were recorded. Here are reported changes in aspartate transaminase (AST) as representative of all changes. Since only baseline values were obtained in the Healthy and Lifestyle counseling groups, there are no recorded changes in these two groups.</description>

    <description>We compared serum levels of SAM at time 0 and week 24 of the study in the alcoholic liver disease groups only, since these parameters were measured in the healthy and lifestyle coaching groups only at baseline.</description>

        <description>Biochemical values for liver function tests and histopathology scores were obtained at week 0 and 24 of the treatment trial, and changes in each were recorded. Here are reported changes in aspartate transaminase (AST) as representative of all changes. Since only baseline values were obtained in the Healthy and Lifestyle counseling groups, there are no recorded changes in these two groups.</description>
