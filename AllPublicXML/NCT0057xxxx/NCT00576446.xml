  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are very aggressive and among the most common of brain tumors. A diagnosis
      carries with it a median survival of approximately 12 months, with 90 - 95% of patients
      surviving less than 2 years. The current standard treatment of surgical resection followed by
      radiation therapy and chemotherapy has not substantially prolonged survival and even the few
      treatment options shown to exhibit small increases in survival primarily benefit certain
      (i.e., young) patient subpopulations.

      Cancer vaccines represent one novel therapy for malignant gliomas. The goal is for the body
      to recognize the tumor cells as foreign and produce its own response to fight off recurring
      tumor cells. A promising means of causing an immune response so the body can create this
      immunity is through the use of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines.

      Dendritic cells are a small group of cells contained in everyone's white blood cell
      population. These cells are responsible for letting the immune system know that something
      foreign, like bacteria, or a tumor, is in the body. Dendritic cells help the body ward off
      disease by alerting the immune system.

      gliadel is an FDA - approved drug - a wafer containing a concentrated amount of a
      chemotherapy agent. These wafers are placed into the brain cavity after the tumor is resected
      (removed) and deliver a steady amount of immediate chemotherapy medicine to the surrounding
      brain tissue. Also, since Gliadel is a local chemotherapy, it will prevent the detrimental
      suppression (weakening) of the immune system shown with systemic (throughout the body)
      chemotherapy.

      In prior Phase l and phase ll studies, patients who received chemotherapy following Dendritic
      cells demonstrated longer progression free and overall survival than the patients who
      received Dendritic cells or chemotherapy alone.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether after standard therapy of tumor resection
      surgery, along with placement of Gliadel wafers at time of surgery followed by dendritic cell
      vaccines will not only generate (start) an immune response, but will provide longer
      progression free survival.

      Patients who were screened and not enrolled in this clinical trial due to screen failure will
      be notified of the reason for screen failure. Pre HIV counseling and appropriate referral
      resources will be provided. If the screen failure is due to the positive HIV test,
      appropriate post HIV counseling will be provided and appropriate referrals will be made. The
      charts of the patients with screen failures will be destroyed.The patients charts who will be
      enrolled in the study kept in the locked cabinet in the research office. patients will be
      assigned a unique identifying code known only to the research team. Data will be captured by
      various source documents, or, as necessary, abstracted from hospital medical records by an
      experienced registered nurse. The electronic data for viral testing will be accessible to
      research personnel only.
