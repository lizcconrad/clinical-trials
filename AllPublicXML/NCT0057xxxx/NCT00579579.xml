    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what happens to patients after they have surgery for
      rectal cancer. After being treated for rectal cancer, patients tell us that their bowel,
      bladder and sexual function have changed. We are trying to understand how these changes
      affect your quality of life. The research that we have now does not explain these changes or
      problems very well. The patients will be asked questions about bowel function, bladder
      function, sexual function, and quality of life so we can understand these changes better.
      This will help us take better care of our patients in the future, before and after their
      treatment for rectal cancer.

    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer is the second most common cancer in North America. Therapy has rapidly improved
      over the last 20 years, and the surgical technique of total mesorectal excision, as well as
      advances in radiation and chemotherapy, have resulted in improved survival and decreased
      local recurrence. As a result, survivorship issues become increasingly important for patients
      with rectal cancer.

      Patients uniformly demonstrate a strong desire to avoid a permanent stoma and show strong
      preferences for sphincter preserving surgery (SPS). With the introduction of the circular
      stapler, SPS is technically possible in a higher proportion of patients. Additionally, even
      tumors at the anorectal ring are considered amenable to SPS in select patients with ultra-low
      rectal cancers.

      At present, long-term outcomes after rectal cancer surgery are poorly understood. Bowel,
      bladder and sexual function appear to be negatively affected by multi-modality therapy.
      However, function has been poorly studied, and it is difficult to translate the data into
      clinically meaningful information for patients. Clinically, bowel, bladder and sexual
      dysfunction seem to affect quality of life (QOL), although this has never been well studied.
      It is important to quantify the extent of impairment so that it can be used to educate
      patients preoperatively. However, translating these data to clinicians and patients remains
      challenging, and efforts to convey the data in a meaningful manner preoperatively constitute
      an important element in managing patient expectations. By understanding patients' baseline
      needs, expectations and satisfaction at the time of the preoperative consent, we can begin to
      develop novel preoperative strategies for educating patients about postoperative function and
      quality of life in a meaningful manner, so that they may better adapt after surgery. We
      ultimately plan to use data from this study to develop and subsequently evaluate the role of
      an educational tool outlining functional outcomes after rectal cancer surgery.

    <description>Prior to surgery, patients will be asked to complete baseline surveys. In addition, a random subsample of approximately 30 patients will be asked to participate in a short qualitative interview to explore expectations regarding bowel function and quality of life following surgery. Follow-up surveys will be completed at 6, 12 and 24 months after bowel continuity has been restored (defined by their last surgical procedure). Patients with a permanent stoma will receive the Stoma-specific QOL questions in place of the MSKCC Bowel Function Instrument at 6 and 12 months after initial surgery.</description>
