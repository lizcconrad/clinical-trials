      The purpose of this study is to compare methadone with morphine in the management of moderate
      to severe cancer pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of cancer pain is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) step ladder approach
      to the use of analgesic drugs. Medication potency increases at each step of the WHO ladder,
      from nonopioid (step 1; e.g., aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) through weak
      opioids (step 2; e.g. codeine) plus a nonopioid to strong opioids (step 3; e.g., morphine)
      plus a nonopioid analgesic. Morphine is considered the gold standard for the treatment of
      moderate to severe pain, but this is based on level C criteria. Research has discovered that
      methadone is a potent opioid that operates at several levels which are important for pain
      control. The primary aim is to compare morphine versus methadone as a first-line analgesic in
      patients with moderate to severe cancer pain. Patients will be randomized to receive either
      oral slow-release morphine (15 mg) every 8 hours and immediate-release morphine (10 mg) every
      4 hours as needed for breakthrough pain or oral methadone 2.5 mg every 8 hours and methadone
      2.5 mg every 4 hours as needed for breakthrough pain. Our hypothesis is that methadone will
      provide equivalent pain control efficacy after 4 weeks of therapy. We postulate that
      methadone will be as preferable as morphine as an analgesic. We will compare the two drugs
      via adverse effects and compare stability of analgesia via comparison of the number of
      breakthrough pain episodes. The study will attempt to establish equivalency of methadone as a
      first-line analgesic for moderate to severe cancer pain.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to slow accrual of subjects, the study was terminated after one subject started in the standard control group (morphine). No subject received investigational study drug (methadone). Therefore no data were analyzed.</limitations_and_caveats>
