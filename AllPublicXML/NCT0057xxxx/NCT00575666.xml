  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intranasal
      insulin as an adjunctive therapy, with a 4-week follow-up, in 60 non-diabetic schizophrenia
      subjects to examine insulin's effect on psychopathology and cognition. In addition, the study
      will examine insulin's effects on weight, food intake, resting energy expenditure, and body
      composition.

      The specific aims include:

      Primary aims

        1. Examine the efficacy of intranasal regular insulin (40 IU 4 times per day) in improving
           cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia.

        2. Examine the efficacy of intranasal regular insulin in improving negative symptoms and
           positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

      Secondary aims

        1. Examine intranasal insulin's effects on weight, food intake and resting energy
           expenditure.

        2. Examine intranasal insulin's effects on body composition, waist circumference, and
           waist/hip ratio.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function- CPT D Prime Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed a computer-based cognitive test designed to measure sustained attention (attention to a specific stimulus over a period of several minutes) before and after intranasal treatment. During this test, participants respond as quickly as possible to any consecutive presentation of identical stimuli on the computer screen. The stimuli (2, 3, and 4-digit targets) were presented with increasing cognitive load in successive blocks. Correct responses, responses made to the second of 2 identical stimuli presented in a row, were scored as hits. False alarms were also recorded. The &quot;d prime score&quot; is a score given to each participant on a scale of 0.0- 1.0 in which discrimination sensitivity is measured. A score of zero equates to no sensitivity, whereas a score of 1.0 equates to perfect sensitivity. Values below represent postreatment performance minus pretreatment performance. Higher scores represent less advanced psychopathology. Week 8 values are displayed below.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function- CPT Hits Rate (Proportion)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed a computer-based cognitive test. The test is described in detail in a previous outcome measure (&quot;CPT d prime score&quot;). Hits rate was defined as the proportion of correct responses to the relevant stimuli (response to two identical targets) compared to total responses (total hits). Assessments were completed at Screening/Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. Hits rate as a proportion of total hits was measured. Min score= 0, Max score= 1.0. Higher values represent higher stimulus recognition accuracy, and thus less advanced psychopathology. Week 8 values are displayed below.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function- CPT Reaction Time of Hits (Milliseconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed a computer-based cognitive functioning test designed to measure sustained attention (attention to a stimulus over a period of several minutes). The test is described in detail in a previous outcome measure (&quot;CPT d prime score&quot;). Reaction time of hits is defined as the average time each participant took to respond correctly to relevant stimuli. Assessments were completed at Screening/Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. Reaction time was measured in milliseconds. Max score= N/A. Lower values represent less advanced psychopathology. Week 8 values are displayed below.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function- CPT False-alarm Rate (Proportion)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed a computer-based cognitive functioning test designed to measure sustained attention (attention to a stimulus over a period of several minutes). False alarm rate is defined as the proportion of overall hits that were in response to an incorrect stimulus (two consecutive non-identical targets). Assessments were completed at Screening/Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. False-alarm hits were measured as a proportion of total hits. Min score= 0, Max score= 1.0. Lower values represent higher hit accuracy and less advanced psychopathology. Week 8 values are displayed below.</description>

Scores were mesured by time to complete in seconds. Max score= N/A. Lower values represent less advanced psychopathology. Week 8 values are displayed below.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Function- CPT D Prime Score</title>
        <description>Subjects completed a computer-based cognitive test designed to measure sustained attention (attention to a specific stimulus over a period of several minutes) before and after intranasal treatment. During this test, participants respond as quickly as possible to any consecutive presentation of identical stimuli on the computer screen. The stimuli (2, 3, and 4-digit targets) were presented with increasing cognitive load in successive blocks. Correct responses, responses made to the second of 2 identical stimuli presented in a row, were scored as hits. False alarms were also recorded. The &quot;d prime score&quot; is a score given to each participant on a scale of 0.0- 1.0 in which discrimination sensitivity is measured. A score of zero equates to no sensitivity, whereas a score of 1.0 equates to perfect sensitivity. Values below represent postreatment performance minus pretreatment performance. Higher scores represent less advanced psychopathology. Week 8 values are displayed below.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Function- CPT Hits Rate (Proportion)</title>
        <description>Subjects completed a computer-based cognitive test. The test is described in detail in a previous outcome measure (&quot;CPT d prime score&quot;). Hits rate was defined as the proportion of correct responses to the relevant stimuli (response to two identical targets) compared to total responses (total hits). Assessments were completed at Screening/Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. Hits rate as a proportion of total hits was measured. Min score= 0, Max score= 1.0. Higher values represent higher stimulus recognition accuracy, and thus less advanced psychopathology. Week 8 values are displayed below.</description>

        <description>Negative symptoms of schizophrenia were measured at Screening/Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. Assessment consisted of seven-items, with each item measured on a seven-point scale (1= absent, 4= moderate, 7= extreme). Min score= 7, Max score= 49. Higher scores represent more advanced psychopathology. Week 8 values are displayed below.</description>
