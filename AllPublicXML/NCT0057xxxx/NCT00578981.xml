  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a decision aid to support the decision to use (or not use) bisphosphonates in
      postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporotic fractures, and to assess the impact of the
      decision aid on start and six month adherence to bisphosphonates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bisphosphonates can reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis. However, many
      patients may not start and adhere to bisphosphonates, consequently losing independence,
      quality, and length of life. We hypothesize that a decision aid that efficiently improves
      patient education and communication with their provider about fracture risk, and about using
      bisphosphonates to reduce that risk, will improve the quality of treatment decisions. We
      anticipate that patients will become more involved in the decision-making process and
      decisions will be more consistent with patients' values and health care goals. We expect this
      will lead to increased bisphosphonate start and adherence and improved patient outcomes.
