               -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination
                  before entering into the study.

               -  Subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

               -  Subjects of childbearing potential (i.e. active menstrual cycle) at the time of
                  study entry:

                    -  must not be pregnant

                    -  and must be abstinent (and if so, this must be documented in the source
                       documents at each vaccination visit)

                    -  or must be using adequate contraceptive precautions (i.e. intrauterine
                       contraceptive device, oral contraceptives, diaphragm or condom in

                       days prior to vaccination and must agree to continue such precautions for
                       one month after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use
             during the study period and up to one month after the last vaccine dose.

               -  Subjects who have delivered recently or breastfeeding women must have completed a
                  period of at least 3 months post-pregnancy and should not be breast-feeding in

             immune-modifying drugs on 14 consecutive days within six months prior to the first
             vaccine dose and up to one month after the last dose of the vaccine. (For
             corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled
             and topical steroids are allowed).

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within 30 days before (Days - 1 to - 30) and 30 days (i.e. Days 0 - 29) after the
             first dose of vaccine. However, the administration of tetanus toxoid vaccine up to 8
             days before the first dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred
             until the subject is outside of specified window.

          -  Previous vaccination against HPV or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other
             than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period.

          -  Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunodeficient condition such as human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based on medical history and physical
             examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  History of allergic disease, suspected allergy or reactions likely to be exacerbated
             by any component of the study vaccines, e.g. AS04, aluminium, MPL.

          -  Hypersensitivity to latex (found in syringe-tip cap and plunger).

          -  Known acute or chronic, clinically significant system conditions, e.g.
             neurologic,pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal functional abnormality or
             psychiatric disorders, as determined by medical history, physical examination or
             previous laboratory tests.

          -  History of chronic condition(s) requiring treatment such as cancer, chronic hepatic or
             kidney disease(s), diabetes, or autoimmune disease. This exclusion criterion should be
