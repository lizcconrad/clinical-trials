    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety in the use of Ranibizumab, an
      effective vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF) inhibitor, in treating patients with a
      failing bleb, characterized by increased fibrosis and vascularization of the conjuctiva,
      following trabeculectomy. Six subjects from one site will be enrolled in this study.
