      The purposes of this research are:

        -  to understand the status of suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and depression in
           Harbin University students; and

        -  to analyse the infect factors of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.

      With cognitive behavior interventions on students with suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior,
      and middle or high degree of depression, the researchers can provide a scientific and
      effective intervention to the students.

      Cognitive therapy for the prevention of suicide attempts: a randomized controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      By using suicidal ideation scale, to assess the status of suicidal ideation and suicidal
      attempt in 6000 university students in Harbin city. About 300 students with suicidal ideation
      and depression disorder randomized into two groups (control and intervention groups) accept
      the cognitive behavior intervention. We will assess the depression after intervention.
