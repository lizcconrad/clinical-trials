  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whereas the smoking prevalence rates in the general population are declining, rates among
      people diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) continue to be
      elevated. Smoking may be a form of self-medication in people with ADHD, which has specific
      reinforcing mechanisms such as improvement of ADHD core symptoms, enhancement of moods and
      arousal, or a combination of both. In addition, the reinforcing effects of smoking may be
      potentiated by stimulant medication.

      The study examined the reinforcing effects of ad libitum smoking with and without ADHD
      medication in adult smokers with clinically diagnosed ADHD. Participants were adults with
      ADHD. The effects of two day of ADHD medication compared to two days on placebo for were
      studied on nicotine intake (i.e., cotinine levels). In addition, task performance on the
      Continuous Performance Task and nicotine withdrawal symptoms were examined in response to
      ADHD medication + smoking a cigarette versus ADHD medication + abstinence versus placebo
      medication + smoking versus placebo medication + abstinence.

      The study identified the reinforcing mechanisms of smoking in interaction with ADHD
      medication. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of nicotine addiction and
      facilitate the development of targeted smoking cessation and prevention programs for
      individuals with ADHD and other people with deficiencies in impulse control and excessive
      risk taking.
