  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference in relapse rates and long term event
      free survival in patients with intermediate grade or immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL) whose marrow is not obviously involved with NHL who are randomized to receive either an
      autologous bone marrow (ABMT) or peripheral stem cell transplant (PSCT). All patients with
      intermediate grade NHL with histologic negative bone marrow who would otherwise meet all
      eligibility criteria for high-dose therapy and ABMT are eligible for this study. Patients who
      are eligible will be randomized to either PSCT or ABMT at the time of enrollment into our
      transplant program.

      These patients would be enrolled in a high-dose protocol using carmustine, etoposide,
      cytarabine, and cytoxan (BEAC) with autologous hematopoietic rescue. The patients will be
      stratified according to good and poor prognosis category and relapsed vs. first partial
      response categories. The patients will have bone marrow or peripheral stem cells collected
      according to standard protocols. A standardized hematopoietic growth factor will be used for
      mobilization and post-transplant. The patients' PSC or BM product will be assayed via
      invitro-culture techniques for occult tumor, and by molecular biologic assays. The patients'
      outcome for transplantation will be evaluated with response to transplantation, relapse rates
      and event free survival being the measured end points.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 16-65

          -  Intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (International Working Formulation -
             Follicular large cell, Diffuse Small Cleaved, Diffuse Mixed, Diffuse Large Cell, and
             Immunoblastic) with histologic negative bone marrow who would otherwise meet all
             eligibility criteria for high-dose therapy and ABMT. These criteria are in each
             specific high-dose therapy protocol (i.e. Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70, adequate
             organ function, HIV and Hepatitis B negative, etc.). These patients would be enrolled
             in a high-dose protocol using carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and cytoxan (BEAC)
             with autologous hematopoietic rescue.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with bone marrow histologically involved with tumor or with a bone marrow
             abnormality making bone marrow harvest not possible.

          -  Patients whose tumor is rapidly growing which may preclude the extra time involved
             with the PSC collection process.

          -  Patients who do not otherwise meet high-dose therapy and transplantation entry
             criteria.
