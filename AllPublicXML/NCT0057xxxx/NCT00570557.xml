  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to facilitate the successful implementation of the new Heart and Stroke
      Foundation of Ontario dysphagia screening model for acute stroke patients. The objectives
      will be 1) to determine the natural history of dysphagia screening skill decay, and 2) to
      assess the benefit of independent web-based practice and periodic feedback on screening skill
      maintenance. We will enrol a convenience sample of nurses who currently work with stroke
      patients but who have had no prior formal training with dysphagia screening.

      The study will consist of 2 phases: A) an initial pilot phase followed by B) a prospective
      randomized controlled study. During Phase A, three new web-based, self-instructed skill
      refresher courses will be developed to help nurses maintain the skills they will learn in an
      8-hour workshop on dysphagia screening. During Phase B, nurses will receive the 8-hour
      workshop and one-on-one evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Following
      training, competent screeners will be randomized into one of two groups: Group A - Control
      group with no refresher course or periodic feedback from SLP; Group B - Web-based skill
      refresher courses only. Nurses will be evaluated at several timepoints throughout Phase B to
      assess theoretical dysphagia screening knowledge and skills.
