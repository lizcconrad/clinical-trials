  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing weekly intramuscular injection of 17 alpha
      hydroxylprogesterone caproate with daily vaginal progesterone in women with singleton
      pregnancies and history of prior spontaneous preterm birth in terms of maternal, fetal and
      neonatal outcomes.

      Our aim is to assess the effects on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of antenatal
      progesterone administered intramuscularly versus vaginally in women with singleton pregnancy
      and a history of prior preterm birth.

      This study is intended as a randomized controlled trial. Women with singleton pregnancies
      between 16 and 20 weeks 6 day will be randomized to one of two treatment groups.

      Those randomized to weekly intramuscular progesterone will receive 250 mg of 17 alpha
      hydroxyprogesterone caproate every week in the clinic between randomization and delivery for
      those delivery preterm or 36 weeks 6 days.

      While those randomized to vaginal progesterone will receive 100 mg vaginal progesterone daily
      at home. Vaginal progesterone to last between clinic visits will be provided to subject.
      Those women in the vaginal progesterone group will also be informed on how to obtain
      additional medication in case of missed clinic appointment. Treatment will be continued until
      36 weeks 6 days or as dictated by date of preterm delivery.
