  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Exendin-(9-39), an antagonist of the
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor with effects on the pancreatic beta cell, increases
      fasting blood glucose levels in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot study , to determine if Exendin-(9-39), an antagonist of the
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor with effects on the pancreatic beta cells, increases
      fasting blood glucose levels in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism. Our overall
      hypothesis is that abnormal GLP-1 secretion resulting from dysfunctional nutrient sensing in
      intestinal L-cells plays a role in the dysregulated insulin secretion characteristic of this
      disorder, and that antagonism of the GLP-1 receptor will increase fasting blood glucose
      levels.

      Aim 1. To evaluate the dose of exendin-(9-39) required to elevate fasting blood glucose
      levels in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism due to KATP channel mutations.

      Aim 2. To determine therapeutic plasma levels, plasma half-life and pharmacokinetics of
      exendin-(9-39) during an intravenous short-term infusion in subjects with congenital
      hyperinsulinism due to Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel (KATP)
      mutations.

    <description>To examine the effect of Exendin-(9-39) on fasting blood glucose levels, samples were collected at various time points before and during the infusion [Exendin-(9-39) or vehicle] including: 60 minutes before the start of the infusion, again at the start of the infusion (Time 0), and then every 20 minutes until 6 hours after the start of the infusion. Using this information, the mean blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) from the start of the infusion to the end of the infusion (360 minutes) was calculated for each both Exendin-(9-39) and vehicle and compared.</description>
