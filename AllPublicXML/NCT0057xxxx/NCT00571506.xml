      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two diabetes medications,
      rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, on markers of vascular disease in subjects with type 2
      diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a common disease in the United States, affecting over 10 million Americans.
      Vascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, affects many diabetic patients and will
      cause the death of three-fourths of these patients. Because the majority of diabetic patients
      will suffer complications or death from vascular disease, we will explore treatments that
      have the potential to reduce or prevent vascular disease in type 2 diabetes patients. Our
      study will examine the effects of two diabetes medications, rosiglitazone (ROSI) and
      pioglitazone (PIO), on markers of vascular disease in 20 subjects with type 2 diabetes. It is
      thought that these two medications will reduce the risk of vascular disease by affecting the
      platelets and proteins that that regulate the processes involved in clot formation. One-half
      of the subjects enrolled in our study will take ROSI and the other half will take PIO. We
      will measure the clumping ability of these subjects' platelets before, during, and after
      three months of treatment with ROSI or PIO. We will measure the blood concentrations of
      several proteins (fibrinogen, PAI-1, CRP, adiponectin, and leptin) before and after treatment
      with the study drugs. These experiments will give us information about any beneficial effects
      of ROSI and PIO on the clot-forming ability in diabetes patients. We expect that treatment
      with ROSI and PIO will result in improvement of the disturbed clot-forming processes that
      predispose diabetic patients to vascular disease.
