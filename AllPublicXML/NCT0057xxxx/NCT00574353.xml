  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When used with a different radioactive tracer called FMISO, a PET scan can find areas of low
      oxygen in the tumor. We think that having areas of low oxygen is a reason why some tumors are
      hard to treat with radiation.

      In a past study, FMISO PET scans were performed in 6 patients with rectal cancer that could
      not be operated on and that had spread to other areas. In this group of patients, FMISO PET
      scans were able to find the low oxygen areas in their tumors. But this study included only a
      few patients. In the present study, we want to use FMISO PET scans in patients who have
      tumors that can be operated on. This group of patients will have radiation, chemotherapy or
      both before they have their surgery. We want to see if FMISO PET can find low oxygen areas in
      this distinct group of patients.

      Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of malignant solid tumors associated with poor prognosis
      and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. It has also been shown (6) that the presence of
      hypoxia may reduce long-term survival post surgery. Hypoxia renders tumor cells up to three
      times more resistant to ionizing radiation than aerobic cells. The presence of hypoxic
      regions within tumors may be one factor leading to local failure after treatment with
      standard pre-operative radiotherapy doses. If these regions could be identified and verified
      using a non-invasive imaging technique prior to surgery, they could be specifically targeted
      using sophisticated planning techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      to deliver higher doses ionizing radiation with preoperative radiotherapy. Future studies
      using IMRT to &quot;dose paint&quot; areas of hypoxia within tumors will build upon the results of this
      feasibility study. Ultimately, by the delivery of differential dose of radiation to the
      tumor, in combination with surgery, the local control rates of rectal cancer patients may
      further be improved.

    <description>You will be scanned 2 to 3 times on the same day, but you will only be administered one dose of the FMISO tracer. The first scan will last about 30 minutes. Then you will have 1 to 3 hours to wait before you are scanned again. Some patients will undergo a second scan approximately one-and-a-half hours after the start of the first scan. This scan will last about 10 minutes. The final scan will occur between 2-4 hours after the start of the first scan. This final scan will also last about 10 minutes. During the PET scan, you may have a separate i.v. line put into your other arm so that we can take 2 to 3 blood samples. These samples will be less than half a teaspoon each. We are taking these blood samples to see how quickly FMISO leaves your blood stream. The first sample will be taken between 2 and 40 minutes after the FMISO is injected. The other two blood samples will be taken with each subsequent scan.</description>
