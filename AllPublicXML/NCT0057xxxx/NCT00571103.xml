      The purpose of this study is to see whether acamprosate (Campral) will curb the desire to
      gamble in people with pathological gambling disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the opiate antagonists appear to be effective in the treatment of pathological
      gambling (PG), it is reasonable to ask whether acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurine;
      Campral), also FDA approved for the treatment of alcoholism, can be used effectively to treat
      PG. Acamprosate is not an opioid antagonist; rather, it is assumed that its therapeutic
      effects are due to actions on GABA receptors. Acamprosate is structurally related to
      1-glutamic, which is an excitatory neurotransmitter. It has been proposed that acamprosate
      decreases the effects of the naturally-occuring excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the
      body. Because chronic alcohol consumption disrupts this system, and the changes last many
      months after alcohol ingestion is stopped, it is possible that acamprosate restores the
      glutamate system towards normal. Regardless, acamprosate decreases the pleasant &quot;high&quot;
      associated with alcohol consumption, and thus decreases the frequency of relapse during
      abstinence. We hypothesize that acamprosate will have similar actions in persons with PG.

    <measure>The Primary Efficacy Measure Was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for PG (YBOCS-PG).</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks minus baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The YBOCS-PG (Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pathological Gambling) is used to assess the range and severity of PG symptoms. The scale is a modification of the YBOCS originally developed by Goodman et al. (1989) for use in rating severity and change in subjects with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This adaptation is a 10-item clinician-rated questionnaire, which rates (on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4) time spent, distress, interference, resistance, and control in relation to PG urges and behaviors. The scale ranges from 0 to 40 with a higher score representing increased severity in PG.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Secondary Efficacy Evaluations Will Include the G-SAS (Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale), Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I) , and the CGI-S Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks minus baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The G-SAS is a 12 item self-report instrument that reflects the subjects urges to gamble and the subjects gambling behavior. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms) with a total score range from 0 to 48. The CGI-I is a 7 point scale requiring the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment. A patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; and 7, among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

        <description>The G-SAS is a 12 item self-report instrument that reflects the subjects urges to gamble and the subjects gambling behavior. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms) with a total score range from 0 to 48. The CGI-I is a 7 point scale requiring the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment. A patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; and 7, among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

        <title>The Primary Efficacy Measure Was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for PG (YBOCS-PG).</title>
        <description>The YBOCS-PG (Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pathological Gambling) is used to assess the range and severity of PG symptoms. The scale is a modification of the YBOCS originally developed by Goodman et al. (1989) for use in rating severity and change in subjects with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This adaptation is a 10-item clinician-rated questionnaire, which rates (on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4) time spent, distress, interference, resistance, and control in relation to PG urges and behaviors. The scale ranges from 0 to 40 with a higher score representing increased severity in PG.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The sample was relatively small, and there was no comparison group; therefore, our results could have resulted from the placebo effect. Another limitation is the relatively short length of the trial. Furthermore, there were few minority subjects.</limitations_and_caveats>
