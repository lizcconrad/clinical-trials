  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients having the transversus abdominal place
      (TAP) block at the end of a cesarean delivery have less pain in the post-delivery period than
      those who do not. Freezing medication is injected between the layers of muscle on either side
      of the belly, to freeze the nerves that carry pain stimuli from an abdominal wound. This
      technique has been useful for many abdominal operations, and has recently been studied in
      cesarean sections, however more information is needed.

    <textblock>
      A cesarean section is a surgical procedure and, like all surgeries, there is pain after the
      operation. The purpose of this study is to find out if patients have less pain after a
      cesarean delivery when they receive an injection of local anesthetic on either side of their
      abdomen, into the plane of the transversus abdominis muscle. We are also interested in
      whether or not this injection decreases the need for other pain-killing medication during
      this time.

      Patients will randomly be assigned to receive either local anesthetic or a placebo. In
      addition, all patients will receive the usual standard of care and medication for pain. At 6,
      12, 24 and 48 hours after the operation, patients will be asked about their pain and
      satisfaction with pain management. The risk of side effects is very low, as the block is done
      in an area with low blood supply. We propose that the addition of the TAP block to the
      current multi-modal regimen of post-cesarean pain management will reduce pain scores and
      requests for additional analgesia post-operatively, as well as increase patient satisfaction
      with their pain control.
