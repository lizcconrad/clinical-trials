      An international study in which patients with GHD were randomized to receive somatropin at a
      dose of either 3 microg/kg/day or 6 microg/kg/day for the first three months. The dose was
      then doubled (6 microg/kg/day, LD or 12 microg/kg/day, CD) for the next three-months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Adult males and females with GHD, arising during adult life from pituitary ablation or
             failure, onset of GHD have taken place at least 1 year before entering the study, or,

          2. Adult males and females with GHD either idiopathic or secondary to pituitary disease
             arising in childhood.

          3. Demonstrated GHD as documented by a negative response to a standard GH stimulation
             test within the last 5 years previous year (see Section 3.4.3, part b). Maximal peak
             must be less than 3.0 ng/ml.

          4. Receiving replacement for other deficient hormones for at least 3 months prior to the
             start of the study, where necessary.

          5. Have given informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

          1. Patients with clinically significant pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, renal or
             neuromuscular disease or with chromosomal or genetic malformation syndromes.

          2. Patients who have any evidence of an active tumorous process. Intercranial lesions
             must be inactive and any antitumour therapy must be complete.

          3. Pregnant women and lactating females or women who decide to become pregnant during the
             study and who are not taking adequate contraceptives.

          4. Patients thought unlikely to comply with the protocol.

          5. Patients taking an investigational drug in the previous month.
