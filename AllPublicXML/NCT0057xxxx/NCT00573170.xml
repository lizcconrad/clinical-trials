      Study TRX109011/TRX109013, A Randomized, Double-blind, Double-dummy, Placebo-controlled,
      Crossover Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of TREXIMET® (Sumatriptan + Naproxen Sodium) versus

      administered during the Moderate-Severe Pain Phase of the Migraine (Studies 1 and 2 of 2)

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,
      crossover, three-attack, outpatient study in which TREXIMET® will be compared to a
      butalbital-containing combination medication (BCM; acetaminophen 325mg, caffeine 40mg, and
      butalbital 50mg [Fioricet]) for the acute treatment of migraine headaches. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of 6 possible treatment sequences (TPB, TBP, BTP, BPT, PTB, PBT where T =
      TREXIMET®; P = Placebo; B = Butalbital-containing Combination Medication) . Subjects will
      treat each of the 3 migraine attacks when pain is moderate to severe. The study will include
      4 visits: (1) a Screening visit at study entry, (2) a Drug Screen visit, (3) a Randomization
      visit, and (4) a Final visit. The Final visit occurs either (A) upon withdrawal or (B) after
      treatment of 3 migraine attacks. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of
      TREXIMET® versus BCM for the acute treatment of moderate/severe migraine. These two replicate
      studies were amended while ongoing to allow for the reporting of pooled data only.

      <recruitment_details>Results for the TRX109011 (NCT00573170) and TRX109013 (NCT00599157) studies were pooled for analysis. Individual studies were not analyzed or reported separately. The individual protocols were amended while ongoing to allow for pooling of study data for analysis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomized participants were treated for three separate migraine attacks with three different investigational products, assigned in randomized order, as one of six possible treatment sequences. Not all participants enrolled in the study were randomized for treatment; those participants who were randomized are said to have &quot;started&quot; the study</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Efficacy Subscore as Measured by the Revised Patient Perception of Migraine (PPMQ-R) Questionnaire 24 Hours After Treating a Migraine</title>
        <description>The PPMQ-R questionnaire was used to assess participant satisfaction with migraine medication; the answers are used to generate a total score and 4 subscales scores for efficacy, functionality, ease-of-use and bothersomeness-of-side effects. The total score was calculated as the average of the efficacy, functionality and ease-of-use subscores. Subscores could range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>
        <time_frame>At 24 hours after dosing for each attack treated with study medication. All 3 migraine attacks were to have been treated within 19 weeks of randomization (when study medication was dispensed).</time_frame>

          <description>Clinical disability for each participant was assessed using the CDQ. This scale uses one question to assess ability to perform normal or usual activities. Responses are recorded on a 5-point scale, where 1 is &quot;normal/not impaired&quot;, 2 is &quot;mildly impaired&quot;, 3 is &quot;moderately impaired&quot;, 4 is &quot;severely impaired&quot;, and 5 is '&quot;required bedrest&quot;.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were collected from the time of first dose of study medication until the final study visit (within 19 weeks of randomization). Serious AEs were also collected if they occurred prior to dosing and were related to screening procedures.</time_frame>
      <desc>AEs and SAEs were assessed in the Safety Population (SP), comprised of all 442 participants treated at least once with study medication. Only a portion of the participants who were randomized comprise the SP. Reflecting the study’s cross over design, AEs are categorized by the initial blinded treatment for the attack treated preceding AE onset.</desc>
