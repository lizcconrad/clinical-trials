    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is a disorder of
      the immune system that puts them at risk for severe infections. CGD is caused by a genetic
      defect that stops or prevents the white blood cells from killing certain bacteria and fungi.
      This condition cannot presently be cured by standard treatment with drugs or surgery. The
      course over time of CGD may differ in severity among patients, but those children who develop
      severe infection at a young age are most likely to have a more severe clinical course.
      Medicine including antibiotics, antifungals, and interferon gamma, may help some patients
      with CGD; however even with continuous treatment with these medications, most patients with
      CGD will have chronic and recurrent infections. Transfusion of healthy or normal white blood
      cells may help overcome infection, but white cell transfusions lead to allergic reactions and
      fever and the benefit of transfusion lasts only a matter of hours. Ultimately, chronic
      infections can damage or injure the body organs such as the lung, liver, or bone. Injury to
      the lung or liver can lead to lung or liver failure and death. Medicines used to treat
      infection can damage body organs such as the kidney. Infections may become resistant to
      antibiotic or antifungal treatment, and infections not responding to treatment can be deadly.

      It is now known that under specific conditions and with special treatment, blood stem cells
      (the cells that make blood) can be transferred or transplanted from one person to another.
      Stem cell transplantation has been done for patients with CGD who have a healthy brother or
      sister and who share the same immune type (HLA type) as the patient. Stem cell
      transplantation allows healthy or normal white cells from the stem cell donor to grow or
      develop in the patient's bone marrow making the donor's white cells. These healthy white
      cells can fight infection and prevent future infections for a patient with CGD.

      Patients on this study will receive stem cells from a related or an unrelated donor. The
      donor will be closely matched to the patients immune type but the donor is not a brother or
      sister. This type of transplantation has been done only a few times for patients with CGD,
      although this type of transplant is commonly done for other reasons, e.g. leukemia. The
      reason this treatment is investigational is that we do not know the likelihood of benefit
      that the patient will receive. It is possible that they will have great benefit, like some of
      the patients who have been transplanted from a brother or sister. It is possible that the
      side-effects of treatment may be too severe so that the transplant won't work.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether or not patients with CGD treated
      with a stem cell transplant from a non-matched and/or non-related donor can have a good
      outcome from the procedure with an acceptable number of side-effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to transplant stem cells we will need to give the patient drugs or high-dose
      chemotherapy to kill or destroy most of the blood forming and immune cells in the bone
      marrow. This is necessary to allow the donor stem cells to live and grow (engraft) in the
      bone marrow space. After the drug treatment is completed, the patient will be given the stem
      cells from the donor. The drug treatment is as follows:

      Day -9 Busulfan

      Day -8 Busulfan

      Day -7 Busulfan

      Day -6 Busulfan

      Day -5 Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide

      Day -4 Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide

      Day -3 Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide

      Day -2 Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, Cyclosporine, Cyclophosphamide

      Day -1 REST

      Day 0 Stem cell infusion

      The day after the chemotherapy treatment is completed, the patient will receive the healthy
      stem cells by vein, like a blood transfusion. Once in the bloodstream, the marrow cells will
      go to the bone marrow and grow.

      It is also possible that if the marrow takes, it will cause a disease known as
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To prevent GVHD, we will give the patient cyclosporine and
      Methotrexate. Methotrexate will be administered on Days 1, 3, 6 and 11 after the transplant.
      The cyclosporine therapy will continue for a longer period of time, however if the patient
      does not develop GVHD, it will be discontinued by 6 months after the stem cell transplant.
