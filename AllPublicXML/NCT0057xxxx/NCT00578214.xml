    <textblock>
      Midazolam is an approved sedative medication used for medical procedures. This study was
      being done to document the safety and efficacy of midazolam in improving anxiety, heart rate,
      and blood pressure in patients prior to undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery for the
      treatment of skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma). Midazolam may
      make a patient relaxed and sleepy, and lower blood pressure. These effects last for about 2
      hours.

      This study had two parts. In the first part, eligible patients were randomized to either
      receiving one standard dose of midazolam syrup or placebo syrup before their surgery, with
      neither the patient nor the study team knowing which patient received the study drug. In the
      second part, patients who were not eligible to participate in the randomized study or who
      refused to participate in the randomized study were enrolled in a prospective arm where they
      knew they were receiving midazolam syrup. In the prospective arm, the doses were based on the
      patient's weight, and patients were given additional doses of midazolam syrup as necessary to
      control their anxiety.

      The primary hypothesis of this study was that a single dose of oral midazolam syrup to
      patients prior undergoing outpatient Mohs micrographic surgery for skin cancer would result
      in lower anxiety scores at 60 minutes compared to placebo. In addition, the second hypothesis
      of this study was that patients given oral midazolam would have the rate of adverse events
      that was not worse than 25% higher than in the placebo group.

      The main objective of this study was to establish the safety and efficacy of midazolam in
      patients with skin cancer undergoing outpatient Mohs micrographic surgery. Patients were
      randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of a single-dose midazolam syrup for
      efficacy in producing safe anxiolysis of short duration. A parallel prospective arm of the
      study involved administration of midazolam in an unblinded fashion. Based on available
      studies of orally administered midazolam, the expectation was that the only observed adverse
      events will be minor and the major adverse event rate for midazolam would be similar to
      placebo. Data was collected on vital signs, anxiety, adverse events, and overall satisfaction
      with the anxiolytic agent.

    <description>Pulse oximetry measures the oxygenation of a patient's hemoglobin. A sensor is placed on the patient's finger. Light at red and infrared wavelengths is passed sequentially through the patient to a photodetector. The changing absorbance at each of the two wavelengths is measured, allowing determination of the absorbance. The color of the blood provides a measure of oxygenation (the percentage of hemoglobin molecules bound with oxygen molecules). A healthy young person will probably have an oxygen saturation of 95-99%.</description>

        <title>Pulse Oximetry at 30 Minutes</title>
        <description>Pulse oximetry measures the oxygenation of a patient's hemoglobin. A sensor is placed on the patient’s finger. Light at red and infrared wavelengths is passed sequentially through the patient to a photodetector. The changing absorbance at each of the two wavelengths is measured, allowing determination of the absorbance. The color of the blood provides a measure of oxygenation (the percentage of hemoglobin molecules bound with oxygen molecules). A healthy young person will probably have an oxygen saturation of 95-99%.</description>
