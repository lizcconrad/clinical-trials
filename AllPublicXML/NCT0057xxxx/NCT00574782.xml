  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an observational multi-centre study (CHALLENGE), the effects were assessed of starting
      treatment with low doses of rosuvastatin in statin naive patients with a history of coronary
      heart disease (CHD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA),
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) or diabetes (DM), on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) goal achievement. Also proportional changes in LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and the ratio TC/HDL-C were
      studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients eligible for the study were high-risk patients with a documented history of
             CHD, PVD, cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease, DM II or DM I with
             microalbuminuria. LDL-C had to be &gt; 2.5 mmol/l and the patient did not use any
             cholesterol lowering medication during the last 3 months preceding inclusion. The
             specialist made the decision to start treatment with rosuvastatin irrespective of
             study participation. Patient approved to place anonymous results at the disposal of
             AstraZeneca

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria included patients familiar with muscular pain, myopathy or liver
             function disorders (inclusive elevation of serum transaminases), patients with
             familial dyslipideamia like familial hypercholesterolaemia and familial combined
             hyperlipid
