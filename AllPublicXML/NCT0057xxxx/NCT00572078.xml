      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability and describe the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of treatment with escalating doses of sorafenib in combination with
      bevacizumab and paclitaxel for patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of a solid tumor with evidence of residual,
             recurrent, or metastatic disease. Patients must be incurable by surgical or other
             standard available therapy

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease; tumor size of ≥ 2 cm on CT scan

          -  Patients may have received prior standard taxane therapy or anti-VEGF therapy, but may
             not have progressed on both therapies. Progression on one type therapy (either taxane
             or anti-VEGF) is allowed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of central nervous system (CNS) disease (i.e., primary brain
             tumor, malignant seizures, CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis).

          -  Prior chemotherapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to registration. Patients must have recovered from
             all therapy-related toxicities

          -  Prior biologic or immunotherapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to registration. Patients must have
             recovered from all therapy-related toxicities

          -  Prior full pelvic field radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks or limited field radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks
             prior to randomization. Patients must have recovered to less than or equal to grade 1
             from all therapy-related toxicities except alopecia. The site of previous radiotherapy
             should have evidence of progressive disease if this is the only site of evaluable
             disease

          -  Major surgery (i.e., laparotomy) ≤ 4 weeks prior to randomization or anticipation of
             need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study

          -  Minor surgery ≤ 2 weeks prior to randomization. Insertion of a vascular access device
             is not considered major or minor surgery in this regard. Patients must have recovered
             from all surgery-related toxicities

          -  Peripheral neuropathy with functional impairment ≥ Common Terminology Criteria (CTC)
             grade 2 neuropathy, regardless of causality

          -  Pleural effusion or ascites that causes respiratory compromise (≥ CTC grade 2 dyspnea)

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled cardiac, vascular or infectious conditions (as
             described in the protocol) which could compromise participation in the study

          -  Patients at risk of QT prolongation such as patients with congenital long QT syndrome
             or with long corrected QT (QTc) at baseline (i.e. QTc greater than 450 msec in males,
             and greater than 470 msec in females) will be excluded

          -  Lung carcinoma of squamous cell histology (mixed tumors will be categorized by the
             predominant cell type unless small cell elements are present, in which case the
             patient is ineligible; sputum cytology alone is not acceptable).
