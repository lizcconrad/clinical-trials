  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To review chart data at the Duke Eye Center and determined whether a 3-year fluocinolone
      acetonide sustained drug delivery system (FA) safely suppressed postoperative inflammation
      when combined with phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation
      (phaco/PCIOL) in eyes with severe uveitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataracts are common in eyes with uveitis. It results from inflammation or the use of topical
      or systemic steroids. Cataract surgery can cause an unusually severe inflammatory response,
      abnormal or excessive bleeding, and unexpected postoperative IOP responses such as
      hypertension or hypotony. Previous studies showed that successful outcome is preoperative and
      postoperative control of intraocular inflammation by topical, periocular, and systemic
      steroidal or immunosuppressive agents. In patients with severe posterior uveitis, periocular
      and intravitreal injections often provide only transient effects and are associated with
      complications such as hemorrhage, retinal detachment and endophthalmitis. Oral corticosteroid
      therapy are also associated with side effects to multiple organ systems in the body. A novel
      technology that delivers corticosteroid therapy linearly via an intravitreal, polymer-coated,
      sustained release implant has been developed and FDA approved to treat severe posterior
      segment uveitis. FA implantation effectively controls inflammation over an extended period of
      time in a complicated group of patients with posterior and/or panuveitis and allows reduced
      immunosuppression. We hope to determined whether this implant, a fluocinolone acetonide
      sustained drug delivery system (FA), can safely suppress postoperative inflammation when
      combined with phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation
      (phaco/PCIOL) in eyes with severe uveitis. We hypothesize that combining the implant with
      cataract surgery will provide better surgical outcomes by suppressing inflammation during the
      postoperative period. By reviewing our own surgical data at the Duke Eye Center, we intend to
      primarily focus on the safety and effectiveness of this surgical procedure.
