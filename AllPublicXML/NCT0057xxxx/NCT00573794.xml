    <description>The IBDQ is a 32-item questionnaire that assesses how the subject felt during the 2 weeks before the measurement time point. Questions are related to symptoms the subject might have had as a result of UC, how the subject felt in general, how the subject's mood was, and social and work problems the subject might have that resulted from UC. An increase in IBDQ score indicates less impact of UC on the subject's life. The responses to each question range from 1 (significant impairment) to 7 (no impairment), with the total score ranging from 32 (very poor) to 224 (perfect health-related quality of life).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until 70 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 398 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>

        <description>The Partial Mayo score (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment [PGA]), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). Remission was defined as Partial Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore &gt; 1.</description>

        <title>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ): Change From Baseline Over Time</title>
        <description>The IBDQ is a 32-item questionnaire that assesses how the subject felt during the 2 weeks before the measurement time point. Questions are related to symptoms the subject might have had as a result of UC, how the subject felt in general, how the subject's mood was, and social and work problems the subject might have that resulted from UC. An increase in IBDQ score indicates less impact of UC on the subject's life. The responses to each question range from 1 (significant impairment) to 7 (no impairment), with the total score ranging from 32 (very poor) to 224 (perfect health-related quality of life).</description>

        <title>36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36) Mental Component Score: Change From Baseline Over Time</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a health-related survey that assesses participant's quality of life and consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems and emotional problems, general health, mental health, social functioning, vitality, and 2 component scores (mental [MCS] and physical [PCS]). MCS consisted of social functioning, vitality, mental health, and role-emotional scales. PCS consisted of physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, and general health scales. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 (poorest health) to 100 (best health) scale with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning.</description>

        <description>The WPAI:GH questionnaire was used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of ulcerative colitis in the last 7 days. The self-administered questionnaire measures the effect of the subject's health problems on work and daily activities in the previous week, specifically, the number of hours missed from work due to health problems, how much the subject's health problems affected work productivity, and how much the subject's health problems affected regular activities. Low scores indicate little or no impact of health problems on work and activities, and a negative change in the WPAI score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The WPAI:GH questionnaire was used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of ulcerative colitis in the last 7 days. The self-administered questionnaire measures the effect of the subject's health problems on work and daily activities in the previous week, specifically, the number of hours missed from work due to health problems, how much the subject's health problems affected work productivity, and how much the subject's health problems affected regular activities. Low scores indicate little or no impact of health problems on work and activities, and a negative change in the WPAI score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>WPAI:GH Activity Impairment: Change From Baseline Over Time</title>
        <description>The WPAI:GH questionnaire was used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of ulcerative colitis in the last 7 days. The self-administered questionnaire measures the effect of the subject's health problems on work and daily activities in the previous week, specifically, the number of hours missed from work due to health problems, how much the subject's health problems affected work productivity, and how much the subject's health problems affected regular activities. Low scores indicate little or no impact of health problems on work and activities, and a negative change in the WPAI score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>
