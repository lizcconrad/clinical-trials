  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FMS), defined as the presence of both chronic widespread pain and the finding
      of 11/18 tender points on examination, affects 2% of the general population. Drug therapy for
      FMS is largely symptomatic as there is not yet a complete understanding of the pathogenesis
      of the disease. In the past 17 years, supervised aerobic exercise has emerged as an important
      treatment modality to improve pain, aerobic capacity, function, and well-being. Individuals
      who are able to adhere to exercise almost always maintain the symptomatic benefits of
      exercise. Unfortunately, the rate of exercise adherence six months after the completion of a
      well-structured supervised exercise program is disappointingly low. Furthermore, although the
      efficacy of supervised aerobic exercise in the research setting is well documented, the
      applicability of such intervention in the clinic setting is doubtful. Therefore, we propose
      to conduct the Research to Encourage Exercise for Fibromyalgia (REEF), a randomized
      attention-controlled trial whose primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of
      telephone-delivered motivational interviewing (MI) to encourage exercise, in improving
      exercise adherence and self-report physical function (co-primary outcome measures) for FMS
      patients. REEF will enroll 200 FMS patients, randomizing them to either the MI group or the
      attention-control (AC) group. Participants from each group will receive a total of 6
      telephone calls within a 12-week period. Prior to the phone calls, participants from both
      groups will receive an individualized exercise prescription and 2 supervised exercise
      training sessions to get them started on an exercise program. All subjects will undergo
      comprehensive outcome assessment at baseline, week 12, week 24, and week 36. The secondary
      aim of this proposal is to determine the mediators between MI and improvement in self-report
      physical function. The proposed research is significant because our focus is the promotion of
      adherence to an exercise program, of adequate intensity, in order to maximize functioning and
      well-being for patients with FMS. The use of a predominantly home-based exercise program and
      telephone-delivered MI by a trained licensed practice nurse (LPN) could potentially make the
      proposed intervention more accessible to the greater majority of FMS patients. Furthermore,
      if proven efficacious, MI could readily be applied to other chronically painful conditions
      (e.g. chronic back pain).

    <description>Telephone Call for the Attention Control Group Each AC call will follow the same format as the MI call. During the AC call, study subjects will receive health information on important topics relevant to their illness. Specifically, there will be one topic during each phone call that includes the following: (a) overview of FMS, (b) pain, (c) fatigue (d) sleep, (e) stress, and (f) living well with FMS. The AC calls will be an avenue to transfer relevant health information from the RA to the study subject. The scheduled topics during each contact will give the call face validity (i.e., establish a credible pretense for the contact) while being neutral with respect to encouragement of exercise.</description>

    <description>Telephone-delivered Motivational Interviewing Participants will receive 6 telephone calls throughout the study. Harland et al reported that the most effective intervention for promoting exercise in the primary care setting was the most intensive treatment arm that included six MI sessions (208). Importantly, in our pilot study, participants who completed 5 to 6 phone calls achieved greater symptomatic benefits than participants who had ≤ 4 phone calls. The phone calls will be scheduled at week 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of the study. Telephone sessions may run for 30 minutes on the average</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for FMS(203)

          2. Has been on stable doses of FMS medications (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, tramadol,
             gabapentin, pregabalin, venlafaxine, duloxetine, pramipexole, tricyclic
             anti-depressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) for at least 4 weeks and
             willing to limit the introduction of new medications for FMS symptoms

          3. Age between 18-65 years old. Because the prevalence of sub-clinical coronary artery
             disease increases with older age, we are excluding those who are ≥ 66 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. FIQ-PI score &lt; 2

          2. BPI-PS &lt;4

          3. Known cardiovascular disease, including congestive heart failure; previous episodes of
             angina pectoris; previous myocardial infarction; or previous revascularization
             procedure

          4. Moderate-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including asthma

          5. Uncontrolled hypertension

          6. Orthopedic or musculoskeletal conditions that would prohibit moderate-intensity
             exercise

          7. Active suicidal ideation

          8. Planned elective surgery during the study period

          9. Ongoing unresolved disability claims

         10. Other major rheumatic conditions (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, scleroderma and other connective tissue disease)

         11. Use of medications that may affect chronotropic response to exercise, i.e.
             beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker

         12. Pregnancy

         13. Schizophrenia or other psychosis

         14. Exercising 3 days a week or more. The US Surgeon General considers a physically active
             person as somebody who does at least 3 times a week of moderate to vigorous level of
             exercise(204). Thus, we are excluding the already physically active individuals from
             the study. In the pilot study, only 4% (2 out of 50) of the potential participants
             were excluded due to being physically active.
