      1. Scientific background In patients with multiple myeloma high-dose chemotherapy followed
           by autologous stemcell transplantation is preferred to conventional therapy, since the
           superiority in respect to complete remission, complete remission duration, event-free
           survival and overall survival has been proven within well controlled clinical trials
           (Fassas et al., 2002; Goldschmidt et al., 2003).

           Nausea and vomiting are well known and the most distressing side-effects of a high dose
           chemotherapy regimen. The administration of selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonists (5-HT3
           RAs) in combination with a corticosteroid (= antiemetic standard therapy) is effective
           for the prevention of those adverse effects in 70 to 80 % of patients. However, 25 to 40
           % of the patients still suffer from vomiting and nausea in the delayed phase of the
           chemotherapy. Superior protection could be achieved with the addition of Aprepitant
           (EMEND®) to the antiemetic standard therapy in acute and delayed phases of highly
           emetogenic chemotherapies. The enhanced antiemetic protection can be maintained over
           multiple chemotherapy-cycles to an extent superior to that of standard therapy alone (de
           Wit et al., 2003).

           Furthermore addition of Aprepitant (EMEND®) to standard therapy was generally well
           tolerated and the impact of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) on daily
           life was significantly reduced (Hesketh et al., 2003; Dando &amp; Perry, 2004).

        2. Trial Rationale Aprepitant (EMEND®) is a selective high-affinity receptor antagonist of
           human substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1) and has been shown to inhibit emesis induced by
           cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and augments the antiemetic activity of 5-HT3 RAs
           (e.g. Granisetron, Ondansetron) and corticosteroids (e.g. Dexamethasone). Thus
           Aprepitant (EMEND®) in addition to antiemetic standard therapy has been shown to possess
           powerful superior protection and has been reported in several clinical trials to
           significantly improve both acute and delayed CINV.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate, during and up to 7 days after high-dose chemotherapy
      with Melphalan (moderate emetogenic drug) followed by autologous peripheral blood stemcell
      transplantation, an antiemetic treatment regimen in respect to efficacy and safety in
      patients with multiple myeloma. To the best of our knowledge effects of Aprepitant on
      Melphalan induced CINV have never been investigated.
