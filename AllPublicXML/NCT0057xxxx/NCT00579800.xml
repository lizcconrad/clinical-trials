  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate new computer software on breast magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI). The information from this study may help doctors and scientists develop better
      ways to find breast cancer, and may help future patents with cancer.

    <description>Conventional images will be taken using the standard sequences consisting of T2-weighted imaging and T1-weighted imaging before and after contrast; these will be used for the diagnostic examination. FIESTA will be performed on 50 patients, while Vibrant-DE and IDEAL will be performed on the other 50 patients.</description>
