    <textblock>
      Ciclosporin is a cyclic nonribosomal polypeptide of 11 amino acids produced by the fungi
      Tolypocladium inflatum and Cylindrocarpon lucidum. Ciclosporin is a highly efficient
      immunosuppressant drug widely used in post-allergenic organ transplant to reduce the activity
      of the subject's immune system and so the risk of organ rejection. Apart from transplant
      medicine, ciclosporin is also used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases like psoriasis and
      infrequently in rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases, although it is only used in severe
      cases.

      Ciclosporin blocks the lymphocytes, especially the T-lymphocytes, in the G0- or G1-phase of
      the cell cycle. Moreover it inhibits the production and release of lymphokines including
      interleukin 2 or the T-cell growth factor.

      Generally ciclosporin is taken orally (capsule or solution)or by injection in doses of 1.5 to
      5.5 mg/kg/day. In the topical cutaneous emulsion presented here, ciclosporin is available at
      a concentration of 0.5 and 1.5%.

      The purpose of this study is the demonstration of antipsoriatic efficacy and tolerability of
      topical cutaneous ciclosporin in subjects with psoriasis vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common dermatological disorder, consisting of both an inflammatory and a
      hyperproliferative component. Scaly, erythematous infiltrated skin lesions are indicative of
      psoriasis vulgaris. The disease is characterized micromorphologically by epidermal
      hyperplasia with incomplete differentiation, intraepidermal accumulation of polymorphonuclear
      neutrophils, elongated papillae containing dilated, tortuous capillaries and
      lymphohistiocytic infiltrate.

      Since the underlying cause of the disease remains unknown, causal therapy is not possible.
      The complex clinical picture necessitates a polypragmatic therapeutic approach. Typical
      therapies include phototherapy and photochemotherapy, topical treatment with corticosteroids,
      vitamin D3 analogs, coal-tar preparations and dithranol, and systemic treatment with
      retinoids, methotrexate and ciclosporin (oral or injection).

      In the present study the topical cutaneous ciclosporin formulation for topical treatment of
      psoriasis will be tested in low-dose for efficacy and tolerability. Two concentrations of the
      ciclosporin formulation (0.5% and 1.5%), the corresponding vehicle, a marketed corticoid
      preparation and a marketed topical Vitamin-D-analog will be tested simultaneously in the same
      patient. Five test fields located at the torso and at the extremities will be examined per
      subject, and will be treated non-occlusively on 22 study days over a period study of 26 days.

      Experimental measurements (sonography) and clinical assessments will be performed at baseline
      and on some study days.
