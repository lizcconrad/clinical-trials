  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trabectedin for the
      treatment of localized (non-metastatic) myxoid / round cell liposarcoma (malignant tumor
      derived from primitive or embryonal lipoblastic cells).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study
      following participants forward in time), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical
      school team work on a medical research study) study of trabectedin for the treatment of
      localized myxoid / round cell liposarcoma (MRCL). Trabectedin will be given at 1.5 milligram
      per meter square (mg/m^2) over a 24-hour intravenous (iv) infusion every 3 weeks for a
      minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 cycles along with dexamethasone 20 mg iv which will be given
      within 30 minutes before start of each trabectedin iv infusion. Participants whose
      myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) do not progress at the end of the neoadjuvant treatment
      will be followed every 6 weeks for disease progression or until 6 months post definitive
      surgery, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and/or disease progression. Efficacy will be
      assessed by determining the pathologic Complete Response (pCR) rate assessed in the tumor
      surgical specimen by a central pathology review. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the trial.

    <description>The objective tumor response is defined as the percentage of participants achieving partial response (PR) on tumor response assessed by RECIST. The PR is at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>
