      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the Healthy Families Durham (HFD) program by
      comparing the traditional 3-year program to 18-months of Healthy Families Durham to Yearly
      Visits with case management referrals to community services as usual, and to determine
      whether participation in the program reduces the number of reports for child maltreatment
      within the first seven years of the child's life.

    <description>For those randomly assigned to the 3-year HFD group, services begin during the third trimester of pregnancy. These families are assigned a Family Support Worker, who begins to initiate contact with the family at approximately 6 months gestation, when possible, so that the family can be engaged and services begun at seven months gestation. The Family Support Worker will provide home visiting services according the existing HFD model, which combines the empirically supported Parents as Teachers Curriculum (see attached description of the Parents as Teachers curriculum) provided in accordance with Healthy Families America standards of service delivery. The 3-year HFD group will receive services to the child's third birthday.</description>
