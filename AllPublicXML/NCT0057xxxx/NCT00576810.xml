                       digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor)

                    -  fewer than 3 defecations per week

               2. Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives

               3. There are insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (i.e.
                  recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort is not the predominant symptom associated
                  with defecation or a change in bowel habit, and with features of disordered
                  defecation)

          3. Able and willing to complete a daily e-diary

          4. Able and willing to use the trial rescue medication (i.e. 10 mg bisacodyl
             suppositories)

          5. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to enrolment into the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

             laxatives

          2. Patients whose constipation is caused by primary organic disease of the colon or
             pelvic floor

          3. Patients with metabolic disorders, neurological disorders, severe or psychiatric
             disorders, or any other significant disease or intercurrent illness (e.g.
             abdominal/gastrointestinal surgery) that, in the Investigators opinion, would
             interfere with participation in the trial

          4. Patients with restricted mobility (e.g. wheelchair bound, or bed-ridden) that, in the
             Investigators opinion, would interfere with participation in the trial

          5. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to sodium picosulphate, bisacodyl or any other
             ingredient in the study medication (sodium picosulphate and matching placebo drops,
             bisacodyl suppositories)

          6. Patients with ileus, intestinal obstruction, acute surgical abdominal conditions (such
             as acute appendicitis and acute inflammatory bowel diseases), or severe dehydration

          7. Patients with anal fissures or ulcerative proctitis with mucosal damage

          8. Patients with known clinically significant abnormal electrolyte values

          9. Patients whose concomitant therapy includes an opioid medication (e.g. morphine,
             codeine)

         10. Constipation which, in the Investigators opinion, is caused by medication (e.g.
             anticholinergics)

         11. Patients who are not willing to discontinue the use of prohibited concomitant therapy
             (see Section 4.2.2)

         12. Pre-menopausal women (last menstruation £ 1 year prior to signing informed consent)
             who:are nursing (breast-feeding) or who are pregnant OR who are of child-bearing
             potential and are not practicing an acceptable method of birth control, or do not plan
             to continue using this method throughout the study.

         13. Participating in another trial with an investigational product with 1 month of
             enrolment into this study

         14. Drug or alcohol abuse

         15. Concomitant use of antibiotics
