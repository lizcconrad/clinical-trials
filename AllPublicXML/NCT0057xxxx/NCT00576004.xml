      To evaluate the impact of Burch colposuspension (BC), as an anti-incontinence measure, in
      patients with urinary incontinence (UI) undergoing abdominal surgery for pelvic organ
      prolapse (POP) repair
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-seven women suffering from POP and UI were randomly assigned to abdominal POP repair
      and concomitant BC ( 24 patients; group A) or POP repair alone without any anti-incontinence
      procedure ( 23 patients.; group B). They were followed-up at 3, 6, and 9 months after surgery
      and then annually. The primary outcome measures were anatomical outcome and changes in
      incontinence status as indicated by a bladder diary, the number of daily pads and the stress
      test. Secondary endpoints were changes in subjective symptoms and Quality of Life (QoL) as
      measured by the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the Impact Incontinence Quality of
      Life (IIQ-7) questionnaires.

          -  Active pelvic inflammatory disease,

          -  Known hypersensitivity to synthetic materials (polypropylene, polythetrafloroethilene,

             diseases; and

          -  Any condition that in the judgment of the investigators would interfere with the
             subject's ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, place
             the subject at increased risk, or which might confound interpretation of study
             results.
