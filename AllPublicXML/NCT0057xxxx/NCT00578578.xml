  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the anti-inflammatory effects of marine omega-3 fatty acids, also known as n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), we propose a randomized, double-blinded, prospective,
      single-center trial to examine the effect of supplementary n-3 PUFA on serum high sensitivity
      (hs) CRP levels.

      Inclusion Criteria Age &gt; 18 hs CRP &gt;3mg/L and &lt;10 mg/L

      Exclusion Criteria

      Active infection Systemic Inflammatory Disease Autoimmune disorders Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE) Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma) Sjögren's
      Syndrome Behçet's Syndrome

      The Vasculitis Syndromes Including:

      Wegener's granulomatosis Temporal arteritis (Giant cell arteritis) Takayasu's arteritis
      Henoch-Schönlein purpura Predominantly cutaneous vasculitis (hypersensitivity vasculitis)
      Sarcoidosis Amyloidosis Currently on warfarin Cr &gt; 2.0 Fish Allergy Pregnancy or
      unwillingness to use some form of birth control in women of child-bearing age during the 8
      weeks.

      We will enroll 200 pts. at Willoughby Hills Family Health Center over a 2 month period 100
      pts. will receive OMEGA-3, 100 pts. will receive placebo Drug is to be taken over 8 weeks Pt.
      will return to Willoughby Hills in 8 weeks for a follow-up hsCRP. A brief questionnaire will
      be completed by the nurse/pt, including vital signs at baseline and follow-up .

      Primary Outcome:

      hsCRP levels after 8 weeks of treatment with PUFA
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be given an 8 week supply of placebo or study drug. The exact composition
      of both the active drug and placebo is detailed below. The physician and the patient will
      both be blinded. Patients will be instructed to take three capsules daily in the morning.
      Each capsule of the drug contains 450 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the active
      component. Thus, three capsules daily will result in 1350 mg daily of EPA. They will be asked
      to return to the clinic after 8 weeks of therapy for a follow-up hsCRP.

      Patients:

      Healthy patients seen in a primary care setting at the Department of Internal Medicine at the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System Willoughby satellite.

      Drug:

      Active Arm:

      1000 mg Lemon flavored Capsules. Three capsules every morning.

      Fill

      45% Eicosapentaenoic Acid 10% Docosahexaenoic Acid 10% Combined total of Docopentaneoic Acid
      and Alfa-Linoleic Acid Natural Lemon Oil Rosemary Liquid Extract D-alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E
      (67.1% W/W) (1000IU/G) Antioxidants, proprietary mix

      Shell

      Gelatin Glycerol Purified Water Lemon Oil

      Placebo Arm:

      Cornstarch Capsules provided by Clinical Encapsulation services. Three capsules every
      morning.
