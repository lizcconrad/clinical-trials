  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is one of the most common health problems in the United States. There are
      many drug treatment options for high blood pressure, but these medications are not always
      effective. People with treated high blood pressure can still suffer from other serious
      cardiovascular health problems, including heart attack, sudden death, or stroke. Genetic
      variations may cause some people to be more susceptible to these cardiovascular outcomes
      despite treatment. This study will identify new gene regions that may influence the
      effectiveness of high blood pressure drugs in preventing the above mentioned cardiovascular
      conditions.

    <textblock>
      High blood pressure affects nearly one in three individuals in the United States. There are
      many factors that can cause high blood pressure, including family history and genetic traits,
      kidney disease, stress, diabetes, and diet. If left untreated, high blood pressure can
      increase one's risk for stroke, heart attack, and heart failure. There are four major classes
      of drugs used to treat high blood pressure, which include diuretics, beta blockers,
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists. Each class works
      differently in treating high blood pressure, and certain gene regions may affect the
      effectiveness of the various high blood pressure drugs. The purpose of this study is to
      identify new gene regions that may influence the effectiveness of the four major high blood
      pressure drug types in preventing a heart attack, sudden death, or stroke.

      This study will draw upon specimens and data from three large population-based studies: the
      Group Health population, the Cardiovascular Heart Study, and the Jackson Heart Study. New
      samples of DNA and laboratory data will only be collected from participants in the Group
      Health population. The remaining samples will be pre-existing samples from the other two
      studies. Through a whole-genome study of the DNA samples, researchers will distinguish
      genomic regions of interest for the four major drug classes to identify associations between
      the drugs and genes in the population. Researchers will further genotype the &quot;interesting&quot;
      genomic regions discovered in the whole-genome study. Ethnic-specific genetic variations will
      also be identified to fully characterize the genetic variations. The study will be replicated
      to assess the validity of the findings.

        Data and specimens for this study will be collected from three population-based studies:
        Group Health population, Cardiovascular Heart Study, and Jackson Heart Study. The Group
        Health population will provide new DNA samples; the Cardiovascular Heart and Jackson Heart
        studies will provide existing DNA specimens to replicate the study findings from the Group
        Health population. The Cardiovascular Heart Study involves Americans over the age of 65.
        The Jackson Heart Study is a cardiovascular disease study in African Americans.
