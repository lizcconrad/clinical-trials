  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether donepezil HCl is effective and safe in
      improving cognitive dysfunction exhibited by children and adolescents with Down syndrome.
      Effectiveness will be measured by rating communication, daily living skills, and social
      skills and relationships in subjects aged 10 to 17.

          -  VABS-II/PCRF standard composite score &gt;55

          -  Diagnosis of DS (trisomy 21) documented by chromosomal analysis (karyotyping). If such
             documentation is not available at screening, karyotyping will be performed with the

          -  Na√Øve to approved or unapproved cholinesterase inhibitors is preferred however, prior
             use of these medications is allowed, provided that the medication was discontinued at
             least 3 months prior to screening and that it was not discontinued for lack of
             tolerability or efficacy or for the sole purpose of enrolling the subject in the
             study.

             contact with the subject to have detailed knowledge of the subject's adaptive behavior
             in order to be able to complete the VABS-II/PCRF accurately. The same individual
             should complete the form at every visit.

          -  Should be in good general health with no medical conditions that are considered both
             clinically significant and unstable

             monitored regularly prior to and during the study to ensure adequate glucose control
             (fasting blood glucose &lt; 140mg/dl and glycosylated hemoglobin [hemoglobin A1c] &lt;8% at
             screening).

          -  Thyroid disease also may be included in the study provided they are euthyroid and
             stable on treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening.

             vision and hearing (eyeglasses and/ or hearing aid permissible) sufficient for
             achieving VABS-II/PCRF composite standard scores &gt;55 and for cooperating with
             examinations and the TOVER.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages &lt;10 or &gt;17 years

          -  Active or clinically significant conditions affecting absorption, distribution or
             metabolism of the study medication (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or

          -  No reliable parent or caregiver, or subjects, or caregivers who are unwilling or
             unable to complete any of the outcome measures and fulfill the requirements of this
             study

             allowed)

          -  Evidence of active, clinically significant, and unstable gastrointestinal, renal,
             hepatic, endocrine or cardiovascular system disease

          -  Current DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or any current primary
             psychiatric diagnosis other than DS (as per DSM-IV)
