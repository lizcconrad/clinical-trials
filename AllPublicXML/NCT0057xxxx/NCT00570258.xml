    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of fulvestrant plus erlotinib versus
      fulvestrant plus placebo for subjects with metastatic breast cancer whose disease progression
      after first line hormonal therapy.

        1. To obtain preliminary estimates of the magnitude and variability of the efficacy of
           fulvestrant in combination with erlotinib in this subject population, and

        2. To obtain historically up-to-date estimates of the magnitude and variability of the
           efficacy of fulvestrant as the sole active agent in this subject population.

      The measure of efficacy for both primary objectives will be time to progression.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of fulvestrant plus erlotinib versus
      fulvestrant plus placebo for subjects with metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed
      after first line hormonal therapy.

        -  Total number of subjects planned for the trial is 130 subjects, that is, approximately
           65 subjects in each arm.

        -  Subjects will be randomized to receive fulvestrant/erlotinib (arm A) or
           fulvestrant/placebo (arm B) and stratified based on accrual center.

        -  The study is a parallel-arm double-blind study, with fulvestrant + placebo on the
           monotherapy arm, and fulvestrant + erlotinib on the combination arm.

        -  The primary variable outcome is time to progression.

        -  Subjects whose metastatic disease was diagnosed more than 12 months after completing
           adjuvant hormonal therapy are eligible to this study if their breast cancer is
           hormone-receptor-positive and after disease progression on first line hormonal therapy
           in the metastatic setting. Subjects may have received no more than one line of
           chemotherapy. While receiving one line of hormonal therapy in the metastatic setting is
           a requirement, receiving chemotherapy is not, and one line of chemotherapy in the
           metastatic setting would not exclude these subjects from the trial. Subjects who had a
           recurrence while on adjuvant hormonal treatment or within 12 months of completion of the
           adjuvant hormonal treatment are also eligible without the need to receive first line
           hormonal therapy in the metastatic setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must sign a written consent.

          2. Subjects must have estrogen- and/or progesterone-receptor-positive histologically
             confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the
             breast.

          3. Baseline measurements and evaluations of involved sites should be performed as close
             as possible to study entry, but must be within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          4. Subjects fulfilling one of the following criteria are eligible to participate in the
             study: Subjects with measurable disease as per RECIST criteria. This is defined as at
             least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest
             diameter to be recorded) as over 20 mm with conventional technique or as over 10 mm
             with spiral CT scan or MRI. Subjects with bone lesions, lytic or mixed (lytic +
             sclerotic), in the absence of measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria. The
             lytic component of at least one bone lesion should measure 20 mm with conventional
             techniques or 10 mm with spiral CT scan or MRI. At least one bone lesion satisfying
             these criteria must be outside any previously irradiated area.

          5. All subjects must be postmenopausal females defined by:

        Prior bilateral oophorectomy OR No menstrual period for 12 months or longer. If age 55

        discontinued more than 12 months ago must have had only 1 prior hormonal therapy for
        metastatic disease. Subjects who relapsed while receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy or less
        than 12 months after completing adjuvant hormonal therapy may be enrolled directly in the
        trial.

        3. No prior therapy with an estrogen receptor down-regulator (e.g. fulvestrant).
        Non-protocol concurrent hormonal therapy is not allowed. Subjects must not have had prior

        trastuzumab (Herceptin) is allowed. Subjects must not receive trastuzumab (Herceptin)
        within 3 weeks prior to randomization.

        4. Subjects must have ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. 5. Subjects must have adequate
        hematologic, hepatic, and renal function defined by the following within 4 weeks prior to
        randomization: Neutrophils &gt; 1500/mm3 and platelets over 100,000/mm3 Total Bilirubin under

        x Institutional upper limit of normal.

        6. Subjects must not be receiving therapy with anticoagulants or have other
        contraindication to IM injections.

        7. Subjects must be age over 18 years. 8. Subjects must not have a history of central
        nervous system metastasis. 9. Subjects may receive concurrent radiation therapy to painful
        sites of bony disease or areas of impending fracture as long as the radiation therapy is
        initiated prior to study entry and sites of measurable disease outside the radiation
        therapy port are available to follow.

        10. Subjects must not take the following medications while enrolled in this trial:
        ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil.

        increased risk of ocular events. The decision to wear contact lenses should be discussed
        with the patient's treating oncologist and ophthalmologist.

        15. Subjects must not suffer from medical or psychiatric conditions that would interfere
        with protocol compliance, the ability to provide informed consent, or assessment of
        response or anticipated toxicities.
