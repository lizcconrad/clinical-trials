  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about women's decision to undergo prophylactic
      surgery. This is removal of healthy organs in order to reduce risk of cancer. This study will
      help us to understand what makes women decide whether or not to have this kind of surgery.

    <textblock>
      For women with a strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer, few options exist for
      primary prevention of these cancers other than prophylactic surgery, or surgical removal of
      noncancerous organs in order to prevent occurrence of the disease. The primary aim of the
      study is to describe the stages of intention to undergo prophylactic mastectomy and/or
      oophorectomy among women seeking genetic testing for inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and
      to identify factors that influence stages of intention regarding prophylactic surgery. To
      achieve these aims, 626 women undergoing genetic counseling and testing for inherited breast
      ovarian cancer risk will be assessed before their first genetic counseling session and three
      times (1 week, 6 months and 12 months) in the year following notification of their genetic
      test results.
