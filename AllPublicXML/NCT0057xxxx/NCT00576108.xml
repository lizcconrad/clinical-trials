          -  Subject with intact skin in the targeted treatment area

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening, a negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test prior to
             randomization, and must use medically acceptable methods of birth control. All

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to KD7040 or methylparaben, or previous exposure
             to KD7040.

          -  Subjects pregnant, nursing or planning to become pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are immunocompromised or have clinically significant hematological
             abnormalities.
