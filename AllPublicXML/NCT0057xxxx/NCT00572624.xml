  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity adversely affects myocardial (muscular heart tissue) metabolism, efficiency, and
      diastolic function. The objective of this study was to determine if weight loss could improve
      obesity-related myocardial metabolism and efficiency and if these improvements were directly
      related to improved diastolic function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, interventional study in obese adults ages 21 to 50 years of age to
      determine whether weight loss could improve obesity-related myocardial metabolism and
      efficiency. Two different mechanisms of weight loss were studied: diet and exercise and
      gastric bypass surgery. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to quantitate myocardial
      oxygen consumption (MVO2) and myocardial fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Echocardiography with
      tissue Doppler imaging was used to quantify cardiac structure, systolic and diastolic
      function (left ventricular (LV) relaxation (E') and septal ratio (E/E')).

    <measure>Total Myocardial Oxygen Consumption (MVO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 16 months after gastric bypass surgery-induced weight loss, and 8 months after diet-induced weight loss</time_frame>
    <description>The evening before an imaging study, all participants were given a meal containing 12 kcal/kg adjusted body weight (=ideal body weight + ((actual body weight-ideal body weight) x 0.25)). Participants fasted until their imaging studies were completed. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) following injection of 1-^11C-acetate. Total MVO2 was calculated by multiplying the MVO2 measure by left ventricular weight.</description>

    <measure>Total Myocardial Fatty Acid (FA) Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 16 months after gastric bypass surgery-induced weight loss, and 8 months after diet-induced weight loss</time_frame>
    <description>The evening before an imaging study, all participants were given a meal containing 12 kcal/kg adjusted body weight (=ideal body weight + ((actual body weight-ideal body weight) x 0.25)). Participants fasted until their imaging studies were completed. Myocardial blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) following injection of ^30O-water. Myocardial fatty acid (FA) utilization was measured using PET after injection of 1-^11C-palmitate. The calculations that describe the relationship between the different measures of myocardial FA metabolism are: FA utilization/gram = blood flow/gram × FA uptake/gram × [average plasma free FA at the time of the 1-11C-palmitate injection]; FA utilization/gram = FA oxidation/gram + esterification/gram. Total fatty acid utilization was calculated by multiplying the fatty acid utilization rate by left ventricular weight.</description>

    <measure>Left Ventricular (LV) Relaxation (E')</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 16 months after gastric bypass surgery-induced weight loss, and 8 months after diet-induced weight loss</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately following MVO2 measurement, complete two-dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed using second harmonic imaging. Left ventricular relaxation (E') was measured at the lateral annulus. All reported measurements represent the average of three consecutive cardiac cycles. A single investigator blinded to all clinical parameters evaluated all echocardiograms.</description>

    <measure>Septal Ratio (E/E')</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 16 months after gastric bypass surgery-induced weight loss, and 8 months after diet-induced weight loss</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately following MVO2 measurement, complete two-dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed using second harmonic imaging. The early diastolic (E) velocity was measured, left ventricular relaxation (E') was measured at the lateral mitral annulus, and the E/E'(septal) ratio was calculated. All reported measurements represent the average of three consecutive cardiac cycles. A single investigator blinded to all clinical parameters evaluated all echocardiograms. The normal septal ratio from the lateral mitral annulus is &lt;5, a ratio from 5 to 10 is indeterminate, and a ratio of &gt;10 indicates elevated left atrial pressure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 16 months after gastric bypass surgery-induced weight loss, and 8 months after diet-induced weight loss</time_frame>
    <description>The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA) was used to calculate insulin resistance using the first AM, fasting glucose and insulin levels. Plasma insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and glucose levels were measured by automated hexokinase assay. A HOMA score of &lt;3 represents normal insulin resistance, a score between 3 and 5 moderate insulin resistance, and a score of 5 or higher represents severe insulin resistance.</description>

    <description>Participants attended 20 group behavioral modification sessions led by a behaviorist, a registered dietician, and a physical therapist. The meal plans ranged from 1200 to 1500 kilocalories per day, depending on subject sex and BMI, and were designed to achieve ≤1% body weight loss/week. Participants completed daily food records, and were taught a variety of weight management skills. The exercise component included strength, flexibility, balance, and endurance instruction, gradually increasing to 30 minutes of exercise 5 days/week.</description>

        <title>Total Myocardial Fatty Acid (FA) Utilization</title>
        <description>The evening before an imaging study, all participants were given a meal containing 12 kcal/kg adjusted body weight (=ideal body weight + ((actual body weight-ideal body weight) x 0.25)). Participants fasted until their imaging studies were completed. Myocardial blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) following injection of ^30O-water. Myocardial fatty acid (FA) utilization was measured using PET after injection of 1-^11C-palmitate. The calculations that describe the relationship between the different measures of myocardial FA metabolism are: FA utilization/gram = blood flow/gram × FA uptake/gram × [average plasma free FA at the time of the 1-11C-palmitate injection]; FA utilization/gram = FA oxidation/gram + esterification/gram. Total fatty acid utilization was calculated by multiplying the fatty acid utilization rate by left ventricular weight.</description>

        <title>Mean Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance</title>
        <description>The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA) was used to calculate insulin resistance using the first AM, fasting glucose and insulin levels. Plasma insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and glucose levels were measured by automated hexokinase assay. A HOMA score of &lt;3 represents normal insulin resistance, a score between 3 and 5 moderate insulin resistance, and a score of 5 or higher represents severe insulin resistance.</description>
