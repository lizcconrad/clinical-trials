      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate and sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of imatinib mesylate
      given together with sunitinib in treating patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate in combination with
           sunitinib malate in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

        -  To determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the antitumor activity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-14 in course 1 and on days 1-42
      in all subsequent courses. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive oral imatinib
      mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected on day 15 and day 43 for pharmacokinetics.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.

    <description>will start at 200 mg daily and will be escalated up to 400 mg bid.If the 400 mg bid dose is tolerated, no further dose escalation will be performed. In the case of excessive toxicity on the starting dose, the option for de-escalation is provided. Sunitinib will start at 25 mg daily and if tolerated, will be escalated to 37.5 mg daily for subsequent dose levels.</description>
