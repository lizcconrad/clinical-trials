  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are a benign but common condition among women in reproductive age. It is one
      of the most common reasons for hysterectomy since it often causes bleeding problems sometimes
      leading to anemia. Several alternative treatment regimens have been investigated that could
      replace surgery. The antiprogesterone, mifepristone, is one of the most promising drugs that
      have been tested. In addition to the inhibiting effect on the growth of uterine fibroids
      antiprogestins have been proposed to have an antiproliferative effect on breast tissue.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of mifepristone on the volume of
      uterine fibroids. The study will also address the effect of mifepristone on the breast tissue

      Other purposes of this study include:

        -  To develop a new non-surgical method for treatment of uterine fibroids

        -  To study the effect of mifepristone on the size of uterine fibroids

        -  To evaluate factors regulating fibroid growth by comparison with untreated fibroids and
           normal myometrium

        -  To study the effect of mifepristone on the amount of blood loss and pelvic pain in
           patients with fibroids

        -  To study the effect of mifepristone on proliferation of breast tissue
