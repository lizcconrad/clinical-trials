      In this study, researchers want to find out if using the VTD regimen, along with higher doses
      melphalan, in subjects who have relapsed or progressed after previous transplant(s), can be
      given safely to subjects who have failed previous transplant(s).

      Autologous transplant is now considered a standard treatment for many patients with multiple
      myeloma. An autologous transplant is a procedure in which stem cells are removed from a
      patient and then given back to the patient following intensive treatment. Doctors remove
      healthy stem cells from a patient's circulating blood system and store them before the
      patient receives high-dose chemotherapy. The stem cells are then returned to the patient,
      where they can produce new blood cells to replace cells destroyed by the treatment. The drug
      usually used before transplant is melphalan alone in 1 or 2 high doses. In past studies
      conducted at UAMS, researchers have shown that a chemotherapy treatment regimen called &quot;VTD&quot;
      is effective in patients with multiple myeloma who have failed previous treatments. VTD is a
      combination of drugs consisting of VelcadeTM (also known as bortezomib), Thalidomide, and
      Dexamethasone. In this study, researchers want to find out if using the VTD regimen, along
      with higher doses melphalan, in subjects who have relapsed or progressed after previous
      transplant(s) can be given safely to subjects who have failed previous transplant(s).

             either scheduled tandem or one autologous transplantation.

          -  Patient has measurable disease in which to capture response.

          -  Performance status of 2 as per Zubroid scale, unless PS of 3-4 based solely on bone
             pain.

          -  Patients must have a platelet count 75,000/μL, and an ANC of at least 1,000/μL.

             bilirubin &lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of childbearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy documented within one week of registration. Women of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy or radiotherapy received within the previous 2 weeks.

          -  Significant neurotoxicity, defined as grade &gt; 2 neurotoxicity per NCI Common Toxicity
