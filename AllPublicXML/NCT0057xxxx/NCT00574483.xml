  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall response to standard therapies and to the newer antiangiogenesis therapies is not
      curative, and treatment-associated toxicities may be severe. Therefore, continued evaluation
      of therapies, with different mechanisms of action, is needed for patients with metastatic
      RCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 31,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occur each year in the United
      States, with a death rate of about 11,600 annually. Many patients present with advanced or
      unresectable disease, and up to 30% of patients who are treated with nephrectomy will
      relapse. The 5 year survival rate for metastatic renal RCC is estimated at &lt; 10%. Surgical
      resection of discernible disease is the only potentially curative treatment. No significant
      improvement in survival has been demonstrated for patients with metastatic RCC who have been
      treated with systemic hormonal, chemotherapeutic, and radiation therapy. Interferon alpha has
      about a 15% objective response rate in appropriately selected patients. Administration of
      interleukin 2 (IL 2) has shown a similar response rate; however, approximately 5% of highly
      selected patients had durable complete remissions.

      Recent studies demonstrated that RCC cells harbor abnormalities of the von Hippel-Lindau
      (VHL) gene, playing a key role in the stimulation of angiogenesis by vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) in this highly vascularized tumor. The novel agents sunitinib (Sutent)
      and sorafenib (Nexavar) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of advanced RCC, and both bevacizumab (Avastin) and temsirolimus have shown
      significant activity in treatment-naïve patients. Prolonged progression-free survival has
      been reported with sorafenib and sunitinib in randomized, controlled phase 2 and 3 studies,
      and improved survival has been reported with temsirolimus in poor-risk patients in a phase 3
      randomized study.
