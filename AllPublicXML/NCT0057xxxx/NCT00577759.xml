  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of strategies to develop and foster the
      relationship between primary care practices and community resources to address specific
      unhealthy behaviors (tobacco use, poor nutrition, and lack of physical activity).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use, poor diet, and lack of physical activity are associated with the leading causes
      of significant morbidity and mortality, including coronary heart disease, hypertension,
      cancer, stroke, diabetes, and respiratory dysfunction. One solution to decreasing unhealthy
      behaviors would be to better integrate primary care providers with community resources,
      including community and public health organizations that already have the capacity and
      expertise to deliver effective interventions. This project is a randomized trial to evaluate
      different practice-level interventions to link practices to community resources to decrease
      unhealthy behaviors.
