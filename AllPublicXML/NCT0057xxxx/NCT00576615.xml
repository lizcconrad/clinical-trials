  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to relate changes in the blood flow in your brain which are
      measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to temporary changes in your memory and level
      of sleepiness while receiving the drug propofol, which is commonly used to induce relaxation
      or sleepiness for minor surgical procedures. This study will help provide us information
      which will be useful in understanding which parts of the brain are influenced by these drugs
      to affect memory and sleepiness.

      We wish to seek evidence of a neuroanatomical basis for the separation of the
      sedative/hypnotic and amnesic effects of propofol by imaging electrophysiologic and regional
      cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes to identify these. Our main hypothesis is that there are
      differing neuroanatomical regions mediating drug-induced sedation and amnesia, and that these
      can be identified by specific changes in electrophysiology and rCBF. Electrophysiologic
      changes will be mapped using a validated electroencephalographic (EEG) mapping technique, Low
      Resolution brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). (1) Changes in brain activity will be
      identified with high spatial resolution using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      statistical parametric mapping (SPM). (2) To identify key regions out of possibly many
      exhibiting changes in brain activity during propofol administration, we plan to manipulate
      drug-induced sedation by using thiopental, a sedative drug with few memory effects active at
      the same receptors as propofol.

    <description>On the day of the study infusion into the vein of a solution containing no drug, Complete about half a dozen memory tasks over the period of the study, each about 5-10 minutes in length, that involve identification of a list of words, or listen to a list of words/tones before, during, and/or after drug infusion. Allow the recording of your brain waves - the faint electrical activity constantly occurring in your brain- using the electroencephalogram (EEG) while completing memory tasks. Allow the imaging of your brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which measures images of water in your brain in a strong magnetic field, while completing memory tasks.</description>
