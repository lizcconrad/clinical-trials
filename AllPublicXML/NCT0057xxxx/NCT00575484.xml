  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present the standard management of fluid overload in patients with congestive heart
      failure (CHF) involves limiting the intake of salt and water while administering high dose
      diuretics, often at the cost of deteriorating kidney function. However, another group of
      researchers has previously shown that intravenously infusing small volumes of concentrated
      saline during diuretic dosing and liberalizing dietary salt intake while continuing to limit
      water consumption resulted in improved fluid removal in CHF patients. Furthermore, less
      deterioration in kidney function, shorter hospitalizations, reduced readmission rates, and
      even reduced mortality were observed. The present study will examine this novel therapy in a
      population of 60 patients with underlying severe CHF and kidney dysfunction hospitalized for
      the management of fluid overload. Half of these patients will receive investigational
      treatment with concentrated salt infusions and liberalized salt consumption during diuretic
      therapy. All patients will otherwise receive the standard therapies for heart failure,
      including restrictions on water consumption. This study will attempt to verify the
      improvements in clinical endpoints previously described and define the mechanisms of enhanced
      fluid removal.
