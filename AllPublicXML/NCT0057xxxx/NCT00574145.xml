      RATIONALE: Healing touch therapy may be effective in lessening fatigue in women with breast
      cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well healing touch works in treating
      fatigue in women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the ability to recruit and retain patients with breast cancer receiving
           curative radiotherapy in a Complementary and Alternative Medicine trial.

        -  To determine the acceptability of weekly healing touch therapy to patients with breast
           cancer who receive curative radiotherapy.

        -  To examine the effect of healing touch on fatigue and quality of life for patients with
           breast cancer receiving radiotherapy as a component of therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by type of treatment (radiotherapy alone vs chemotherapy
      completed prior to radiotherapy)

        -  Arm I:Patients receive healing-touch therapy administered once a week for 45 minutes by
           a healing-touch therapist for the duration of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive sham-therapy administered once a week for 45 minutes by a
           sham-practitioner (NOT a healing-touch therapist) for the duration of radiotherapy.

      Patients complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and a demographic variables
      form (age, race/ethnicity, marital status, employment) at baseline. Patient fatigue is
      measured on a weekly basis throughout radiotherapy with completion of the Brief Fatigue
      Inventory (BFI). The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast form (FACT-B) is
      completed at baseline and the end of radiotherapy. Patients undergo a 20-minute interview at
      the end of study to determine the acceptability of the intervention.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>9-items with an 11-point rating scale measures intensity of fatigue (3 items, 0 = no fatigue to 10 = fatigue as bad as you can imagine) and interference of fatigue on daily life (6 items, 0 = does not interfere to 10 = completely interferes. Each participant's score is summed with a possible minimum score of 0 and a possible maximum score of 90. A mean score was then determined.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life as Measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Form (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>36 items that measure general quality of life (27 items) and specific breast cancer concerns (9 items) on a 5-point rating scale with 0 = not at all to 4 = very much. Minimum (worst quality of life) possible score = 0 and maximum (best quality of life) possible score = 144. Physical and emotional well-being scores were reverse coded and sub scale scores were summed. Median scores for baseline and at 6 weeks were determined</description>

    <measure>Intensity of Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and off-radiation at 5 to 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 14 items on a 4-point scale scored from 0 = not at all (best feeling) to 3 = very often (worst feeling). Scores are summed and range from a minimum of 0 (no anxiety or depression) to 42 (worst anxiety or depression)and a median for each arm is determined at the specified timepoints.</description>
