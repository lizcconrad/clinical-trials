    <textblock>
      This study will compare two ways of having people respond to a questionnaire about health and
      emotional well-being: on a computer and with paper and pencil. We will see how long it takes
      using both methods. We will also ask you how you feel about using a computer to answer the
      questions.

      To determine feasibility of using the Computer Assisted Survivor Screening (CASS) as a
      routine screening measure for the survivor population. Specifically, to determine patient
      acceptance, time to completion, and burden associated with the CASS. To examine the potential
      utility of the CASS as a routine screening measure in the survivor population. To validate
      the CASS against the SCL-90-R screening measure. Calculate the sensitivity,specificity,
      positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic agreement and ROC curve of the CASS
      compared to the SCL-90. Determine the optimal cut-off scores to optimize agreement between
      the CASS and the SCL-90.
