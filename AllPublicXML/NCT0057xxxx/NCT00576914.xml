    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine whether adjuvant vinorelbine plus cisplatin and endostar
      prolongs overall survival compare to vinorelbine plus cisplatin alone among patients with
      completely resected IB-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer.

      The patients with completely resected stage IB to stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer were
      randomly assigned to the group of vinorelbine plus cisplatin plus endostar or to the group of
      vinorelbine plus cisplatin . The primary end point was overall survival; principal secondary
      end points were recurrence-free survival and the toxicity and safety of the regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an open labelled, randomized, multi-center phase III clinical trail.A total of 1108
      patients with resected stage IB to stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer will either ether
      the group of vinorelbine plus cisplatin plus endostar or the group of vinorelbine plus
      cisplatin randomly. The primary end point was overall survival; principal secondary end
      points were recurrence-free survival and the toxicity and safety of the regimens.The major
      inclusive criteria are pathological confirmed non-small cell lung cancer after complete
      resection and can tolerate chemotherapy safely.The tissue and blood samples will be banked
      for further investigation. All of the enrolled patients will be followed up until death or
      over 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer, the pathology type includes
             squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and any mixed type of
             the 3 types mentioned above.

          -  Stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer, tumor was completely resected (The type of
             surgery including lobectomy, left side pneumonectomy,bi-lobectomy).

          -  The time from surgery to first dose of adjuvant chemotherapy are mandatory between 4-8
             weeks.

          -  No evidence of tumor relapse prior to adjuvant therapy.

          -  Age 18-70, ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  Normal hematologic function.Renal function , hepatic and cardiac function will be
             within the acceptable ranges as following:serum bilirubin, AST and ALT levels below
             1.5 times of normal value.

          -  No history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy;

          -  The patient should have well compliance for chemotherapy and follow up.Informed
             consent should be obtained before treatment.
