  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We seek to improve the predictive accuracy of the nomogram to predict survival for patients
      with castrate mets disease through the addition of pathological data, the results of
      automated machine vision based image analysis of H&amp;E stained tumor tissue developed at Aureon
      Biosciences,and molecular biomarker studies (25 markers) determined by immunohistochemistry
      on tissue microarrays prepared from paraffin-embedded tumor.

    <measure>The analysis for the progressive castrate mets disease population consists of two analytical steps. The first step involved the development of a predictive model of pt survival using supervised multivariate analytical (SMA)techniques</measure>

      In a first analytical step, using only the clinical and pathological variables used in the
      original clinical mets castrate disease nomogram as inputs, supervised multivariate
      analytical techniques (SMA) were used to generate a new predictive model for patient
      survival. A similar approach will then be used to analyze a second group of approximately 223
      pts in the state of a rising PSA14 after surgery or radiation therapy treated on a sequential
      series of IRB approved trials testing conjugate vaccines also consented on IRB protocol
      90-40.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients in the first retrospective study (Stage 1) must be part of the 409 patient strong
        MSKCC cohort with progressive metastatic prostate cancer which was used for the generation
        of the original nomogram.

        For details please see original publication by Smaletz et al. Patients involved in the
        second retrospective study (Stage 2) must be part of the 223 patients with a rising PSA
        after surgery or radiation therapy who were treated on conjugate vaccine trials at MSKCC..

        For details of excluded patients on the clinical metastases castrate disease study, please
        see original publication by Smaletz et al.4
