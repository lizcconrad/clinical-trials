      The investigators are proposing that energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the central
      nervous system, the viscera and the endocrine system has the potential to enhance the immune
      system; thereby enhancing the production of killer cells to fight and destroy the human
      immunodeficiency virus.

      Acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS or Aids) is a
      collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system
      caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in humans. The late stage of the condition
      leaves individuals prone to opportunistic infections and tumors. Although treatments for AIDS
      and HIV exist to slow the virus' progression, there is no known cure.

      The investigators are postulating that energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the
      central nervous system, the viscera and the endocrine system has the potential to enhance the
      immune system; thereby enhancing the production of CD4+ T cells and other killer cells to
      fight and destroy the human immunodeficiency virus.

      The primary end point is to determine the therapeutic effects of far infrared radiation (5μm
      to 20μm wavelength) on HIV/AIDS.
