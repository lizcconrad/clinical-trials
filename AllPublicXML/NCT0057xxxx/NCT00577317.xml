  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying Flexitouch® home maintenance therapy to see how
      well it works compared with standard home maintenance therapy in treating patients with
      lower-extremity lymphedema caused by treatment for cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, or
      endometrial cancer. Flexitouch® home maintenance therapy may lessen lower-extremity
      lymphedema caused by treatment for gynecologic cancer. It is not yet known whether the
      Flexitouch® system is more effective than standard home maintenance therapy in treating
      lymphedema.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Compare the effectiveness of the Flexitouch® System to standard home lymphedema therapy
      (Manual Lymphatic Drainage) in the management of lower-extremity lymphedema in women with a
      history of cervical, vulvar, or endometrial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Compare the quality of life (QOL) and functional status between patients using the
      Flexitouch® System and those following standard home lymphedema treatment (Manual Lymphatic
      Drainage) programs in the management of lower-extremity lymphedema

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to site of cancer
      (cervical vs vulvar vs endometrial) and stage of lymphedema at diagnosis. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard home maintenance therapy and perform self-manual lymphatic
      drainage once daily for 60 minutes for 24 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive Flexitouch® home maintenance therapy once daily for 60 minutes for
      24 weeks.

      Clinical staff measure patients' lower limb (both) volumes and patients complete quality of
      life questionnaires at baseline, every 8 weeks during treatment, and at completion of study
      treatment.
