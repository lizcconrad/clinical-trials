      RATIONALE: Erlotinib and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving erlotinib together with everolimus may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving erlotinib
      together with everolimus and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety of everolimus given in combination with erlotinib hydrochloride
           in patients with metastatic breast cancer (phase I).

        -  To determine the antitumor activity of the combination (phase II).

        -  Determine the rate of clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable
           disease for at least 6 months) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (phase II).

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to progression.

        -  To determine PTEN, pAkt, pP70S6K1 and pEGFR in primary tumors at baseline.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose escalation phase I study followed by an open-label phase
      II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive escalating doses of oral everolimus and oral erlotinib
           hydrochloride once daily until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Treatment
           repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Once the MTD is reached, the recommended dose to be used in the phase II portion of the
           study is identified.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive oral everolimus and oral erlotinib hydrochloride as in phase
           I at the recommended phase II dose determined in phase I.

      Patients undergo tissue collection to evaluate tumor levels of PTEN, pAkt, pP70S6K1, and
      pEGFR at baseline in order to identify predictors of therapeutic response.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years (from
      study entry), every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.

      NOTE: Phase I completed. Investigator did not proceed with Phase II
