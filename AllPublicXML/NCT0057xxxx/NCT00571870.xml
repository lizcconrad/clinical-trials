  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists have been widely used for the prevention of
      premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surges during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH)
      for in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) since the late 1990's.

      Many years have passed since GnRH antagonists were introduced to prevent premature LH surges
      during stimulated cycles. However, there is still no consensus on the optimal GnRH antagonist
      protocol. Attempts at modifying GnRH antagonist protocols have been made to improve COH
      outcomes. However, a meta-analysis of 27 randomized controlled trials, including recent
      reports, showed significantly lower clinical ongoing pregnancy rates in the antagonist group.
      Thus, additional efforts are needed to identify the optimal stimulation protocols to achieve
      better follicular and embryonic development and to improve the pregnancy rates in COH using
      GnRH antagonist.

      Given the assumption of a detrimental effect of GnRH antagonist on the pregnancy rate, with
      current protocols, we hypothesized that a shorter duration of GnRH antagonist administration
      might improve outcome.

    <description>The GnRH antagonist, cetrorelix acetate (Cetrotide; Serono) 0.25 mg was added daily, starting when the leading follicle reached 14 mm in diameter during ovarian stimulation for IVF. When the leading follicle reached a mean diameter of 18 mm or two follicles or more reached a diameter of 17 mm, 250 Î¼g of recombinant hCG (Ovidrel; Serono) SQ was injected. In Group A, the GnRH antagonist continued to be used until the day of hCG administration. In Group B, the GnRH antagonist was not administrated on the hCG day</description>
