  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients may develop side effects during treatment, such as nausea, pain, fatigue,
      diarrhea, constipation, or shortness of breath. These symptoms may be due to the cancer
      itself, or due to treatments like chemotherapy drugs or radiation therapy. Doctors and nurses
      often ask patients about their symptoms, because an important part of cancer treatment is to
      make patients feel as well as possible. If patients do not feel well, the investigators may
      need to change the way the investigators are treating you or prescribe therapies that will
      decrease your symptoms. The best way to find out how you are feeling is to ask you directly.

      However, during your time between appointments the investigators may not be able to ask you
      how you are feeling on a regular basis. In addition, even at an appointment, there may be
      symptoms that the investigators do not have a chance to discuss.

      The investigators are interested in developing new ways to ask patients about how they are
      feeling, using the Internet. A special new website called STAR (&quot;Symptom Tracking and
      Reporting for Patients&quot;) has been developed to help patients record this information, so that
      their doctors and nurses can review it during clinic appointments. This study is designed to
      help us see if STAR is a helpful way for us to keep track of information about patients'
      symptoms and quality of life.

      This pilot study will assess patient use of STAR (Symptom Tracking and Reporting for
      Patients), an online system designed for cancer patients to self-record toxicity-related
      symptoms based on NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, performance status
      by ECOG criteria, global quality of life by the EuroQOL 5-D assessment tool, emergency room
      visits, and survival. Secondary outcomes will include patient assessment of the usefulness of
      STAR, clinician perceptions of the potential value of STAR in routine clinical practice, and
      an evaluation of whether STAR improves the patient experience of care as assessed by
      satisfaction measures.
