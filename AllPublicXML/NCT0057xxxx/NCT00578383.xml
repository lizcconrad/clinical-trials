  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether low-field magnetic stimulation (LFMS) can relieve some
      of the symptoms of depression in bipolar disorder or major depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a screening visit with the study physician and a treatment visit.
      Participants will be asked to complete several questionnaires about their mood during both
      visits. The treatment visit will involve use of the LFMS device. Participants will place the
      top of their head inside the device for approximately 20 minutes. Participants will receive
      either the actual treatment or a sham treatment and will not know which they receive. This
      device produces weak electromagnetic fields. There is no discomfort or even sensation caused
      by the device. The device has been declared to be a &quot;non-significant risk device&quot; by the FDA,
      and there are no known risks associated with its use.

    <time_frame>Once just before and once just after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A multiple choice questionnaire used to rate depression severity. Mean change from pretreatment score. 17 items reflecting depression symptoms are scored on scale of severity; 9 items are scored 0 = Absent 1 = Trivial 2 = Mild 3 = Moderate 4 = Severe 8 items are scored 0 = Absent 1 = Mild 2 = Severe. Items are summed; minimum score is 0, maximum score is 52. Higher scores represent more severe depression.</description>

        <description>A multiple choice questionnaire used to rate depression severity. Mean change from pretreatment score. 17 items reflecting depression symptoms are scored on scale of severity; 9 items are scored 0 = Absent 1 = Trivial 2 = Mild 3 = Moderate 4 = Severe 8 items are scored 0 = Absent 1 = Mild 2 = Severe. Items are summed; minimum score is 0, maximum score is 52. Higher scores represent more severe depression.</description>
