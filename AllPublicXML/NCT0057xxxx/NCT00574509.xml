      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of 131I-anti-B1 Radioimmunotherapy when
      combined with high-dose BEAM or BEAC chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation. The study will also compare the difference in response rates and time to
      treatment failure between historical control patients receiving high-dose BEAM or BEAC
      chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant and patients receiving
      radioimmunotherapy and high-dose BEAM or BEAC chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant. Patients will receive escalating doses of radioimmunotherapy with anti-B1
      radiolabeled with 131Iodine, high-dose carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and Melphalan (BEAM)
      chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

      Thirty patients will be enrolled in this study. There will be two administrations of
      131I-anti-B1 given to patients, the &quot;dosimetric dose&quot; and the &quot;radioimmunotherapy dose&quot;. The
      dosimetric dose will consist of an infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 (450 mg) immediately
      followed by an infusion of Anti-B1 (35 mg) which has been trace labeled with 5mCi of
      131I-anti-B1. The total whole body dosimetry dose is then calculated over an approximated
      one-week time interval from the radioactive clearance data obtained by the Whole Body
      anterior and posterior gamma camera scans. Based upon dosimetric data calculations specific
      for each individual patient, a radioimmunotherapy dose will be given consisting of an
      infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 (450 mg)immediately followed by an infusion of 35 mg Anti-B1
      including a patient specific dose of 131Iodine-Anti-B1. Calculations will be made such that
      in a dose escation study, whole body radiation doses of 30, 45, 60, and 75cGy will result
      from the administration of the therapeutic activity of 131I-anti-B1. The amount of the
      unlabeled Anti-B1 administered is not calculated on a body surface area basis, but is given
      to provide an excess of Anti-B1 independent of tumor burden, splenic uptake, or other causes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pts with a diagnosis of indolent or aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have
             failed &gt; 3 prior therapies, or are chemo resistant or refractory. Patients must be
             otherwise eligible for high-dose therapy with the BEAM protocol and ABMT or PSCT.

          -  Pts without evidence of severe organ dysfunction.

          -  The pre-transplant bone marrow biopsy must show no evidence of marrow involvement if
             an autologous BMT is to be performed and adequate cellularity, alternatively
             autologous PSCT will be considered if the bone marrow involvement is &lt;25%.

          -  The pt must have no other major medical problems and specifically life expectancy must
             be at least 4 months post transplant, with a performance status Karnofsky score of
             &gt;70.
