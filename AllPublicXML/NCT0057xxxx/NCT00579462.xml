  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study whether the presence of lung cancer in your body can be
      detected by testing the blood, and if the results of these blood tests change as your tumor
      shrinks or grows.

      This is a cooperative research project involving patients on the Thoracic Oncology Service at
      Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the laboratory of Dr. Peter Danenberg, Professor
      of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California / Norris
      Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles, California. The primary objectives are to measure
      the proportion of patients with advanced (stage III-IV) lung cancer with methylated genes in
      their blood, and to determine if response to chemotherapy (complete or partial radiologic
      response) in patients with advanced lung cancer renders methylated genes undetectable in the
      blood. This research project will enroll approximately 80 patients per year over 4 years to
      generate a sample size of approximately 320 patients.Blood will be collected from
      participating patients at baseline, as close as possible to the date of their baseline
      radiologic assessment. Three follow-up blood collections will be drawn, each within 7-10 days
      of each follow-up radiologic evaluation.
