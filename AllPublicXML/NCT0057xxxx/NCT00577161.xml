  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BBR 2778 is a novel aza-anthracenedione that has activity in experimental tumors and reduced
      delayed cardiotoxicity in animal models compared to reference standards. This cytotoxic agent
      has structural similarities to mitoxantrone as well as general similarities to anthracyclines
      (such as the tricyclic central quinoid chromophore7).

      This phase III study will compare the efficacy and safety of the combination BBR 2778,
      fludarabine, and rituximab with the combination fludarabine and rituximab in patients with
      relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
