      This phase II trial is studying the effects of oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil-when
      given together with Cetuximab and radiation therapy and radiation therapy to see how they
      work in treating patients with stage III esophageal cancer.

    <textblock>
      Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody which can block the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread Cetuximab may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drug used in
      chemotherapy such as oxaliplatin leucovorin and Fluorouracil work in different way to stop
      the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them form dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy X rays to kill tumor cells. Giving cetuximab could improve
      the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and may make the tumor smaller This phase
      II trial is studying the effects of oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil-when given
      together with Cetuximab and radiation therapy and radiation therapy to see how they work in
      treating patients with stage III esophageal cancer.
