      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may
      also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving monoclonal antibodies together with combination chemotherapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together
      bevacizumab works as first-line therapy, followed by combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab
      with or without cetuximab as second-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV
      colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the efficacy of bevacizumab and cetuximab as first-line treatment for
           metastatic colorectal cancer, as measured by percentage of patients who remain
           progression-free at 6 months.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate adverse events, confirmed response, duration of response, time to disease
           progression, time to treatment failure, and survival of patients treated with
           bevacizumab and cetuximab.

        -  To evaluate adverse events, confirmed response, duration of response, time to disease
           progression, time to treatment failure, and survival of patients who are refractory to
           dual-agent bevacizumab and cetuximab and are subsequently treated with modified FOLFOX7
           chemotherapy and bevacizumab with or without cetuximab.

        -  To evaluate quality of life parameters in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To estimate the direct medical resource utilization and costs.

        -  To assess the reliability of FDG-PET as a measurement of early treatment response, as
           measured by percentage of patients who are progression-free at 6 months.

        -  To identify circulating angiogenesis biomarkers.

        -  To assay the activity of pro-angiogenic factors in plasma angiogenic assays.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study*. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance
      status (0-1 vs 2) and number of metastatic sites (1 vs &gt; 1).

      NOTE: *Participating site must be PET-qualified.

        -  First-line therapy: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and cetuximab IV
           over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease proceed to
           second-line therapy.

        -  Second-line therapy: Patients are randomized* to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I (modified FOLFOX7 with bevacizumab only): Patients receive bevacizumab IV
                over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV over 2
                hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment
                repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
                toxicity.

             -  Arm II (modified FOLFOX7 with bevacizumab and cetuximab): Patients receive
                bevacizumab and modified FOLFOX7 as in arm I. Patients also receive cetuximab IV
                over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease
                progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Randomization occurs prior to receiving first-line therapy.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for translational studies. Samples are
      analyzed for circulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells via flow
      cytometry; angiogenic activity of serum/plasma in angiogenesis-dependent diseases via
      endothelial proliferation assay and matrigel tube formation assay; and circulating
      angiogenesis biomarkers (i.e., free VEGF, soluble FLT-1, and KDR) via ELISA.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically using the UNISCALE, Skindex-16, and Skin Assessment
      Questionnaires.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years.
