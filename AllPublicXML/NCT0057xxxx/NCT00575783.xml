    <textblock>
      The research study is designed to examine the impact of low blood sugar on brain function in
      individuals with Type 1 Diabetes who have frequent and severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
      compared to those who do not.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the course of treating diabetes (for example, after an insulin injection), blood sugar
      levels will sometimes drop too low. This condition is known as hypoglycemia. Normally, a
      healthy body responds to hypoglycemia by producing a number of &quot;anti-insulin&quot; hormones which
      raise blood sugar levels. In addition, these hormones provide the individual with warning
      signals of hypoglycemia, including hunger, sweating, shaking and heart palpitations. These
      warning signals allow diabetics to correct low blood sugar levels by eating sugar tablets or
      by having a snack.

      Unfortunately, and for unclear reasons, many people with longstanding diabetes lose their
      ability to recognize low blood sugar levels-a condition called &quot;hypoglycemia unawareness.&quot;
      The brain, in particular, is extremely sensitive to hypoglycemia. Unable to sense and respond
      to low blood sugar levels, these individuals may experience a sudden onset of blurred vision,
      confusion, seizures, coma, or even death.

      In recent years, a new technique called &quot;islet cell transplantation&quot; has been developed as an
      alternate means of treating insulin-dependent diabetes. Pancreatic islet cells (the cells
      that produce insulin), from human donors, are injected into the diabetic patient's liver
      where the cells are capable of making insulin and can regulate blood sugar levels without the
      need for insulin injections. Currently, this technique is used primarily in patients with
      severe hypoglycemia unawareness.

      While it is known that islet cell transplantation can reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia,
      the effects of transplantation on hypoglycemia unawareness are unknown. This study is
      designed to investigate why hypoglycemia unawareness happens and the impact it has on brain
      function in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
