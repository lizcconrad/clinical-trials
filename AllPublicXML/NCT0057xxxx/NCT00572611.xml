    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to define the absorption and excretion kinetics of
      bilastine in man following oral administration, and to investigate the nature of the
      metabolites present in plasma and excreta. The secondary objective of the study is to assess
      the safety and tolerability of bilastine

      Primary Endpoints are: Whole blood and plasma concentrations of total radioactivity and
      parent drug. Urine and faecal recovery of total radioactivity. Characterisation and
      identification of metabolites in plasma, urine and faeces.
