      RATIONALE: Giving intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy, such as
      etoposide and cyclophosphamide, before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of
      cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem
      cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help
      the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
      Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's
      normal cells. Giving IMRT together with chemotherapy before transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) when given together with etoposide and
      cyclophosphamide followed by donor stem cell transplant and to see how well they work in
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML).

      OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose [MTD] of large field image-guided
      IMRT, using helical tomotherapy when given in combination with intravenous cyclophosphamide
      and VP-16 as a preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling or unrelated donor in patients
      with ALL or AML with induction failure or in relapse. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicity
      at each dose level standard. (Phase I) III. To collect data on the radiation dose to normal
      organs and bone marrow using tomotherapy targeted total-body irradiation (TBI). (Phase I) IV.
      To estimate the overall survival probability, disease free survival probability and relapse
      rate associated with this regimen. (Phase II) V. To characterize the treatment related
      mortality and toxicity profile (early/late) associated with this regimen. (Phase II) VI. To
      descriptively compare the outcomes of patients treated on this protocol to a comparable
      patient population conditioned with whole body radiation. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) followed by a phase II study.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients undergo IMRT using helical tomotherapy once or twice daily on
      days -10 to -6 or -10 to -7. Patients also receive etoposide intravenously (IV) on day -6 or
      -5 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -4 or -3.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow
      transplantation on day -1 or day 0. After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up periodically for up to 2 years.
