    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this exploratory study is to measure orocecal transit time using the
      SmartPill ambulant capsule technology and to compare this with the lactulose hydrogen breath
      test. Additionally, the ability of the SmartPill GI Monitoring System to discriminate between
      healthy human subjects and patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth will be explored
      using analyses of both pH and pressure patterns within the stomach and small intestine. The
      study will be performed in both normal subjects and patients with and without small bowel
      bacterial overgrowth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO), an increasingly recognized malabsorptive condition
      caused by the excessive growth of bacteria in the small bowel, results in a spectrum of
      symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating abdominal discomfort and weight loss. Multiple factors
      both internal and external to the individual prevent excessive small bowel bacterial
      colonization and determine the types of bacteria present. The most important factors within
      the individual are normal small bowel motility, which prevents attachment of ingested
      organisms, and gastric acid, which destroys many organisms before they reach the small
      intestine. The determination of small bowel motility is problematic due to limitations of the
      tests available (e.g., hydrogen breath test, scintigraphy and manometry).

      The SmartPill capsule is a recently developed novel device that, following its ingestion, can
      measure pH, pressure and temperature as it moves through the gastrointestinal tract. These
      recordings can be used to measure gastrointestinal transit and, potentially, other aspects of
      gastrointestinal motility/function. Previous studies using this device have demonstrated the
      ability of the SmartPill to measure the gastric residence time using the duration of acidic
      pH recording with good correlation between the gastric residence time of the SmartPill
      capsule and conventional gastric emptying scintigraphy.

    <description>Oro-cecal transit time is the period of time needed by the head of the meal to reach the cecum, which is frequently used as an indicator of small intestinal transit time. Oro-cecal transit was to be determined simultaneously in the study subjects by both the SmartPill technique and the lactulose H_2BT technique.</description>

    <description>Subjects with symptoms suggestive of small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO) (e.g., diarrhea, bloating, abdominal discomfort) for at least 3 months will be divided into 2 groups based on the results of their previous testing for SBBO (5 SBBO positive patients, 5 SBBO negative patients).
The symptomatic participants will report for simultaneous lactulose hydrogen breath test (H_2BT) and SmartPill study after an overnight fast. They will swallow the SmartPill Capsule at the study site. After 4 hours, they will be allowed to leave the study site and consume their usual diet. They will return for removal of the data recorder 5 days later.
After the capsule has been demonstrated to be passed from the subject, the subjects with SBBO present will then enter into an open-label treatment using Rifaximin (400 mg PO TID) for 7 days.</description>

        <title>Oro-cecal Transit Time as Measured by SmartPill</title>
        <description>Oro-cecal transit time is the period of time needed by the head of the meal to reach the cecum, which is frequently used as an indicator of small intestinal transit time. Oro-cecal transit was to be determined simultaneously in the study subjects by both the SmartPill technique and the lactulose H_2BT technique.</description>
        <time_frame>baseline to passage of SmartPill, passage of SmartPill estimated no more than 72 hours from baseline</time_frame>
        <population>Data were not analyzed as study was terminated early due to low enrollment.</population>

            <title>Healthy Participants</title>
            <description>Healthy Participants will report for simultaneous lactulose hydrogen breath test (H_2BT) and SmartPill study after an overnight fast. They will swallow the SmartPill Capsule at the study site. After 4 hours, they will be allowed to leave the study site and consume their usual diet. They will return for removal of the data recorder 5 days later.</description>

            <title>Symptomatic Participants</title>
            <description>Subjects with symptoms suggestive of small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO) (e.g., diarrhea, bloating, abdominal discomfort) for at least 3 months will be divided into 2 groups based on the results of their previous testing for SBBO (5 SBBO positive patients, 5 SBBO negative patients).
The symptomatic participants will report for simultaneous lactulose hydrogen breath test (H_2BT) and SmartPill study after an overnight fast. They will swallow the SmartPill Capsule at the study site. After 4 hours, they will be allowed to leave the study site and consume their usual diet. They will return for removal of the data recorder 5 days later.
After the capsule has been demonstrated to be passed from the subject, the subjects with SBBO present will then enter into an open-label treatment using Rifaximin (400 mg PO TID) for 7 days.</description>
