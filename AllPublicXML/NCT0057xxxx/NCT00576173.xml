  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and safety of 37.5mg
      Tramadol hydrochloride/325mg Acetaminophen in the treatment of breakthrough pain in cancer
      patients.

    <textblock>
      The combination of tramadol HCI/acetaminophen provides a more rapid onset of action compared
      to tramadol HCI alone and a longer duration of action than acetaminophen alone. Therefore,
      the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen may be effective for the treatment of cancer
      pain as well as to allow lower cumulative daily dosages of each medication to be used.This is
      an open-label study. Patients will receive one-dose treatment of 37.5mg Tramadol/325mg
      Acetaminophen tablets.This study has been designed to investigate the following
      hypothesis:Tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen is effective in the treatment of breakthrough
      pain in cancer patients.The patients will complete basic questions on side effect at visits
      on entry, 10, 30 mins, and 1h.

      The patients will receive only one dose treatment of Tramadol hydrochloride/Acetaminophen
      oral tablets throughout the study. The number of oral tablets be given will be depend on the
      total daily dose of around-clock medications. If around-clock medication is Tramadol &lt;=400mg
      or codeine &lt;=300mg or morphine &lt;60mg, the breakthrough pain medication will be 1 tablet. If
      around-clock medication is morphine 60-120mg or Fentanyl &gt;=25 ug/hr, the breakthrough pain
      medication will be 2 tablets.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histologically, radiologically or haematologically confirmed
             malignancy whose pain is judged by the investigator to be caused by the malignancy

          -  Patients must have been on a stable daily dose of weak opioids or strong opioids for
             at least 72 hours prior to the start the study and must remain at the same dosage for
             the duration of the study

          -  Patients must have a VAS (Visual analog scale) &gt;=40mm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have taken either morphine with daily dose more than 120mg or Fentanyl
             with daily dose more than 50ug/hr

          -  Patients with significant abnormalities in hepatic or renal function which would, in
             the opinion of the investigator, prevent the patients involvement in the study

          -  Patients with significant clinical abnormalities in CNS, respiratory or cardiovascular
             function, which in the investigators judgement prevents participation in the study

          -  Patients who have taken antidepressants or anti-epileptic drugs, sedative hypnotics,
             selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, short-acting analgesics, topical medications
             and anesthetics and/or muscle relaxants when taking Tramadol/Acetaminophen
