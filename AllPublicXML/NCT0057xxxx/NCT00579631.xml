  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the health behaviors of young adults who have been
      treated for cancer, leukemia, or similar illnesses. We will also ask you some questions about
      your family members' and friends' health behaviors. We plan to use the findings from this
      study to design new programs to help teenage cancer survivors resist doing things that might
      harm their health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to explore cancer-risk behaviors and future behavioral intentions among
      adolescent cancer survivors (i.e., 14-19 years old) and compare them to their &quot;healthy&quot; peers
      using population-based normative data. Additionally, it seeks to determine the significant
      theory-driven covariates related to adolescent survivors' health behaviors, which will aid in
      the design of future behavioral interventions.
