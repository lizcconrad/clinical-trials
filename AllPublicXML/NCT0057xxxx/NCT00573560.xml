    <textblock>
      The CardioKinetix Ventricular Partitioning Device (VPD) is intended to isolate the
      malfunctioning portion of the left ventricle in patients with symptoms of heart failure due
      to ischemic heart disease. By isolating the malfunctioning portion of the left ventricle, it
      is hypothesized that the left ventricle will pump more effectively.
