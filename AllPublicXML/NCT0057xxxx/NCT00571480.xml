    <textblock>
      Ear acupuncture has been used as treatment for various pain symptoms. Pregnancy related low
      back pain can be debilitating for pregnant women but there is lack of effective treatment.
      Owing to the unique circulation system between mother and fetus, prenatal care providers and
      gravidae are reluctant to prescribe or accept the pharmacological intervention. Thus the goal
      of this clinical investigation is to determine whether ear acupuncture can be used as
      treatment for this special clinical entity. The participants are randomized into one of the
      three interventions based on a computer generated randomization table. These three
      interventions groups are: (1) True acupuncture (2) Sham acupuncture and (3) no acupuncture.
      All participants are allowed to use standard of care (SOC) as a rescue treatment and the SOC
      consists of acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours no more than 4 times per day, frequent rest
      and topical warm/cold compress. The participants in group 1 &amp; 2 received a total of three
      continuous retained ear acupuncture needles at three sites ipsilateral to the dominant hand
      in preselected ear acupuncture points for one week then after day 7. All participants are
      followed/observed for a total 2 weeks after the initiation of the study.
