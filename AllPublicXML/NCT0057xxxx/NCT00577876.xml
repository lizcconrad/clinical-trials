  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with Prostate Cancer advances in medical technology have enabled us to identify
      &quot;accessory&quot; (additional) pudendal arteries (called APA) while performing a laparoscopic
      radical prostatectomy (a scope with a video camera is used during the surgery). APAs running
      near the prostate gland are identified in approximately 1 in 3 to 4 patients. However, large
      APAs, like the ones looked for in this study, are identified in 15-18% of all patients. These
      arteries are preserved more than 80% of the time, depending on their size and location.With
      this study, we plan to evaluate whether APAs supply blood to the penis and male erections, as
      well as the amount supplied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall, approximately 50% of patients become impotent (inability to achieve or maintain an
      erect penis; also called erectile dysfunction) after radical prostatectomy (removal of the
      prostate). It is already known that postoperative (after surgery) erectile dysfunction does
      not depend solely on the preservation of the nerves going to the penis, but also to the
      preservation of the arteries bringing blood to the penis.

      Although, the presence and frequency of APAs have been studied, and the ability to preserve
      them has also been noted, we still do not know how much these arteries contribute to a male's
      erection. With this study, we plan to evaluate whether APAs supply blood to the penis and
      male erections, as well as the amount supplied. While there is no immediate benefit to you
      for participating in the study, these findings will further help our understanding of APA's
      and the importance in preserving them during surgery.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the proportion of men with APAs for whom APAs
      contribute to penile blood flow. The secondary aim is to describe peak systolic, diastolic
      and resistive index velocities of the dorsal artery of the penis before and after clamping of
      the APA.

    <description>Day of Surgery:Patient is admitted through the Preoperative Surgical Center (PSC). If a large APA is identified, then subject will continue on study Dissect APA (without any changes from what is routinely done) with a penile injection of Trimix. Once the initial Doppler Ultrasound is completed, the accessory pudendal artery will be temporarily clamped to stop blood flow. After the artery is clamped, the Doppler Ultrasound will be repeated. We estimate an extension of the surgery no longer than 5 or 10 minutes in comparison to the usual operating time. Once the Doppler Ultrasound is completed, the clamp will be removed and the surgery continued in its usual fashion.</description>

    <description>In case a large APA was identified, it will be dissected following the usual technique. Upon completion of the dissection, patients will have intracavernosal injection of 10 units (0.1 ml) of a Trimix administered (PGE1 10 mcg/ml, papaverine hydrochloride 30 mg/mL and phentolamine mesylate 1mg/mL.
Once the patient achieves a pharmacologic erection, the initial Doppler Ultrasound is completed, the accessory pudendal artery will be temporarily clamped to stop blood flow. After the artery is clamped, the Doppler Ultrasound will be repeated. We estimate an extension of the surgery no longer than 5 or 10 minutes in comparison to the usual operating time. Once the Doppler Ultrasound is completed, the clamp will be removed and the surgery continued in its usual fashion.</description>
