  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a common and important health issue. Although effective treatment is often
      available for localized disease, metastatic prostate cancer remains incurable. The initial
      treatment for metastatic prostate cancer often includes medical or surgical treatments that
      deprive the tumor of male hormones (androgens) required for growth. Although this treatment
      is successful for many patients, the cancer may eventually return in others. Recurrent
      prostate cancer may be treated with additional hormonal agents, but these agents usually do
      not result in long-term control of the disease. Eventually most patients with recurrent
      prostate cancer progress to a state where the cancer grows despite very low level of
      circulating male hormones known as androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC).

      Patients will undergo a screening procedure to determine eligibility of trial. During the
      treatment period, the patient will be given docetaxel/bevacizumab on day 1 followed by RAD001
      continuously on days 2-21 and this is called a treatment cycle. Patients will be able to
      continue to receive multiple treatment courses as long as the cancer does not get worse and
      the person does not develop other problems that would prevent him from staying in the study.
      The final part of the research is the study completion period which includes an end of
      treatment visit and subsequent follow-up visits. These visits take place whenever the
      research medication is stopped, even if it is stopped early. For the patient's safety, he/she
      should at least complete the end of treatment visit.

             defined as any one of the following:

          -  Measurable Disease: Objective evidence of increase &gt; 20% in the sum of the longest
             diameters of target lesions from the time of maximal regression or the appearance of
             one or more new lesions (Modified RECIST Criteria)

          -  Bone Scan Progression: Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan attributable
             to prostate cancer

          -  PSA Progression: An elevated PSA (≥ 5 ng/ml) which has risen serially from baseline on
