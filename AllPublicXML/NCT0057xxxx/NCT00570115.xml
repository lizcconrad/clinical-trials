    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with obstructive sleep apnea have
      any changes in left atrial morphology and function evaluated by echocardiography three
      dimensional
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have been suggesting that Obstructive Sleep Apnea contributes to
      deterioration of left ventricular diastolic function . It may lead to atrial myocardium
      stretching and enlargement which may be associated to increased risk of cardiovascular
      events. We hypothesized that morphological and functional LA changes might be found using
      three dimensional echo, and that such alterations are related to obstructive sleep apnea
      presence.

        The investigators recruited 56 recently diagnosed OSA patients, confirmed by full
        polysomnography (PSG), referred to Sleep Laboratory of Psychobiology Department of Federal
        University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, according to the following inclusion criteria: both
        genders aging from 29 to 70 years old, with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;5 events/hour of
        sleep. Control group comprised 50 healthy community subjects without OSA confirmed by full
        PSG, matched by age, gender, and BMI.
