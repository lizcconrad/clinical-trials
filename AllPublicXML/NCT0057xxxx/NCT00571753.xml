  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to compare safety and efficacy of isoniazid administered as an
      adjusted dose based on NAT2 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase type 2)genotype and as a standard
      dose.

      The hypothesis is that the genotype-adjusted dose is superior to the standard dose with
      regard to hepatotoxicity and early treatment failure, respectively, in the group of slow and
      rapid acetylators of NAT2.

             therapy is indicated

          -  Patient has a smear-positive sputum

          -  Patient has radiological evidence of a pulmonary infiltrate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known contraindications for isoniazid: acute hepatitis, macroscopic
             hematuria, allergy to isoniazid, peripheral neuritis, coagulopathy, severe

             of biochemical or serological tests by eligibility assessment (relevant abnormalities
             of the following liver tests: ALT, AST, AP, total and conjugated bilirubin; positive
             serology for hepatitis), if the assessed risk-benefit ratio for the participation in
             the study is unfavourable (inclusion upon a decision of clinical investigator)

             may be included

          -  Patients with diabetes mellitus

             Acceptable alternatives of effective contraception are also sexual abstinence or
             vasectomized partner. In contrast, oral contraceptives are not recommended, since the
