  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older people living in nursing homes do not sleep very well for many reasons. Sleep disorders
      such as sleep apnea (when someone briefly stops breathing during sleep), and night time
      urination, along with the problems caused by the nighttime environment of the nursing home,
      such as noise and disruptive care routines can all contribute. Poor sleep can lead to other
      health problems or make existing health problems worse.

      This study will evaluate how well a sleep hygiene intervention and a medication for sleep
      (ramelteon (Rozerem)) work to improve sleep in nursing home residents with poor sleep.
      Ramelteon is FDA approved and has been tested in older adults living in the community, but
      not in older adults living in nursing homes. We expect sleep to improve on the study drug
      along with the sleep hygiene intervention, in comparison to placebo along with the sleep
      hygiene intervention. Based on adverse events reported in previous samples of older subjects,
      we expect the study drug to cause few side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how well Ramelteon works by measuring sleep at night and during the day.
      After consenting and final determination of eligibility, participants will complete a
      baseline phase to assess usual sleep, as well as daytime alertness and activity , thinking
      and memory, walking and balance (among those who walk and/or stand), and mood. Sleep at night
      and during the day will be objectively assessed with wrist actigraphs in all subjects.
      Approximately half will also receive polysomnography to assess nighttime sleep. Subjects who
      sleep more than 75% of the time they are in bed will not continue in the study. Subjects that
      do not have improved sleep with the sleep hygiene program will be randomized to one of two
      treatment groups - one will receive the active drug along with the sleep hygiene intervention
      and the other will receive a placebo along with the sleep hygiene intervention. Following
      randomization, subjects will complete a brief run-in phase and then enter the treatment
      phase. Assessment of sleep and other measures will be repeated.

      The primary hypotheses to be examined in this study are as follows:

      Hypothesis 1: Subjects treated with ramelteon in addition to a sleep hygiene (SHI) will have
      improved sleep latency, and as a consequence, a significant increase in actigraphically
      measured sleep efficiency, compared to subjects treated with placebo plus a SHI.

      Hypothesis 2: Subjects treated with ramelteon in addition to a SHI will sleep less and spend
      less time in bed during the day, be more engaged in daytime activities, and have better mood
      than subjects treated with placebo plus a SHI.

      Hypothesis 3: Changes in daytime sleep, time in bed during the day, engagement in activities,
      and mood will be positively correlated with improved sleep efficiency among subjects
      receiving ramelteon in addition to a SHI.

    <description>Trained research technicians observed the subjects behavior during assessment phases every 15 minutes for one full minute. Specific behavioral definitions were employed to record whether the subject was in or out of bed, awake or asleep (eyes closed with no purposeful movement for at least 60 consecutive seconds), actively engaged in an activity (reading, watching television, conversation, a specific group activity, etc), and whether any physical or verbal agitation was noted.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were long-stay residents of NHs in the Atlanta area who were &gt; age 65. Potential subjects were initially screened using administrative data and medical record review. Potential subjects who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria after initial screening were approached for informed consent or proxy consent was obtained when applicable.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Those for whom consent was obtained underwent a clinical assessment and baseline measures . Only subjects with 5-night average sleep latency &gt; 20 minutes and/or sleep efficiency &lt;80% were included . Subjects with severe sleep apnea were excluded and referred to their primary physician. Subjects unable to tolerate the actiwatches were excluded.</pre_assignment_details>
