      This research study seeks to find new ways to treat people with Waldenstrom's
      Macroglobulinemia (WM). The study is for participants with slow growing WM who otherwise
      might not need therapy for at least 3-6 months. Simvastatin is a drug approved by the FDA for
      lowering cholesterol. In test tube studies the study drug appears to have direct anti-cancer
      effect against WM tumor cells and mast cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To define objective response, time to progression and safety of Simvastatin in Waldenstr√∂m's
      Macroglobulinemia.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      For this phase II study, a single-stage design is used to evaluate the efficacy of
      Simvastatin. With a target enrollment of 30 participants, the 95% exact confidence bounds
      surrounding the response estimate will be no wider than +/- 19%.

    <time_frame>Assessed at month 1 and 3 and thereafter every 3 months while on therapy. Median duration on treatment was 6 months (range 1-24 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is defined as achieving partial response or better on therapy based on the Consensus Panel Recommendations from the 2nd and 3rd International Workshop on WM [Weber et al, 2003; Kimby et al, 2005]. Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of serum monoclonal (SM) Immunoglobulin (Ig) E (IgE), measured centrally; resolution of adenopathy/organomegaly upon physical exam and computerized tomography (CT) scan; lymph nodes =&lt;1.5 centimeters; absence of malignant cell by bone marrow histologic examination. Partial Response (PR): a &gt;=50% reduction from baseline in the SM IgM concentration. Minor Response (MR): &gt;=25%, but a &lt;50% reduction of SM IgM from baseline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at month 1 and 3 and thereafter every 3 months while on therapy; Assessed every 6 months for up to 2 years of follow-up. Median follow-up in this study cohort was 6 months (range 2-18 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is the defined as the time from study entry to disease progression (PD) or death based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Patients alibe without PD are censored at the date of last disease evaluation. PD is defined as a greater than 25% increase in serum IgM monoclonal protein levels from the lowest attained response value as determined by serum electrophoresis, confirmed by at least one other investigation, or progression of clinically significant disease related symptom(s).

          <title>Progression-Free Survival</title>
          <description>Progression-free survival is the defined as the time from study entry to disease progression (PD) or death based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Patients alibe without PD are censored at the date of last disease evaluation. PD is defined as a greater than 25% increase in serum IgM monoclonal protein levels from the lowest attained response value as determined by serum electrophoresis, confirmed by at least one other investigation, or progression of clinically significant disease related symptom(s). [Consensus panel criteria: Weber et al, 2003; Kimby et al, 2005].</description>
