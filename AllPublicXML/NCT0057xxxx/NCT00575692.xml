  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to identify changes in the cardiovascular system in patients
      with pulmonary hypertension (PH) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is accepted as
      golden standard method for the evaluation of left and right ventricular morphology and
      function.

      All patients who showed elevated pulmonary pressure in the right heart catheter investigation
      are assigned to MRI. Parameters derived from MRI are included in the clinical and therapeutic
      decisions. Well established as well as new MRI parameters are evaluated and compared to the
      results of right heart catheter. Further age-matched controls without known cardiac or
      pulmonary disease are investigated by native MRI.

    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected, latent and manifest PH and controls are investigated by MRI
      according to the following protocol in breathhold or free breathing (depending on the
      patients' breath-hold abilities). In case of elevated Creatinin values, no contrast agent is
      applied.

        -  Planning of cardiac views: Planning of 2-chamber view, short axes view and 4-chamber
           view.

        -  Morphological overview: Transversal and coronal Haste images

        -  Left and right heart functional and valve evaluation: Cine 2-chamber imaging,
           Multi-slice cine 4-chamber imaging, Cine Left and Right ventricular outflow tract
           imaging and Multi-slice cine short axes imaging covering the left and right ventricle
           for evaluation of EDV, ESV, SV, EF, CO and muscle mass.

        -  Phase Contrast Imaging: Flow measurements in the aorta, the pulmonary artery and the
           heart.

        -  Perfusion measurement.

        -  Late enhancement measurement: Multi-slice short axes view, multi-slice 2-chamber view
           and multi-slice 4-chamber view.

        Cardiac MR is recommended to all patients with suspected, latent and manifest PH who are
        investigated by right heat catheter in the Department of Pulmonology. Patients with
        pacemaker, agoraphobia or other standard MR contraindications are excluded from the study.
