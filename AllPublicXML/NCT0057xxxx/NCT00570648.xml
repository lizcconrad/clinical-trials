      Hypothesis: 1% sodium hyaluronate (Healon), applied at end of surgery to the surface of a
      corneal transplant will not shorten graft reepithelialization time when compared to coating
      with nothing. We also wish to measure and compare visual acuity in this immediate post
      operative period. We also wish to assess the safety of using this agent on the epithelium
      post-operatively.

      We will recruit 50 high risk patients (see inclusion criteria) here at the University of
      Virginia to randomly receive nothing or sodium hyaluronate (Healon) on the ocular surface at
      the end of surgery, and follow time to reepithelialization of the corneal transplant grafts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corneal transplant is one of the most common transplant procedures, with over 32,000
      recipients in the United States in 2005 and a similar number estimated in 2006. The immediate
      post-operative period is very important in determining the quality of the graft and often its
      overall chance of survival. The corneal epithelium is replaced by the recipient epithelium
      after transplant and this should usually take place in no more than 1 week. This
      reepithelialization is very important for healing, recovery of the epithelial barrier against
      infectious agents, and for recovery of vision through the graft. Grafts that take longer to
      heal can invite not only infection and hinder visual recovery, but be permanently scarred,
      thinned, and even perforate/fail. Thus rapid reepithelialization is crucial. This becomes
      even more crucial for monocular patients who need quick recovery.

      Currently there is no universal agent that is used to coat the surface at the end of surgery
      before patching. Previous animal studies have shown that sodium hyaluronate will promote
      rapid migration of cells as well as stimulate cell proliferation leading to rapid wound
      closure (1,2). In 1987 one smaller study showed that topical sodium hyaluronate (Healon) may
      foster improved epithelial healing but it was used intraoperatively and presented technical
      challenges (3). A more recent non-randomized, retrospective study found that sodium
      hyaluronate at the end of surgery to coat the ocular surface shortened reepithelialization
      time. This was in comparison to dexamethasone/oxytetracycline ointment and
      neomycin/dexamethasone drops, both of which hinder reepithelialization (4). To date we know
      of no prospective, randomized, double-blinded studies that compare the application of sodium
      hyaluronate versus nothing (currently the practice at UVA).
