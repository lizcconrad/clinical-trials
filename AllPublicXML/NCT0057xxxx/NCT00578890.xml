  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteomyelitis is a frequent complication of diabetic foot ulcer. Several therapeutic
      strategies are used : medical treatment with antibiotics and foot offloading or surgical
      treatment consisting in the resection of infected bone and a shorter antibiotic course. The
      medical treatment risk is a longer healing time and a risk of bone infection relapse. The
      surgical treatment risk is the ulcer relapse because of the modification of the foot
      structure. These treatments need to be compared in terms of benefit/risk ratio. Our
      hypothesis is : 1) in the medical treatment group a 7 month mean healing time of and a 15%
      osteomyelitis recurrence rate;2) in the medical-surgical treatment group a 4 month mean
      healing time and a 10% osteomyelitis recurrence rate.

      The study aim is to compare the rate of therapeutic success of the secondary ostéite with a
      wound of the foot diabetic, obtained either by a single medical coverage(care), or by a
      medical surgical coverage(care). The therapeutic success being defined by the association of
      1) the absence of local distribution(broadcasting) of the ostéite 2) the healing of the wound
      3) in 12 months of the healing the absence of local recurrence of the ostéite
