  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol we combine two available and reliable treatments - lumpectomy and RFA. This
      combination method will provide for excision of the cancer as routinely accomplished and
      ablation of the cancer bed (lumpectomy site) to ensure negative margins without removing
      large volumes of tissue. This combined open technique will allow for full histologic analysis
      of the primary tumor and margin. Because no extra tissue is removed from the breast to
      generate negative margins it will result in better cosmesis than re-excision to obtain
      negative margins.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While RFA alone is not approved for tumor destruction in breast it is FDA-approved for
      ablation of soft tissue after the breast cancer is removed. This study seeks to remove the
      tumor and then ablate a tumor-free zone (margin) of tissue around the lumpectomy site instead
      of removing more tissue. The primary short-term goal is to obviate the need for re-excision
      in the event of close or positive margins (&lt; 3 mm) which occurs on average in ~40 percent of
      the cases. Permanent pathology is only an estimation of margin status since 90% of
      recurrences occur at the site of the original lumpectomy. RFA ensures a sterilized margin
      regardless of the accuracy of the permanent pathology.
