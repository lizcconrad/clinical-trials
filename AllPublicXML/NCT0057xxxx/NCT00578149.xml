    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn what effects (good and bad) bevacizumab in conjunction with
      carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiation therapy has on patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      -  There are three phases of treatment 1)chemoradiation, 2) consolidation and 3)maintenance
           therapy.

        -  The chemoradiation phase is from week 1 to week 7. The following will occur during this
           phase: Daily chest radiation starting on day 1; pre-medication for paclitaxel; weekly
           intravenous administration of paclitaxel and carboplatin; intravenous administration of
           bevacizumab once weekly every three weeks starting on day 1.

        -  During weeks 8-9, patients will undergo a PET/CT scan for restaging.

        -  The consolidation phase is from week 10 to week 16. The following will occur during this
           phase: Pre-medication for paclitaxel; intravenous administration of paclitaxel and
           carboplatin twice weekly every 3 weeks; intravenous administration of bevacizumab once
           weekly every 3 weeks.

        -  The maintenance phase is from week 17 to week 52. The following will occur during this
           phase; intravenous administration of bevacizumab once a week every three weeks for 1
           year; PET/CT scan every three months.

        -  The following evaluations will occur during treatment: 1)Patients will be evaluated
           weekly by the study doctor, 2) Weight, difficulty or discomfort in swallowing, shortness
           of breath and over well-being will be recorded, 3) Weekly lab test will include CBC,
           chemistries, and liver function tests. 4) Followed through each cycle of chemotherapy
           and every 6-8 weeks for the duration of the study.

        -  The following evaluations will occur after treatment: 1)Every 6-8 weeks assessed for
           response with a CT or PET/CT scan for one year, 2) Toxicity will also be assessed at
           each follow-up interval.
