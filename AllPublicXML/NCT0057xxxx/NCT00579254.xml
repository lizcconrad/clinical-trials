      Patients who have been prescribed single pill Caduet are eligible to participate in this
      study. The treating physician will obtain written informed consent from each subject or the
      subject's legally acceptable representative before any study-specific activity is performed.

      The study terminated on May 5, 2008. The decision to terminate was due to inability to
      achieve study timelines and undue delay in obtaining IEC/IRB permission at some sites. No
      safety or efficacy issues caused the decision to terminate.
