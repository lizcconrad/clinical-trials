    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of endoscopic full-thickness
      plication (Plicator; NDO Surgical, Inc., Mansfield, MA) for the treatment of GERD in
      comparison to a sham procedure.

      Patients with symptomatic GERD requiring maintenance proton pump inhibitor therapy were
      entered into a randomized, single-blind, prospective, multicenter trial. Seventy-eight
      patients were randomly assigned to undergo endoscopic full-thickness restructuring of the
      gastric cardia with transmural suture. Eighty-one patients underwent a sham procedure. Group
      assignments were revealed following the 3-month evaluation. The primary endpoint was ≥ 50%
      improvement in GERD-HRQL score. Secondary endpoints included medication use and esophageal
      acid exposure.

      Patients achieving ≥ 50% improvement in GERD-HRQL score at 3-months versus baseline off-meds
      were considered responsive to their assigned procedure. Patients who failed to reach this
      level of improvement at 3-months were considered non-responders. Analysis of these
      dichotomized variables (responder/non-responder) was done using Fisher's exact test comparing
      the proportion of responders between the active and sham groups. Intent-to-treat analysis was
      also performed. The null hypothesis was that the proportion of responders was the same in
      both the active and sham groups. Testing was done at the 5% level of significance
      (alpha=0.05).

    <description>A low-profile (≤6mm) gastroscope was advanced and an EGD followed by Savary wire placement was performed. The gastroscope was then removed and the Plicator was advanced directly over the wire and into the stomach. The gastroscope was re-introduced through the Plicator, and the Plicator was retroflexed under direct endoscopic visualization to the anterior gastric cardia, approximately 1cm below the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The Plicator arms were opened and the endoscopic tissue retractor was advanced deeply into the gastric cardia. The gastric wall was then retracted into the open arms of the Plicator. The arms were closed and a single, transmural pledgeted suture was deployed. The Plicator and gastroscope were then removed and the gastroscope re-inserted to evaluate the post-plication GE junction.</description>

    <description>The sham procedure was identical to the treatment procedure through the positioning of the retroflexed Plicator 1cm below the GE junction. The Plicator instrument remained in this position for 15 minutes, based on average procedure times established in previous studies. During the sham procedure, physician investigators were required to talk through the procedure steps to maintain the patient blind.</description>
