    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic hepatitis C with persistently normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
      levels have been generally excluded from treatment, because the strong conviction that normal
      ALT would be synonymous of absence of liver damage. However, recent studies have demonstrated
      marked liver fibrosis, including cirrhosis, in patients with HCV and persistently normal ALT
      levels. Up to now, just a sigle randomized, controlled, multicenter study was lead to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C and
      persistently normal serum ALT levels. Aim of our study is evaluate the efficacy of treatment
      and the outcome of treated patients compared with a control group of untreated patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Serologic evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection (repeatedly HCV-RNA positive) with
             persistent normal ALT levels documented on at least 3 occasions, in the last 18 months
             before screening.

          -  Fibroscan performed in the last 3 months

          -  Compensated liver disease, Child Pugh score &lt;7

          -  Serum HCV-RNA &gt;615 IU/mL

          -  Patients who are naïve to any hepatitis C therapy (i.e. have not been previously
             treated with an interferon or with IFN plus ribavirin)

          -  No clinical or radiological evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and a serum AFP &lt;100
             ng/mL within 2 months of randomisation

          -  Negative urine or blood pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)
             documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  All fertile males and females receiving ribavirin must be using two forms of effective
             contraception during treatment and during the 6 months after treatment end

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with ongoing pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  History or other evidence of bleeding from oesophageal varices or other conditions
             consistent with decompensated liver disease (Child Pugh B or C)

          -  Therapy with any systemic anti-viral, anti-neoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment
             (including supraphysiologic doses of steroids and radiation) £6 months prior to the
             first dose of study drug

          -  History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease
             other than HCV (e.g., hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, metabolic liver disease,
             alcoholic liver disease, toxin exposures)

          -  Neutrophil count &lt;1500 cells/mm3 or platelet count &lt;90,000 cells/mm3 at screening

          -  Serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal at screening

          -  Evidence of current severe psychiatric disease, especially depression within one year
             of study entry. Severe psychiatric disease is defined as treatment with an
             antidepressant medication or a major tranquilizer at therapeutic doses for major
             depression or psychosis, respectively, within 12 months prior to study entry. Patients
             with a previous history of the following: a suicidal attempt, hospitalization for
             psychiatric disease, or a period of disability due to a psychiatric disease should be
             evaluated by a qualified Psychiatrist for study suitability prior to enrolment.

          -  History of a severe seizure disorder or current anticonvulsant use History of
             immunologically mediated disease, chronic pulmonary disease associated with functional
             limitation, severe cardiac disease, major organ transplantation or other evidence of
             severe illness, malignancy, or any other conditions which would make the patient, in
             the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study

          -  History of thyroid disease poorly controlled on prescribed medications, elevated
             thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations with elevation of antibodies to
             thyroid peroxidase and any clinical manifestations of thyroid disease

          -  Evidence of severe retinopathy (e.g. CMV retinitis, macula degeneration)

          -  Evidence of drug abuse (including excessive alcohol consumption) within 6 months of
             study entry

          -  Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent or abide by the requirements of
             the study

          -  Male partners of women who are pregnant

          -  Hgb &lt;12 g/dL in women or &lt;13 g/dL in men at screening

          -  Any patient with an increased baseline risk for anemia (e.g. thalassemia,
             spherocytosis, history of GI bleeding, etc) or for whom anemia would be medically
             problematic

          -  Patients with documented or presumed coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular
             disease should not be enrolled if, in the judgment of the investigator, an acute
             decrease in hemoglobin by up to 4 g/dL (as may be seen with ribavirin therapy) would
             not be well-tolerated
