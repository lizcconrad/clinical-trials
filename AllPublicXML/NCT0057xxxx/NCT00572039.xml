    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled clinical trial will test the efficacy of Problem-Solving
      Treatment (PST) to improve vision function in older persons with age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). AMD is a highly prevalent, disabling disease of aging that causes severe
      vision loss and functional decline. It is the leading cause of blindness in older persons in
      the United States and may affect more than 10 million people. Currently, there are no
      effective treatments to restore vision. Thus, improving Vision Function is a major goal of
      treatment. Vision function refers to vision-related abilities to perform daily living
      activities (e.g. reading recipes to prepare meals). Decrements in vision function will become
      a major public health problem as the population ages and the prevalence of AMD increases. PST
      is a brief, standardized, cognitive-behavioral treatment that teaches problem-solving skills.

      We believe PST will enable patients with AMD find practical solutions to vision-related
      problems and thereby improve vision function.

      We will recruit 240 AMD patients from the retina clinics of Wills Eye Institute,
      Philadelphia, PA, with bilateral AMD and visual acuity worse than 20/70 in the better eye.
      PST-trained therapists will deliver 6 1-hour, in-home sessions to the 120 subjects randomized
      to PST. The control treatment is Supportive Therapy (ST), a similarly structured,
      standardized psychological treatment that controls for the non-specific effects of treatment
      (n=120). ST contains no active elements beyond its non-specific components; in this way it is
      a placebo treatment. Independent raters, masked to treatment assignment, will assess Targeted
      Vision Function (primary outcome) and vision-related quality of life (secondary outcome) at 3
      months to assess PST's efficacy, and at 6 months to evaluate its long-term effects. As the
      population ages, the disability of AMD will become more prevalent, costly, and burdensome to
      patients, families, and ophthalmologists. This makes devising and testing practical and
      affordable interventions to improve vision function a national priority.

      The primary hypothesis will address treatment group differences in Targeted Vision Function
      at 3-months, and secondary hypotheses will the long-term effect (6-months) of Problem Solving
      Treatment (PST) on TVF and vision-related quality of life.

    <description>We identified and quantified the TVF goals that subjects valued but found difficult to achieve. To derive the TVF measure, at baseline subjects completed the Activities Inventory, a structured vision function questionnaire that asks patients to rate the value and difficulty of 48 vision function goals (e.g., daily meal preparation) and the tasks (e.g., seeing stove settings) that are required to achieve them. If a goal is important (range of 0 [not important]to 4 [very important]), the subject rates its &quot;difficulty&quot; (on a scale of 0 [not difficult] to 4 [impossible]). The average TVF score is the sum of the difficulty ratings of the (up to) 4 self-selected goals divided by the number of goals (from 1 to 4). Higher average scores indicate greater disability. At each outcome assessment subjects again rated the difficulty of the same targeted goals and the average TVF score was calculated.</description>

    <description>We administered the 25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionaire plus Supplement (NEI-VFQ).19 This version of the NEI VFQ consists of 39 items that assess self-reported vision function and vision-related QoL. The latter yields a multidimensional index of vision-related health composed of social functioning (social interactions), mental health (worry, frustration), role difficulties (accomplishing less), and dependency (relying more on others) due to vision loss. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>

          <title>Supportive Therapy</title>
          <description>Supportive therapy is a structured, standardized, psychological treatment that controls for nonspecific treatment effects. Supportive therapy resembles PST in all ways but for PST’s problem-solving skills training. Both interventions are based on written treatment manuals and similar in dose and intensity of attention (number and duration of sessions). Supportive therapy is nondirective and supportive, facilitates personal expression, and conveys empathy, respect, and optimism (i.e., a general sense that things can get better). The ST therapist informs subjects that ST’s purpose is to explore the impact of vision loss on their lives.</description>

To derive the TVF measure, at baseline subjects completed the Activities Inventory, a structured vision function questionnaire that asks patients to rate the value and difficulty of 48 vision function goals (e.g., daily meal preparation) and the tasks (e.g., seeing stove settings) that are required to achieve them. If a goal is important (range of 0 [not important]to 4 [very important]), the subject rates its “difficulty” (on a scale of 0 [not difficult] to 4 [impossible]). The average TVF score is the sum of the difficulty ratings of the (up to) 4 self-selected goals divided by the number of goals (from 1 to 4). Higher average scores indicate greater disability. At each outcome assessment subjects again rated the difficulty of the same targeted goals and the average TVF score was calculated.</description>

            <description>Supportive therapy is a structured, standardized, psychological treatment that controls for nonspecific treatment effects. Supportive therapy resembles PST in all ways but for PST’s problem-solving skills training. Both interventions are based on written treatment manuals and similar in dose and intensity of attention (number and duration of sessions). Supportive therapy is nondirective and supportive, facilitates personal expression, and conveys empathy, respect, and optimism (i.e., a general sense that things can get better). The ST therapist informs subjects that ST’s purpose is to explore the impact of vision loss on their lives.</description>

            <description>Problem-solving therapy teaches problem solving skills in a structured way to enable a patient to systematically identify his or her problems, generate alternative solutions for each problem, select the best solution, develop and conduct a plan, and evaluate whether the problem is solved.</description>

            <title>Supportive Therapy</title>
            <description>Supportive therapy is a structured, standardized, psychological treatment that controls for nonspecific treatment effects. Supportive therapy resembles PST in all ways but for PST’s problem-solving skills training. Both interventions are based on written treatment manuals and similar in dose and intensity of attention (number and duration of sessions). Supportive therapy is nondirective and supportive, facilitates personal expression, and conveys empathy, respect, and optimism (i.e., a general sense that things can get better). The ST therapist informs subjects that ST’s purpose is to explore the impact of vision loss on their lives.</description>

          <title>Targeted Vision Function</title>
          <description>We identified and quantified the TVF goals that subjects valued but found difficult to achieve. To derive the TVF measure, at baseline subjects completed the Activities Inventory, a structured vision function questionnaire that asks patients to rate the value and difficulty of 48 vision function goals (e.g., daily meal preparation) and the tasks (e.g., seeing stove settings) that are required to achieve them. If a goal is important (range of 0 [not important]to 4 [very important]), the subject rates its “difficulty” (on a scale of 0 [not difficult] to 4 [impossible]). The average TVF score is the sum of the difficulty ratings of the (up to) 4 self-selected goals divided by the number of goals (from 1 to 4). Higher average scores indicate greater disability. At each outcome assessment subjects again rated the difficulty of the same targeted goals and the average TVF score was calculated.</description>

        <description>We administered the 25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionaire plus Supplement (NEI-VFQ).19 This version of the NEI VFQ consists of 39 items that assess self-reported vision function and vision-related QoL. The latter yields a multidimensional index of vision-related health composed of social functioning (social interactions), mental health (worry, frustration), role difficulties (accomplishing less), and dependency (relying more on others) due to vision loss. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>
