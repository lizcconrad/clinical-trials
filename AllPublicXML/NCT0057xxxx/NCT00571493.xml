    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II trial designed to study the toxicity and Maximum Tolerated Dose of
      VELCADE in combination with BEAM and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and
      to obtain a preliminary estimate of the response rate to this combination.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate in a phase I study the toxicity and MTD of the addition of
      VELCADE™ (bortezomib) to a standard BEAM autologous transplant regimen. The phase II portion
      of the study will determine a preliminary estimate of the response rate.

      Secondary Objectives: To obtain a preliminary estimate of the response rate to this regimen.
      To obtain preliminary estimates of event-free and overall survival using this regimen.

      Enrolled subjects will receive Velcade in combination with BEAM and Autologous Hematopoietic
      Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT). Phase I treatment will administer Velcade in four dose
      cohorts,in addition to the BEAM and AHSCT. Three patients will be accrued in each dose cohort
      with enrollment starting at dose cohort. These subjects will be evaluated to establish the
      maximum tolerated dose of Velcade in combination with BEAM autologous peripheral blood stem
      cell transplantation. Once established, the maximum tolerated dose will be utilized in
      treating an additional 20 subjects.

      Follow-Up: Data collected will be utilized to obtain a preliminary estimate of the response
      rate, event-free and overall survival using this regimen.

    <description>3 patients will be accrued in each dose cohort. Enrollment will start at Dose Cohort #1. If 0-1 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity, the next dose cohort will be initiated. Escalation to a higher dose cohort will not commence before 2 patients have achieved engraftment on that dose cohort to evaluate for toxicities.
If 2 of 3 patients in Dose Cohort #1-4 have a dose-limiting toxicity, 3 additional patients will be added to that dose level. If 3 of these 6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity defined as grade &gt; 2 on the Bearman scale, DLT will be reached. No further dose escalation will take place.</description>

    <description>Peripheral blood stem cells will be collected as per the discretion of the treating physician. Once an adequate number of CD34+ cells/kg have been collected (as per existing institutional guidelines) the patient will begin the preparative regimen with for transplant. On day 0 of treatment, the previously stored hematopoietic stem cells will be re-infused. The cells will be removed from the storage freezer, brought to the patient area, thawed in a 370C water bath, and administered intravenously through a central line to the patient. Patients will then be cared for as standard transplant patients.</description>
