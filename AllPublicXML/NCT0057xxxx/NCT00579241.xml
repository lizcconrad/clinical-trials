      To Determine whether transcranial ultrasound can detect the presence of intravenously
      injected microbubbles used routinely for dobutamine stress echocardiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the intravenous microbubbles used to
      improve border delineation during dobutamine stress echocardiographies (DSE) can be detected
      within the cerebral circulation.

    <description>All Patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography have an intravenous line placed and a continuous infusion of a commercially available contrast agent administered. Prior to contrast infusion, baseline transcranial ultrasound images at 0.4 mechanical index using low mechanical index pulses and color Doppler will be performed and recorded. After this the contrast infusion will begin, and resting cardiac images will occur.</description>
