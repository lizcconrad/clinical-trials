  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective evaluation of left ventricular recovery on conventional
      therapy in patients with the recent onset of dilated cardiomyopathy. In some subjects with
      this disorder, the heart will recover significantly over the first year, while others will be
      left with a chronically weak heart. The proteins that help the heart recover are encoded by
      genes, which can differ markedly between individuals. The goal of the current study is to
      determine whether variation in these genes involved affect the probability that the heart
      will recover. We will also look at which genes are involved in inflammation and which ones
      are &quot;turned on&quot; (producing proteins) in circulating white blood cells.{These statements will
      only be added if the site has chosen to participate in RNA analysis}. In addition, this study
      will look at how levels of proteins in the blood, proteins called &quot;cytokines' which control
      inflammation and proteins called &quot;neurohormones&quot; which are released when the heart weakens,
      affect the likelihood of recovery.

      Enrollment will take place at 15 centers. The goal is to enroll approximately 500 adult
      subjects (age 18 years or older, both men and women) over the course of approximately 48
      months.

      After presenting with new onset idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, one third of patients
      experience dramatic recovery of left ventricular function, while for the majority chronic
      heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction persist. This marked variation in clinical
      outcomes is determined in part by genetic heterogeneity of the systemic response to
      myocardial injury. This population has been excluded from most clinical trials and few
      studies have examined the role of cytokine and neurohormonal mediators in modulating the
      balance between left ventricular recovery and remodeling in early cardiomyopathy. This
      proposal will investigate whether genetic polymorphisms of inflammatory and neurohormonal
      mediators influence subsequent clinical outcomes for patients with recent onset primary
      (idiopathic) dilated cardiomyopathy. The study will enroll 500 patients with recent onset
      left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 0.40) due to non-ischemic primary cardiomyopathy at
      eleven centers and follow these patients prospectively to evaluate subsequent left
      ventricular recovery and freedom from clinical events.

      Specific aim 1 will be to determine the correlation of echocardiographic parameters of
      systolic and diastolic functional entry with circulating inflammatory mediators: TNF, IL-6
      and TNF receptors 1 and 2. Specific aim 2 will be to determine the predictive value of early
      plasma TNFÎ± levels and of left ventricular size by transthoracic echo at baseline in
      predicting improvements in left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) at 6 months. Specific
      aim 3 will evaluate the effects of the TNFA 1/2 promoter polymorphism on circulating plasma
      TNF levels and its influence on subsequent improvement in LVEF. Specific aim 4 will look at
      the impact of the deletion allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and the genetic
      variation of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors on left ventricular recovery.

      At time of enrollment, 30cc of blood will be obtained: 10cc for plasma banking for
      neurohormones and cytokine analysis, 10 cc for DNA banking and genotyping, 5 cc for
      evaluation of gene expression of inflammatory markers from circulating leukocytes and 5 cc
      for serum banking. Ten ccs of blood for cytokine analysis will also be collected at one month
      and six months after entry. A blood specimen for repeat analysis of serum mediator (5ccs in a
      red top tube) will be drawn at six months and sent to the University of Pittsburgh. All blood
      samples will be kept for 10 years. Access to the banked DNA will be limited to investigations
      at the University of Pittsburgh and each site of this multi-center trial. These samples will
      be available without any identifying information (name, social security number and medical
      record number). In addition, a Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained from the NIH
      for further subject protection.

          1. Patients must be 18 years or over, and may be of either gender and of any race.

          2. Patients must have significantly systolic dysfunction, defined as a left ventricular
             ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% by transthoracic echocardiography.

          3. The patients must have a recent onset of dilated cardiomyopathy. Specifically, the
             initial signs or symptoms of cardiomyopathy should not pre-date the time of evaluation
             for the study by more than six months.

          4. Subjects diagnosed during with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) are allowed as long as
             they are enrolled within six months of cardiac symptoms.

          5. Subjects presenting with acute heart failure with a positive familial history of
             cardiomyopathy are included. Subjects who are asymptomatic, but are diagnosed with a
             cardiomyopathy of unknown duration during screening for known familial disease are
             excluded

          6. Patients must be competent to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Coronary artery disease as defined as a single coronary artery stenosis of a major
             epicardial vessel greater than 50% or a previous history of myocardial infarction.

          2. Patients with a history of familial cardiomyopathy, or a primary relative defined as
             parents, siblings or children with a dilated cardiomyopathy are excluded.

          3. Past or present history of alcoholism, or in whose current alcohol consumption exceeds
             an average of three drinks per day. A past history of cocaine or IV drug abuse as a
             possible explanation for their cardiomyopathy as well as substance abuse of
             prescription pain relievers or any illicit drug that may hinder the participant's
             ability to complete study follow-up.

          4. Patients who are post cardiac transplant.

          5. Patients whose heart failure is felt to be secondary to primary valvular disease,
             uncorrected thyroid disease, uncontrolled hypertension despite medical therapy,

             time of evaluation by more than six months are excluded.

          7. Evidence of ongoing bacteremia or sepsis. Patient with a febrile illness felt to be
             secondary to myocarditis can be included (even with a non-diagnostic biopsy) if a
             bacteriologic cause of the illness is excluded.

          8. Patients with other life threatening diseases such as malignancy which would likely

             or equal to 2.5mg%) are excluded from the study. Subjects who present with an acute
             worsening of renal function or liver function tests in the setting of potentially
             fulminant myocarditis can be enrolled. Patients whose hepatic abnormalities are
             secondary to hypoperfusion can also be considered.
