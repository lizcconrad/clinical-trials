    <textblock>
      Ganoderma lucidum (Lingzhi) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine which is widely used as a means
      to 'strengthen immunity' among patients with cancers. However, there is no published
      randomized controlled clinical trial on its efficacy and safety despite the many in vitro
      studies on its anti-viral, anti-oxidative, anti-tumour, radioprotective, hepato-protective
      and immunomodulatory effects. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel clinical trial that investigated the benefits and safety of Ganoderma lucidum
      (Lingzhi) in treating children with cancers. Patients were randomized to receive identical
      capsules of either Lingzhi or placebo for six months. The primary outcome was the general
      Paediatric Quality of Life score. Secondary outcomes included immune functions,
      infection-related morbidities, complete blood counts and serum biochemistry, and overall and
      event-free survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alternative and complementary medicine are widely used in treating children with cancers. A
      population-based survey in British Columbia revealed that they were used by 42% of the
      respondents. Among Chinese in Hong Kong, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is also widely
      practiced. Some 60% of the population had consulted TCM practitioners at one time or another.
      TCM use could be dated back to more than five thousand years ago, and written records were
      available for over two thousand years. TCM is considered to be an integral part of the
      Chinese culture. In our experience, TCM is believed to be commonly used to 'strengthen
      immunity and promote health' among local children with cancers, despite the lack of
      well-designed study to prove its usefulness. Ganoderma lucidum (Ling Zhi) is a mushroom
      long-used in China for a broad range of disorders. Its use is common in the general
      population and among both adults and children with a wide range of malignancies. However,
      there is no randomized controlled trial to support its clinical efficacy and safety.
      Therefore, we conducted this clinical trial of Ganoderma lucidum (Ling Zhi) among Hong Kong
      children with cancers.
