      An observational study to investigate how patients experience the ability to adjust their
      asthma maintenance medication according to instructions received from their physician. The
      primary aim is to create an insight in the perception of the patient when he has the ability
      to adjust his own maintenance treatment and how the patient exercises this in the daily
      practice.
