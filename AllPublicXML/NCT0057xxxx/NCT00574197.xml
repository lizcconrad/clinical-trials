  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic®) is a newly developed enteric-coated tablet version of
      mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®) which is currently used as therapy for the prevention of
      transplant rejection. Myfortic® was developed to improve the gastrointestinal tolerability of
      Cellcept®. The new enteric-coated, Myfortic® is presently FDA approved for the prevention of
      acute kidney rejection only. There is no clinical data of its use in heart transplant
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, prospective, non-randomized pilot-phase study of the enteric-coated,
      Myfortic® versus the non enteric-coated, Cellcept® in patients who are within 5 years of
      having undergone heart transplant surgery who are currently taking Cellcept®. After the
      initial screening, 20 patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria and report symptoms of
      gastrointestinal side-effects while taking Cellcept will be switched to Myfortic. All 20
      patients will be followed closely over a period of 6 months following enrollment. Concomitant
      immunosuppressive therapy will continue in all patients per standard treatment protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with an absolute neutrophil count &lt;1500 cells/mm3, and/or leukocytopenia
             (&lt;2500 cells/mm3), thrombocytopenia (&lt;75,000 cells/mm3) and significant anemia
             (hemoglobin &lt; 6g/dl) at the time of potential enrollment.
