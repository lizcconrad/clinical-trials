        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). PANSS total score is the sum of the 30 items and ranges from 30 to 210; where higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms.</description>

        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. PANSS positive subscale assesses the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia as delusions, conceptual disorganization, and hallucinatory behavior. It consists of 7 items and each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptoms not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). PANSS positive subscale is the sum of 7 items and ranges from 7 to 49; where higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms.</description>

        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. PANSS negative subscale assesses negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia as blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, and passive/apathetic social withdrawal. It consists of 7 items and each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptoms not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). PANSS negative subscale score is the sum of 7 items and ranges from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms.</description>

PANSS positive Marder factor score is the sum of 8 items and ranges from 8 to 56; where higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

PANSS hostility/excitement Marder factor score consists of 4 items and each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptoms not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). PANSS hostility/excitement Marder factor score is the sum of 4 items and ranges from 4 to 28; where higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

        <description>NOSIE is an inpatient treatment staff-administered questionnaire. It consists of 30 items: 26 items divided into 6 subscales and 4 individual items. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0= never to 4= always), to assess functional ability of participants. 6 subscales: irritability (sum of 5 items: score range 0 to 20), manifest psychosis (sum of 4 items: score range 0 to 16), personal neatness (sum of 4 items: score range 0 to 16), retardation (sum of 3 items: score range 0 to 12), social competence (sum of 5 items: score range 0 to 20) and social interest (sum of 5 items: score range 0 to 20) and 4 individual items: cried (score range 0 to 4), refused to speak (score range 0 to 4), said felt blue or depressed (score range 0 to 4) and said he/she was no good (score range 0 to 4). For each of the 6 subscales and 4 individual items: higher scores indicates irregular functional ability.</description>

          <description>GAF is a single clinician-rated item to measure the severity of illness-related impairment in psychological, social and occupational functioning. It is a 100 point rating scale, score range: 0= worst functioning to 99= superior functioning, where higher scores indicates better functioning.</description>
          <population>PD analysis set included all participants with at least 1 dose of study medication and had a baseline value and at least 1 post dose PD measurement.</population>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 10 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <description>SSS is a 7-point Likert scale which facilitates standardized observation of alertness and rates sleepiness, where 1= alert/wide awake, 2= able to concentrate, 3= not at full alertness, 4= not at peak and let down, 5= beginning to lose interest in remaining awake, 6= sleepiness, 7= sleep onset soon; lost struggle to remain awake. Score ranging from 1 to 7, where higher score indicates more sleepiness.</description>
