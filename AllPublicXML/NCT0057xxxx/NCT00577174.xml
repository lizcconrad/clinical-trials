  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of pediatric obesity is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Obese children
      are at risk for the development of insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. However, the cause of insulin resistance remains an area of scientific
      interest. The study of type 2 diabetes in children is limited by the lack of a non-invasive
      method to evaluate insulin resistance. Recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial
      dysfunction is associated with, and perhaps predictive of insulin resistance in adult
      relatives of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Mitochondria generate energy in muscle tissue
      through the production of ATP, and are important in the metabolism of both glucose and fat.
      This study evaluates a novel, non invasive, safe method for predicting insulin resistance and
      diabetes in children using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based technique to measure
      mitochondrial function. We propose to investigate mitochondrial function and glucose
      metabolism in obese and non-obese children in early, mid and late puberty. Analyses will be
      conducted to investigate the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction in obese children, to
      evaluate the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to insulin resistance, and to
      determine the contribution of pubertal status to mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin
      resistance. The successful completion of this study would provide evidence to support the
      hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in insulin resistance and diabetes in
      children. In addition, it would provide a new technique for the prediction of disease states
      and perhaps lead to the development of preventative therapeutics for insulin resistance and
      type 2 diabetes in children.

      We hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction will mirror the progression of insulin
      resistance and precede and predict abnormal glucose metabolism in a population with pediatric
      obesity

      Aim I: A cross sectional study to evaluate baseline mitochondrial function in obese children
      compared to non-obese children. Determine whether children with pediatric obesity have
      impaired mitochondrial function based on 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy when compared to
      healthy non-obese control children.Examine the relationship between mitochondrial function
      and insulin resistance in obese and non-obese children. Determine the impact of pubertal
      stage on mitochondrial function in obese and non-obese children.

      Aim II:A prospective evaluation to determine in a longitudinal cohort study the timing and
      relationship of mitochondrial dysfunction to the development of insulin resistance in
      prepubertal/early pubertal obese children compared to prepubertal/early pubertal non-obese
      children. Determine in a longitudinal cohort study if obese children with mitochondrial
      dysfunction develop greater insulin resistance and/or impaired glucose tolerance at an
      earlier time point. Evaluate the relationship of obesity, timing of puberty and related
      changes in hormone levels to mitochondrial function and the development of insulin resistance
      and/or impaired glucose tolerance in longitudinal analyses.
