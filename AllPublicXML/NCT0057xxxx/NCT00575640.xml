    <textblock>
      Clinically feasible dose of Hydralazine for ~ 3 months, by virtue of its demethylating
      effect, will:

        1. Result in re-expression of epigenetically silenced TSGs in rectal cancer specimens.

        2. Decrease the global methylation in primary cancer cells compared to pre-treatment

      This study will be conducted as a phase I/II clinical trial. In addition to determining the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydralazine, the phase I trial will be performed to identify
      unexpected toxicities that may occur when hydralazine is used in conjunction with neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in normotensive patients with rectal cancer. Once the phase I trial is
      successfully completed, the phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of hydralazine in
      producing a demethylation effect will begin.

      This phase I/II trial will require between 31 to 47 patients to complete.

      • Phase I Study

      The objective of this study is to determine the MTD for Hydralazine added to standard
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable recta cancer. Four dose levels of hydralazine are
      planned:

      Dose Level 1: 150 mg/d 50 mg PO TID Dose Level 2: 200 mg/d 50 mg PO QID Dose Level 3: 225
      mg/d 75 mg PO TID

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The principal objective of this study is to perform a molecular evaluation for the reversal
        of methylation in clinical material collected at two different time points. The first
        sample representing untreated (the biopsy sample), and later a hydralazine-treated specimen
        (the resection specimen). Accordingly, we are not using routine inclusion criterion for
        enrollment (such as histology or clinical stage), but realize that the majority of operable
        rectal cancers will be stages II-III, and that treatment—again not specified or
        restricted—will very likely follow the standard therapy for this disease (infusional
        5-Fluorouracil and radiation therapy). The accrual target at the phase II segment of this
        trial is small and that does not allow for any traditional clinical endpoints assessment
        (such as response rate, time to treatment failure or survival). Accordingly, we do not plan
        on following these endpoint as part of this study.

        Patients referred to the surgery or gastroenterology services for diagnostic evaluation for
        rectal cancer will be candidates to participate in this study. Patients with history of
        elevated blood pressure and who are already on anti-hypertensive drugs would be ideal
        candidates for this project. In such situation, hydralazine will replace other
        anti-hypertensives for the duration of study only. There is no age limit for this study.
        Inclusion criteria are as follows:

          1. Operable rectal cancer (the overwhelming majority are Adenocarcinoma)

          2. Signed informed consent

          3. Baseline blood pressure OFF anti-hypertensives over 100/50 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-existing hypotension (as defined in this protocol BP 100/50)

          2. Pre-existing liver disease (liver function tests over 2x upper limits of normal ULM).

          3. Pre-existing kidney (serum creatinine over 2 mg/dl).

          4. Medical necessity to remain on beta-blockers that cannot be met by other agents.

          5. Coronary even in the preceding 2 months prior to enrollment. Coronary evens include
             any of the following:

               -  Acute Myocardial Infarction

               -  Cardiac catheterization regardless of outcome of procedure or need of
                  intervention

               -  History of Valvular heart disease

               -  History of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract
                  obstruction.
