      This will be a prospective, multicenter, open-labeled, non-comparative pharmacokinetic study
      conducted in 10 critically ill, anuric patients receiving CVVHDF. Enrollment will take place
      at 3-5 clinical sites in the United States. A study coordinator at each site will be
      identified and institutional specific processes (e.g., pharmacy records, etc.) will be
      utilized to identify patients. Full evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      conducted by each site's coordinator within 48 hours of initiation of daptomycin therapy.
      Subjects receiving daptomycin 6mg/kg (total body weight) once daily for a
      suspected/documented infection, as deemed necessary by the treating clinician will be
      screened for inclusion in the current study. Dialysate, ultrafiltrate, and blood flow rate
      utilized during the CVVHDF procedure will be determined by clinicians at discretion to
      optimize stability of patients.

      Daptomycin samples will be obtained around the third dose in an attempt to achieve
      approximate steady-state concentrations. Pre- and post-filter blood samples will be collected
      simultaneously with dialysate and ultrafiltrate specimens at multiple time points. Protein
      binding will be assessed by filtration of the serum samples at the peak drug concentration
      time points.

      All of your biologic samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this
      research project. To protect your confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name,
      social security number, and birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a
      specific code number. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding
      subjects' identities will be kept in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this
      study will keep the samples indefinitely. Samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, room 812, 3500 Terrace Street. You may request to have
      your samples destroyed if you withdraw. The request must be in writing and samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This study will be conducted in adult critically ill patients receiving CVVHDF who are
             prescribed daptomycin 6mg/kg once daily as part of required medical care for
             suspected/documented infection, as deemed necessary by his or her treating clinician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Daptomycin therapy will be chosen by the treating physician based on clinical
             indication and it is expected that risks of therapy will have already been considered;
             therefore, subjects are only to be excluded based on covariates that are expected to
             affect pharmacokinetics. Subjects will be excluded if they are:

               -  less than 18 years of age

               -  producing urine greater than 50 ml per 24 hours

               -  have a life expectancy less than 96 hours

               -  receiving CVVHDF utilizing rates or filters that are NOT otherwise considered
                  &quot;standard&quot; by the enrolling site

               -  receive less than 3 doses of daptomycin

               -  participating in any other study
