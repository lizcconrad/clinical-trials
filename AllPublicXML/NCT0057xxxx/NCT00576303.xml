  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of monthly
      intravenous Mircera for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in dialysis patients with
      chronic renal disease, currently receiving epoetin alfa or beta. Patients will receive
      monthly intravenous injections of Mircera at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360
      micrograms/month, depending on the dose of epoetin alfa or beta they were receiving in the
      week preceding study start. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the
      target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <time_frame>EEP (Week 16 to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>All mean Hb values recorded during the evaluation period were calculated and subtracted from the mean baseline Hb value for each participant. The percentage of participants maintaining their mean Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration within +/- 1 gram/deciliter (g/dL) of their reference Hb and between 10.5 -12.5 g/dL is presented during the EEP. The EEP is defined as Week 16 to Week 24</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Hb Concentration From Baseline to the EEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week -4 to Week -1), EEP (Week 16 to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>A time adjusted mean change in Hb concentration was calculated using an area under the curve approach, for both periods separately. Change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation periods was calculated by subtracting the calculated average baseline Hb value from the average evaluation period Hb value. All blood samples for Hb measurements were taken prior to study drug administration. Analysis used last observation carried forward (LOCF) for missing Hb values to correct for the impact of early dropouts. The baseline period is defined as Week -4 to Week -1. The EEP is defined as Week 16 to Week 24</description>

The dose of C.E.R.A was based on the epoetin alfa or beta dose of&lt;8000, 8000-16000, or &gt;16000 international units (IU)/week, administered during the stability verification period (SVP) of 4 weeks. The SVP period was followed by dose titration period (DTP) of 16 weeks, efficacy evaluation period (EEP) of 8 weeks and long term safety period (LTSP) of 28 weeks</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Hb Concentration From Baseline to the EEP</title>
        <description>A time adjusted mean change in Hb concentration was calculated using an area under the curve approach, for both periods separately. Change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation periods was calculated by subtracting the calculated average baseline Hb value from the average evaluation period Hb value. All blood samples for Hb measurements were taken prior to study drug administration. Analysis used last observation carried forward (LOCF) for missing Hb values to correct for the impact of early dropouts. The baseline period is defined as Week -4 to Week -1.
