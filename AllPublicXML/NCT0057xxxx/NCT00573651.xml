  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis
      or seronegative arthritis (and related conditions) mount protective immune responses to the
      human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine called Gardasil. The researchers also want to monitor for
      any increase in disease activity following receipt of the vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each individual subject's participation is scheduled to last approximately two years.
      Patients will be given Gardasil injections at months 0, 2, and 6. Patients will have
      geometric mean titers (GMT) measured at 7, 12, and 24 months. Questionnaires about health and
      function will also be completed at each visit.

          -  Known HPV infection

          -  Current or history of cervical cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
