  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children surviving some types of cancer have a higher risk of developing learning problems
      after cancer treatment than do children who have not had cancer or its treatment. Cancer
      treatment may cause problems with learning, attention, and memory. The purpose of this study
      is to identify brain changes that may underlie learning problems in cancer survivors and
      investigate whether methylphenidate (a stimulant medication) may reduce these problems.

      Subjects who have had treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or a brain tumor will
      be asked to take part in this research study. Siblings of some subjects will also be asked to
      take part, so that their results can be compared with those of children who have had cancer
      treatment. We hypothesize that children receiving more aggressive therapy will have lower
      white matter brain volumes and these volumes will be significantly lower than age-matched
      siblings. We also hypothesize that children who take methylphenidate will show improvements
      on teacher and parent report measures of attention and social skills.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-phase, multi-site methylphenidate (MPH) trial in childhood cancer
      survivors. Study participants that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria are screened to
      ensure that they have adequate global cognitive functioning (IQ &gt; 50) and have academic and
      attention difficulties that might be managed with MPH. Following the screening phase,
      qualifying participants take part in a two-day, in-clinic, double-blind, cross-over trial
      during which they receive MPH (0.6 mg/kg; maximum dose, 20 mg) and placebo (inert substance)
      in a randomly assigned order. Patients who do not have a significant adverse reaction during
      the two-day trial go on to participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      three-week home cross-over trial consisting of placebo, low-dose MPH (0.3 mg/kg; maximum
      dose, 10 mg bid), and moderate-dose MPH (0.6 mg/kg; maximum dose, 20 mg bid). Patients are
      then selected for participation in a 12-month open-label MPH trial if they show improvement
      over placebo on a parent and/or teacher rating of attention during the three-week home
      cross-over trial. The 12-month open-label MPH trial includes individually titrated MPH dosing
      to maximize clinical benefit, monthly monitoring of side effects and regular acquisition of
      parent and teacher ratings of attention and behavior. Laboratory measures of intellectual
      function, attention and memory are conducted at the end of the 12-month trial.

The continuous performance test used during the in-lab trial was developed in house using SuperLab Pro v2.0 (Cedrus Corp., Phoenix, AZ). The test was modeled after Conners' CPT, but was shortened for ease of administration and evaluation of short-form sensitivity. The test is one-sixth the length of the Conners' CPT, lasting 2.33 min with 54 total targets and six nontargets (10% of trials). Similar to the Conners' CPT, the interstimulus intervals also varied by trial blocks with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 s. Omission errors are the raw score for the number of targets presented where the subject did not respond. Accordingly, the range for this variable is 0-54 with a higher score indicative of worse performance or problems with sustained attention.</description>

Similar to the Conners' CPT, the interstimulus intervals also varied by trial blocks with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 s. D' and β are derived variables from signal detection theory. D' is a measure of sensitivity of a person to the signal or target; a higher score is indicative of better performance or better sustained attention. D' was calculated as z(hit) - z(commission). Z-scores were calculated using the NORMSINV function in Microsoft Excel.</description>

    <time_frame>Subjects were tested in both the drug and placebo groups before and after taking either MPH or placebo.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in raw scores for the shortened version of the Conner's CPT from Baseline to Post-dose. The continuous performance test used during the in-lab trial was developed in house using SuperLab Pro v2.0 (Cedrus Corp., Phoenix, AZ). The test was modeled after Conners' CPT, but was shortened for ease of administration and evaluation of short-form sensitivity. The test is one-sixth the length of the Conners' CPT, lasting 2.33 min with 54 total targets and six nontargets (10% of trials). Similar to the Conners' CPT, the interstimulus intervals also varied by trial blocks with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 s. D' and β are derived variables from signal detection theory. β is a measure of response tendency; higher scores indicate a more conservative response pattern. β was calculated using the formula = -d'*.5*(NORMSINV(hits)-NORMSINV(false alarms)). In the case where the false alarm rate = 0 or the hit rate = 1.0, we used the standard correction of 1/2N and 1- 1/2N, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Methylphenidate (MPH) Home Maintenance Phase Baseline to Completion of Phase as Measured by Conners' Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS: ADHD T Score)</title>
        <description>The Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale- Revised (S) is a measure of the observed frequency of behaviors associated with ADHD. Twenty-eight questions are rated on a scale from 0 (not true at all) to 3 (very much true). Raw scores are converted to T scores using age and gender normative data. T scores have a mean of 50 ± 10 where higher scores are indicative of greater problems. Assessments were performed prior to beginning the Methylphenidate (MPH) Home Maintenance Phase(baseline) and upon completion of the phase. Phase completion ranged between 11.44 and 24.36 months.</description>
        <time_frame>From beginning and at completion of Methylphenidate (MPH) Home Maintenance Phase, on average 16.3 months.</time_frame>
        <population>118 patients began the MPH Home Maintenance Phase of the trial. 68 completed the year long phase. 55 were screened at the beginning of the trial using the CTRS: ADHD T Score Questionnaire and 59 were screen at completion. 47 patients were analyzed.</population>

          <title>Change From Maintenance Phase Baseline to Completion of Phase as Measured by Conner's Parent Rating Scale (CPRS: Cognitive Problem T Score)</title>
          <description>The Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale- Revised (S) is a measure of the observed frequency of behaviors associated with ADHD. Twenty-seven questions are rated on a scale from 0 (not true at all) to 3 (very much true). Raw scores are converted to T scores using age and gender normative data. T scores have a mean of 50 ± 10 where higher scores are indicative of greater problems. Assessments were performed prior to beginning the Home Therapy Phase (baseline) and upon completion of the phase. Phase completion ranged between 11.44 to 24.36 months</description>

        <description>The Conners' Teacher Rating Scale- Revised (S) is a measure of the observed frequency of behaviors associated with ADHD. Twenty-seven questions are rated on a scale from 0 (not true at all) to 3 (very much true). Raw scores are converted to T scores using age and gender normative data. T scores have a mean of 50 ± 10 where higher scores are indicative of greater problems. Assessments were done weekly during the 3-week Home Crossover Period with the best response being used as the measurement for the test.</description>

        <title>Effectiveness of MPH in Enhancing Classroom Attentiveness, Academic Productivity, and Social Behavior Measured by The Conners’ Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) Cognitive Problem/Inattention Scale.</title>
        <description>The Conners’ Parent Rating Scale- Revised (S) is a measure of the observed frequency of behaviors associated with ADHD. Three scales are reported: Cognitive Problems/Inattention (assesses the ability to learn at the same pace as peers, organize and complete work, and concentrate for sustained periods of time), Hyperactivity (assesses the ability to sit still to complete tasks, and impulsivity) and ADHD Index (assesses risk for ADHD disorder to be corroborated by other clinical information). Raw scores are converted to T scores using age and gender normative data. T scores have a mean of 50 ± 10 where higher scores are indicative of greater problems. Assessments were performed at the end of each medication week during the Home Therapy Phase- placebo, low dose and moderate dose weeks.</description>

Three scales are reported: Cognitive Problems/Inattention (assesses the ability to learn at the same pace as peers, organize and complete work, and concentrate for sustained periods of time), Hyperactivity (assesses the ability to sit still to complete tasks, and impulsivity) and ADHD Index (assesses risk for ADHD disorder to be corroborated by other clinical information). Raw scores are converted to T scores using age and gender normative data. T scores have a mean of 50 ± 10 where higher scores are indicative of greater problems. Assessments were performed at the end of each medication week during the Home Therapy Phase- placebo, low dose and moderate dose weeks.</description>

Raw scores are converted to T scores using age and gender normative data. T scores have a mean of 50 ± 10 where higher scores are indicative of greater problems. Assessments were performed at the end of each medication week during the Home Therapy Phase- placebo, low dose and moderate dose weeks.</description>

        <title>Effectiveness of MPH in Enhancing Classroom Attentiveness, Academic Productivity, and Social Behavior Measured by Social Skills Rating System - Parent (SSRS-P) – Social Skill.</title>
        <description>The SSRS assesses social skills for children and adolescents at preschool, elementary and secondary developmental levels. The SSRS is 40 to 57 items, depending on age, completed separately by parents (SSRS-P) and teachers (SSRS-T). Respondents rate the frequency of occurrence for each item ranging from 0 to 2 (0-never, 1-sometimes, 2-very often). The raw scores for the SSRS-P and SSRS-T Social Skills Scales and the SSRS-P and SSRS-T Problem Behaviors Scales have different ranges that are dependent upon age. Raw scores obtained from the SSRS Scales cannot be used to directly interpret social skills or problem behaviors as raw scores vary in meaning based on scale, informant form and developmental level. Raw scores are converted to standard scores with a mean of 100 ± 15. For the Social Skills Scale, a higher score is indicative of better social functioning, and for the Problem Behaviors Scale, a higher score is indicative of greater behavior problems.</description>

        <title>Effectiveness of MPH in Enhancing Classroom Attentiveness, Academic Productivity, and Social Behavior Measured by Social Skills Rating System - Teacher (SSRS-T) – Social Skill.</title>
        <description>The SSRS assesses social skills for children and adolescents at preschool, elementary and secondary developmental levels. The SSRS is 40 to 57 items, depending on age, completed separately by parents (SSRS-P) and teachers (SSRS-T). Respondents rate the frequency of occurrence for each item ranging from 0 to 2 (0-never, 1-sometimes, 2-very often). The raw scores for the SSRS-P and SSRS-T Social Skills Scales and the SSRS-P and SSRS-T Problem Behaviors Scales have different ranges that are dependent upon age. Raw scores obtained from the SSRS Scales cannot be used to directly interpret social skills or problem behaviors as raw scores vary in meaning based on scale, informant form and developmental level. Raw scores are converted to standard scores with a mean of 100 ± 15. For the Social Skills Scale, a higher score is indicative of better social functioning, and for the Problem Behaviors Scale, a higher score is indicative of greater behavior problems.</description>

        <description>Change in raw scores for the shortened version of the Conner’s CPT from Baseline to Post-dose. The continuous performance test used during the in-lab trial was developed in house using SuperLab Pro v2.0 (Cedrus Corp., Phoenix, AZ). The test was modeled after Conners' CPT, but was shortened for ease of administration and evaluation of short-form sensitivity. The test is one-sixth the length of the Conners’ CPT, lasting 2.33 min with 54 total targets and six nontargets (10% of trials). Similar to the Conners’ CPT, the interstimulus intervals also varied by trial blocks with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 s. Omission errors are the raw score for the number of targets presented where the subject did not respond. Accordingly, the range for this variable is 0-54 with a higher score indicative of worse performance or problems with sustained attention.</description>

          <description>Change in raw scores for the shortened version of the Conner’s CPT from Baseline to Post-dose. The continuous performance test used during the in-lab trial was developed in house using SuperLab Pro v2.0 (Cedrus Corp., Phoenix, AZ). The test was modeled after Conners' CPT, but was shortened for ease of administration and evaluation of short-form sensitivity. The test is one-sixth the length of the Conners’ CPT, lasting 2.33 min with 54 total targets and six nontargets (10% of trials). Similar to the Conners’ CPT, the interstimulus intervals also varied by trial blocks with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 s. Commission errors are the raw score for the numbers of nontargets presented where the subject incorrectly responded.
