  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines if the use of antipsychotic medications might contribute to an
      interruption in bone mineral development and/or a reduction in bone mineral content in
      adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that some antipsychotic medications, including Risperdal, can increase
      prolactin levels in both adult and pediatric populations. Prolactin is a hormone made by the
      central nervous system. The main function of prolactin is to regulate lactation in females.
      However, having too much prolactin over time can interrupt bone mineral accrual and a
      decrease in bone density. Since peak bone mass is reached during adolescents, this is a key
      determinant of a lifetime risk of osteoporosis. On the other hand, there ahve been no reports
      of increased prolactin using Abilify. In fact, in adults Abilify has been shown to normalize
      or even lower prolactin levels. In this study, we will compare the amount of prolactin and
      bone mineral density of adolescents who take Risperdal or Abilify with bone mineral density
      of adolescents who do nto take antipsychotic medications. We will also compare the amount of
      prolactin and bone mineral density of adolescents who take Risperdal with those who take
      Abilify. This study will also help us to learn about the relationship between medications,
      prolactin levels, sex steroids, and bone formation markers in adolescents.
