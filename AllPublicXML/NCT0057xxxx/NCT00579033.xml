    <textblock>
      Patients with focal dystonia experience uncontrollable movements of the hand during certain
      types of skilled movements. Though the origin of the disorder is not fully understood, it is
      thought that brain areas involved in moving the hands and receiving touch information from
      the hands, are involved. For example, patients with dystonia affecting the hand show changes
      in their ability to perceive touch - this is something that typically escapes the patients
      own awareness. Further, the area of the brain receiving touch information has a disrupted
      representation of the finger skin surfaces.

      The goal of our research is to improve dystonia symptoms in patients with hand dystonia. We
      will attempt to achieve this goal by implementing an intensive training treatment that
      requires patients to attend to, and use touch information applied to specific fingertips.
      Previous work has attempted to alter touch perception using sensory training and improvements
      in motor control (hand writing) of dystonia patients were observed. For example, learning to
      read Braille improves tactile perception and handwriting in focal hand dystonia. A different
      approach to treat focal hand dystonia involves a technique called repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and this can also temporarily improve hand writing in dystonia
      patients. The proposed research will attempt to alter touch processing using touch training
      alone, or in combination with rTMS. Rather than train using Braille reading, the sensory
      training will be applied using a systematic, experimenter controlled stimulus set that
      focuses on touch stimuli applied to individual digits. Importantly patients will have to
      associate certain types of touch information with rewards and other touch input with the lack
      of a reward.

      The study will first involve measuring the location and representation of the touch in the
      brain using multiple brain mapping tools. These tools include functional magnetic resonance
      imaging and magnetoencephalography; when both tools are used a very accurate picture of
      finger representation can be obtained, and we also know what brain areas respond to touch
      stimuli. Dystonia symptoms and touch perception will also be assessed. Next, patients will
      participate in a training intervention that involves 15 days(2.5 hr/day) of touch training
      applied to the fingertips of the dystonia affected hand. Patients will identify the touch
      targets amongst distractors and receive on-line performance feedback. The goal of the
      training is to provide the cortex with regular boundaries of fingers and in this way, attempt
      to re-shape the sensory cortex to accept these boundaries. Another group of patients will
      receive rTMS. The goal of the rTMS is to create an environment in sensory cortex that is open
      or 'ready' to accept changes induced by tactile stimulation. The rTMS will be immediately
      followed by the tactile training. A third group of patients will receive a placebo version of
      rTMS followed by tactile training. The latter group will allow us to understand if rTMS has a
      definite effect on the physiology of the patient. Following the 15-day training, we will
      assess the brains representation of fingertips, changes in dystonia symptoms and changes in
      the perception of touch stimuli.

      This research will advance the treatment of focal hand dystonia and assist the design of
      precise remediation training tailored to the dystonia patient.
