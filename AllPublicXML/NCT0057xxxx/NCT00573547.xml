      The purpose of this study is to test whether once-weekly prozac therapy leads to reduction in
      depression in patients requiring kidney dialysis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once-weekly Prozac is a psychiatric medicine, approved by the FDA for the use in treatment of
      psychiatric disorders. This study will test whether once-weekly Prozac leads to reduced
      symptoms of depression. Patients requiring dialysis often report symptoms of depression
      either due to the presence of major depression, a relatively common psychiatric disorder, or
      due to depression secondary to kidney failure.
