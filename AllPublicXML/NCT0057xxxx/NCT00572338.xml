      The purpose of this study is to learn how myeloma cells grow and become a cancer, how to
      distinguish them from normal cells and how to eliminate these cells selectively.

      Participating in this study will require that blood and bone marrow samples be obtained as a
      part of the diagnostic work-up or follow-up of your multiple myeloma. Bone marrow/peripheral
      blood/tissue samples will be collected for research purposes, as well as testing for genetic
      traits of Castleman's disease if you consent to this study. In addition, data will be
      collected including demographic information gathered from your medical record, including
      gender, date of birth, ethnicity, date of diagnosis, laboratory and pathology results,
      treatment protocols, dates of relapses, subsequent treatment protocols, and current
      treatments and medications.

        Samples will be studied in the laboratory and in experimental animal models. These analyses
        and animal models may help to better understand multiple myeloma and to better select the
        appropriate treatment for all participants with multiple myeloma.
