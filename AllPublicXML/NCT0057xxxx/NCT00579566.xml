  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study normal and sarcoma cells. To study these cells we need
      to have human tissue. You will be having or have already had a procedure to remove tissue. We
      would like to use some of this tissue. We will use it for laboratory studies on the
      diagnosis,behavior and treatment of sarcoma. We will perform an extensive analysis of your
      samples. We will only use extra tissue left over after all needed testing has been done or
      remove an additional small amount of tissue if you are having a biopsy. We will also take
      blood samples before and/or after your procedure to measure biochemical factors that may help
      us predict the behavior of sarcoma.

      In this protocol, we plan to identify specific markers from biochemical, proteomic,
      epigenetic and molecular genetic analyses that predict clinical outcome, responsiveness to
      therapy and might serve as promising therapeutic targets in patients with soft tissue
      sarcoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with known or suspected sarcoma who will have or have had tissue removed
             for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.

          -  Patients will be entered without preference for any particular racial/ethnic group or
             gender.

          -  Patients may have received prior hormonal therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
             irradiation, immunotherapy or surgical therapy.

          -  Tissue specimens must be large enough in quantity to allow routine pathologic
             analysis, with the research laboratory specimen removed from the residual specimen,
             which would otherwise be discarded. Optimal tissue amounts for snap freeze: Core
             biopsy - 2 tissue cores Incisional biopsy- 0.5 to 1.5 grams Resected sarcoma specimen-
             1.0 to 50 grams depending on size of specimen Normal fat or muscle tissue - 0.5 to 4.0
             grams (if available from resected sarcoma specimen) Optimal tissue amounts for RNA
             later Core biopsy - 2 tissue cores Incisional biopsy- 30 mg (three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cubes)
             Resected sarcoma specimen - 30 mg (three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cubes) Normal fat or muscle
             tissue - 30 mg (three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cube
