      We have compared to types of surgery to assess which one leaves the smaller surgical defect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a clinical diagnosis of a nodular basal cell carcinoma of less than 1
      centimetre and 1 centimetre away from eyes, nose and ears were either randomized to undergo
      Mohs Micrographic Surgery or standard surgical excision. After the tumour had been removed
      the defect was measured.
