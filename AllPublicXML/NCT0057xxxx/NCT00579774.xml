  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced glycation products or AGEs are a heterogeneous group of molecules formed by exposure
      of tissue constituents to high levels of reducing sugars, e.g. glucose. The interaction of
      these compounds with extra- and intra-cellular components may account in part for several
      conditions related to aging. It has recently been recognized that AGEs are also formed during
      the preparation of food by heating, are absorbed into the circulation and become largely
      incorporated into tissue components. Accumulation of these exogenous substances over time
      may, together with those generated endogenously, contribute to the clinical manifestations
      and complications of aging.

      This is an interventional-randomized study in which we are trying to determine whether a diet
      low in AGE can effectively reduce circulating AGE levels, with or without altering oxidation
      or inflammatory markers, in a subset of both young and older subjects , over a period of 4
      months. If positive results are obtained, longer-term prospective studies will be designed to
      determine if this intervention can affect disease outcomes in older age subjects.

      The study design is very simple and consists initially of obtaining a dietary history, a
      blood sample, 24-hour urine collection and, subsequently, of determining the effects of a
      low-AGE diet for 4 months on the plasma levels of these compounds in a group of healthy
      subjects.

      Advancing age is known to be associated with increased oxidant stress (OS), increased
      prevalence of cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, decline
      of renal function, and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs can lead
      to activation of transcriptional pathways, excessive proliferative/growth-related phenomena
      and sustained inflammation and through these different mechanisms may contribute
      significantly to the clinical complications of aging. Recently, it has become clear that a
      major source of AGE precursors and OS is the Western diet. The body turnover of AGEs involves
      specific receptors and is also dependent on renal function.

      While experimental work has linked AGE-mediated OS and chronic complications in aging
      animals, human studies are strikingly lacking. We plan to test the following two hypotheses:
      1) older men and women (age &gt; 60 years) who consume standard diets (usually high in AGE
      content) will have higher serum levels of AGEs in conjunction with higher markers of OS,
      vascular dysfunction and inflammation when compared with younger subjects (age &lt; 35 but &gt;18
      years), and 2) dietary AGE restriction will reduce the serum levels of AGE, markers of OS,
      vascular dysfunction and inflammation and attenuate the difference between older and younger
      groups.

      Specific aims:

      To determine the effect of dietary AGE modification for 4 months on circulating levels of
      AGEs, markers of oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, inflammatory mediators and
      AGE-receptor mechanisms in PBMN in old and young subjects. This will be a randomized study
      (Study 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult subjects of any gender or race between the ages of 18 and 35 or older than 60
             years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes (absence of diabetes will be defined as a negative history of
             diabetes in combination with a HgbA1c &lt; 6% at the time of recruitment)

          -  Any major cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, PTCA or coronary artery
             bypass) within the preceding 3 months

          -  Smokers

          -  Glucocorticoid, anticoagulant (except for aspirin) or antioxidant therapy

          -  Serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dl

          -  Inability to understand or unwillingness to follow study diets

          -  Any severe illness with an expected patient survival less than 1 year

          -  Patients who have initiated therapy with ACE inhibitors, lipid lowering medications or
             hormone replacement within the previous 3 months. Patients on stable doses of these
             medications will be included

          -  Before randomization all subjects will be screened with a 3-day food record to
             determine their average spontaneous daily intake of AGEs. Only those subjects whose
             daily intake is on the upper half of normal (greater than 14 AGE Eq/day) will
             participate in the study. This value of 14 E/day corresponds to the median daily AGE
             intake estimated in a large number of healthy subjects.
