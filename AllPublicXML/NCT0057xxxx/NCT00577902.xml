    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to define the specific nutritional biomarkers and nutritional
      risk during the course of chemoradiation therapy for cancers of the head and neck. This
      prospective, longitudinal observational study is focused on specific antioxidants and B
      vitamins. The ORAC was selected as an index of overall antioxidant capacity. We chose to
      evaluate antioxidant status because administering antioxidants has been shown to reduce
      chemotherapeutic agent toxicities.

      The study will include 60, ≥18 year old patients (of both genders) with head and neck cancers
      receiving concurrent radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Patients with any pathologically
      proven head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, except those of the nasopharynx and sinus will
      be eligible, if there is no evidence of metastatic disease. Patients with previous
      chemotherapy or radiation treatment will be excluded. A Karnofsky performance status ≥60% or
      more is required. Patients with significant cardiac, chest or gastrointestinal comorbidities
      will be excluded, as will those who have had previous chemotherapy or radiation treatment.
      Patients may receive standard nutritional care, as needed.

      This study will involve an examination of the patient to evaluate mucositis, collection blood
      samples for analysis of specific indicators of nutritional status and completion of
      questionnaire regarding food intake and functional status. Blood samples will be collected
      and brief questionnaires about diet and weight status will be completed at each of the three
      visits. Visits will occur before treatment begins, at the end of XRT treatment and 4-6 weeks
      after completion of XRT. Assessments for the presence and severity of mucositis and
      functional status (Karnofsky) will be done at each visit. All of the samples and data
      collection will be done at visits to clinic required for the patients' treatment. If it is
      necessary to obtain blood samples from the central venous catheter, this will be done using
      aseptic technique and will be performed by a nurse. In some instances, the information
      obtained as part of this project may be used to reduce side effects of therapy.

      Blood samples will be collected and nutritional risk evaluated, using the Patient-Generated
      Subjective Global Assessment tool (PG-SGA). The PG-SGA and blood tests will be performed
      before, at the end of XRT treatment and four to six weeks after treatment is completed.

        Methodology. Patients presenting at the UAMS Head and Neck Clinic will be invited to
        participate in this study according to the inclusion criteria listed:

          1. Age over 18 years,

          2. Pathologically proven squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, except
             nasopharyngeal and sinus

          3. Concurrent radiation and chemotherapy (taxotere/carboplatin)

          4. Karnofsky score over60

          5. Must receive radiation (IMRT)/chemotherapy at UAMS

          6. No evidence of metastatic disease

          7. No significant cardiac, chest, gastrointestinal or renal morbidities

          8. No previous chemotherapy or radiation If they are considered eligible and agree to
             participate, the patients will be registered and sign informed consent form. Radiation
             and chemotherapy will commence on the same day. IMRT is the only modality of radiation
             allowed. Blood samples will be collected and nutritional risk evaluated, using the
             Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment tool (PG-SGA). The PG-SGA and blood
             tests will be performed before, at the end of XRT treatment and four to six weeks
             after treatment is completed.
