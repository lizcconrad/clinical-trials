      Objectives:

        1. To show feasibility and reproducibility of performing a multiplex ligation-dependent
           amplification procedure (RT-MLPA)

        2. To describe the profile of changes in inflammatory gene products, using RT-MLPA, in
           pediatric patients receiving stem cell transplant

        3. To determine if changes in a specific inflammatory product, or a combination of
           inflammatory products, can predict grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease

      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a successful treatment option
      for multiple malignant diseases (i.e. leukemia) and non-malignant disorders (i.e. metabolic
      disorders, genetic disorders, immunodeficiencies). Unfortunately, transplantation from an
      HLA-related family member is only available in 30-40% of stem cell transplant recipients. The
      other patients requiring HSCT must then receive their stem cells from either a
      matched-unrelated donor (MUD) or from cord blood. One major limitation upon receiving these
      unrelated stem cells are acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Specifically looking at
      acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), up to 30% of the recipients of stem cells from an
      HLA-identical related donor will develop greater or equal to grade 2 of aGVHD despite
      immunosuppressive prophylaxis. The percentages of patients who develop aGVHD from unrelated
      donors are even higher.

      The current standard treatment for aGVHD is corticosteroids. Unfortunately, only 40% of
      matched-siblings HSCT cases and 25% of MUD SCT cases show a complete response to these
      steroids. Those patients who do not respond to corticosteroids can show a dismal outcome.
      Given the poor outcome with refractory GVHD, there has been a lot of interest in trying to
      predict who will get GVHD. These findings could lead to augmentation of GVHD prophylaxis.

      The purpose of this study is to look at a series of identified biomarkers to predict aGVHD.
      Once blood is drawn from the SCT recipient, a multiplex ligation-dependent probe
      amplification (MLPA) will test different biomarkers in the blood to result in about 30-45
      target sequences being examined simultaneously.
