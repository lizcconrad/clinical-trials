  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      quetiapine SR monotherapy and divalproex sodium ER monotherapy in comparison to placebo in
      the treatment of ambulatory bipolar disorder with co-morbid lifetime panic disorder or
      generalized anxiety disorder and current at least moderately severe anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of
      quetiapine SR monotherapy compared to divalproex sodium ER monotherapy in outpatient subjects
      with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or NOS disorder, a lifetime panic or generalized anxiety
      disorder, and current diagnosis at least moderately severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately
      180 subjects will be randomized to obtain 90 subjects who complete the 8-week trial (30
      completers per treatment group). This calculation is based on drop out rates in a similar
      patient population carried out by this group of collaborators. Subjects will be randomized to
      quetiapine SR or divalproex sodium ER or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. No concomitant
      psychotropic medication will be allowed throughout the study except for prn lorazepam during
      the first two weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms, prn zolpidem and
      zaleplon for the management of insomnia and benztropine for the management of EPS. Throughout
      the study, psychiatric scales will be used to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of
      treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and recorded.
