  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of combination first-line treatment
      with docetaxel + Xeloda + Avastin in patients with inflammatory or locally advanced breast
      cancer. Patients will receive 3-weekly cycles of Avastin (15mg/kg i.v. on day 1 of each
      cycle), docetaxel (75mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 of each cycle, after Avastin) and Xeloda (2000mg/m2
      p.o. on days 1-15 of each cycle). Four cycles of chemotherapy are planned, plus an optional
      additional two cycles; after chemotherapy patients will be assessed for surgery. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100
      individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Pathological Complete Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of surgery, after receiving up to 6 cycles of treatment (average of 12 to 18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>pCR was defined as the absence of viable tumor cells, as determined by standard histologic procedure, in the tumor specimen (including regional lymph nodes) obtained at surgery. In order to minimize evaluation bias, tumor specimens were analyzed by both a central and local pathologist. The number of participants with pathological tumor stage 0 (pT0) and regional lymph nodes stage 0 (pN0) at surgery was determined. pCR was defined as the number of participants with pT0 and pN0 at surgery divided by the total number of participants with pathological tumor stage data collected.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of Cycles 1-6</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must have decreased to normal (short axis less than [&lt;]10 millimeters [mm]). No new lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (â‰¥) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short aixs was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease.
