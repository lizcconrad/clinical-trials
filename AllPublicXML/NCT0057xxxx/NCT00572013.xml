      Objectives: I. To determine the response rate, complete and partial, of patients with
      indolent lymphoma receiving Rituxan and BEAM with autologous stem cell transplant. II. To
      determine if the addition of Rituxan changes the toxicity profile attributed to high-dose
      BEAM chemotherapy.

      This protocol is a phase I/II trial combining the Rituxan as a pre and post-transplant agent
      to aid in the chemotherapy sensitization and the treatment of minimal residual disease
      post-transplant.

          -  WHO performance status greater or equal to 2

          -  Subjects without serious disease or condition that, in the opinion of the
