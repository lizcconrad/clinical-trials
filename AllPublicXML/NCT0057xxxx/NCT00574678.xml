  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will further evaluate the use of protein identification or protein pattern
      (signature) found in tears. We hypothesize that differences exist between the protein profile
      in tear fluid from patients with versus without cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, this study will compare the protein profile in tear fluid from patients with
      breast, ovarian or colon cancer versus &quot;normal male and female patients&quot; for differences that
      show promise as a diagnostic indicator. If such differences can be found, then their
      diagnostic potential will be assessed and developed further in a subsequent study. The
      long-term goal of this project will be to develop a screening tool for the detection of
      breast and/or other cancers.

    <description>A tear sample (~75 microliters in a tuberculin syringe with the needle removed) will be taken at time of the initial clinic visit. After collection, the tears will be put directly on ice and taken to the lab. If it is not possible to obtain natural tears, an &quot;eye wash&quot; method using sterile saline will be employed and the fluid collected using the aforementioned technique. The SELDI-MS process will be conducted on the specimen immediately. The remainder of the tear specimen will be stored in a -80ÂºC freezer until completely analyzed.</description>
