  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether short-term exposure to a compound found in
      some fruits and vegetables (anthocyanin), is effective in improving skin health and reducing
      the levels of various markers of cardiovascular disease risk. A range of skin health
      parameters are being studied and volunteers are also providing skin biopsy, urine and blood
      samples. 62 postmenopausal women have been recruited for this study.

          -  Agreeing to maintain existing cosmetic and beauty regime, and avoid 'tanning' (either
