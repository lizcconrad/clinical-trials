  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if we can find ways to improve the treatment of tobacco
      dependence in patients who have cancer or may have cancer. We will compare two ways to help
      people quit tobacco use before surgery and to stay quit after surgery. One way is a scheduled
      reduced smoking program followed by use of the nicotine patch. In this program, the tobacco
      user will gradually cut down on their tobacco use until they quit. Once they quit, they will
      be offered the nicotine patch. We will compare this approach to our current program of
      counseling and use of nicotine patch. What we learn from this study may help us to develop
      new ways to help tobacco users and improve our current smoking cessation program.

      Smoking cessation offers an important way for newly diagnosed cancer patients to take an
      active role in their treatment and recovery. Quitting tobacco use decreases cancer patients'
      risk of disease recurrence and development of second primary cancers. In addition,
      preoperative tobacco cessation may reduce the likelihood of perioperative pulmonary,
      cardiovascular, and wound healing complications. Due to increased awareness of the health
      hazards of tobacco use, rates of cessation after cancer diagnosis are high. However, 35% to
      69% of patients continue to use tobacco and this is largely due to strong barriers to
      quitting (low-self efficacy, psychological distress) rather than lack of positive intentions
      to quit. Previous attempts to increase smoking cessation among the medically ill have
      provided intervention either during or after hospitalization.

      We propose that the period immediately prior to hospitalization and surgery represents a
      unique window of opportunity, or &quot;teachable moment,&quot; for smoking cessation that could take
      full advantage of patients' enhanced health awareness and quitting motivation, strong
      physician quitting advice, and patients' heightened desire to take an active role in their
      care.

    <description>Same components of HC+NRT as well as the PS/SRS enhancement.The research team will provide education about scheduled reduced smoking either in person or over the phone. Purpose of the training session, will be audio taped, to prepare participants for daily PDA use over the dur of the scheduled-reduced smoking intervention. Training will demonstrate use of PDA and simulate common technical and procedural issues that might arise during the intervention (e.g., forgetting to record a cigarette or wake time; repeating a day's schedule if needed, prior to the quit date). The simulation will reflect anticipated problems and those identified by users of the PDA. A study helpline number and instructional manual will be provided. A member of the research staff will contact the study participants, once the reduced smoking schedule has begun, to check that the patient understands the schedule and that the PDA is working properly. Estimate patient training with the PDA will require 30 minutes.</description>
