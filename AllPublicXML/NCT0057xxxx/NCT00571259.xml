    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double blinded, prospective, multicenter, clinical trial. All
      patients requiring vascular access with a tunneled central venous catheter for hemodialysis
      are eligible for enrollment. Patients will be randomized to receive either Heparin 1,000 U/ml
      in a volume sufficient to fill the catheter length in both ports or to receive 4% Sodium
      Citrate with Gentamicin 320 mcg/mL in a volume sufficient to fill the catheter length in both
      ports.We hypothesize that the device related infection rate in the Citrate/Gentamicin group
      will be less than the heparin arm.
