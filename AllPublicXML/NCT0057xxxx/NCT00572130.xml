    <textblock>
      Rexin-G is a tumor-targeted gene medicine that is designed to seek out and destroy both
      primary tumors and metastatic cancers without the side effects of standard chemotherapy. The
      objectives of the study are: (1) to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of intravenous
      injections of Rexin-G, a tumor-targeted gene vector, in controlling tumor growth and
      prolonging life, and (2) to evaluate its over-all safety.

      The adaptive trial design of this advanced Phase II study incorporates (i) a dosing schedule
      based on the patient's estimated tumor burden and not on standard dosing per kilogram body
      weight or body surface area, and (2) a tumor response evaluation process that is unique to
      the manner in which osteosarcoma responds favorably to therapy, i.e., with necrosis and
      increasing calcification in metastatic tumors and decreased glucose utilization using PET-CT
      imaging studies.

      Twenty to thirty patients will receive Rexin-G at either Dose Level 1 or 2. Patients will be
      assigned a dose level based on the estimated tumor burden as measured by PET-CT imaging
      studies. Estimated tumor burden is measured by multiplying the sum of the longest diameters
      of target lesions in cm by 10e9 cancer cells. If the tumor burden is less than 10 billion
      cells, the patient will be assigned to Dose Level 1, if the tumor burden is greater than 10
      billion cells, the patient will be assigned to Dose Level 2.

      *Treatment Cycle Dose Level Vector Dose/Day Max.Volume/Dose

      Two times a week 1 1.0 x 10e11 cfu 200 ml

      Three times a week 2 1.0 x 10e11 cfu 200 ml

      * Each treatment cycle will be six weeks (four weeks of treatment and two weeks of rest).
      Patients who have resolution of toxicity to &lt; grade I may have repeat cycles. After one or
      more treatment cycles, the principal investigator may recommend surgical debulking or
      complete surgical removal. If residual disease is present either by histopathological
      examination or by PET-CT scan, repeat treatment cycles may be given 3-4 weeks after surgery,
      if the surgical incision has healed, and if the patient has &lt; grade I toxicity.
