  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether chest tubes can be safely removed without
      considering how much fluid is draining through the tube.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracostomy tubes are routinely used to drain the pleural space of fluid and gas to optimize
      pulmonary mechanics. Clinicians frequently postpone removal of thoracostomy tubes if the
      drainage from the tube exceeds a specific volume threshold for the prior 24 hours. However,
      there is substantial variability in the drainage volume threshold that different clinicians
      use, and no threshold has been established as clearly superior to any other. Removing tubes
      independently of the drainage volume may result in a greater risk of pleural effusion or
      pneumothorax requiring an invasive drainage procedure. However, removing tubes independently
      of the drainage volume might also expedite recovery by allowing earlier removal of the tube,
      thus diminishing pain and increasing patient mobility.

      Thoracostomy tube management practices, including the drainage volume threshold used, may be
      dissimilar for different types of disease processes, so this study will be restricted to
      patients who required a thoracostomy tube for treatment of traumatic injury.
