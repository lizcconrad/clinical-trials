      RATIONALE: Gold sodium thiomalate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gold sodium
      thiomalate in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of gold sodium thiomalate in patients with
           advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  To describe the toxicities associated with this treatment.

        -  To describe any preliminary evidence of biologic activity.

        -  To further assess the correlation between PKCι expression and the antitumor effects of
           gold sodium thiomalate.

        -  To study the association of clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) with
           pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters.

        -  To describe anti-proliferative activity of gold sodium thiomalate through
           3-deoxy-3-[^18F]-fluorothymidine positron emission tomography imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gold sodium thiomalate.

      Patients receive gold sodium thiomalate intramuscularly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients then receive gold sodium thiomalate once every 4 weeks until a total
      cumulative dose of 1 gram is delivered.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and prior to therapy in weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.
      Samples are analyzed by mass spectometry for pharmacokinetics. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue
      samples are analyzed for PKC_l expression and antitumor activity. Antiproliferative effects
      of gold sodium thiomalate are analyzed by 3-deoxy-3-[^18F]-fluorothymidine positron emission
      tomography imaging.
