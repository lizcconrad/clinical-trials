  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective cohort study describing pregnancy outcomes in women
      with pre-existing (prior to pregnancy) type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to any
      formulation of exenatide during pregnancy. The pregnancy registry will compare the occurrence
      of the pregnancy outcomes of interest with those collected from a prospective group of women
      with pre-existing type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to one or more antidiabetic
      medications other than exenatide during pregnancy. Insulin exposures are acceptable in both
      groups but must be in addition to one or more other antidiabetic medications in the
      non-exenatide group.

      The primary study objective is to evaluate the percentage of major birth defects (i.e., those
      that caused significant functional or cosmetic impairment, required surgery, or were
      life-limiting) following use of exenatide during pregnancy for treatment of type 2 diabetes
      compared to the percentage of major birth defects following use of one or more antidiabetic
      medications other than exenatide during pregnancy for treatment of type 2 diabetes.

      The secondary objectives of the Exenatide Pregnancy Registry are to evaluate the percentage
      of other adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth)
      and any potential impact of exenatide use during breastfeeding among pregnancies or births in
      women who used exenatide for pre-existing type 2 diabetes:

      This study is being conducted in the United States (US). Enrollment in the Registry is
      voluntary. The Exenatide Pregnancy Registry is sponsored by AstraZeneca and is managed by INC
      Research, LLC. The scientific conduct and analysis of the Registry is overseen by a Registry
      Review Committee (RRC) consisting of experts in maternal and fetal medicine,
      teratology/genetics, epidemiology, type 2 diabetes in pregnancy and/or pediatrics.
