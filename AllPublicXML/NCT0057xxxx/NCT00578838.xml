  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether magnetic resonance (MR) techniques can detect
      changes caused by chemotherapy in the livers of patients who have been treated for colorectal
      cancer. Some patients who undergo chemotherapy for colorectal cancer may experience
      side-effects in their livers. These side effects may influence further treatment options. If
      this study finds that MR techniques detect changes in the liver due to chemotherapy, then MR
      methods may eventually be used to help patients and physicians plan further treatment.

      Each patient will have 4 MR exams: prior to or within one week of the start of the
      chemotherapy regimen, one after 6 weeks of chemotherapy, a third after completion of
      chemotherapy (between 12 and 24 weeks post-initiation of chemotherapy) and a long term
      followup study at least 4 months after the completion of chemotherapy. Normal volunteers will
      be recruited and studied by MR for comparison to patient data.

    <description>You will have two MR exams on two different days. There will be no injection of contrast material. An MR exam requires about 1 hour. The second MR exam will take place 2-3 weeks after the first one. This second MR exam will take about 1 hour and will look at whether the results from the MR exams are reliable and repeatable.</description>

        There will be a total of 20 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, 20 patients with

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent.

          -  21 years of age or older.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma (patients only).

          -  Resected primary colorectal cancer and no metastatic disease or primary colorectal
             cancer with no metastatic disease and planned resection after neo-adjuvant
             chemotherapy or metastatic colorectal carcinoma considered by the attending physician
             to have resectable or potentially resectable hepatic metastases (patients only). Each
             patient will be staged by his/her attending physician in the Department of Medicine or
             Surgery. Hepatic metastases are considered resectable if they are expected to be
             completely removable with negative margins by a procedure that leaves behind
             sufficient liver parenchyma with arterial/portal blood supply, venous drainage and
             biliary drainage for subsequent regeneration and survival. Potentially resectable
             indicates that a reduction in tumor size due to chemotherapy could render the tumors
             resectable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to cooperate for an MR exam.

          -  Contraindication to MR:

               -  Pacemaker

               -  Aneurysmal clips

               -  Any ferrous metallic implants which could be deflected by the magnet

               -  Metal implants in field of view which could distort the images and spectroscopy
                  data

               -  Pregnant women

               -  Age and mental status wherein he/she is unable to cooperate for MR study

          -  Patients who are considered to have unresectable hepatic metastases will be excluded.
             Hepatic metastases are considered unresectable if their removal would leave behind
             insufficient liver parenchyma for subsequent regeneration and survival. In addition,
             hepatic metastases are considered unresectable if their removal would be expected to
             leave behind residual disease (positive margins). Also, patients are considered
             unresectable if they have any comorbid conditions which would jeopardize successful
             recovery from hepatic resection.
