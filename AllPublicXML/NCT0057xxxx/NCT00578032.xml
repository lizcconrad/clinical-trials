  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to better understand the changes in symptoms and overall quality of
      life after head and neck surgery and reconstruction. &quot;Quality of Life&quot; means how you feel
      about your life as a result of your disease and its treatment. Learning about changes in
      patients' quality of life will help doctors and future patients make more informed treatment
      decisions.

      This prospective, longitudinal study will evaluate patient-reported quality of life and
      symptomatology immediately prior to and for up to one year following surgical resection and
      reconstruction head and neck malignancies.Patients with head and neck malignancies that
      require simultaneous surgical resection and reconstruction of the ablative defect will be
      eligible to participate.Quality of life and symptom relief will be evaluated by both domain
      and disease specific questionnaires at four time points: pre-operatively, and 3 months (±1
      month), 6 months (±1), and 9 months (-1 and +3) post-operatively. These assessment points
      represent clinically significant events in patients' post-operative course following head and
      neck surgery. Studies have shown that quality of life decreases significantly at three months
      after surgery but then reapproaches baseline levels around one year (1). Pre-operative
      responses will serve as the baseline for comparison.
