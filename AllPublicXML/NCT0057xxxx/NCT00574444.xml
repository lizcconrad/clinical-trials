    <textblock>
      We propose a phase I study of laparoscopic assisted, transvaginal peritoneoscopy by using
      flexible endoscopy in female patients with pelvic pain. It is designed as a hybrid procedure
      with laparoscopy using one port for adequate safety with the ultimate goal in the future that
      transvaginal NOTES can replace therapeutic pelviscopy for this indication. The standard
      number of port sites for diagnostic laparoscopy is 2-3. By reducing the number and size of
      laparoscopic port, patients should already experience benefits from this hybrid procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of patients with chronic pelvic pain will have a normal laparoscopy. The
      vast majority of women with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain and absence of ovarian
      endometriomata determined by ultrasound will have revised ASRM Stage I or II (peritoneal)
      disease with preservation of the posterior cul-de-sac. This sparing of the posterior
      cul-de-sac may offer a preferable route of entry for endoscopic surgery compared to the
      current standard of care.

      Despite all the advantages of laparoscopic surgery, it is not free of risks and pain, and
      creates scars, which themselves are associated with complications such as abdominal wall
      hernias and adhesions.

      Within this scenario, a new surgical procedure has emerged, called natural orifice
      transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). This technique uses existing orifices of the body
      for introducing optical systems and surgical instruments into the peritoneal cavity by
      avoiding penetration of the abdominal wall. The expectations are no postoperative pain,
      optimal cosmesis without any visable scars and shorter recovery similar to therapeutic
      endoscopy.
