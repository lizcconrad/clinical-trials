    <textblock>
      This trial was made available as a compassionate use protocol for patients who failed
      induction chemotherapy + Vaccine on trials 197-99 and 196-99. These follicular NHL patients
      then went on to high dose BEAM chemotherapy and transplant. Patients received idiotype
      vaccine therapy at 3 months post transplant. Vaccine was given monthly x 4 series, with a
      fifth series given 12 weeks after the fourth. Patients are then followed annually until
      progression or death with standard staging. Immune response testing continues annually on
      patients who continue to have a response post transplant.
