  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The basic premise of this research proposal is to determine whether there is any significant
      association between germline polymorphisms and cancers of colon, bladder, breast, testicular,
      prostate, ovaries, kidney, lung, lymphoid organs, and head and neck. This is an exploratory
      study designed to generate hypotheses for further research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To establish significant correlations between genetic polymorphisms and cancer, a largescale,
      systematic comparison of genetic alterations utilizing a case-control methodology is
      proposed. To date, such studies have been limited due to the large number of samples
      necessary for obtaining statistical significance, and the lack of rapid and accurate methods
      to screen for genetic polymorphisms. We propose to utilize an anonymized design to obtain DNA
      from residual material from routine diagnostic blood tests, to link these samples to a
      limited set of clinical variables, and to test for the frequency of candidate low-penetrance
      cancer susceptibility alleles. These data will be combined with similar data from a control
      group of age- and ethnically-matched volunteers for a related cohort study to be conducted
      separately. Polymorphisms to be screened for include those involving the genes PTEN, APC, TGF
      βR-I, BLM, CHK2, a p85 phosphoprotein, ATM, ER, PR, MCP-1, MPIF, CCR2/5, CCR3, and SULT1A1.
      Cancers to be included are breast, bladder, kidney,colon, testicular, lung, prostate,
      ovarian, lymphoid neoplasms, and head and neck carcinomas. Genes with SNPs known to be
      relevant for either the development or treatment of lymphoid malignancies will also be
      targeted. Specifically, candidate genes will be selected from 1) cytokine signaling, 2) DNA
      repair, and 3) apoptosis regulatory pathways.
