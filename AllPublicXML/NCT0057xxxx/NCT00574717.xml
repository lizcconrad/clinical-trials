  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if wearing a moderate spectacle under-correction (3.00D) and performing
      activities designed to stimulate accurate accommodation during a 15-month period will enhance
      emmetropization in highly hyperopic (between +5.00D and +7.00D) 3-month old infants.

      The purpose of the project is to determine if emmetropization can be enhanced in very
      farsighted babies. We will give them glasses with a partial correction, an amount that is
      less than their full degree of farsightedness but enough to put them in the zone of effective
      emmetropization. This 'boost' is meant to enable very farsighted babies to use their eyes in
      a normal way and emmetropize as normal infants. This partial correction would be given at 3
      months of age for a period of up to 15 months. A program of visual engagement is also
      provided in order to encourage the normal development and use of accommodation. As changes in
      farsightedness occur, the power of the glasses will be reduced at follow up appointments to
      keep the farsightedness within the zone of effective emmetropization. Once an infant reaches
      a normal amount of farsightedness, the glasses would be discontinued.

    <description>Infants will receive spectacles with 3.00D of under-correction relative to the spherical equivalent in each eye as measured by the cycloplegic retinoscopy performed at baseline. They will also receive the full amount of measured astigmatism in their glasses. Changes in spectacle lens power will be made as needed at follow-up visits to keep the level of under-correction within 0.50D of the target 3.00D. A program of visual engagement is also provided to encourage the normal development and use of accommodation. Treatment will continue for 15 months (until 18 months of age) or until the infant reaches a spherical equivalent refractive error of +3.00D or less hyperopia.</description>
