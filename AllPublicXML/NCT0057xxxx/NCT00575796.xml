      The overall objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of weekly Vinblastine in
      chemotherapy na√Øve patients with progressive or incompletely resected paediatric low grade
      glioma, to generate estimates of the response rate, progression-free survival, toxicity and
      quality of daily living among the population treated and determine biologic factors which
      will enable us to predict tumour behaviour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unresectable low grade glioma (LGG) of childhood increasingly appears as a chronic condition
      for which multiple treatments may be required. While several studies have shown evidence of
      short term tumour control with chemotherapy, the progression-free survival at 5 years is
      unsatisfactory. In addition, several regimens currently used for this condition are
      associated with significant risks of side effect and long term toxicity.

      We have piloted in a single arm study the feasibility and efficacy of Vinblastine for
      children with recurrent and refractory low grade glioma, who have failed at least one line of
      treatment (chemotherapy and/or irradiation). Preliminary results show promising activity with
      minimal toxicity.

    <description>Children will be treated with Vinblastine Sulphate chemotherapy via intravenous administration once a week over a period of 26 weeks. MRI disease evaluation should be performed at weeks 12 and 26 (+/- 1 week). If response on MRI at week 26 &gt; stable (i.e. stable disease, objective or partial or complete response compared to the baseline MRI exam), continue weekly Vinblastine to the total duration of treatment (i.e. 70 weeks).
All children will be followed until they demonstrate clear signs tumour progression.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have been &lt; 18 years of age when originally diagnosed.

          2. Histologic Diagnosis: Patients must have histologic verification of LGG at original
             diagnosis. Exceptions are optic pathway gliomas in children with neurofibromatosis or
             children with large hypothalamic tumours for which a diagnostic biopsy does not seem
             necessary. Patients with disseminated low grade glioma are eligible.

               1. Astrocytoma Variants: fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic, mixed

               2. Pilocytic Astrocytoma

               3. Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma

               4. Infantile desmoplastic astrocytoma

               5. Ganglioglioma

               6. Oligodendroglioma

               7. Mixed glioma (including oligo-astrocytoma)

               8. Pilomyxoid astrocytoma

          3. Performance Level :Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 or a
             Lansky/Karnofsky score &gt; 50

          4. Life expectancy: Patients must have a life expectancy of * 2 months.

          5. Prior Therapy: Patients are eligible at the time of diagnosis or first progression
             following treatment with surgery only.

          6. Measurable Disease: Patients must have measurable disease, documented by radiographic
             criteria.

          7. Concomitant Medications

               1. Steroids: Steroids may be used at the time of inclusion to control progressive
                  symptoms.

               2. Anti-epileptic medications are permitted - levetiracetam (Keppra) or clobazam
                  (Frisium) being the preferred anti-epileptic medications for chronic use
                  reserving phenytoin and lorazepam for acute seizure control.

          8. Organ Function Requirements: All patients must have adequate organ and bone marrow

             count * 100 x 109/L (transfusion independent).

          9. Regulatory: All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written
             informed consent and all institutional requirements for human studies must be met.
             This study is open to all participants regardless of gender or ethnicity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria are restrictive. Patient must meet all inclusion criteria.
