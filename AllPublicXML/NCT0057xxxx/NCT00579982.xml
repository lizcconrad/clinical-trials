      To determine the convenience and satisfaction of new orally disintegrating tablet formulation
      (ODT) of lamictal in subjects with a mood disorder. This was a multicenter, open-label study
      in participants with a mood disorder, who reported difficulty or discomfort in swallowing the
      currently marketed IR compressed tablet formulation of lamotrigine and who had a person (such
      as a spouse, partner, companion, aid, nurse, caregiver, etc) willing to complete a
      Companion/Caregiver Question. Subjects were switched from the currently marketed lamotrigine
      IR formulation to a matching dose of lamotrigine IR orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) for 3
      weeks to determine convenience and satisfaction.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Convenience Subscale Score (CSS) Derived From the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM v 1.4) Using Items 9 (Ease of Use), 10 (Ease of Planning to Use), and 11 (Convenience) at Week 3.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Study (Week 3) or Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The CSS is the sum of items 9 (values: 1=Extremely difficult - 7=Extremely easy), 10 (same set of values as for 9), and 11 (1=Extremely inconvenient - 7=Extremely convenient). The sum has 3 subtracted from it, is divided by 18, and then multiplied by 100; the range is 0-100. Change from baseline=end of study CSS minus baseline score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Global Satisfaction Subscale Score, From the TSQM Using Items 12 (Confidence in Medicine), 13 (Certainty That Good Things About Medication Outweigh Bad Things), and 14 (Satisfaction With Medication) at Week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Study (Week 3) or Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Satisfaction Subscale Score is the sum of item 12 (values: 1=Not at all confident - 5=Extremely confident), item 13 (values: 1=Not at all certain - 5=Extremely certain), and item 14 (Extremely dissatisfied - 7=Extremely satisfied). The sum has 3 subtracted from it, is divided by 14, and then multiplied by 100; thus, the range is 0-100.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Study (Week 3) or at Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician assessment evaluating how mentally ill the patient is at time of evaluation. The questionnaire is based on a 7-point scale (from1 = Normal to 7 = Among the most extremely ill patients).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) Score at Week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Study (Week 3 weeks) or at Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-reported questionnaire consisting of 21 items on a 4 point scale (0 to 3, with 3 indicating most severely ill), with the score being the sum of the items. The change from baseline is the end of study score minus the baseline score; larger values indicate more depression with the ODT formulation relative to the IR formulation.</description>

          -  Subject must have a person (such as a spouse, partner, companion, aid, nurse,
             caregiver, etc) willing to complete a Companion/Caregiver Preference Question either
             in person or via the telephone. This individual must read, write, and comprehend
             English at a level sufficient to complete study-related assessments.

          -  Subject must have been taking a stable dose of currently marketed compressed tablet

          -  Subject must currently report a difficulty or discomfort swallowing lamotrigine IR
             compressed tablets, the nature of which is or will be documented. NOTE: A diagnosis of
             dysphagia is not required.

          -  Subject must have the ability to comprehend the consent form and provide informed
             consent.
