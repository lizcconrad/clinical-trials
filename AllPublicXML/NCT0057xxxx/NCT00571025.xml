  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the characteristics of those who obtain genetic
      susceptibility testing for Alzheimer's disease with APOE disclosure and to study the
      psychological and behavioral consequences of providing this information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in genetic research have led to an increased number of testing procedures to
      determine future risk of disease among at-risk individuals. An increasing number of genes are
      being identified that confer susceptibility for a given disease rather than inevitably
      causing it. Given that such genes may provide risk information for common diseases (e.g.,
      stroke, depression), there is a growing need to understand how at-risk populations might
      respond to the option of genetic susceptibility testing. A prominent case in point is
      Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      Participation in this study requires an initial phone call which will elicit some medical and
      family history information about the participant. A first in-person visit to the clinic will
      consist of an education session and the administration of some tests to assess memory and
      thinking skills. This visit will take approximately 2-3 hours. Approximately 2 weeks later,
      participants will return to have their blood drawn for genetic testing. Participants will
      then be randomized to one of two groups. Those in the experimental arm will receive
      information on their risk based on their family history and APOE genotype, while those in the
      active comparator arm will receive information on their risk for developing Alzheimer's
      disease based on their family history alone. Participants will be followed for 1 year
      following disclosure of results with 2 additional clinic visits.
