  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators planed to conduct a randomized, controlled, crossover trial to examine the
      effects of daily walnuts intake among Korean subjects with metabolic syndrome. Primary
      objective of this study was to investigate the effects of daily walnut intake on changes of
      metabolic syndrome indices in Koreans with metabolic syndrome age over 30 years old. This
      study was consisted of four periods: run-in, first intervention, wash-out, and second
      intervention phases. As 16 weeks of first intervention period began after the run-in phase,
      the subjects were randomly assigned into one of two groups: walnut group and control group.
      Participants in walnut group consumed 45 grams of walnuts on a daily basis and participants
      in control group were provided iso-caloric white bread for first 16 weeks. After the first
      intervention and wash-out period (6 weeks), second intervention which is crossover of first
      intervention was started during the next 16 weeks. Anthropometric measurements and
      biochemical analyses were done at the beginning and the end of each intervention (0, 16, 22,
      and 38 weeks of trial). Habitual diet was randomly observed using 3-day diet record once
      during each phase.

      Investigators expected to evaluate 1)effects of walnut ingestion on reverting metabolic
      syndrome to normal status especially by reducing waist circumference and improving serum
      levels of triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein, 2)beneficial effects of daily walnut
      consumption on changes of body composition in the subjects with metabolic syndrome, and
      3)regulatory effects of daily walnut intake on inflammatory markers and diabetic markers.
