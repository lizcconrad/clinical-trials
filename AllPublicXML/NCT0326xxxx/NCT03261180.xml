    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well Nestle Impact Advanced Recovery works in
      improving surgery recovery in patients with head and neck cancer. Adding a nutritional
      supplement, such as Nestle Impact Advanced Recovery to a regular diet before and after head
      and neck cancer surgery may help to decrease the number of wound complications after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of perioperative use of Nestle Impact Advanced Recovery (AR) on the rate
      of post-operative wound complications within 30 days after major head and neck surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess whether sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for the development of
      post-operative wound complications.

      II. Assess whether Nestle IMPACT AR decreases the rate of other post-operative complications
      such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis, and clostridium difficile
      colitis within 30 days of surgery, as well as length of hospital stay.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess changes in muscle metabolic gene expression at the time of surgery associated with
      sarcopenia and IMAPCT treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive Nestle Impact AR for 5 days before and after surgery in addition to
      regular diet.

      GROUP I: Patients receive regular diet.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days post-surgery.
