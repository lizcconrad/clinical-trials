  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the association of maxillary expansion using a rapid palatal expansion, use of
      a mandibular advancement appliance (MGA™) and of a device allowing sleep in a semi-seated
      position (Yoobreath™) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OAS). MGA™ and YooBreath™
      constitute the Yookid system™.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome (OSA) shows a 10% morbidity rate in children with a higher
      rate between the ages of 3 and 5. Generally speaking, its prevalence is underestimated.
      Furthermore, detecting OSA remains difficult due to its particular physiopathology. The
      decrease in nasopharyngeal airway dimensions is the most common etiology. This decrease is
      related to soft tissues as well as maxillomandibular abnormalities. The aim of the study is
      to show that reducing sleep apnea in children remains possible when inducing rapid palatal
      expansion and mandibular advancement using the Yookid™ system. The Yookid™ system associates
      a mandibular advancement appliance and repositioning of the patient during sleep.
