    <textblock>
      Primary malignant and non-malignant brain tumors account for an estimated 21.42 cases per
      100,000 for a total count of 343,175 incident tumors based on worldwide population estimates.
      These entities result in variable but disappointing rates of survival, particularly for
      primary brain tumors (5-year survival rates: anaplastic astrocytoma 27%; glioblastoma
      multiforme 5%). Metastatic brain tumors outnumber primary brain tumors (estimates as high as
      10:1) as they affect approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with cancer. In terms of brain
      tumor surgery, the extent of surgical resection—a factor that is greatly impacted by a
      Neurosurgeon's ability to visualize these tumors—is directly associated with patient outcomes
      and survival. Although spinal cord tumors are lower in terms of their incidence, data
      correlating extent-of-resection to outcomes and survival have been demonstrated in patients
      with intramedullary tumors. Using systemically delivered compounds with a high sensitivity of
      detection by near-infrared fluorescence, it would be possible for us to improve surgical
      resection thus minimizing chances of recurrence and improving survival. The use of an ICG
      probe registered with MRSI-derived metabolic data allows for the operating field and tissue
      at the tumor/normal brain or spinal cord interface to be observed in real-time.

      Investigational Agent

      Indocyanine Green (ICG) is an FDA approved, water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye routinely used
      in clinical settings for measuring cardiac output, liver function, and retinal angiography
      and has been in use for over 50 years. The chemical formula is C45H47N2O6S2Na and the
      compound has a molecular weight of 774.96Da (CAS number 3599-32-4). It has a peak absorption
      in the near-infrared spectrum at 805nm and maximal emission at 835nm. Indocyanine Green (ICG)
      is rapidly and completely bound to plasma proteins (especially albumin) after intravenous
      injection in the blood (3). At that point the emission spectrum shifts dramatically and can
      be excited to the 735nm absorbance - 770nm emission spectrum.

      Indocyanine Green (ICG) for Injection USP is a sterile, lyophilized green powder containing
      25 mg of indocyanine green with no more than 5% sodium iodide. Indocyanine Green for
      Injection USP is dissolved using Sterile Water for Injection, and is to be administered
      intravenously. There is currently no known toxicity to this agent and no overdose has ever
      been reported (product insert). Current trials have utilized 3-5 mg/kg without any adverse
      effects. The LD50 after I.V. administration ranges between 60 and 80 mg/kg in mice, 50 and 70
      mg/kg in rats and 50 and 80 mg/kg in rabbits.

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy methods

      The combination of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
      (1,2) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging provides high sensitivity and
      specificity in the spatial localization of intra-cranial tumors and differentiation from
      unaffected healthy tissue. Conventional MRS studies with single voxel or 2D chemical shift
      imaging (CSI) methods typically suffer from poor spatial resolution, limited tissue coverage
      and partial volume effects. The investigators are therefore proposing to use a novel 3D high
      resolution whole-brain echo planar spectroscopic imaging (3D-EPSI) method in this study. The
      investigators hypothesize that a combination of 3D-EPSI, DSC-MRI and DTI will facilitate
      accurate and highly specific spatial localization of brain tumor data in three-dimensional
      maps. Previous studies have demonstrated elevated relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV),
      Ktrans in tumor tissue (1,3) along with choline (Cho) concentration (4,5) relative to
      creatine (Cr) and n-acetylaspartate (NAA), along with enhancement under DSC-MRI indicative of
      increased uptake of the contrast agent.

      Preclinical Data

      Studies made in a rat glioma model demonstrated that Indocyanine Green (ICG) remained within
      tumors with relatively few glioma cells seen beyond the ICG-laden tumor margin. The doses
      utilized ranged from 60 to 120 mg/kg with imaging taking place at least one hour following
      the dose. In Dr. Singhal's lab, ICG-injection utilizing canine tumor models demonstrated
      reliable uptake into flank tumor xenografts with visualization of the tumor/normal tissue
      interface

      The scientists who developed the excitation probe (Spectropen) at Emory are working with
      multiple models in mice showing excitation in these tumors up to 128 hours after initial tail
      vein injection of Indocyanine Green (ICG), although the background from surrounding normal
      tissues falls off within 3 hours. The effective doses of Indocyanine Green (ICG) they use in
      their animals models are similar to what is commonly used in humans.

      Clinical Data to Date

      Indocyanine Green (ICG) has been used in the clinical settings since 1957. There is a wealth
      of data available attesting to the safety of this drug injected at its current clinically
      indicated dosing level. ICG has been shown to preferentially uptake in esophageal tumors as
      opposed to surrounding epithelial lumen after one minute of IV exposure

      . Additionally, the same group reported being able to better characterize the vascularization
      of the tumor to further clarify the invasiveness of the cancer. Indocyanine Green (ICG) usage
      has been shown to be safe in a similar clinical setting by the Gotoh group, who used
      Indocyanine Green (ICG) to detect and characterize bullous and emphysematous lesion of the
      lung in video assisted thoracoscopic surgeries (VATS) with Infrared Thoracoscopy that were
      not previously detectable by white light. Finally, Indocyanine Green (ICG) has been utilized
      in applications relating to brain tumors. In a rat glioma model, areas imaged using
      Indocyanine Green (ICG) seemed to correlate to the tumor margin within 1 mm. Although dosing
      and the timing of administration of Indocyanine Green (ICG) were variable, tumor demarcation
      was made possible with the use of intraoperative near-infrared imaging of Indocyanine Green
      (ICG). Since then, Dr. Singhal's group has demonstrated uptake into human lung tumors.

      Previous studies conducted in full-term pregnant women demonstrated no maternal or fetal
      reactions to the dye. It appeared that Indocyanine Green clearance is a safe and sensitive
      test for evaluation of liver function during pregnancy (5).

      In Dr, Singhal's prior study, Indocyanine Green for Intraoperative Imaging, UPCC 11510, IRB
      Protocol # 811870, the investigators enrolled 33 patients with lung tumors. At this time, no
      adverse events have occurred. Based on the extremely favorable results of this prior study,
      the investigators then opened the current study in order to expand the indication to patients
      with solid tumors including those with CNS tumors (UPCC 08913 IRB#818012). To date, 26
      patients been involved in this study—8 at Pennsylvania Hospital and 18 at the Hospital of the
      University of Pennsylvania. All have complied and are voluntarily enrolled in our study. The
      data collected from the 8 patients enrolled at Pennsylvania Hospital (all with CNS tumors)
      have provided us with knowledge that this method of imaging can be helpful to neurosurgeons
      in the operating room. Because of the ability to visualize at depths below the cortical
      surface (using near-infrared fluorescence), the investigators have been able to better plan
      the incision of the dura (covering of the brain) following removal of the overlying skull. In
      some patients, the investigators have identified areas of brain tumor using Indocyanine Green
      (ICG) that would otherwise have not been resected using our traditional methods.

    <description>There will be two different patient population cohorts in this study. Both of them receive the study drug, indocyanine green, with intraoperative near-infrared (NIR) imaging. The two cohorts are as follows:
Cohort 1 (No Study MRI): Patients with extra-axial brain tumors such as meningioma, craniopharyngioma, schwannoma undergo standard-of-care MRI but no study sequences. They will undergo indocyanine green injection the day before surgery.</description>
  </arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>Cohort 2 (Study MRI): Patients with intra-axial glial tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma will be in Cohort 2. This group of patients will undergo study MRI sequences before surgery. This group will also undergo ICG injection the day before surgery as described below.
Of note, sometimes it is difficult to determine the precise diagnosis of tumor based on preoperative imaging navigation MRI alone, and thus enrollment in Cohort 1 or 2 will be made at the discretion of the PI.</description>
