  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to answer the question of what is the burden of lower respiratory disease
      (pneumonia) among children ages 1 month to 5 years of age in rural Cambodia. The primary
      objective will be to quantify the prevalence of severe pneumonia at Chenla Children's
      Healthcare, a hospital in the rural town of Kratie, Cambodia. This will involve a chart
      review of the medical records available at Chenla Children's Healthcare.
