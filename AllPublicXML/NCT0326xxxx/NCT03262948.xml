  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, open, controlled phase III trial. 388 subjects with stage
      IIIB who were not eligible for radical surgery or radiotherapy, stage IV or recurrent
      squamous cell NSCLC were enrolled in this study .The subjects will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two treatment groups at a 1: 1 ratio, and stratified by sex, ECOG physical status,
      smoking status, disease staging.

      Subjects will receive one of two treatment regimens:

      Group A: intravenous infusion of paclitaxel (albumin binding) 260 mg/m2, intravenous
      infusion, carboplatin area under curve （AUC) = 6, intravenous infusion, starting from
      randomization, once every 3 weeks, for 4-6 cycles,or progression, or intolerance, or deth or
      start a new anti-tumor treatment, whichever occurs first.

      Group B: paclitaxel injection 175 mg/m2, intravenous infusion, carboplatin AUC= 6,
      intravenous infusion, starting from randomization, once every 3 weeks, for 4-6 cycles, or
      progression, or intolerance,or death or start a new anti-tumor treatment, whichever occurs
      first.The primary end point is overall response rate (ORR),the secondary endpoint is
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety and Quality of Life (QOL).
