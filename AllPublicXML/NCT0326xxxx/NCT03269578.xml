  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People who join a study in the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic (DTC) have tests. These
      include blood draws and biopsies. Researchers collect data from these samples. Some people
      take part in more than one study at the DTC. At this time, data are connected only with one
      single study. Researchers want to access people s medical records. This will allow them to
      link the research data from all their studies they have or will take part in. Researchers
      also want to collect medical data about their diagnosis and treatment history. This will
      allow them to see how their cancer reacted to different drugs over time.

      Objective:

      To enter people into a master protocol to connect research sample and treatment data across
      DTC studies.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who are being evaluated or treated for cancer in the DTC

      Design:

      Participants will allow researchers to look at all the data from their research samples. This
      includes those from their current, past, and any future NIH studies.

      Participants will allow researchers to access some of their medical data. This includes age,
      diagnosis, treatment history, and response to treatment.

      Participants will provide no new samples.

      Background:

      Research samples and data collected on a treatment-intent protocol are discrete items
      associated with that protocol up until the patient comes off study, usually due to disease
      progression. These data are not stored in the patient s medical records, but are essential to
      understand tumor response to different drugs over time. Patients in the Developmental
      Therapeutics Clinic (DTC) often start other clinical trials; this protocol provides a
      mechanism to connect research data about that patient from one trial to the next as long as
      the patient remains eligible and has given his or her informed consent. No new analysis will
      be performed under this protocol. There is research interest in collecting pre- and post-dose
      research biopsies and other samples such as circulating tumor cells to measure dynamic
      drug-specific target effects (e.g., changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, DNA damage
      response, or immunotherapeutic cell infiltration), and then to evaluate molecular changes
      before and during disease progression to understand why the tumors initially respond but then
      became resistant to treatment. To accomplish this, we will connect research results from
      consecutive trials with limited patient information (age, gender, disease, prior therapies,
      protocol number/drug regimen, response, and duration of treatment). Each patient who consents
      to participate in this non-treatment, longitudinal sample protocol agrees to allow his or her
      Medical Record Number (MRN) to be used to track participation on DTC clinical trials.

      Objectives:

      Patients will be entered onto this &quot;master&quot; longitudinal protocol to connect research sample
      and treatment data across consecutive DTC clinical trials. Biopsy samples collected at time
      of disease progression on one research trial will be evaluated for use as the baseline sample
      for the next research trial, potentially obviating the need for additional biopsies.

      Eligibility:

      Adult patients who are being evaluated for and/or treated for cancer at the DTC.

      Design:

      No samples will be collected under this longitudinal protocol, no treatment decisions will be
      made based on data collected, and no new analysis will be performed. Specimens for research
      purposes, as outlined in this protocol, will be those obtained from tests and procedures that
      are done as required by the primary research protocols that a given patient is enrolled in.
      Tissue collected under DTC tissue procurement protocol 06-C-0213 will not be used or tracked.
      Sample location and use will be managed in the Repository at the Frederick National
      Laboratory for Cancer Research using LabMatrix software. Patients may remain on this
      longitudinal protocol for the duration of their consent.
