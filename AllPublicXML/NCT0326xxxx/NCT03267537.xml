  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common medical condition that has a deleterious effect on emotional status,
      health-related quality of life, and has been associated with hospitalizations and all-cause
      mortality. Recently hospitalized patients who are recuperating in their homes would find it
      difficult to return for weekly visits with a clinical psychologist and therefore could
      benefit from the convenience of CBT-I treatment administered in the comfort of their homes
      via the wireless iPAD and video chat software. In patients who are recently discharged from
      the hospital, we wish to assess whether telemedicine-based CBT-I is comparable to
      conventional office-based CBT-I in the efficacy for treating insomnia. Research aiming to
      improve understanding of whether insomnia represents a modifiable risk factor for
      re-hospitalizations in patients who are high utilizers of healthcare services is an important
      area of future research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common and distressing medical condition that affects nearly 20% of U.S.
      adults, and persistent (or chronic) insomnia affects nearly 10-15% of U.S. adults. In a
      community-based prospective observational study, preliminary data suggests that insomnia is
      associated with hospitalizations due to cardiovascular, cancer, or any cause over a 4-year
      period. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the gold-standard in
      the treatment of insomnia. There are 5 components of CBT-I, sleep restriction therapy,
      stimulus control instructions, relaxation training, cognitive therapy, and sleep hygiene
      education. In an ongoing study of CBT-I in recently hospitalized patients, the investigators
      found a high prevalence of insomnia (80%) and were able to administer CBT-I in the
      participants' home via iPADs with wireless connectivity and secure video-chat software.
      Recently hospitalized patients who are recuperating in their homes would find it difficult to
      return for weekly visits with a clinical psychologist and therefore could benefit from the
      convenience of CBT-I treatment administered in the patient's homes via the wireless iPAD and
      video chat software. The AASM SleepTM platform could conceivably allow performance of CBT-I
      without the added expense of an iPAD. The investigators are proposing to perform a
      non-inferiority trial of telemedicine CBT-I (AASM SleepTM) versus conventional office-based
      CBT-I that is performed in patients with insomnia who have been recently discharged from the
      hospital. The investigators will measure the following outcomes: insomnia severity index
      (primary outcome) and patient satisfaction. In the future, the investigators' program of
      research aims to improve understanding of whether insomnia represents a modifiable risk
      factor for re-hospitalizations in patients who are high utilizers of healthcare services.

      Specific Aim 1: To perform comparative effectiveness research of CBT-I administered by
      telemedicine versus conventional office-based CBT-I on insomnia severity in recently
      hospitalized patients.

      Hypothesis #1: In recently hospitalized patients with insomnia, after six weeks of CBT-I
      treatment, the mean improvement in ISI score among patients treated by telemedicine CBT-I
      (AASM SleepTM) would be no more than 3-points less than that in patients treated by
      conventional office-based CBT-I.

      Specific Aim 2: To perform comparative effectiveness research of CBT-I administered by
      telemedicine versus conventional office-based CBT-I on patient satisfaction.

      Hypothesis #2: In recently hospitalized patients with insomnia, after six weeks of CBT-I
      treatment, the mean improvement in patient satisfaction score (Consumer Assessment of Health
      Plans Survey [CAHPS v4.0] item) among patients treated by telemedicine CBT-I (AASM SleepTM)
      would be no more than 1-point less than that in patients treated by conventional office-based
      CBT-I.
