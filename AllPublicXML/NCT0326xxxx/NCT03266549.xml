    <textblock>
      Infantile esotropia is defined as the onset of constant convergent squint in children less
      than 6 months of age. Infantile esotropia is mainly treated surgically using either bilateral
      medial rectus muscle recessions or unilateral medial rectus muscle recession and lateral
      rectus muscle resection with the main goal being to align the eyes so that single binocular
      vision may develop. For infants with very large angles of esotropia (&gt;60 prism diopters
      (PD)), surgery on 2 muscles alone may not be adequate. Approaches to these patients have
      included large bilateral medial rectus muscle (MR) recessions, smaller bilateral medial
      rectus muscle recessions combined with resections of 1 or both lateral rectus muscles (LR) or
      botulinum toxin augmented bimedial recession. Botulinum toxin augmentation of medial rectus
      muscle recession was reported in three previous studies. Lueder et al evaluated the long-term
      outcomes in patients with infantile esotropia. The results were good, with a 74% success
      rate. Based on historical comparisons, this technique appears equally as effective as 3- or
      4-muscle surgery and more effective than large bilateral medial rectus recessions alone.
      Ideally, a prospective randomized study should be performed to more definitively determine
      which of these approaches is best.

    <textblock>
      Infantile esotropia is defined as the onset of constant esodeviation in children less than 6
      months of age.There are several other clinical findings that often accompany infantile
      esotropia including: large amplitude of the angle (greater than 30 prism diopters),
      dissociated vertical deviation, dissociated horizontal deviation, inferior oblique
      overaction, latent nystagmus, cross fixation with pseudo abduction deficit, low degree of
      hyperopia (less than 3 diopters), and amblyopia. The incidence of infantile esotropia is
      approximately 1%,making this an important issue for pediatric ophthalmologist.

      There are multiple surgical techniques used to treat infantile esotropia with the main goal
      being to align the eyes so that binocular vision may develop.The most common initial
      treatment is either bilateral medial rectus muscle recessions or unilateral medial rectus
      muscle recession and lateral rectus muscle resection. For infants with very large angles of
      esotropia (&gt;60 prism diopters [PD]), surgery on 2 muscles alone may not be adequate to
      correct the strabismus. Approaches to these patients have included large bilateral medial
      rectus muscle recessions, smaller bilateral medial rectus muscle recessions combined with
      resections of 1 or both lateral rectus muscles or botulinum toxin augmented bimedial
      recession.

      Historically, the success of surgery for infants with large-angle esotropia was limited by
      the amount of medial rectus muscle recession that was considered safe. Initially, most
      surgeons restricted their medial rectus recessions to approximately 5 mm, anticipating an
      under correction that could be addressed with lateral rectus muscle resections during a
      second surgery. Over time, the maximal amount considered safe for medial rectus muscle
      recession has increased, and now most surgeons are comfortable performing 6- to 7-mm
      recessions in patients with large-angle esotropia.Others have recommended small medial rectus
      muscle recessions combined with unilateral or bilateral lateral muscle resections, because of
      the potential risk of overcorrection with large medial rectus muscle recessions. Other
      studies reported the use of botulinum toxin augmentation of medial rectus muscle recession in
      patients with large-angle infantile esotropia.

      Botulinum toxin exerts its effect by interfering with release of acetylcholine at the
      neuromuscular junction, thus inhibiting muscle contraction. Although the pharmacologic effect
      of botulinum toxin is temporary, permanent results in patients with strabismus may occur.
      These effects include a change in the length-tension curves of the muscles and permanent
      changes in sarcomere density and myosin heavy chain composition.

      Botulinum toxin alone has been advocated by McNeer and associates as a primary treatment for
      infantile esotropia in children with smaller angles of deviation. The advantage of this
      approach is that incisional surgery is not required. However, it was found that botulinum
      alone was less effective in establishing binocularity when compared to standard surgery. This
      is likely because multiple injections are often needed,which prolongs the duration of
      misalignment.On the other hand,the concomitant use of botulinum toxin and surgery allowed for
      rapid establishment of alignment. Other advantages of botulinum augmentation are that only 2
      muscles are operated upon, thus decreasing anesthesia duration and the risk of surgical
      complications, and the lateral rectus muscles are preserved for additional surgery, if
      needed.

      Botulinum toxin augmentation of medial rectus muscle recession was reported in three previous
      studies. Khan reported 8 patients with &gt; 60 prism diopters (PD) esotropia treated with
      botulinum-augmented horizontal muscle surgery.Six of 8 had deviations of 10 PD or less
      following surgery, with an average follow-up of 9 months. Özkan and associates used botulinum
      augmentation in a group of older patients (age range 5-50 years) with large-angle esotropia
      of different etiologies, with a success rate of 57% and an average follow-up of 14
      months.Lueder and associates evaluated the long-term outcomes in patients with infantile
      esotropia who had been followed for more than 2 years after treatment. The results were good,
      with a 74% success rate.This study demonstrated that this procedure is an effective treatment
      for infants with large-angle infantile esotropia, with stable results over time. Based on
      historical comparisons, it appears equally as effective as 3- or 4-muscle surgery and more
      effective than large bilateral medial rectus recessions alone.

      Ideally, a prospective randomized study should be performed to more definitively determine
      which of these approaches is best.

      This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin augmented medial rectus
      recession compared to conventional surgery in the management of large angle infantile
      esotropia.
