  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems are very common in children with ADHD, with a prevalence rate as high as 73%,
      and often pose significant challenges and stress to the families. Sleep problems in ADHD
      children are strongly associated with the exacerbation of daytime symptoms, impaired physical
      health, and poor parental mental health. The present study is a randomised controlled trial
      to compare the effects of a parent-based sleep intervention for children with ADHD (aged
      6-12). Eligible participants will be randomised to either intervention (two face-to-face
      consultation sessions and one follow-up phone call) or waiting-list control condition.
      Assessments will be conducted at pre-treatment (baseline), one-week after the intervention
      (post-treatment), and 3 months after the intervention.

    <description>The first session will involve the provision of sleep-related psycho-education (e.g. sleep hygiene practices) and specific strategies to tackle problematic sleep-related behaviours, as well as collaborative goal setting and development of management plan tailored to the child's sleep problem for the next two weeks. The second session will involve a review of the sleep diary and a reinforcement of learned strategies, and focus on problem-solving to tackle any issues that have emerged from implementing the behavioural strategies at home. A follow-up phone call will be made two weeks later to provide parents with an opportunity to ask any further questions and to consolidate learned strategies and further troubleshoot.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with a serious medical condition (e.g. severe cerebral palsy) or intellectual
             disability (IQ&lt;70);

             sleep;

             the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). If the child is suspected of a
             clinical sleep disorder, he/she will be referred to appropriate services;
