  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following stroke, muscle weakness and impaired motor function are expressed in both the more
      (MA; paretic) and less affected (LA; non-paretic) sides. Although the efficacy of resistance
      training is well recognized, training the MA limb directly may be initially difficult due to
      muscular weakness. &quot;Cross-education&quot; is training one side of the body increases strength in
      the untrained and opposite side. This concept can be applied in strength training when
      training the more affected sides cannot be initiated. Recently, our lab found six weeks of
      dorsiflexion resistance training in the LA leg improved the strength of both trained and
      untrained legs of chronic stroke participants.

      The current project explored if cross-education exists in the upper limb in chronic stroke
      participants and if there are related changes in cortical and spinal cord plasticity. We
      hypothesized that unilateral strength in the less affected arm could enhance wrist extension
      strength bilaterally with related neural adoption and improved clinical function.

      Stroke produces muscle weakness seen on both more (paretic, MA) and less affected
      (non-paretic, LA) sides. &quot;Cross-education&quot; is training one side of the body increases
      strength or motor skill in the same muscles on the untrained side. This can be applied to
      enhance muscle strength in the MA side and we found that 6 weeks of dorsiflexion resistance
      training with the LA leg improved strength bilaterally in chronic stroke. To explore if
      cross-education occurs also in the upper limb after stroke, participants will complete a
      5-week unilateral wrist extension training.

      Twenty four participants will be recruited, 12 from Rehabilitation Neuroscience laboratory at
      University of Victoria, 12 from Brain Behaviour Laboratory at University of British Columbia.
      Before and after training, maximal voluntary contraction wrist extension force was measured
      with a 6-axis load cell using Cartesian coordinates (Fz = extension). Electromyography of
      extensor and flexor carpi radialis, biceps and triceps brachii were recorded. Fugl-Meyer and
      partial Wolf Motor Function Test were performed by the same physical therapist at each
      location. Reciprocal inhibition from wrist flexors to extensors, cutaneous reflexes evoked by
      median and superficial radial nerve stimulation were assessed in those at UVIC. Cortical
      silent period, short-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation and
      transcallosal inhibition from transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured in participants
      at UBC.

    <description>To test if training could improve wrist extension strength, maximal wrist extension force were measured in both arms during the 3 baseline pretests, 1 post-test. There was a week in between each baseline tests, post-test will be performed within one week after the training finished. To test if the force changes maintained after training, follow-up test was performed 5 weeks after training finished.</description>
