    <textblock>
      The investigator is testing blood samples to compare the results of two different techniques.
      Since blood loss and the need for blood transfusions continue to be major problems after
      heart surgery and other types of surgery, the blood clotting levels are constantly checked
      during heart surgery as part of clinical care.The purpose of this study is to compare the INR
      levels in blood before and after the heart bypass during surgery.
