  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is performed to assess if PET-MR imaging can improve treatment of patients with
      irregular heart rate and heart failure. Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle is too
      weak to do his work correctly. Irregular heart rate can be related to numerous diseases. One
      category of irregular heart rate is called ventricular arrhythmia. It is often seen in
      patients who have had a heart attack. This type of arrhythmia can be dangerous and can cause
      sudden death. To prevent these arrhythmias, doctors can perform procedures that burn the
      source of arrhythmia in the heart muscle. This is called ablation. Unfortunately, ablation
      does not fix the problem in 100% of patients and some will still have the arrhythmia
      requiring repeated procedure. The purpose of this study is to find new ways of guiding the
      doctors performing ablation, hoping to improve the success rate of the procedure.

    <description>A subset of the Arrhythmia cohort, this group will undergo a second imaging session. This subset corresponds to patients from the Arrhythmia cohort presenting with recurrent ventricular arrhythmia following initial EAM-guided catheter ablation and requiring repeated ablation. It is estimated that 30% of the Arrhythmia cohort patients will require repeat ablation based on rate of repeat ablation procedures at MGH. T</description>
