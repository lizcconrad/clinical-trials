  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological trauma is a major public health concern that affects numerous patients who have
      experienced traumatic events.

      The objective of our research was to improve the diagnosis and management of persons
      experiencing such events.

      We will seek to determine factors brought into play in the construction of psychological
      trauma and the best way to identify them so as to implement the optimal management of
      patients and ensure recognition of this condition.

      In addition, in the context of our activity as expert witnesses, we will study the methods
      used to assess and quantify psychological trauma.

      In this respect, a medical appointment will be made by a nurse of the Forensic Medicine
      Department of Dijon CHU. During this consultation, a self-report questionnaire will be
      completed by the patient alone to evaluate the level of acute stress followed by a
      psychiatric consultation and completion of the IES-R questionnaire with the doctor to
      identify symptoms of psychological trauma.
