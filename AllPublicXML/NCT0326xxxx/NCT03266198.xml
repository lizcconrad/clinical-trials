    <textblock>
      Normal fetal growth is a critical component for a healthy pregnancy and for ensuring the
      health and well-being of infants throughout childhood and adolescence. One promising area of
      research suggests that changes in fetal soft tissue may be the earliest changes that occur in
      pathologic growth. Three-dimensional volume assessments may be used to detect changes in
      fetal lean mass, fat mass, and organ size that result from pathologic growth earlier than
      conventional 2D measures. This knowledge may lead to interventions that could minimize or
      prevent pregnancy and newborn health problems in the future.

      The NICHD Fetal Growth Study was a multi-site, prospective cohort study designed to establish
      a standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age in the U.S.
      population. For the singleton study, 2,334 low-risk, non-obese gravidas were recruited from
      each of 4 self-identified race/ethnicity backgrounds. An additional 468 obese women and 171
      dichorionic twin gestations were recruited. After an initial sonogram in the first trimester,
      women were randomized to serial ultrasonology schedules. Each schedule comprised five
      additional sonograms for fetal biometry (six in twins) plus additional image and 3D volume
      acquisition for later analysis.

      Ultrasound measurements at each follow-up visit included standard fetal biometrics ((BPD, HC,
      AC, FL) and the following volumes in the singleton study if they were able to be obtained:
      1st trimester: fetus and gestational sac; 2nd and 3rd trimesters: head, cerebellum, face,
      chest, heart, abdomen, pelvis, arm and thigh. In twins, the volumes collected were 1st
      trimester: fetus and gestational sac and in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters the thigh. In addition
      to ultrasound, this study recorded maternal anthropometrics and a brief interview to capture
      changes in health status, stress and depression, and physical activity at each follow-up
      visit. Blood draws at baseline and at targeted gestational ages were obtained for the
      eventual identification of biomarkers indicative of fetal growth were collected. After
      delivery, neonatal anthropometric measures were assessed, placental biospecimens were
      collected, and select information about the obstetrical course and newborn status were
      abstracted from medical charts.

      The Fetal 3D Study is being conducted to catalog and perform 2 Dimensional (2D) and 3
      Dimensional (3D) measurement of the obstetrical ultrasound images in the existing bank of
      singleton and twin gestations collected from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. The research
      study aims to understand the relationship between gravid diseases and longitudinal changes in
      fetal body composition (subcutaneous fat, lean mass) and organ measurements (in singletons)
      over the course of pregnancy.

    <description>Growth trajectories in singletons and dichorionic twin pregnancies will be created using two- and selected three-dimensional ultrasound measures. Measures in singletons include fetal body composition from 2D abdominal circumference, arm and thigh volumes; cerebellum; adrenal glands; kidneys; liver; pancreas; lungs; first trimester gestational sac, embryo and placenta, using standardized protocols. Measures in twins include 2D abdominal circumference and thigh volumes, and first trimester gestational sac, embryo and placenta.
Measurements will be performed using stored ultrasound images and 3D volumes that were collected in the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singleton and Twins ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00912132 and NCT01369940, respectively. Women were recruited during the first trimester and followed until delivery. Each woman had scheduled ultrasound examinations, one at enrollment and five during follow-up visits (six for twins).</description>
