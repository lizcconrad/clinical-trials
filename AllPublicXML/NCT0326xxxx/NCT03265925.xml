  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study investigating the utility of Brain Network Activation (BNA)
      analysis in patients with epilepsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BNA technology is based on a network model to depict functional connectivity. The descriptive
      network model approach provides insights regarding inter-connectivity of brain networks and
      can describe the temporal-spatial brain activation patterns applied to various types of
      data-sets including EEG, MEG and fMRI.

      In this study it is proposed that synchronization in brain activity may be disrupted in
      patients who experience frequent seizures and may correspond to functional impairments (e.g.,
      memory, processing speed). As such, BNA analysis may provide additional data that complement
      current functional assessments, inform clinical assessment and management of epilepsy, and
      identify subgroups of patients that might be at risk for poor treatment outcomes.

        Participants will be recruited from the long-term EEG monitoring floor and outpatient EEG
        laboratory. Controls will be recruited in response to advertisements. All participants will
        be given the BNA Auditory Go/NoGo task. Patient identity will be coded with a master record
        kept on a password protected computer in the laboratory. Deidentified data will be sent to
        ElMindA for scoring of the BNA test. Patient data from electronic medical records will be
        extracted along with patient MRI data processed.
