      Role of anti-platelet in treatment of acute ischemic stroke to determine the safety of
      immediate anti-platelet therapy .that is started as soon as possible within the first 24
      hours of the onset of symptoms.

    <textblock>
      In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease,
      accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total).Studies have reported a 30-day
      recurrence rate of 1.1 to 15 % after stroke and as high as 17% after transient ischemic
      attack .Therefore, early initiation of antiplatelet agents in ischemic stroke and patients is
      important to prevent stroke recurrence and is tracked as a quality measure by organizations
      that accredit stroke centers . Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase is the mainstay
      medical treatment for acute ischemic stroke. given intravenously within 4.5 hours of symptom
      onset, to reopen occluded intracerebral arteries. As in fact most patients with ischemic
      stroke present to the emergency department beyond the approved time window for thrombolytic
      or other revascularization therapies beside their high cost and at this time, there are no
      approved urgent therapies for most of these patients In addition, those who present with
      rapidly resolving deficit or low National Institutes of Health stroke scale score are
      generally not considered for thrombolytic treatment, although approximately one third of them
      may be at high risk for neurological deterioration and recurrent vascular events.This study
      will evaluates the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin in treatment of patients
      not eligible for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or any other acute reperfusion
      therapy with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack within 24 hours of symptoms
      onset.
