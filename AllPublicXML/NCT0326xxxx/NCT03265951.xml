  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is commonly reported in Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder,
      which can potentiate symptoms of anxiety and depression, daytime symptoms and worsen
      nightmares. Continuous positive airway pressure is the most effective therapy but adherence
      to treatment is suboptimal. The overarching theme of the proposal is to compare usual care to
      Ramelteon, in a randomized, clinical trial, investigating the effectiveness of physiological
      versus pharmacological intervention on sleep quality of life, insomnia severity and CPAP
      adherence.

    <textblock>
      Despite the overall improvement in PTSD symptomatology with CPAP therapy, adherence to CPAP
      is far worse in Veterans with PTSD (41%) compared to the general population with OSA (70%).
      Among the factors associated with CPAP non-adherence is the coexistence of insomnia. Complex
      insomnia defined as the coexistence of comorbid insomnia ans OSA is a frequent diagnosis in
      military personnel with combat exposure. Similar to prior reports of patients with OSA
      without PTSD, comorbid insomnia can create a barrier to CPAP therapy. Ramelteon (TAK-375),
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of insomnia with sleep onset
      abnormalities, is a neurohormone that functions as a melatonin receptor agonist targeting the
      MT1 and MT2 receptors located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus which
      regulates the circadian rhythm of the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.The goal is to test the
      hypothesis that the administration of insomnia therapy-ramelteon- significantly improves
      treatment outcomes in Veterans with PTSD and complex insomnia compared with placebo.
