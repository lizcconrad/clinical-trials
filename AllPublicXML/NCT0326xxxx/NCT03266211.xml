  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last ten years, more than one hundred generalized tetanus cases were declared in
      France. Most of them were affecting people older than 70 years with an important mortality
      (around 28%). It is know that the only way to protect ourselves from this disease is the
      vaccination. In France tetanus vaccination is mandatory since 1940.

      Nowaday none study looked specifically for the vaccination of people older than 65 years. The
      hypothesis is: there is a difference in the tetanus vaccination coverage for people older
      than 65 years depending on the demographic and medical practice of their general
      practitioner.
