  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At our institution, hip fracture patients are admitted and treated according to a fast track
      patient pathway. The aim of this study is to identify areas of this patient pathway that can
      be improved. To achieve this, the study will investigate the underlying reasons for the
      continued need for hospitalization on the consecutive days after hip fracture surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at the orthopedic department, Akershus University Hospital, as a
      prospective observational study and will include approximately 200 consecutive hip fracture
      patients. The patients will be evaluated once daily for the fulfillment of predefined
      discharge criteria. If the discharge criteria are not met or if the criteria are met but the
      patient is not discharged in spite of this the underlying reason(s) are recorded.

    <intervention_name>Fast track patient pathway</intervention_name>
    <description>Prehospital services establish a working diagnosis of hip fracture and initiate first line treatment. In the emergency department a specially trained nurse triages the patient. Patients without signs of other acute disease or trauma and who have not previously been operated in the same hip are directly transported to the x-ray suite. The x-rays are reviewed by the radiographer and in case of an obvious fracture of the hip the patient is transported directly to the orthopedic ward where the patient is received by a nurse and seen by an orthopedic surgeon. The pathway includes standard procedures for blood sampling, pain relief, including a fascia iliaca compartment block, intravenous fluids, transfusion triggers, management of anticoagulants and premedication. The pathway puts focus on prevention of pressure sores, a short preoperative fasting period and early mobilization. Screening tools are used to assess for delirium, nutritional status and fall risk.</description>
