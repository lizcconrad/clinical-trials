      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the relative efficacy of two
      non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia in Veterans suffering from chronic mild
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a serious health problem in Veterans suffering from chronic Traumatic Brain
      Injury (TBI) and often associated with extensive prescription of sleeping medications.
      Although safer, even the latest &quot;sleeping pills&quot; can lead to daytime impairment and risk of
      abuse. Thus non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia have been pursued as alternatives to
      medications. This trial will compare the relative efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      for Insomnia (CBT-I) and Desensitization Therapy for Insomnia (DTI).

The ISI has been shown to be a reliable subjective measure of insomnia severity as well as a sensitive measure of symptom change.</description>

             treatment or other research protocols on sleep apnea. Subjects who have Obstructive
             Sleep Apnea (OSA) but who are adherent to CPAP will not be excluded. Subjects working
