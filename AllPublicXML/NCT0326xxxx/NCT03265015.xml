  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to identify causal neural mechanisms underlying unwanted, repetitive
      behaviors (compulsions). Using non-invasive brain stimulation coupled with practice in a
      computer task, we will modulate activity in a target brain region in two directions (up or
      down) and measure effects on compulsive behaviors and related measures. This work could
      ultimately lead to the ability to treat compulsions more effectively by targeting the regions
      of the brain that can help or hinder attempts to overcome compulsions.

          2. Endorse problematic compulsive behaviors, per self-report and clinician-administered
             measures.

          3. Agree to video taping of structured clinical interview

          4. Report that they will reside in the Pittsburgh area for at least 5 weeks
