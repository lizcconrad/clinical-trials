  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia is a common, distressing condition that is sometimes difficult to diagnose and
      treat.

      Losing hair is not usually health threatening; it can scar a young child's vulnerable
      self-esteem by causing immense psychological and emotional stress, not only to the patient,
      but also to the concerned parents and siblings; so the cause of hair loss should be diagnosed
      and treated early to overcome the resulting problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of alopecia in children is presented as patchy alopecia, which is most commonly
      diagnosed as alopecia areata. However, other causes of patchy alopecia such as tinea capitis,
      trichotillomania, temporal triangular alopecia (TTA), nevus sebaceous and aplasia cutis
      congenita (ACC) can be easily missed.

      Trichoscopy (hair and scalp dermoscopy) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that allows the
      recognition of morphologic structures not visible by the naked eye.

      Trichoscopy allows visualization of hair shafts at high magnification and performing
      measurements, such as hair shaft thickness, without the need of removing hair for diagnostic
      purposes. It also allows in vivo visualization of the epidermal portion of hair follicles and
      perifollicular epidermis.

      The advantages of trichoscopy in evaluating hair loss in children are numerous, as it is a
      fast in-office technique , non-invasive, inexpensive, and painless , and therefore it will be
      accepted by children and their parents.

      Tinea capitis and alopecia areata are considered to be the most common causes of hairless
      patches of the scalp in pediatrics. Tinea capitis especially non-scaly type may have the same
      clinical appearance of alopecia areata, so trichoscopy has recently become a useful
      diagnostic tool for alopecia areata and tinea capitis, especially in doubtful cases as lab
      investigations like fungal culture or biopsy may take several weeks.
