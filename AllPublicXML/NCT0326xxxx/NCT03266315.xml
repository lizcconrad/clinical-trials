  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics have been started in the NICUs in Calgary since 2016 aiming to decrease the
      incidence of NEC. Adults with abdominal surgery who received post-op probiotics reported a
      significant reduction in surgical site infection, urinary tract infection, and combined
      infection. Currently probiotics used only in none-surgical population of infants The main
      objective of this study is to determine the impact of probiotics administration on length of
      hospital stay in neonates undergoing intestinal surgery. The study will also generate
      important data about safety and efficacy of probiotics in this surgical population.

      Research Objectives/Question:

      The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of probiotics administration on
      length of hospital stay in neonate undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. The study will also
      generate important data about safety and efficacy of probiotics in this surgical population.

      Primary question:

      Does probiotic supplementation in neonates after gastrointestinal surgery reduce the duration
      of parenteral nutrition?

      Secondary outcomes:

        1. Length of hospital stay

        2. Time to reach full feed (defined as 120 ml/kg/day)in the post-operative period

        3. Incidence of infection as defined by positive bacterial blood, urine or cerebrospinal
           fluid culture

        4. Incidence of cholestasis

        5. Duration of cholestasis

        6. Growth anthropometrics(weight, head circumference and length) and Z-score

        7. Diversity and abundancy of stool microbiome at baseline and after 1 and 3 weeks of
           initiation of probiotics

      Relevance:

      Project has the potential to promote the health of Alberta's children and their families.
      Improve feed tolerance, prevent complications of parenteral nutrition and shortening the
      length of hospital stay in neonates with gastrointestinal surgery are potential health
      benefits for the project.

      Methodology:

      Study design

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial NICU at Alberta Children's Hospital and
      Stollery Children's Hospital . Probiotics or placebo will be administered orally or via naso-
      or orogastric feeding tube. Clinical outcomes and gut microbiome data will be compared
      between the two groups. The project starting time is November 2017. Study duration will be 18
      months.

      Study Population

      Infants born between 23 - 42 weeks of gestation, admitted to NICU at Alberta Children's
      Hospital for gastrointestinal surgery.

        1. Inclusion Criteria:

             1. Infants born between 23 - 42 weeks of gestation

             2. Required gastrointestinal surgery in a first week of life (including spontaneous
                intestinal perforation, necrotizing enterocolitis, bowel atresia, mechanical bowel
                obstruction, volvulus, gastroschisis)

             3. Ready to start enteral feeding

        2. Exclusion Criteria:

             1. Infants with major congenital anomalies excluding GI tract

             2. Suspected congenital or acquired immune deficiency

             3. Palliative care patient

             4. Septic babies with positive blood, CSF or urine culture

      Sample Size and feasibility

      A study by Dang et al. revealed a difference of 3 days in the time to reach full feeds in
      non-surgical preterm infants receiving probiotics compared to those in the placebo group. (3)
      A sample size of 44 infants per group will allow for a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05 for
      a two-tailed detect similar difference in surgical neonates. Assuming that 70% of parents'
      consent to their infant's participation in the study, it will be feasible to complete
      enrollment of 88 babies in the 2 year period of the study.

      Variables collected

        1. Demographic variables: Gestational age, birth weight, gender, mode of delivery,
           singleton/multiple and rank, maternal administration of corticosteroids and antibiotics,
           duration of rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis.

        2. Clinical variables: Type of surgery, day of life at start of feeds post-surgery, total
           days of study drug, antibiotic use pre- and post-surgery, type of feeds during NICU and
           at discharge.

        3. Outcome variables: mortality, time taken to reach full enteral feeds before (if
           applicable) and after surgery (defined by 120ml/kg/day), post-operative total days of
           NPO and TPN, duration of central catheter use, number of separate NPO events, Z-score,
           head circumference and weight at discharge home, post-operative infection (blood, urine
           or CSF), length of hospital stay, and incidence of cholestasis (defined by conjugated
           bilirubin &gt;34 micromol/L).

      Study protocol.

      Infants will be identified within 48 hours of surgery and parents will be approached for
      informed consent. Once consent is obtained, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive
      either probiotics or placebo. Investigators will conduct the randomization using a
      computer-generated table of random numbers generated at the University of Calgary.

      Preparation and Administration of Study Drug

      The study supplementation will be started at the when oral feeds will reach 24 mL/kg/day
      after surgery after collecting a stool/ostomy sample. The decision to start feeding will be
      made by the neonatal and surgical team. After the first stool/ostomy sample is obtained, one
      study sachet to a minimum of 1 mL of Expressed Breast Milk (EBM) (mothers own milk or donor
      human milk) once a day.

      If mothers own milk or donor human milk is not available, 1 sachet will be added to a minimum
      of 1 mL of sterile water or formula (in formula fed babies) once a day. All empty sachets
      will be placed into biohazard container. Placebo sachet will be made of 0.3 g maltodextrin
      and be administered to the control group in the same manner. If the infant is placed NPO, the
      study drug will be stopped and restarted together with refeeding. Both probiotic and placebo
      will be packaged as single dose sachet. They will be maintained, blinded and dispensed by the
      pharmacists at the study sites, who will be the only ones knowing the subject assignment.

      The study probiotic / placebo will be given till discharge. If the infant is transferred
      outside NICU, the study drug will be dispensed with the infant and clinical outcomes will be
      ascertained in collaboration with the local Pediatrician at the time of infants' discharge
      home.

      Sample collection

      Nurses will collect the stool samples at 3 time points: prior to initiation, 1 week after and
      4 weeks after probiotic or placebo administration is commenced. &quot;Stool&quot; will be collected
      directly from the infant's ostomy bag and diaper with a sterile spatula. As soon as a sample
      is collected, the nurse will contact the investigators. The samples will then be placed in a
      laboratory freezer (-80Â°C) within 24 hours of collection. Batched samples will be transported
      to the University of Calgary Genomics laboratory for subsequent microbiome processing.
