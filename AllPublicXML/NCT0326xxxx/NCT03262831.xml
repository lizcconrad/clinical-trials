  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a personalized yoga program with mindful movement
      implemented during breast cancer therapy will benefit women in multiple ways. The
      investigators predict that women participating in the program will experience less weight
      gain and fatigue and will have an improved quality of life compared to women not
      participating in the program. The investigators predict that this will be associated with
      decreased markers of inflammation. The investigators will also evaluate whether there is
      improved pathologic response rate compared to historical controls. This study will provide
      pilot data for a larger randomized controlled trial assessing whether program can provide
      long-term improvement in quality of life, weight maintenance, and the serum and tumor changes
      correlating with a reduced risk of recurrence and mortality.

    <description>Prior to start of treatment, a yoga therapist will work with each patient to develop a personalized yoga protocol using Gentle Hatha and Restorative Yoga
Each protocol will consist of 5-10 minutes of centering poses to invite focus and relaxation, then 15-20 minutes of seated and standing active poses, ending with 5-10 minutes of guided relaxation.
The personalized practice will be given to each participant and she will be asked to practice beginning at the start of neoadjuvant treatment at least 3 times a week (but preferably daily) at home for at least 30 minutes each time. Participants will continue their personalized yoga practice during the entirety of treatment. Each participant will be asked to journal when and for how long she practices at home and make any comments as to how the practice might have made her feel
During participation, weekly follow-up calls will be made by a member of the study team to each participant randomized to the yoga arm.</description>
