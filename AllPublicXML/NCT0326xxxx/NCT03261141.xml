      The aim of this study is to assess the Correlation between The Arabic Pediatric Voice Related
      Quality of Life (PV-RQOL), The Auditory Perceptual Assessment and Acoustic Analysis of voice
      of dysphonic children. This is important to provide an efficient therapeutic strategy for
      these children.

      Voice is the carrier wave for speech signal. It can also be defined as an audible sound
      produced by phonation . It is a primary mean of expression and oral communication and has
      life-long importance to social well-being.

      Through life, voice development follows and represents organic, psychological, and social
      changes in the person .

      Any disruption of the function of voice is called dysphonia . defination of dysphonia is
      perceptual audible change of a patient's habitual voice as self-judged or judged by his or
      her listeners.

      The incidence of the pediatric voice disorders ranges from 6%-23%, while, stated that voice
      disorders affect approximately 6-9% of pediatric population. Boys were statistically more
      likely to have dysphonia (7.5%) over girls (4.6%) , abnormal vocal presentations
      (symptomatology) include: phonasthenia ,dysphonia, aphonia and dysodia. Dysphonia may
      adversely impact a child's general health, communicative effectiveness, social and
      educational development, self-esteem, and participation in school group activities. Hence,
      dysphonia has a substantial negative effect on children's lives.Although voice disorders are
      common in the pediatric population; there is still a lack of information available to
      clinicians regarding evaluation and treatment of pediatric voice disorders.

      Etiology of Voice disorders can be subdivided into 3 main groups: There are the organic voice
      disorders (There are detectable morphological changes in the vocal apparatus), Non-organic
      (functional) voice disorders (There is no detectable organic pathology in the structure of
      the larynx) and Minimal Associated Pathological Lesions (MAPLs) (Long-standing, non-organic
      (functional) voice disorders leading to the creation of detectable organic changes.

      The protocol of evaluation of voice disorders is constructed /built in escalating stepwise
      stages from the simple subjective bed-side diagnostic procedures to the more sophisticated
      objective quantitative instrumental measures. Thus the protocol encompasses the following 3
      levels which are 1- Elementary diagnostic procedures, 2-Clinical diagnostic aids 3-Additional
      instrumental measures .

      Several instruments have been designed specifically to evaluate quality of life outcomes in
      dysphonic populations. The best validated and most utilized surveys are the Voice Handicap
      Index (VHI) , the Voice Outcome Survey (VOS) and the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQoL) .
      These instruments were designed to be used in the assessment of dysphonic patients and were
      validated in adult populations. Since their dissemination, each of these instruments have
      produced a pediatric analogue, namely a pediatric VOS (PVOS) , a pediatric V-RQoL and a
      pediatric VHI (PVHI).

      Questionnaire may help to increase the patient's awareness of the impact of dysphonia and his
      motivation for change. The Questionnaires have also been proven sensitive to post-changes and
      are an additional and valuable tool in the determination of therapy efficiency.

      At Minia University, a study was carried out to develop an Arabic version of PVRQoL and test
      its validity and reliability .The results suggested that the APVRQoL is a valid and reliable
      assessment tool that can be used by the parents of Arabic-speaking children or by the
      children themselves (when they are older) with voice disorders to assess the impact of
      dysphonia on the quality of their lives.

      The (PV-RQOL) has 10 questions that are divided among 4 subdomains: The social (questions no:
      8 and 10), emotional (questions no: 4 and 5) , The physical (questions no: 2 and 3) and the
      functional (questions no: 1, 6,7 and 9), each question is rated from 1to5 (1=no problem and
      is given&quot;10 points&quot;,2=a small amount and is given&quot;7.5points&quot;,3=a moderate amount and is
      given&quot;5 points&quot;,4=a lot and is given&quot;2.5 points&quot;, and 5=problem is as bad as it can be, and
      is given&quot;0 points&quot;. Thus the raw scores can range from 0 to 100 points with higher scores
      indicating a better quality of life.

    <description>Application of the Arabic Pediatric Voice Related Quality of Life (PV-RQOL): all participants /parents of the participants will be given (PV-RQOL) form that consists of 10 questions divided among 4 subdomains: The social (questions no: 8 and 10), emotional (questions no: 4 and 5) , The physical (questions no: 2 and 3) and the functional (questions no: 1, 6,7 and 9) . Thus the total score can range from 0 to 100 points with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.and Auditory perceptual assessment (APA) of the participant's voice: the domains will be graded on a scale of 0-3, in which 0 is normal and 3 is severe.and Acoustic voice analysis: will be carried out using Kay Elemetrics' Computerized Speech Laboratory. These measures will be obtained by recording the voice of each participant using a microphone positioned âˆ¼10 cm from his/her mouth and the participantswill be asked to phonate a sustained vowel /a/ at comfortable pitch and intensity levels.</description>
