    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether Fibromyalgia Integrative Training program for Teens (FIT Teens),
      a combined cognitive behavioral therapy and neuromuscular exercise training program is more
      effective in reducing disability in adolescents with Juvenile Fibromyalgia compared to
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone or a graded aerobic exercise (GAE) program alone.
      One third of participants will receive the FIT Teens training; one third will receive CBT
      training; and one third of participants will receive the GAE training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a chronic, debilitating pain condition that typically
      persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Whereas medications offer limited and
      short-term symptom relief for JFM, our research group has demonstrated that
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is safe, effective and durable in reducing functional
      disability and depressive symptoms in adolescents with this condition. However, 60% of
      patients receiving CBT did not show clinically significant improvement in functional
      disability, and pain levels remained in the moderate range despite being reduced overall. Our
      multidisciplinary team of experts in Behavioral Medicine, Rheumatology and Exercise Science
      has developed and tested the feasibility of a new Fibromyalgia Integrative Training program
      for Teens (FIT Teens), which enhances the established CBT intervention with a novel
      neuromuscular exercise training program derived from evidence-based pediatric injury
      prevention research. Pilot testing showed excellent patient engagement, no adverse effects
      and very promising early results indicating this treatment to have even stronger effects on
      disability and pain outcomes than CBT alone. This trial evaluates whether the FIT Teens
      intervention is more effective than CBT alone or graded aerobic exercise alone and whether
      treatment effects are sustainable over 1 year follow-up.

    <description>The Functional Disability Inventory (FDI), a 15 item self-report measure will be used to assess participant's perceived difficulty in the performance of daily activities at home, school, recreational, and social domains due to pain. For this primary outcome, data from this questionnaires will be used to compare baseline response to 3 month follow up to examine whether a reduction in disability occurs.
The main outcome measure for this comparison will be the difference in baseline and primary endpoint (3 month) FDI scores for each of the three interventions (FIT Teens, CBT, and GAE).</description>

    <description>Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Teens (FIT Teens) is a combined coping skills training and physical exercise program. Pain coping skills training, also called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) teaches a number of behavioral skills (e.g. breathing, relaxation, activity pacing, distraction, and calming statements). Participants also receive a specialized type of neuromuscular exercise training which focuses on core strength, gait and balance.</description>
