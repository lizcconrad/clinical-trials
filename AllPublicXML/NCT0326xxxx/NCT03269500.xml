      The description of the population will identify the characteristics of patients who use the
      tools and guide their use in patient care. To realize an impact assessment, It necessary to
      identify specific criteria for inclusion. It is important initially to assess the use of the
      nutritional tools. The assessment of performance (obstacles and understanding), will be used
      to improve tools to optimize their use.
