  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed co-registered photoacoustic and ultrasound (US) imaging
      technique that allows the investigators to visualize tumor structure and functional changes
      simultaneously, which may potentially reveal early tumor angiogenesis development that is not
      available by US alone. The ability to detect early angiogenesis changes, as well as tumor
      morphology changes in the ovary, using a non-invasive imaging modality will greatly enhance
      the care for women.

    <measure>Measure PAI/ultrasound signatures from ovaries prior to surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to surgery (no more than 30 days prior to surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>-The transvaginal US will be performed by US technologists or radiologists at the Radiology Department and images will be read by one of the study radiologists either Dr. Cary Siegel or Dr. Kathryn Robinson of the Radiology Department. The reading will be categorized as normal, suspicious or highly suspicious. The scores will serve as a baseline comparison of US/PAI technique with the current clinical practice using US. Immediately after the transvaginal US, US/PAI imaging will be performed with the assistance of the US technologist or radiologist.</description>

    <description>-Will be used to distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian tissues. Student t-test will be used for statistical significant test of each feature obtained from malignant and benign ovaries. Those features with p value less than 0.05 will be used as a predictor.</description>
