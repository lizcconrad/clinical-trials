      This study will be conducted to observe the disease activity change of Conventional Disease
      Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (cDMARD) plus anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) from
      baseline to 6 months compared with cDMARDs, as measured by the disease activity score with
      the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR).

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the disease activity score 28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate DAS28-ESR at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 is a quantitative tool used to measure and monitor disease activity and &quot;the treatment&quot; of rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28 uses a formula that includes the number of tender joints and swollen joints for a maximum of 28 joints. DAS28 is used to assess whether an individual participant has a significant improvement of the disease activity, compared to baseline. A DAS28 score greater than 5.1 implies active disease, a score less than 3.2 implies low disease activity, and a score less than 2.6 implies remission.</description>

    <measure>Clinical remission rate measured by DAS28-ESR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as no tender or swollen joints and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. DAS28 will be used to measure disease activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Success rates of dose-reduction and discontinuation of steroid(s)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dose reduction is defined as a reduction by more than 50% compared to baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scores on the Korean Health Assessment Questionnaire (KHAQ-20), as a measure of quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KHAQ-20 is a participant-assessed measure of health assessment comprised of 8 indices. Scores for each index range from 0 (no difficulty to do) to 3 (unable to do). The total score is a sum of the 8 index score and ranges from 0 to 24. Higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>
