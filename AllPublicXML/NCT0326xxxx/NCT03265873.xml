  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT), surgery and chemotherapy (CT) are treatments for head and neck cancers,
      used alone or in combination. Conformal RT with Intensity Modulation (IMRT) is currently the
      reference technique. IMRT requires a precise definition of the target volumes to be treated
      and the anatomical structures to be protected from irradiation. Most studies of head and neck
      cancers published in the literature demonstrate the variability in the contouring of the
      target volumes between radiotherapists. This may have an impact on dosimetry. To date, no
      studies have evaluated the impact of the ENT surgeon's evaluation in volumes contouring. The
      aim of this study is to compare the volumes determined by the radiotherapists alone and those
      determined jointly by the radiotherapists and the ENT surgeon.

    <description>The contouring of the different target volumes will be first performed by the radiotherapists. During the Head and Neck Tumor Board, the volumes initially determined by the radiotherapists will be analyzed jointly by the radiotherapists and the patient's ENT surgeon to carry out, if necessary, modifications, taking into account clinical observations, intraoperative findings (if any) and endoscopy findings. Concordance parameters will be calculated in a second time with the determined volumes (in particular, index of concordance, coefficient of similarity).</description>
