  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presented study compares the effectiveness of a biofeedback-based relaxation training
      with the effectiveness of a biofeedback-based self-alert training on the reduction of fatigue
      in multiple sclerosis patients using a between groups design. Furthermore, the relation of
      fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients and autonomic potentials as well as the performance in
      a vigilance task will be examined.

      The relaxation training is based on the principle of progressive muscle relaxation according
      to Jacobsen. The patient is asked to tense all muscles in their face and perceive consciously
      the relaxation afterwards according to verbal cues. In the self-alert training condition, the
      patient will hear verbal cues to increase their attention. In both conditions the external
      cues given will be reduced in four phases until the patient has to cue himself. The patient
      is advised to track the changes in the skin resistance mirrored by biofeedback on a screen.

      In both conditions the training will be split on two days. During the whole examination heart
      rate and skin resistance will be recorded. The allocation to the training happens randomly.
      On the first day the patient will complete questionnaires to survey depression and apathy and
      do a baseline vigilance task. Before and after the vigilance task the current fatigue status
      will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Afterwards an introduction in the treatment
      method will be given.

      On the second day the introduction into the training will be repeated. Afterwards a short
      time vigilance task will be done and questionnaires to survey fatigue and sleep behaviour and
      quality will be completed. Subsequently the last part of the training (no external cues) will
      be done. The examination will be completed by a long-time vigilance task. Before and after
      the vigilance task the current fatigue status will be assessed using a visual analogue scale.

      It is hypothesised that especially the biofeedback-based self-alert training has a positive
      effect on fatigue and the vigilance performance in multiple sclerosis patients, as it
      increases the ectodermal activity and increases the sympathetic activation. It was shown that
      phasic changes of the skin resistance are correlated with an increase of neuronal activity in
      the brain areas relevant for vigilance (Critchley et al., 2002; Nagai et al., 2004). The
      relaxation training will reduce the sympatho-adrenergic excitation disposition and reduce the
      level of activity. Consequently, we do not expect an alleviation of the perceived fatigue
      according to our underlying model (Hanken et al., 2016). In addition, it is hypothesized
      that, independent from the treatment, autonomic potentials correlate with fatigue.
