      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, PK and PD of TAK-906 in participants
      with Gastroparesis (GP).

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906 maleate. TAK-906 maleate is being
      tested to treat people who have DG or IG. This study will assess the safety, tolerability,
      PK/PD and food effect of TAK-906, and will determine the effect of TAK-906 on GE.

      The study will enroll a total of approximately 48 participants. This study will be conducted
      in two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 will consist of 48 participants enrolled in 4 active
      treatment groups. Each treatment group will enroll 12 participants with a minimum of 4 DG and
      IG participants in each group. Participants in Part 1 will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to one of the four active treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK 906 maleate 5 mg

        -  TAK 906 maleate 25 mg

        -  TAK 906 maleate 100 mg

        -  Placebo

      All participants who will complete Part 1 of the study will be eligible for enrollment in
      Part 2. Part 2 will consist of 18 participants who completed Part 1 and will be assigned to
      the 2 treatment groups as follow:

        -  TAK-906 maleate 25 mg Fed + TAK-906 maleate 25 mg Fasted

        -  Metoclopramide 10 mg

      This multi-center trial will be conducted the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 8 weeks. Participants will make a final visit to the clinic
      10-14 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>The GEBT is a nonradioactive, noninvasive, orally administered test for measuring the rate of solid phase gastric emptying (GE) in adults. The GEBT measures how fast solid food moves from the stomach to the small intestine during the digestive process and aids in the diagnosis of delayed stomach emptying (GP). GE half-emptying time is the time for half of the ingested solids to leave the stomach. This value was measured by the 13C spirulina GEBT.</description>

SmartPill eliminates radiation exposure and is the only motility test that provides a complete transit profile of the GI tract.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

        In order to be eligible for participation in this trial, the participant must:

          1. Has a documented diagnosis of DG or IG.

          2. Has a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 18 and less than or equal to
             (&lt;=) 40 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) at the Screening Visit.

          3. Be a nonsmoker who has not used tobacco or nicotine-containing products (example,
             nicotine patch) for at least 6 months prior to trial drug administration of the
             initial dose of trial drug/invasive procedure.

          4. Has symptoms for GP (that is, chronic postprandial fullness, abdominal pain,
             postprandial nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and/or early satiety) the past 3
             months.

          5. Has documented slow GE, with delayed GE by GEBT at Screening defined as &gt;=80th
             percentile. Note: If a participant has had a documented scintigraphy or GEBT within
             the last 12 months that confirms the diagnosis of delayed GE, a screening GEBT would
             not be required.

          6. Has nausea subscale (of American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society
             Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index-Daily Diary [ANMS-GCSI-DD]) symptom score &gt;=2 at
             least 3 of 7 days during Screening.

          7. Has hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c) less than (&lt;) 10 percent (%) (for diabetes mellitus only).

        Exclusion Criteria

        The participant must be excluded from participating in the trial if the participant:

          1. Has acute severe gastroenteritis and pronounced dehydration in the past 48 hours prior
             to Screening, gastric pacemaker, chronic parenteral feeding or persistent severe
             vomiting.

          2. Has a known disturbance of small intestinal absorption, exocrine pancreatic function,
             liver metabolism, and pulmonary function.

          3. Has a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia.

          4. Previous history of bezoars (the presence of retained liquid, bile, or small amounts
             of poorly organized food residue is permitted).

          5. Difficulty swallowing solid food or pills.

          6. Prior surgery involving the luminal GI tract (cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and
             hysterectomy are permitted if performed greater than (&gt;) 3 months prior to SmartPill
             test).

          7. Any abdominal or pelvic surgery within the past 3 months.

          8. Known or history of inflammatory bowel disease.

          9. Has active diverticulitis, diverticular stricture, and other intestinal strictures.

         10. Had major surgery, donated or lost 1 unit of blood (approximately 500 milliliter [mL])
             within 4 weeks prior to the pretrial (screening) visit milligram per deciliter (mg/dL)
             (14.99 millimole per liter [mmol/L]) during any visit up to and including the
             randomization visit (Period 1 Day 1 predose). Note: If the participant meets this
             exclusion criterion and the investigator believes that the value is not consistent
             with the participant's current self-monitoring blood glucose values, the participant
             should not be excluded at this time. The visit can be repeated within 5 to 7 days.

         11. Has had diabetic ketoacidosis (within the prior 4 weeks).
