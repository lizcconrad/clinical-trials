      The aim of this project is to evaluate whether Beanstalk's 'Story Starters' intervention is
      effective in boosting vocabulary and grammatical development in young children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who read regularly with their parents or carers tend to learn language faster, enter
      school with a larger vocabulary of words and become more successful readers in school.
      Because of this, local authorities often commission services to promote family-based shared
      book reading. However, recent studies suggest that shared reading interventions work less
      effectively for children from disadvantaged backgrounds than originally thought, particularly
      when their parents have lower levels of education. This means that there is a danger that the
      benefits of shared reading will be restricted to children from more affluent homes and not
      get through to those who need them most. To solve this problem, there is a need to develop a
      better understanding of how reading interventions work and to evaluate existing shared
      reading interventions to determine whether they are effective in promoting young children's
      language development.

      The aim of this project is to evaluate whether Beanstalk's 'Story Starters' intervention is
      effective in boosting vocabulary and grammatical development in young children. Story
      Starters is a reading intervention delivered by Beanstalk, a national children's literacy
      charity committed to ensuring no child faces the severe consequences of illiteracy. Beanstalk
      trains volunteers to provide caring and fun one-to-one support to disadvantaged children aged
      3 and 4 in local nurseries, aiding their language development.

      The project will compare the effects of the 'Story Starters' intervention against a wait-list
      control group. Children in the intervention group will receive the Story Starters
      intervention, delivered by a trained Beanstalk volunteer, at their preschool for six months.
      The trained volunteer will visit the child twice a week and deliver a one-to-one 20 minute
      book reading and play session. Children in the intervention group will also receive a new
      book each month which will be sent to their home address by Dolly Parton's Imagination
      Library.

      Children in the wait list control group will also receive a new book each month from Dolly
      Parton's Imagination Library but they will not receive the 'Story Starters' intervention
      until after the project has ended.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals - Preschool 2 United Kingdom (CELF Preschool-2) will be administered. This is a published standardized measure of the language knowledge of individual children. The investigators will use three subtests to calculate each child's core language score. The three subtests measure knowledge of sentence structure, knowledge of word structure and expressive vocabulary.</description>

    <description>The British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS) will be administered. This is a published standardised measure and will be used to measure receptive vocabulary of individual children.</description>

    <description>The full Preschool Inventory of Phonological Awareness (PIPA) will be administered. This is a published standardised measure of phonological awareness of individual children. The investigators will use the PIPA to measure, rhyme awareness, syllable segmentation, alliteration awareness, phoneme isolation, phoneme segmentation and letter knowledge.</description>

    <description>The WellComm Screening Tool will be administered. This is a published measure of language skills of individual children. The investigators will use the WellComm to measure expressive and receptive language skills.</description>

    <measure>Fidelity to the intervention by the Beanstalk volunteer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Video recordings of the trained Beanstalk volunteers delivering 'Story Starter' sessions will be analysed to measure fidelity to the intervention and presence of target book reading behaviours. This will include coding for the presence of Dialogic book reading behaviours (prompting, evaluating, expanding and repeating). This will allow measurement of whether the volunteer adheres to the Story Starter intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Video recordings of the trained Beanstalk volunteers delivering 'Story Starter' sessions will be analysed to measure level of child engagement (Kucirkova, Messer &amp; Whitelock, 2012). This will include coding rate of pointing, rate of smiles and laughs, rate of less engaged behaviours and rate of vocal activity.</description>

    <description>Children will receive the the Story Starters intervention for six months. Each child will be visited by a trained Story Starter volunteer twice a week while the child is in preschool. The sessions will last 20 minutes and in each session the Story Starter volunteer and child will read books and play with toys. The Story Starter volunteers will keep a record of the number of sessions each child attends.
Each child will receive one new book per month delivered to their home address by Dolly Parton's Imagination Library.</description>
