  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) is common and can have lasting consequences for mother and child.
      ROSE is an intervention to prevent PPD, delivered during pregnancy in outpatient prenatal
      settings. ROSE has been found to significantly reduce cases of PPD in multiple randomized
      trials in community prenatal settings with racially and ethnically diverse low-income
      pregnant women. Requests for ROSE training and recent policy changes supporting payment for
      comprehensive perinatal services to underserved populations suggest a context ripe for
      embedding ROSE in prenatal clinics long-term. Given the need for return on investment studies
      about sustainment efforts, we propose a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized (SMART)
      Trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach to sustainment of
      ROSE in 90 outpatient clinics providing prenatal care to pregnant women on public assistance
      in 6 U.S. states. In Year 1, all clinics will receive enhanced implementation as usual (EIAU;
      initial training + tools for sustainment). At the first time at which a clinic is determined
      to be at risk for failure to sustain (i.e., at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 months), that clinic will be
      randomized to receive either: (1) no additional implementation support (i.e., EIAU only), or
      (2) low-intensity coaching and feedback (LICF). If clinics receiving LICF are still found to
      be at risk at subsequent assessments, they will be randomized to either (1) EIAU + LICF only,
      or (2) high-intensity coaching and feedback (HICF). Additional study follow-up interviews
      will occur at 18, 24, and 30 months, but no implementation intervention will occur after 18
      months. Outcomes include: 1. Sustainment of core program elements at each time point and
      total length of time ROSE services were provided and were provided with at least moderate
      fidelity. 2. Health impact (PPD rates over time at each clinic) and reach. 3. ROI (costs,
      cost-offsets, and cost-effectiveness) of each sustainment step. Hypothesized mechanisms
      include sustainment of clinical and organizational capacity to deliver core elements, and
      engagement/ownership. The study will also examine predictors, tailoring variables, and
      implementation processes to determine which kinds of clinics need which level of sustainment
      support and when. To our knowledge, this study will be the first randomized trial evaluating
      the ROI of a stepped approach to sustainment, a critical unanswered question in
      implementation science.

    <textblock>
      A recent expert consensus report concluded that, &quot;Little is known about how well or under
      what conditions health innovations are sustained and their gains maintained once they are put
      into practice. Implementation science typically focuses on uptake by early adopters. The
      later-stage challenges of sustaining evidence-supported interventions receive too little
      attention.&quot; This report placed high priority on conducting return on investment (ROI) studies
      to determine how much is gained when effective programs are sustained, and cost-benefit
      trade-offs for effort required to sustain.1 Information is especially needed for preventive
      behavioral health interventions for adults in outpatient medical (e.g., primary care; OBGYN)
      settings.

      Postpartum depression (PPD) is common and can have serious and lasting consequences for
      mother and child, including maternal increased risk for suicide, compromised functional
      status, and adverse infant developmental outcomes. Prevalence of PPD is ~13% in the 12 weeks
      after childbirth, with rates up to 50% among low-income women, who are especially vulnerable
      to the consequences of PPD. Outpatient clinics offering prenatal care are an opportune place
      to deliver PPD prevention services because most women will visit while pregnant. Recent
      guidelines suggest that prenatal clinics should screen for PPD after birth and refer once it
      is identified. Unfortunately, prenatal clinics do not routinely do anything to prevent PPD
      from occurring.

      The ROSE Program (Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of newborns) is a
      small-group intervention to prevent PPD that is delivered during pregnancy in outpatient
      prenatal settings. ROSE is the only PPD preventative intervention that (1) has been found to
      significantly reduce cases of PPD in multiple randomized trials, and (2) has been tested in
      community prenatal settings with racially and ethnically diverse low income pregnant women.
      ROSE consists of four 90-minute group sessions and a 50-minute individual booster session
      after delivery. Requests for ROSE training in Philadelphia and nationwide in Japan, and
      recent policy changes supporting payment for comprehensive perinatal services (including
      behavioral health care) to underserved populations all suggest a context ripe for embedding
      ROSE in prenatal clinics long-term. Given the need for ROI studies about sustainment efforts
      and that ROSE is well-positioned for implementation and sustainment research, we propose a
      Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized (SMART) Trial of the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach to sustainment of ROSE in 90 outpatient clinics
      providing prenatal care to pregnant women on public assistance in 6 U.S. states (MI, NY, RI,
      PA, MA, FL). Our conceptual framework comes from RE-AIM and a review on sustainment by Co-I
      Wiltsey-Stirman,3 with sustainment strategies based on the Replicating Effective Programs
      (REP) framework. All clinics will receive enhanced implementation as usual (EIAU; initial
      training + tools for sustainment). Clinics will be assessed using surveys and qualitative
      interviews 9 times over 2.5 years after receiving EIAU. Clinics at risk for failure to
      sustain operationally (defined as no ROSE intervention in 3 months and none planned) and/or
      clinically (defined as low fidelity to ROSE core elements) will be randomized to receive
      additional sustainment support for up to 18 months after baseline. At the first time period
      at which a clinic is determined to be at risk (i.e., at 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 months), that
      clinic will be randomized to receive either: (1) no additional implementation support (EIAU
      only), or (2) EIAU plus low-intensity (every 3 months) coaching and feedback (LICF). If
      clinics receiving LICF are still at risk at subsequent monitoring periods, they will be
      randomized to (1) EIAU + LICF only, or (2) EIAU + LICF + high-intensity (monthly) coaching
      and feedback (HICF). Additional study follow-up interviews will occur at 18, 24, and 30
      months, but no implementation intervention will occur after 18 months. We will assess costs
      and benefits of sustainment strategies. Aims are to:

      Compare effectiveness of each sustainment step for the following final and proximal OUTCOMES:

        1. Sustainment of core program elements at each time point, and total length of time in
           weeks that: (i) any ROSE services were provided, and (ii) were provided with adequate
           fidelity to core elements (primary).

        2. Health impact (e.g., PPD rates over time at each clinic) and reach (number of patients
           enrolled in and completing the ROSE program).

        3. Return on Investment (costs and cost-effectiveness of each sustainment step).

        4. Hypothesized mechanisms include sustainment of: (a) clinical and organizational capacity
           to deliver core elements, and (b) a sense of engagement/ownership by key clinic staff,
           Examine predictors and processes to determine which kinds of clinics need which level of
           support.

        5. Explore which clinic characteristics (e.g., organizational and state policy contexts)
           and hypothesized mechanisms (Aim 4) are associated with best sustainment to determine
           tailoring variables for choosing/sequencing EIAU, LICF, HICF in the future.

        6. Document implementation/sustainment effort processes, their timing relative to desired
           outcomes, critical incidents to explore factors most related to sustainment after
           accounting for hypothesized mechanisms.

      To our knowledge, this study will be the first randomized trial evaluating the ROI of a
      stepped approach to sustainment, a critical unanswered question in implementation science.
      The study will also examine a set of strategies to promote sustainment of an effective PPD
      prevention intervention for low-income women, reducing negative consequences for mother and
      child. The proposal directly addresses the goal of PAR-16-238 to conduct longitudinal studies
      on &quot;factors that contribute to the sustainability of evidence-based interventions,&quot; to test
      strategies to improve quality of care among underserved populations, examine mediators and
      moderators, and examine cost-effectiveness or other economic outcomes. Thus, the study will
      advance implementation science, knowledge of implementation science mechanisms, and clinical
      care for an at-risk population.

    <description>Quarterly, we will ask each clinic to report the following overall numbers: (1) # of women who should have come for their 6-week postpartum appointment; (2) # who came; (3) # that were screened for PPD; (4) # who screened positive for PPD. We will also collect this information for 4 quarters (12 months) prior to baseline. We will use these numbers to calculate PPD rates for each time period. Although though not every woman in the clinic will receive ROSE, we chose to track overall PPD rates at each clinic because: (1) the study examines larger-scale sustainment aimed at clinic-wide (and eventually population-wide) outcomes; and (2) the clinic-level outcomes are primary; not consenting individual patients makes the needed sample size (90 clinics) feasible.</description>
