  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo general anesthesia for surgical procedures frequently need to have a
      breathing tube placed (&quot;tracheal intubation&quot;) for the duration of the procedure. Most often
      airway management is routine for an experienced anesthesiologist. Less often, airway
      management can be difficult and can result in patient harm. In order to reduce risk,
      anesthesiologists routinely evaluate patients' airways by obtaining a relevant history and
      doing a physical exam, which can aid in predicting which airways may be difficult to manage.
      The &quot;gold standard&quot; for management of the anticipated difficult airway is to perform an awake
      flexible bronchoscopic intubation after anesthetizing the airway with local anesthesia. This
      affords added safety because the airway remains patent and the patient breaths spontaneously
      until a tracheal tube is secured, at which point general anesthesia can be induced.

      Recently, authors have advocated for alternative methods of management of the predicted
      difficult airway, most commonly by using a video laryngoscope to perform the awake
      intubation. A video laryngoscope provides an indirect view of the larynx using a camera at
      the tip of a rigid laryngoscope. It takes less training to gain and maintain proficiency
      compared to flexible bronchoscopy.

      Previous studies that have shown successful awake intubation with video laryngoscopy in the
      predicted difficult airway have not included patients with head and neck pathology, including
      malignancies or a history of head and neck surgery or radiation. In this study, the study
      team will perform video laryngoscopy in patients with head and neck pathology who require
      awake bronchoscopic intubation for surgery after placement of the tracheal tube and induction
      of anesthesia. The study team hypothesize that it will be difficult to obtain a good view of
      the larynx with video laryngoscopy in some patients with head and neck pathology. If there is
      a significant incidence of difficult video laryngoscopy in this patient population, it will
      reinforce that anesthesiologists need to continue to learn and maintain skills in
      bronchoscopic intubation.
