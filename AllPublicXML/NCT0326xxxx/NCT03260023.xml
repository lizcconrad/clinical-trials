  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two parts :

      In the phase Ib part: safety will be assessed in consecutive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients at
      increasing doses of TG4001 in combination with avelumab according to a 3+3 design. There will
      be no intra-patient dose escalation.

      In the phase II part, evaluation of efficacy and further evaluation of safety of the
      combination of TG4001 and avelumab will be performed in a single arm cohort of patients with
      HPV-16 positive oropharyngeal SCCHN.

      In both parts, tumor response will be evaluated on local assessment using RECIST 1.1.

      All patients will be followed up until disease progression or death due to any cause or the
      date of data cut-off, whichever occurs first.
