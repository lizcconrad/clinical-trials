  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading cause of neonatal viral infection and can have a
      significant impact on the neurosensory development of newborns and especially premature
      infants. CMV infection can result from materno-fetal transmission during pregnancy
      (congenital infection) or postnatal transmission. The prevalence of congenital CMV infection
      in the newborn is estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.5%. Among the newborns in utero infected
      by CMV, it is estimated that 10-15% will present symptoms at birth (hypoacousia / unilateral
      or bilateral deafness, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, psychomotor retardation, etc.) and 0.5%
      of them will die. 20% of infected infants, mainly symptomatic newborns, suffer permanent
      sequelae, mainly loss of hearing. Many asymptomatic children at birth will present hearing
      loss and other delayed neurological complications. A progressive neurosensory hearing loss
      may develop for 13-15% of asymptomatic newborns at birth. Deafness is bilateral in 50% of
      cases, severe in more than 50% of cases, and its occurrence is often delayed. The hearing
      loss has a significant impact on the future life of the child, mainly on language acquisition
      and school performance.

      A systematic CMV screening is not currently recommended at birth due to the frequency of
      asymptomatic forms, difficulty in fetal diagnosis and prognosis, lack of consensus for
      preventive and curative treatment of the infection. New treatments are being evaluated and
      encouraging results could revive the debate.

      PCR from urine is the gold standard for the diagnosis of CMV infection. Urine collection is
      not systematic in newborns and its realization can sometimes be difficult. On the other hand,
      in children at risk (hypotrophy, prematurity, infectious risks, fetal distress or respiratory
      distress at birth), gastric aspiration is systematically performed at birth to overcome
      obstruction of the upper aero-digestive tract, to prevent oesophageal atresia, to avoid
      inhalation by reflux and sometimes to make a bacteriological diagnosis.

      Our hypothesis is that this liquid could be used for the detection of CMV infection without
      adding any invasive action in newborns. Ultimately, gastric aspirate could allow for routine
      CMV screening in children at risk and thus allow for appropriate care by nursing staff.The
      occurrence of immediate or delayed sensory sequelae in these children would be then limited.

        Inclusion Criteria of the newborn:

        - Child born in maternity and / or child hospitalized in the Neonatal Médicine Department
        of the University Hospital of Besançon for which a urine sample (minimum volume = 0.5 mL)
        and a gastric aspiration fluid sample (minimum volume = 0.7mL) were collected (regardless
        of gender, birth weight or pathology presented at admission).

        Exclusion Criteria of the newborn:

          -  Child died before the sampling

          -  A volume of gastric aspiration fluid dedicated to the study less than 0.7 mL.

          -  An impossible collection of urine (malformation, skin irritation of the perineum,
             contamination with meconium).
