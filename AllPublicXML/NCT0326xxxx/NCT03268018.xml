      The MODIFY Pilot clinical study in Europe looks to evaluate acute and procedural outcomes
      using a new calcium atherectomy and modification solution in patients with balloon resistant
      calcified lesions in infrainguinal disease. The intent is to both debulk and modify the
      vessel to restore blood flow, improve vessel compliance and drive better outcomes. The MODIFY
      Pilot study will evaluate safety and performance measurements.
