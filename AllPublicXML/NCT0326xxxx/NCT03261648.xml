  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Admission to an emergency department is a major source of anxiety for the patient. Anxiety
      plays not only a role in its emotional state but can also have consequences on the taking
      care of the patient and especially on the analgesic procedure.

      Since pain is one of the first causes of emergency admission, patient anxiety should not be
      overlooked. In the emergency department, patient consults frequently, with his partner .
      Anxiety can also affect the partner, which may affect the patient. No studies have yet
      demonstrated this correlation.

      This study will evaluate, the anxiety of both parties and show the presence or not of an
      influence of the partner's anxiety on the patient using a standardized questionnaire, the
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory- form Y (STAI-Y).
