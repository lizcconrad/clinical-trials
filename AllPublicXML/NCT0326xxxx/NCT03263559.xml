    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single arm, multi-center trial, designed to estimate the efficacy and
      toxicity of haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in patients with sickle cell
      disease (SCD). Based on their age and entry criteria patients are stratified into two groups:
      (1) children with SCD with strokes; and (2) adults with severe SCD.

      This study is designed as a Phase II multi-center trial to determine the feasibility of
      achieving a high rate of event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years post transplant using
      pre-conditioning hydroxyurea (HU) with a conditioning regimen that consists of a combination
      of Thymoglobulin/Cyclophosphamide/Fludarabine/Thiotepa with post-grafting high-dose
      cyclophosphamide in patients with severe SCD who have HLA-haploidentical donors. EFS is
      defined as survival without a qualifying event. This is a single arm study in which
      participants will be enrolled into one of two strata. The first stratum will be restricted to
      children who have stroke and 40 children will be enrolled in this stratum. The second stratum
      will consist of adult patients with severe sickle cell disease and 40 participants will be
      enrolled in this stratum.

             scan.

          3. Pulmonary function: Pulse oximetry with a baseline O2 saturation of ≥ 85% and
             Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt; 40% (corrected for

          4. Renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal for age and estimated
             or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m²

          5. Hepatic function:

               1. Serum conjugated (direct) bilirubin &lt; 2x upper limit of normal for age as per
                  local laboratory. Participants with hyperbilirubinemia as the result of
                  hyperhemolysis, or a severe drop in hemoglobin post blood transfusion, are not
                  excluded.

               2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 5x upper
                  limit of normal as per local laboratory.

          6. Liver MRI using a validated methodology per institutional preference (T2* or R2* or by
             ferriscan [R2 MRI]) for estimation of hepatic iron content is required for
             participants who are currently receiving ≥8 packed red blood cell transfusions per
             year for ≥1 year or have received ≥20 packed red blood cell transfusions (lifetime
             cumulative). Participants who have hepatic iron content ≥ 10 mg Fe/g liver dry weight
             by liver MRI must have a Gastroenterology/hepatology consultation with liver biopsy
             and histological examination including documentation of the absence of cirrhosis,
             bridging fibrosis, and active hepatitis.

          7. Participants must be HLA typed at high resolution using DNA based typing at HLA-A, -B,
             -C, DRB1, and have available:

             An HLA haploidentical first degree relative donor (parents, siblings or half siblings,
             or children) with 2, 3, or 4 (out of 8) HLA-mismatches who is willing and able to
             donate bone marrow. A unidirectional mismatch in either the graft versus host or host
             versus graft direction is considered a mismatch. The donor and recipient must be HLA
             identical for at least one antigen (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the
             following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment of this
             criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share
             one HLA haplotype, and typing of additional family members is not required.
             Confirmatory donor HLA typing must be completed &lt; 100 days prior to Segment A
             enrollment

             images using a MRI scan, indicative of an acute infarct, with no other reasonable
             medical explanation (definition of a stroke supported with MRI imaging scans of the
             brain), OR both.

          4. Lack of clinical or radiologic evidence of a recent cerebral infarct by cerebral
             MRI/MRA within 30 days prior to enrollment. Participants with clinical or radiologic
             evidence or a recent cerebral infarct will be deferred for ≥ 6 months with repeat
             cerebral MRI/MRA to ensure stabilization of the neurologic event prior to proceeding
             to transplantation.

                  red blood cell transfusions per year for ≥1 year in the 12 months before
                  enrollment to prevent vaso-occlusive clinical complications (i.e. pain, stroke,
                  and acute chest syndrome);

               5. An echocardiographic finding of tricuspid valve regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) ≥
                  2.7 m/sec.

             enrollment.

          7. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          8. Participants with clinically significant, uncontrolled autoimmune disease, requiring
             active medical management (immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy), which, in the
             judgment of the local Principal Investigator, indicates that the patient could not
             tolerate transplantation.

          9. Females of child bearing potential (to include all female participants &gt; 10 years of
             age, unless postmenopausal for a minimum of 1 year before the time of consent or
             surgically sterilized), who do not agree to practice two (2) effective methods of
             contraception at the same time, or do not agree to practice true abstinence when this
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, from the time of
             signing of informed consent through 12 months post-transplant.

         10. Males (even if surgical sterilized) who do not agree to practice effective barrier
             contraception, or who do not agree to practice true abstinence from the time of
             signing informed consent through 12 months post-transplant.

         11. Presence of anti-donor specific HLA antibodies. HLA antibody presence and specificity
             will be determined by solid phase immunoassays. An anti-donor specific HLA antibody
             will be considered positive when the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is higher than
             the cut-off defined by each institution. Recommended cut-off values are MFI &gt;1000 for
             donor specific antibody to HLA-A, -B, and DRB1 and MFI &gt;2000 for HLA-C, DQB1 and DPB1.
             This must be measured before the final donor selection, and &lt; 100 days before
             enrollment in Segment A (preferably &lt; 30 days before Segment A enrollment). If MFI
             &gt;1000 for donor specific antibody to HLA-A, -B, DRB1 and/or MFI &gt;2000 for HLA-C, DQB1
             and DPB1, documentation must be submitted to the DCC coordinator for review and
             approval by a Protocol Chair and/or Protocol Officer prior to enrollment
