  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We and other investigators have revealed an association between Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      seropositivity and an increased risk of developing marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZ),
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL, also known as Waldenström's macroglobulinemia), follicular
      lymphoma (FL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The sustained virologic response
      (SVR) to treatment with interferon or pegylated (Peg)IFN with ribavirin was closely
      associated with the regression of HCV-associated B-cell NHL (mainly MZL, and LPL).

      Currently, the second-generation direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), such as sofosbuvir,
      have been shown to have a higher cure rate, less side effects, and a shorter duration of
      therapy for chronic HCV infection. After the approval of DAA for HCV therapy, several recent
      anecdotal case reports showed that indolent low-grade B-cell NHLs regressed after HCV
      clearance by DAAs. It is noted that the time to complete remission of these lymphomas was
      around 20 to 24 weeks after starting DAAs. These findings indicate that DAAs can eradicate
      the trigger of lymphomagenesis by curing chronic HCV infection.

      Because DAAs are more potent and efficient than pegylated (Peg) interferon plus ribavirin and
      well-tolerated for the treatment of HCV infection, it is reasonable to use DAAs as the
      frontline treatment for HCV-positive patients with indolent B-cell NHL, such as MZL, LPL, and
      low-grade FL, who do not require immediate cytoreductive therapy. The aim of this proposal is
      to assess whether Harvoni® (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) could eradicate HCV and lead to
      durable complete remission of these lymphomas..

    <textblock>
      Although several epidemiological studies, including our study have been demonstrated the link
      between HCV and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), the direct evidence of the
      HCV-associated-NHL remains uncertain. Direct antiviral agents (DAA) have been shown to have a
      higher cure rate, less side effects, and a shorter duration of therapy for chronic HCV
      infection. Whether DAA treatment can cure HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHL remains unclear?
      If yes, a direct evidence of HCV-associated lymphomagenesis will be approved. Because DAAs
      are more potent and efficient than pegylated (Peg) interferon plus ribavirin and
      well-tolerated for the treatment of HCV infection, it is reasonable to use DAAs as the
      frontline treatment for HCV-positive patients with indolent B-cell NHL, such as MZL, LPL, and
      low-grade FL, who do not require immediate cytoreductive therapy. The aim of this proposal is
      to assess whether Harvoni® (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) could eradicate HCV and lead to
      durable complete remission of HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHL.

      In the translational part, we will assess the expression pattern of BAFF-related canonical
      and non-canonical NF-κB signaling molecules by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and
      t(11;18)(q21;q21), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in
      pre-treatment tumors samples of patients in prospectively predicting the antiviral
      responsiveness of HCV-positive indolent B-cell NHLs. The serum cytokines and chemokines,
      IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13 and CXCL13, BAFF level, and HCV RNA load before
      and after DAA treatment in HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHLs will be examined. The genotype
      of the HLA class II, and cloning followed by sequences of the VH region of the immunoglobulin
      gene derived from pre-treatment tumor samples will be assessed.
