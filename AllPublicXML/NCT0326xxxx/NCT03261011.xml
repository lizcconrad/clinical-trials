  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of AK104 as a single agent in
      adult subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The study consists of a dose
      escalation phase (Phase 1a) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AK104 as a single agent, and a dose expansion phase (Phase 1b) which
      will characterize treatment of AK104 as a single agent at the MTD or RP2D.
