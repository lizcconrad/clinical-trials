    <textblock>
      It is known that the number of Chronic Critical İllnes, an iatrogenic condition, increases
      all over the world. The prevalence of Chronic Critical Illness in Turkey is unknown. The
      investigators aimed to evaluate the etiology, comorbid conditions, demographic data,
      prevalence, mortality and costs of these patient in intensive care units in Turkey. In this
      multi-centered study, The investigators will retrospectively review the last 1 year of
      patients receiving treatment at the Adult Intensive Care Unit.

    <textblock>
      The patients who survive an acute critical illness in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) may be
      delayed in a situation where they are sometimes totally independent before hand due to
      iatrogenic causes such as infections, dysfunctions, psychological disorders. This can take
      weeks, sometimes months. This disease is called &quot;Chronic Critical Illness&quot; (CCI).

      Most researchers associate CCI with the need for prolonged acute mechanical ventilation or
      the opening of tracheostomy for prolonged acute mechanical ventilation. There is no single
      condition that does not require an extended mechanical ventilation from CCI. In conclusion,
      CCI is characterized by long-term care requiring survival and it is predicted that the cost
      of these patients will increase with the new patients whose cost will be added in the coming
      years. In the United States, the number of CCI is around 250,000, and this figure has
      increased by 50-100% in the last 10 years. At least 50% of these patients die in one year and
      less than 12% recover and become discharged. The annual cost of these patients' health care
      system is over $ 20 billion. The prevalence of CCI in Turkey is still unknown. In this study,
      it was aimed to investigate the prevalence of patients with Chronic Critical Syndrome in
      intensive care units in Turkey.
