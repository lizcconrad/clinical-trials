    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to: 1) test whether transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS) after spinal cord injury can reduce the onset of post-injury neuropathic
      pain; and 2) to learn more about this kind of pain and who is at risk for suffering from this
      type of pain after spinal cord injury. Neuropathic pain is a type of pain that occurs in
      about 50% of people with spinal cord injury. This type of pain is usually described as
      &quot;burning&quot; or &quot;tingling,&quot; and is present around the level of injury and/or in areas below the
      level of injury. The investigators' goal is to try a non-drug treatment (TENS) that may help
      prevent this pain from occurring. Pain symptoms will be compared between the study
      participants who receive active TENS and the study participants who receive a sham TENS
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18;

          -  Traumatic spinal cord injury;

          -  Date of injury occurring within four months of study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than four months since date of injury;

          -  Contraindications for the study intervention, transcutaneous electrical nerve
             stimulation (TENS),88 including:

          -  Implanted electronic device such as a pacemaker;

          -  Cardiovascular problems;

          -  Pregnancy;

          -  Epilepsy;

          -  Cancer;

          -  Persons with a spinal cord injury at the C2 level, as placement of TENS electrodes on
             the neck is not recommended;

          -  Cognitive dysfunction which limits the ability of the participant to adequately
             understand procedures and risks.

          -  Prisoners

          -  Pregnant Women

        Special populations:

          -  Adults unable to consent: excluded from study

          -  Individuals -who are not yet adults: individuals who are less than 18 years old will
             be excluded from the study

          -  Pregnant women: Women who are known to be pregnant will not be recruited into the
             study. A pregnancy test will be administered to females prior to enrollment in TENS
             (or sham) treatment. Women who become pregnant before or during the 8-week TENS
             treatment period will be discontinued from the study. Women who become pregnant after
             the 8-week TENS treatment portion of the study will continue to be enrolled, and
             followed according to protocol guidelines (no information will be collected
             specifically on the pregnancy or fetus).

          -  Prisoners: excluded from study

          -  Neonates: not applicable
