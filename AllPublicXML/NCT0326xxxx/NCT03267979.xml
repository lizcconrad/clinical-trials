  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different pain assessment methods have been proposed to evaluate analgesic efficacy after
      surgical operation. Pain is a subjective phenomenon. Patient did his pain self assessment.
      But, cooperation of the patient is limited by cultural differences, language barriers or
      residual effect of products used while general anesthesia.

      A lot of study were conducted to demonstrate and to quantify the pain after an operation. The
      aim will be dose analgesic treatment better without cooperation of the patient.

      This sudy concerns patients on the post anesthesia care units one hour after their arrival.
      They will have electrocardiogram and video-pupillometer.

      Primary objective is to compare Variation Coefficient of Pupillary Diameter (VCPD) obtained
      during a light flash and pain assessment realized thanks to Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Too,
      Variation Coefficient of Pupillary Diameter (VCPD) with electrocardiogram will be measured to
      demonstrate a correlation between the three parameters.
