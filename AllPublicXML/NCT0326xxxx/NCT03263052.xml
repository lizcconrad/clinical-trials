  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether converting patients from FDA approved immediate-release
      tacrolimus to FDA approved extended release tacrolimus (Envarsus) reduces neurological
      side-effects, improves quality of life, and enhances adherence. A select group of elderly (&gt;
      60 years of age) patients, who are especially sensitive to tacrolimus-related adverse (AEs)
      effects, will be provided the opportunity to convert to Envarsus with this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus (Prograf) is a calcineurin inhibitor that is widely used in all types of solid
      organ transplants. However, one of the major limitations in using tacrolimus are the adverse
      effects that significantly reduce a transplant recipient's quality-of-life (QOL). These QOL
      reducing AEs associated with tacrolimus include post-transplant diabetes mellitus,
      neurotoxicity, diarrhea, nephrotoxicity, and alopecia. A recent open-label, multicenter,
      prospective phase 3b study showed that Envarsus significantly reduced tremors and improved
      quality of life when compared to tacrolimus. It is postulated that the mechanism behind
      tremor reduction occurs as a result of lower Cmax tacrolimus concentrations with the new
      Envarsus formulation. Given its ability for tremor improvement, it would be beneficial to
      investigate whether conversion from tacrolimus to Envarsus can improve other neurological AEs
      such as insomnia vertigo, photophobia, mood disturbances, or headache. In particular, the
      elderly are especially sensitive to tacrolimus-related AEs and may benefit from tacrolimus to
      Envarsus conversion. Further, it is useful to understand the cost effectiveness of converting
      to Envarsus in this patient population.

      Study duration: 35 days per subject until a total of 40 subjects are enrolled. Patients will
      have a total of 4 visits.

        This study will enroll elderly kidney transplant recipients who are at least 60 years of
        age and have experienced neurological adverse events while on generic tacrolimus, Prograf,
        or Astagraf XL.
