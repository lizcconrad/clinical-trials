  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of KERAAL technological project is to create a new intelligent robot which
      allows a humanoid robot to record then to show and to follow the progress of rehabilitation
      sessions proposed by a physiotherapist to a patient, the latter being able to practice
      without the physiotherapist. The final objective is to stimulate and increase the overseen
      time of rehabilitation. Poppy robot was chosen as it is able to realize all kind of movements
      notably movements of the spine with 5 degrees of freedom associated to the several levels of
      the spine. It will allow to address the population included in the protocol. RCOOL study
      tries to validate this prototype device as tool of rehabilitation.

      The main objective is the feasibility of the supervision by a humanoid robot of a succession
      of rehabilitation exercises.

      RCOOL study is a randomized clinical trial checked under single-blind condition to compare
      two rehabilitation strategies, one with exercises executed by the patients and supervised by
      Poppy and the other one with usual rehabilitation protocol.
