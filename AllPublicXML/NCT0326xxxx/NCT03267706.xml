  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot the introduction of a newly developed palliative care
      tool to clinicians in a family health team. The intent of the tool is to improve the quality
      and comprehensiveness of palliative care, which effects caregiver and patient satisfaction
      with care received, as well as clinician satisfaction with their delivery of care. Tool
      effectiveness will be evaluated by measuring satisfaction scores of caregivers, patients and
      clinicians who receive training and access to the tool compared to caregivers, patients and
      clinicians providing usual care (without the tool). Uptake of the tool and user feedback will
      be collected

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A newly developed tool to guide clinicians in best palliative care practices was developed
      based on a combination of published tools and consultation with primary care, end users
      (clinicians). The tool will be introduced as a pilot to clinicians who will receive training
      on use of the tool and access to the tool within a family health team in Ontario, Canada. The
      tool will be applied in a controlled study environment that randomly assigns clinicians to
      one of two groups. One group will receive training and access to the tool and the other group
      of clinicians will continue to provide usual care.The tool will be evaluated based on
      validated satisfaction surveys completed by caregivers, patients and clinicians. Satisfaction
      scores of those randomly assigned to care enhanced by the tool will be compared to those
      receiving usual care at the beginning and end of the study. Uptake of the tool will be
      measured, as well as user experience with the tool (feasibility and acceptability)
