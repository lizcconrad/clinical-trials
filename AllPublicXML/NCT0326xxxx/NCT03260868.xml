      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of virtual approach via novel technologies versus traditional study
      conduct on glycemic control in terms of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the appropriate utilization of virtual approach via novel technologies during the
      study and to assess the effect of the virtual versus traditional study conduct on multiple
      outcomes in terms of study methodology and diabetes management.

      The study will have a maximum study duration of 29 weeks, which consists of a 3-week
      screening period (including a possible 1-week delay in first IMP administration after
      randomization in virtual group due to shipment of IMP and the virtual devices), a 24-week
      treatment period, and a 2-day post-treatment safety follow-up period.

          -  Patients who are treated with multi-dose insulin using insulin glargine 100 U/mL (eg,
             Lantus or Basaglar) as basal insulin and rapid acting insulin analogues as bolus
             insulin.

          -  Patient with access to or experience with mobile technology (eg, tablet or smart
             phone).

          -  eSign the consent on the study web portal.

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

          -  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ) &lt;5.4% or â‰¥9.0% measured by the central lab at Visit 1.

          -  Patients who received less than 6 months treatment with any basal plus mealtime
             insulin.

          -  Use of any basal insulins other than insulin glargine 100 U/mL (eg, Lantus or
             Basaglar) within 3 months before screening.

          -  Use of an insulin pump within 6 months before screening.

          -  Use of meal-time insulin other than rapid-acting insulin analogs (Humalog, Novolog, or
             Apidra), eg, human regular insulin, within 30 days before screening.

          -  Hemoglobinopathy resulting in undetectable HbA1c by the central laboratory, or
             hemolytic anemia requiring transfusion of blood or plasma products within 3 months
             before screening.

          -  Patients experienced with any severe hypoglycemic episode resulting in seizure,
             unconsciousness, or coma, and/or leading to hospitalization during the past 6 months
             before screening.

          -  Patients with insufficient smart phone skills or unwilling to properly use the virtual
             tools deemed by the investigator based on the observation and experiences over the
             digital screening procedure-Mental disorders or any neurologic disorder that would
             affect patient's ability to meet the study requirements, or patients deemed unlikely
             to safely manage insulin dosage by the investigator.

          -  Known hypersensitivity/intolerance to insulin glargine, rapid-acting insulin analogs
             or any of their excipients.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women, or women who intend to become pregnant during the
             study period.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
