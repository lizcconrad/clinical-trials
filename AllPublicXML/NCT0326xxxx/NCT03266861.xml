  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, the measurement of the transcutaneous oxygen pressure during walking is the
      only continuous method that estimates the importance of ischemia, bilaterally and segment of
      limb by segment of limb. The determination of the lactates concentration, with micro method
      from earlobe sampling, is very widely validated in physiology and exercise physiopathology;
      and it is widely used, by laboratories, for exercise investigation in athletes. We use it in
      routine to evaluate the presence of functional limitation during tcpO2 tests on a treadmill.

      The present study hypothesises a significant relationship between lactatemia variation
      (difference between lactatemia after 3 minutes of recovery from walking and the value at
      rest) and tcpO2 &quot;decrease from rest of oxygen pressure (DROP) values for patients with
      peripheral artery disease (PAD).

  <detailed_description>

      Lactates sample (100 microliter) will be collected at rest Ankle brachial index is measured
      at rest transcutaneous oxygen pressure is measured at the chest, calves and buttocks and
      results will be expressed as the minimal value of the DROP index (Limb changes minus chest
      changes) Patients walk on treadmill (2MPH 10% slope) until exertional limb pain. Lactates
      sample (100 microliter) will be collected at minute 3 of recovery from walking Correlation of
      lactate increase to the sum of DROP values wil be studied
