      Stratified randomization Implanon and Jadelle group were done using block randomization. The
      participants and investigators were blinded to treatment allocation, using drug coding that
      not revealed until the end of study. Research assistants and nurse who did not have involve
      in analyses data would follow the recruitment criteria and drug injection follow the code of
      drug.

      All participants were collected demographic data, medical history, obstetrical and
      gynecological history, bleeding pattern before enrollment. Then physical exam and pelvic
      examination were performed for all participants. Participants received single dose
      intramuscular injection of Cyclofem® 0.5 ml or normal saline 0.5 ml as placebo on that day of
      recruitment to the study. Daily record of bleeding, spotting and side effect was done on
      record form.
