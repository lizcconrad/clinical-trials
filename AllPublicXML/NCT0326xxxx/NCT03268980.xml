  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Tobacco is the leading risk factor for avoidable mortality in France and around the
           world. It is also the second cause of life with disability in the world and the leading
           preventable risk factor for cancer in France and worldwide.

        -  The &quot;Health Barometer&quot; studies carried out for 25 years in France by Santé-Publique
           France assessed prevalence of smoking in the lay population. These studies showed that
           smoking prevalence has stabilized among 15-75 year olds (34.1% of current smokers) with
           a slight decrease in regular smoking (from 29.1% in 2010 to 28.2% in 2014).

        -  Data on the prevalence of smoking among hospital staff are contradictory. Some studies
           find a higher prevalence of active smoking than the general population; others have a
           lower prevalence. However, it appears that an active prevention policy with hospital
           staff can significantly and rapidly reduce the prevalence of active smoking.

        -  The prevalence of active smoking in patients is logically higher than in the general
           population (at comparable age).

        -  The data on the prevalence of smoking among medical students are also contradictory.
           Yet, this population is a special interest group given their future investment in
           patient care.

        -  Cannabis use also appears to be an independent risk factor for respiratory diseases and
           broncho-pulmonary cancers. Cannabis use among health students is not uncommon (11.5% of
           students). To our knowledge, the measurement of the prevalence of Cannabis use in an
           all-patient population of a hospital-university facility has never been achieved.

        -  According to the health barometer 2014, about a quarter of 15-75 year olds have already
           tried electronic cigarettes and 6% are regular current users. Although the toxicity of
           the electronic cigarette and its interest in weaning remain controversial, its use to
           patients, staff or patients has been reported very little.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of collective and individual tobacco control
      measures by measuring the prevalence of smoking on a given day at the &quot;Hospices Civils de
      Lyon&quot;, among patients, staff and students present on a given day initially and 5 years later.
