    <textblock>
      BRB-018-001 will be conducted as a multicenter, adaptive design, randomized, parallel group
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of repeat IV doses of RYI-018 in subjects
      with NAFLD. Subjects in each cohort shall be randomized to either RYI-018 or placebo as
      weekly injection for four weeks. The active doses of RYI-018 will be as follows: Cohort 1:
      0.6 mg/kg, Cohort 2: 1.2 mg/kg, and Cohort 3: 2.5 mg/kg. Primary endpoints include safety and
      tolerability. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.

          2. BMI ≥25.0 and ≤40.0 (kg/m2) (inclusive).

          3. Liver ultrasound (or transient elastography if approved by medical monitor) which
             qualitatively shows fatty liver or documented history of NAFLD.

          4. Liver fat percentage by MRI of approximately 10% or greater (MRI to be performed only
             in subjects with documented NAFLD or fatty liver by ultrasound or transient
             elastography if approved by medical monitor).

          7. Administration of IP in another trial within 30 Days or 5 times the investigational
             drug half-life, whichever is longer, prior to the first study drug administration.

          8. History of cerebrovascular event acute coronary syndrome within 6 months of screening.

          9. Any history of seizures, major depression, suicidality, or unexplained syncope.

             disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, alcohol liver disease, drug induced liver
             disease).

         11. Use of prescription or non-prescription weight loss medications, thiazolidinediones,
             investigational or approved medications for NASH, or antidepressant medications within
             90 days of screening.

         12. Use of insulin injections within 30 days of screening.

         13. History of bariatric surgery or plans for bariatric surgery or an attempt to lose
             weight during study.

         14. Daily alcohol intake &gt;20 g/day for women and &gt;30 g/day for men (on average per day),
             as per medical history.

         15. Subjects with renal dysfunction estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73
             m2.
