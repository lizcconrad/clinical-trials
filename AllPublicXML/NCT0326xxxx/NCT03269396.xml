      The purpose of this proposed study is to obtain safety and efficacy data on human laryngeal
      allograft transplantation in an effort to safely use these procedures as a viable
      reconstructive option for patients with severe laryngeal or laryngotracheal incompetence.

      Patients with severe laryngeal or laryngotracheal incompetence without other reconstructive
      options will be considered for cadaveric laryngotracheal transplantation. Data will be
      collected from 10 patients and will include length of hospital stay, short-term
      complications, long-term complications, hospital readmission, return trips to the operating
      room (OR), rejection episodes and severity, swallowing function, ability to have tracheotomy
      tube decannulated, voice parameters, pulmonary function, development of anti-donor
      antibodies, and quality of life scores.

      <textblock>
        Potential subjects for this study include patients with severe laryngeal dysfunction or a
        previous laryngectomy. For the purposes of this study, severe laryngeal dysfunction is
        defined as the loss of normal laryngeal function resulting in significant dysphonia,
        dysphagia, or dyspnea.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 18 years and older

          -  Male or Female

          -  One of the following:

               -  Severe laryngeal dysfunction as described above

               -  Laryngeal stenosis

               -  5 years or longer s/p definitive management for head and neck cancer

               -  Laryngeal cancer requiring total laryngectomy in a patient already on
                  immunosuppression

               -  Low-grade chondrosarcoma requiring total laryngectomy

          -  Ability to obtain informed consent from the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  be considered in case by case discussion)Less than 5 years s/p definitive
                  management for cancer

               -  Cancer within the last 5 years (Exceptional cases will be considered in case by

          -  Psychosocial parameters

               -  Severe mental retardation, psychosis, depression or organic brain syndrome

               -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Once HbA1C &lt; 7, reevaluate for candidacy.

               -  Active substance use within 6 months

               -  Active smoking within 6 months
