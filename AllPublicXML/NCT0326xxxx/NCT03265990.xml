      Comparison between Haemorrhoidectomy by Ligasure and conventional surgery

    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoids, a varicose condition are one of the commonest illnesses which causes per rectal
      bleeding . Hemorrhoidectomy is the standard operation for grades III and IV hemorrhoids; it
      is superior to any proposed conservative procedure. Conventional haemorrhoidectomy is the
      open surgical procedure in which the haemorrhoid pedicle is ligated by a transfixing suture
      which may lead to some postoperative complications mostly pain, bleeding and wound infection
      which ultimately cause prolonged stay in hospital.

      A number of surgeons believe that by avoiding vascular pedicle ligation the chances of
      secondary bleeding can be decreased .This stimulated the researchers to develop new
      techniques with a less severe course and faster recovery . Recent advances in instrumental
      technology including the bipolar electrothermal device, ultrasonic scalpel, and circular
      stapler are gaining popularity as effective alternatives in hemorrhoidectomy . Of these
      instruments, the LigaSure vessel sealing system has been recently introduced as a tool
      conceived to upgrade the conventional treatment of haemorrhoids. This reduces anal spasm and
      allows performing a bloodless haemorrhoidectomy with reduced post- operative pain and fast
      healing . .Thus this operation can be recommended as the ideal technique. Many trials were
      performed to compare LigaSure hemorrhoidectomy with conventional hemorrhoidectomy, although
      an overall favorable trend exists toward LigaSure, conclusions are not univocal and
      definitive; this creates some uncertainty, also considering the increasing cost for this
      disposable device: thus it is essential to keep on experimenting to determine whenever an
      actual advantage exists.

    <description>In ligasure group,After the haemorrhoids are prolapsed out from the anal canal with an artery forceps,Ligasure haemorrhoidectomy will be performed by applying the ligasure forceps close to the edge of each pile.Repeated applications of the device will be performed and excision will be continued into the anal canal,lifting the pile from the internal anal sphincter,to the level of the vascular pedicle,which will be finally divided.</description>
