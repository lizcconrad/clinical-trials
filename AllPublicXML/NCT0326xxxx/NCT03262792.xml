  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 weeks randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to assess the
      effect of ParActin® at low dose of 300 mg/day and high dose of 600 mg/day in the study
      population in the age range of 40-70 years and suffering from mild-moderate OA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will assess the efficacy parameters such as effect on various joint health
      parameters (pain, stiffness and physical activity) by using WOMAC scale. The individuals with
      knee OA suffer from an increased impact on their activities of daily living, which leads to
      losses in labor relations, leisure, social life, and sleeping quality, leading also to
      important decrease in their quality of life. Thus, an important outcome to be evaluated in
      this study is quality of life of these individuals which will be assessed by SF-36
      self-reported questionnaire. One of the aims of this study is therefore to investigate the
      levels of different dimensions of fatigue in knee OA and to assess changes in fatigue after
      the treatment targeting pain reduction and physical functioning by the use of FACIT-fatigue
      questionnaire.

      Effect of the treatment on rescue medication consumption which is directly proportional to
      the degree of pain will also be captured via this study. The hepatic (SGOT and SGPT) and
      renal (serum creatinine) safety biomarkers will be assessed to investigate the effect of
      chronic use of ParActin® on liver and kidneys.
