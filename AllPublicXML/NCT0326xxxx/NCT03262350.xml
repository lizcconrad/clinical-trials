      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of a regular yoga practice on body image
      in college women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled design will be used to study the effects of a regular yoga practice
      on body image in young adult women. Fifty female freshman, sophomores, and juniors between
      the ages of 18 and 26 years will be recruited from the University of Delaware student
      population, specifically targeting those new to yoga. Age, academic standing, availability
      and prior yoga experience will be evaluated.

      Consented individuals will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) yoga (offered 3 times
      per week) for 10 weeks; or (2) a control group. Baseline assessments, midpoint assessments,
      and end-of-study assessments will be conducted on all participants. Participants will be
      compensated for their attendance at assessment visits.

    <description>Participants are required to attend three assessment visits. During these assessments, participants will complete a questionnaire that will ask about their eating patterns, body image, sleep habits, and loneliness and have their height and weight measured. Participants are also required to attend 50-minute yoga classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 1:25-2:15pm for 10 weeks. The overall time commitment for Yoga Group participants is 3 hours of assessments and 50-minute yoga classes 3X week for 10 weeks.</description>

    <description>The yoga classes will be adapted to all levels of experience, mobility, and body size. Specific breathing techniques and body positive language will be incorporated into a body-positive yoga training done by Ms. Lisa Diers, RDN, E-RYT, YACEP. Less focus will be placed on precision of the poses, instead focus will be on body feelings, except where physically dangerous. Thus, the overall focus will be on listening to one's own body. List of messages will be carefully designed to be related to eating and weight, but to not be directly discussed. Ms. Diers will travel to Delaware to lead the intervention training for yoga instructors prior to the study taking place.</description>
