  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various antiangiogenic agents have a modest effect in prolonging overall survival in solid
      tumours. In colorectal cancer it is clear that there are some patients in whom bevacizumab
      significantly prolongs survival, but it is not effective in the majority of patients.
      Biomarker studies using tumour tissue and blood have failed to define a consistent biomarker
      that correlates with a beneficial effect of bevacizumab on survival. DCE-MRI can detect
      changes in tumour blood flow which, in early phase drug studies, correlated with subsequent
      tumour responses, but is too expensive and time consuming to be used in larger scale trials.
      DCE-US is a promising biomarker for use in this group of patients with antiangiogenic agents,
      as detailed above. The investigators wish to use this technique as a predictive biomarker for
      any effects Aflibercept has on OS and PFS in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      refractory to standard treatment.
