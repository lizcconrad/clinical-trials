  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently the imaging gold standard
      to detect active inflammatory lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The sensitivity of
      enhanced MRI to detect active lesions may vary according to the acquisition strategy used
      (e.g., delay between injection and image acquisition, contrast dose, field strength, and
      frequency of MRI sampling). Selection of the most appropriate T1-weighted sequence after
      contrast injection may also influence sensitivity. Several clinical studies performed at 1.5
      Tesla have shown that conventional 2D spin-echo (SE) sequences perform better than gradient
      recalled-echo (GRE) sequences for depicting active MS lesions after gadolinium injection. As
      relates to MS, 3.0 Tesla systems offer some advantages over lower field strengths, such as
      higher detection rates for T2 and gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions, an important capability
      for diagnosing and monitoring MS patients. Recent studies have shown that at 3 Tesla, 3D GRE
      or 3D fast SE sequences provide higher detection rates for gadolinium-enhancing MS lesions,
      especially smaller ones, than standard 2D SE, and better suppress artefacts related to
      vascular pulsation. However, the comparison of the performance of 3D GRE versus 3D SE
      sequences has not been investigated yet.

      Objectives To compare the sensitivity of enhancing multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in
      gadolinium-enhanced 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) and turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequences.

    <description>There will be only one arm of patients with central nervous system inflammatory disease.
Each patient will be its own control. The usual and additional MRI sequences will be performed in all patients and the number of lesions obtained in usual sequences and additional sequences will be compared in the same patient.</description>

    <description>Due to the participation in the study, the following sequences are added to the imaging protocol:
3D T1 GRE after injection (Gradient-Recalled Echo)
3D T1 TSE before injection (Turbo Spin Echo)
3D fGATIR PSIR after injection (fast Gray Matter Acquisition T1 Inversion Recovery Phase-Sensitive Inversion Recovery)
Sequences will be performed in a random order to avoid the bias induced by different time intervals between injection and acquisition.</description>
