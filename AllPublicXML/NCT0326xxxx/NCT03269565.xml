      An International Multicenter Open-label Randomized Trial of the Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics,

    <textblock>
      This trial has been designed as an international multicenter open-label Phase II trial.

      The trial aims to investigate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity of
      two dosage regimens of BCD-100 (JSC BIOCAD, Russia) as monotherapy in patients with
      unresectable/metastatic melanoma.

      According to the design, the trial will include two arms of patients. Each of the trial arms
      will receive repeated doses of the test drug as monotherapy; BCD-100 will be administered
      using one of the following dosage regimens established in a Phase I trial:

        -  Monotherapy, BCD-100 1 mg/kg Q2W (IV infusion over 60 minutes; if a 60-minute infusion
           is tolerated well, all following doses can be administered over 30 minutes);

        -  Monotherapy, BCD-100 3 mg/kg Q3W (IV infusion over 60 minutes; if a 60-minute infusion
           is tolerated well, all following doses can be administered over 30 minutes).
