    <textblock>
      The &quot;beverage hydration index&quot; (BHI) assesses the hydration potential of any consumable fluid
      relative to water. The BHI is a relatively new metric. Our purpose was to assess the BHI of
      beverages never previously tested, including an amino acid-based oral rehydration solution
      (AA-ORS), a glucose-containing ORS (G-ORS) and a sports drink (SD) compared to water
      (control).

      The &quot;Beverage Hydration Index&quot; (BHI) was created to assess the degree to which beverages
      &quot;hydrate&quot;, by measuring fluid retention after ingesting a 1 liter bolus and comparing it to
      water. Drinks with carbohydrates and electrolytes would traditionally be expected to score
      higher on the BHI due to glucose-sodium cotransport at the gut and osmolality approaching
      isotonicity with blood. One recent study reported that an oral rehydration solution (ORS)
      scored better than water, but a &quot;sports drink&quot; did not. No &quot;optimal&quot; BHI beverage composition
      has been described, nor has an optimal osmolality. Recently, a hypotonic amino acid-based
      rehydration beverage was developed to take advantage of amino acid-sodium cotransport, thus
      obviating the need for carbohydrate. However, the BHI of this beverage has not yet been
      assessed. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the hydration potential of this
      novel beverage in comparison to a commercially available carbohydrate-containing sports drink
      and oral rehydration solution.
