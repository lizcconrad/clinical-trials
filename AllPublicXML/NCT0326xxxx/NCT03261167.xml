  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin A (GSK1358820) is a sterile, purified type A botulinum neurotoxin complex. In
      Japan, 240 units of botulinum toxin A are approved as a maximum dose per administration for
      upper limb spasticity. This study is planned to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 400
      units of botulinum toxin A which can help to increase the maximum dose per administration to
      400 units from 240 units as the treatment with 240 units is considered insufficient in
      subjects with post-stroke upper limb spasticity. Approximately 120 subjects will be
      randomized to receive either 400 or 240 units of botulinum toxin A in double blind phase
      followed by open-label phase in which 400 units of the study treatment will be injected in
      both the groups. The study period will be up to 52 weeks, consisting of a screening phase up
      to 4 weeks, minimum 12-week double blind phase (Part 1), maximum 36- week open-label phase
      (12 weeks per cycle with 3 treatment phases: Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4).

    <description>The responder rate is defined as the proportion of the subjects whose MAS score was reduced at least 1 from Baseline in the elbow flexors. The MAS scale will be used to evaluate the level of spasticity. It is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (no increase in muscle tone) to 4 (affected part rigid in flexion or extension).The test will be performed on sitting position with affected parts extended as fast as possible to grade the flexor muscle tones.</description>

    <description>DAS scores of hygiene, pain, dressing, and limb posture will be assessed using a 4-point scale (0=No functional disability to 3=Severe disability).

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment will be categorized as SAE.</description>
