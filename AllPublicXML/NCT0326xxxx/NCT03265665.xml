  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ACTION intervention: physicAl aCtiviTy In minOrity womeN with asthma is a 8-month
      community-based walking intervention refined to be applicable for sedentary African American
      (AA) women with asthma. The main outcome of this study is to test the feasibility,
      acceptability and estimate the efficacy of the ACTION intervention in a randomized controlled
      pilot of 80 AA women with asthma within a pragmatic community setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease that disproportionately impacts African American
      (AA) women. AA women have poorer asthma-related quality of life and higher rates of asthma
      exacerbations, healthcare utilization and mortality compared to Caucasian women. Further, AA
      women are less physically active than any other subgroup of adults, which may help explain
      the asthma health disparities, found between AA and Caucasian women. Physical inactivity
      among individuals with asthma is associated with poor asthma control and respiratory
      function, greater health care utilization, and poorer quality of life. Given the connection
      between poor asthma outcomes and physical inactivity, addressing physical activity (PA) among
      sedentary AA women with asthma is imperative. Physical activity demonstrated improvement in
      asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, quality of life and healthcare utilization.
      Despite these benefits, fewer than 25% of AA women with asthma engage in regular physical
      activity. The ACTION intervention: physicAl aCtiviTy In minOrity womeN with asthma is a
      8-month community-based walking intervention refined to be applicable for sedentary AA women
      with asthma.

    <description>Women in the ACTION intervention will attend 1 asthma education/physical activity session and 5 group sessions in community location convenient to participants. Each session will last approximately 2 hours. Participants will be given Fitbit Charge HR to monitor their daily steps and will be sent motivational, educational and reminder text messages up to 3 times per week.</description>

    <description>Women in the Enhanced usual care arm will attend 1 asthma education/physical activity session and be given a Fitbit Charge HR to monitor their daily steps.

    <description>The intervention is based on the Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity Program, a culturally sensitive community-based walking intervention for African American (AA) women based on the Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior and Social Cognitive Theory. There are 2 phases to the intervention: Adoptive (16 weeks) and Maintenance (12 weeks). 3 motivational/reminder texts will be made each week during the adoption phase and 1 during the maintenance phase. 5 Group sessions(adoptive): Participants will be given individualized step goals, watch a short DVD featuring AA women demonstrating skills and sharing experiences of engaging in walking. An interventionist will lead a discussion on role-modeling and encouraging problem solving. Each intervention group will have 10 women with 1 interventionist. Data will be collected at 3 time points: baseline, post-adoptive phase and post-maintenance phase.</description>

    <description>Participants will attend 1 two hour asthma education/physical activity session at community location near them. Participants will review basic asthma topics in a didactic session and will include exercising with asthma and exercise-induced asthma. Participants will be given Fitbit and provided instructions on how to use it. Participants may receive 2 newsletters with information on asthma and reminder texts regarding data collection visits.
Data will be collected at 3 time points: baseline, post-adoptive phase and post-maintenance phase.</description>
