  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge of the evolution of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its long-term prognostic factors is
      essential to guide the therapeutic management. However, it remains partial and concerns above
      all data collected during the first years of the disease. The evolution towards disability
      can only be assessed after a follow-up of more than 10 years and does not depend solely on
      the initial inflammatory activity of the disease. We propose to realize a standardized
      clinical assessment, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) and a cerebral MRI 15 years after
      the first clinical manifestation of the disease.

      Clinical and paraclinical assessment will consist in the realization of additional MRI
      sequences in order to obtain more precise information on cerebral lesions (unconventional
      parameters). Optical coherence tomography (new generation device) will also be performed on
      both eyes to describe the thickness of the different layers of the retina. A clinical
      evaluation will be performed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).

      This study aims:

        1. to describe the current clinical situation of patients (e.g. percentage of patients with
           moderate or severe disability)

        2. to explore the associations between MRI parameters, those measured with OCT and clinical
           characteristics (disability)

        3. to explore clinical and paraclinical prognostic factors of pejorative evolution
           (disability, severe cerebral atrophy, etc.)

    <description>Disability assessment will be carried out using the EDS (Expanded Disability Status) Scale.
This scale ranges from 0 to 10. Binary or ordered variables will be considered with various thresholds (for example, a score equal to 3 corresponds to moderate disorders ; a score equal to 6 corresponds to major disorders (need of a stick to walk 100 meters)).</description>

Paraclinical evaluation consists in the realization of additional MRI sequences in order to obtain more precise information on brain lesions (unconventional parameters).
