  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well Walking for Recovery from Surgery works in
      improving quality of life in older adults with lung or gastrointestinal cancer and their
      family caregivers. A walking program, such as Walking for Recovery from Surgery may help
      support overall well-being as a caregiver, and may help improve family member or friend's
      recovery from surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine whether the intervention and telehealth approach would be feasible and
      acceptable.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine patient outcome patterns suggesting the potential efficacy of the intervention
      on self-efficacy, functional status (daily steps, 6-minute walk time, timed up and go),
      psychological distress, symptoms, and global health status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and caregivers receive Walking for Recovery from Surgery prehabilitation
      intervention in 4 sessions 3-7 days before surgery, before discharge, and at 2 and 7 days
      post-discharge.

      After completion of study, patients and caregivers are followed up for 2 months.
