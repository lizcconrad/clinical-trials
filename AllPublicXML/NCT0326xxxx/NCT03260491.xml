  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

      The primary objectives are:

        -  For Dose Escalation, to assess the safety and tolerability of U3-1402 in the study
           population and to determine the recommended dose for expansion of U3-1402 in the study
           population

        -  For Dose Expansion, to assess the safety and tolerability of U3-1402 in the study
           population

      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants will continue study
      treatment for 36 months unless they decide not to (withdraw consent), their disease gets
      worse [progressive disease (PD)], or side effects become unacceptable (unacceptable toxicity)
      or other stopping reasons have been met.

             risk of arrhythmic events, such as congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long
             QT syndrome, or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first-degree
             relatives.
