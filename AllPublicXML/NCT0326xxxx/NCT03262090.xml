  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation/delirium (EA/ED) is a common complication in pediatric surgery patients,
      which increases the risk of developing postoperative airway obstruction and respiratory
      depression. In infants, there is a high incidence of emergence agitation (EA) after
      desoflurane anesthesia. The aim of the present preliminary study was to determine the safety
      and efficacy of of intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine (DEX) that would prevent
      postoperative EA and ED in children undergoing day surgery with desoflurane anesthesia

      subjects who underwent day surgery were stratified into two age groups as follows: low to 3
      years group, and 3-12 years group. Then they were randomly assigned to receive one of six
      doses of intravenous dexmedetomidine: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 ,1.0ug/kg before skin incision.
