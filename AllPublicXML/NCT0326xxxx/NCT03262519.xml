  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an extremely common disease with inadequately explored
      neurocognitive consequences. The investigators will study OSA patients before and after
      treatment to understand how OSA changes decision making abilities, and whether treatment can
      reverse such cognitive changes. These results could provide deeper insight into how OSA
      affects decision making either temporarily or permanently, and provide another rationale or
      motivation for treatment of OSA in adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that OSA will lead to (H1) more reward-seeking and lower
      payoffs in the Iowa Gambling task, replicating previous findings; (H2) greater discounting of
      future rewards in financial choices; and (H3) these effects would dissipate when OSA is
      successfully treated.

      In order to test these hypotheses, the investigators will perform cognitive tests (Iowa
      gambling; intertemporal choice; other measures) in 100 patients about to undergo sleep
      testing. It is expected that of these 100 patients, some will have no sleep apnea; some will
      have sleep apnea and will be successfully treated; and that some will have sleep apnea but
      will not be successfully treated by the time of repeat testing. The investigators will repeat
      testing using the same instruments 2 months later.

      Thus the investigators will be able to compare whether OSA patients differ from control at
      baseline (t1), and whether OSA patients' performance will improve after treatment at t2,
      compared to the control at t2.

    <measure>Change in Iowa Gambling Task</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (baseline, 2 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa Gambling Task is a psychological task thought to simulate real-life decision making. It is completed on a computer and takes about 10 minutes. It is widely used in research on cognition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (baseline, 2 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is a task designed to measure a person's tendency to override an incorrect &quot;gut&quot; response and engage in further reflection to find a correct answer. It takes about 3 minutes to complete.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Intertemporal Choice</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (baseline, 2 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>Intertemporal choice is the study of how people make choices about what and how much to do at various points in time, when choices at one time influence the possibilities available at other points in time. These choices are influenced by the relative value people assign to two or more payoffs at different points in time. It takes about 3 minutes to complete.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (baseline, 2 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is a computerized measure of risk taking behavior. The BART models real-world risk behavior through the conceptual frame of balancing the potential for reward versus loss. It takes less than 2 minute to complete.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects aged 18-75 referred to the UCSD Sleep clinic for either home or in-laboratory
        testing will be considered for inclusion in the study. Inclusion will not depend on gender,
        race or ethnicity, as per the following:

          1. 100 participants will be enrolled at the UCSD Sleep Clinic at Chancellor Park.

          2. Ages 18-75

          3. Gender: Men and woman

          4. Ethnic background: All

          5. Health Status: to the UCSD Sleep clinic for either home or in-laboratory testing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing CPAP treatment for OSA

          2. Inability to use a tablet device (e.g. no reading glasses, or unfamiliar with
             devices).

          3. Severe cardiopulmonary disorder that requires treatment with supplemental oxygen
             therapy.

          4. Inability to speak English fluently, as some of the questionnaires/tests are only
             validated in English.
