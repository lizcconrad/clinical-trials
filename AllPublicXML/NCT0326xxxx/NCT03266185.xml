  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is one of the most distressing side effects for patients.
      Scalp cooling can prevent or minimise CIA in approximately half of all patients, depending on
      many factors, e.g. type and dosage of chemotherapy. High rates of success are seen in
      patients treated with taxanes, up to 80-90%. Previous research has shown comparable results
      of scalp cooling in docetaxel-treated patients when shortening the post-infusion cooling time
      (PICT) from the initial standard of 90 minutes to 45- and 20 minutes. A shorter PICT is an
      advantage for both the patient, who can spend less time in the hospital, as well for the
      logistics at oncological departments. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are both classical taxanes,
      that share similar mechanisms of action and have comparable plasma terminal half-life times,
      therefore it seems plausible that the PICT can be shortened for paclitaxel-treated patients
      as well.
