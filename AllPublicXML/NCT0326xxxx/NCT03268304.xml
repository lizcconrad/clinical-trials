      Introduction: In the recent past, medical training systems using virtual reality (VR) have
      been introduced to neurorehabilitation to train motor function deficits in patients. The
      usage of VR-based training systems is based on the evidence of neuroplasticity, which is
      responsible for recovery of patients suffering from motor dysfunction. Such systems are
      increasingly used to encourage purposeful limb movements in a VR environment and its efficacy
      has been found comparable with conventional therapeutic intervention. VR training systems,
      e.g. the YouGrabber® (YG), will increasingly also be used at home. Therefore, it is essential
      to integrate valid and reliable assessment tools to monitor the recovery process.

      Objectives: The aim of the clinical study is to evaluate the usability, feasibility and
      validity of the digital version of the ActionResearchArmTest (d-ARAT) using the YG system as
      a platform. Additionally, the feasibility and usability of the implementation of two
      rehabilitation measures that only recently became integral part of neurorehabilitation, e.g.
      Action Observation (AO) and Motor Imagery (MI), into the YG training software will be
      evaluated. Patients &amp; methods: This observational study is designed as a single-arm trial for
      testing the assessment software including pre- to post rehabilitation comparison of a
      training involving AO and MI. Therefore, 75 adult patients with Parkinson's disease, MS,
      Stroke, traumatic brain injury or Guillain-Barré syndrome will be included. 30 out of the 75
      patients will take part in the 4-week training on the enhanced VR-based system with a total
      of 16 training sessions of 45 min each. Primary outcomes will be the score on the System
      Usability Scale (SUS) and the ARAT as well as the d-ARAT scores. Secondary outcomes will be
      hand dexterity (Box-and-Block Test), upper limb activities of daily living (CAHAI) and
      quality of life (EQ-5D-5L).

      Hypothesis: The study was designed to evaluate the d-ARAT and the training software modules
      for the YG system. Currently AO and MI specific tasks are being integrated and the ARAT
      subscales will be implemented on the basis of the redesigned glove equipped with new sensors.
      The results are expected to give recommendations for necessary modifications. They might also
      contribute knowledge concerning the application of AO and MI tasks within VR training.

        1. Patients will be recruited from the clinics' inpatient or outpatient departments by
             physicians, therapists and nurses.

          2. Patients will be recruited from the clinics' patient database. Datasets will be
             screened for study selection criteria by the involved study personnel. If patients are
             eligible, they will be sent a letter describing the study and including patient
             information. If patients are interested in participating, they can contact the study
             personnel in the clinic by phone or email.

          3. Patients will be recruited via a study information flyer provided on the clinic's
             homepage and through patient self-help groups. If patients are interested in
             participating, they can contact the study personnel in the responsible clinic by phone
             or email.
