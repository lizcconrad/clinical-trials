  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839
      and how well it works with panitumumab and irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with
      RAS wildtype colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body and does not
      respond to treatment. Glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      panitumumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Giving glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 with panitumumab and irinotecan
      hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with colorectal cancer.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective of Phase I:

      • Determine the safety and tolerability of CB-839 in combination with panitumumab and
      irinotecan.

      Primary Objective of Phase II:

      • Determine the efficacy of CB-839 in combination with panitumumab and irinotecan as measured
      by the response rate (RR) in patients with previously EGFR treated RAS wildtype colorectal
      adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives of Phase II:

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839.

      Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28,
      panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, and irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.

        -  Determine the disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall
           survival (OS).

        -  Perform the following correlative studies (in the Phase II component):

             -  Correlate radiological features of pre- and post-treatment 18F-FSPG PET/CT with
                clinical outcome and biological correlates (plasma glutamate levels, exosomes)

             -  Quantify exosomal content in the plasma.
