  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of different frequencies in treating the
      moderate and severe acne vulgaris using acupuncture combined with moving cupping and ear
      point tapping.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease, especially in adolescents and young
      adults. Acne affects approximately 85% of teenagers, but can occur in most age groups and can
      persist into adulthood. There is no mortality associated with acne, but there is often
      significant physical and psychological morbidity. Acupuncture combined with moving cupping
      and ear point tapping may effectively relieve the skin lesions, but the evidence is limited.
      Also, young patients usually have no time to see the doctor frequently, thus it's necessary
      to figure out a better frequency of treating.

    <description>VAS uses a 100-mm line that is labeled at each end, and 0 mm represents no itch, and 100 mm represents unbearable itch. Patients will rate the VAS (average VAS of facial itch in the past 24 hours), and a researcher will record the VAS once weekly, generally at the third weekly treatment. The mean weekly VAS of itch over weeks 1-6 will be calculated as the sum VAS of each week divided by the number of weeks assessed.</description>

    <description>Skindex-16 is a dermatologic quality-of-life survey. There are 16 questions in this survey. It concerns the skin condition which has bothered the patient the most during the past week. This survey calculated from 3 aspects including symptoms, emotions and functions. The score of each question is 0 to 6 points, and multiply by 16.6667，and get the sum of 16 questions' score. The average of the sum of 16 questions' score is the final result of skindex-16 dermatology survey. When the score is higher, it means the disease has greater influence on the patient.</description>
