      In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the incidence of vena cava inferior
      diamater on ultrasound guidance of intravascular volume before diagnosis of contrast

      - enhanced CT for diagnostic purposes in ileus patients and to investigate the incidence and
      risk of developing contrast nephropathy due to contrast - enhanced CT.

      Our work will be carried out in Kocaeli Derince Education and Research Hospital Emergency
      Service. Patients who are scheduled to receive abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT)
      scans in the emergency room, who are over 18 years of age, who are referred to Kocaeli
      Derince Education and Research Hospital Emergency Department for the study, will be
      calculated and recorded. The Mehran risk scores will be calculated and recorded in our
      clinic. 3 ml / kg IV physiological saline (SF) is applied first and then 1 ml / kg / hr IV SF
      is applied for at least 6 hours after shots. In addition, patients with contrasted abdominal
      CT underwent emergency surveillance ultrasound imaging (including the measurement of the vena
      cava diameter for evaluation of the patient's volume status). Patients who were admitted to
      our general surgery and not followed up for at least 48 hours, patients with contrast
      allergies, patients with renal replacement therapy, pregnancies, patients with
      contrast-enhanced CT scans within the last 10 days, and patients not informed will not be
      taken to the study. All Emergency Physicians will be informed about the study. Less than 100
      mL of hypoosmolar, non-ionic contrast material will be used for all CT shots. Patients will
      be evaluated for the development of contrast nephropathy according to biochemical assays
      48-72 hours after CT acquisition. Physicians evaluating patients in the emergency and general
      surgery services will be required to record blood tests that they consider necessary for
      diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and no extra blood will be collected for use in the
      study.

    <description>Place the patient in the supine position. The degree of elevation of the head of the bed has not been shown to make a significant difference in measurements. The diameter of the IVC for calculation of the caval index should be measured 2 cm from where it enters the right atrium .An alternative way to visualize respiratory variation is to use M-mode, with the beam overlying the IVC 2 cm from the right atrium.The inspiratory and expiratory diameter can then be measured on the M-mode image, at the smallest and largest locations, respectively.</description>
