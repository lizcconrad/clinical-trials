  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6th most common cancer in the world but the 2nd most
      important cause of cancer death. Because of its highly heterogeneous nature, the current
      approach to identifying druggable targets have not delivered efficacious therapies in HCC and
      is a main reason for the high case fatality. Even when surgical resection is potentially
      curative in early disease, tumor recurrence remains high and long term survival poor because
      of the absence of useful adjuvant therapy.

      To address these unmet needs, the investigators bring together internationally recognized
      scientists from genomics and immunology and established clinician investigators in a
      synergistic team. This TCR capitalizes on recent collaborative advances made by the PIs in
      the consortium. The investigators have shown through multi-region sampling of freshly
      resected HCC and phylogenetic analysis, that significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity exists
      and have identified the specific positions of known clonal drivers. Simultaneously the
      investigators have analyzed the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment with deep
      immune-phenotyping and found unique inter-patient immune landscapes predictive of clinical
      trajectory.

      This TCR is a prospective study that samples resected HCC from multi-ethnic sites within the
      established Asia-Pacific Hepatocellular Carcinoma (AHCC) Trials Group, which has enrolled
      approximately 1000 patients through 6 multi-center trials in 35 centers in the region.
      Clinical trajectories are tracked and genomic and immunological studies are repeated when
      tumors recu r, to confirm clonally dominant driver mutations and immunological processes that
      are targetable. Concurrently, representative pre-clinical models will be developed from the
      tissues sampled.

      The investigators aim to combine these approaches to overcome the challenges posed by genomic
      heterogeneity and to guide the development of therapeutics and precision medicine in HCC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients, 21 to 80 years of age at the time of signature of the
             informed consent form.

          2. Histologically proven HCC after liver resection. Combined
             hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma can be included.

          3. HCC limited to the liver with no extra-hepatic metastasis on CT or MRI of the abdomen
             and chest (defined as lymph node &lt;2 cm, lung nodules &lt; 1 cm, farther lymph nodes &lt; 2
             cm) according to the AASLD criteria65.

          4. R0 or R1 resection on histology.

          5. Eligibility according to tumour size:

               1. Large tumour &gt;= 5 cm (preferred)

               2. Smaller tumours &gt;=2cm and &lt; 5cm

               3. Multifocal tumours - maximum of 3 total tumours with size &gt;=2cm detected from
                  CT-scan. Detection of &lt;1cm tumour intra-operatively or upon histologic
                  examination following resection can be ignored. For multiple satellite nodules
                  (&gt;=2cm) that are detected intraoperatively, harvest ALL satellite nodules (&gt;/=
                  2cm). DNA/RNA will be extracted from cases confirmed to be
                  HCC/hepato-cholangiocarcinoma by histology. A MAXIMUM of 3 samples with the best
                  quality are to be used for the analysis.

          6. Child-Pugh ≤ 7 points without clinical ascites before surgery.

          7. ECOG performance status 0-1 before surgery.

          8. Scheduled for liver resection within 6 weeks.

          9. The patient has received no anti-cancer specific treatment for HCC eg. previous liver
             resection, loco-regional therapy (e.g. RFA, TACE, SIRT), radiotherapy, immunotherapy,
             chemotherapy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy other than the planned surgery. However,
             patient who has received previous HCC resection more than 5 years ago is deemed to
             have a de-novo liver tumour and therefore can be included.

         10. Adequate bone-marrow reserve, renal function and hepatic function as assessed by
             standard laboratory criteria:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L

               -  INR ≤ 2.0

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

               -  Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the ULN

          1. Single lesion &lt; 2 cm at the time of tumour resection.

          2. The patient has previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites, except
             effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
             effectively treated malignancy that has been in remission for over 5 years and highly
             likely to have been cured.

          3. Encephalopathy

          4. The patient has received a major organ allograft.

          5. The patient is known to be positive for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          6. The patient has an uncontrolled bleeding disorder.

          7. The patient has uncontrolled congestive heart failure or hypertension, unstable heart
             disease (coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction) or uncontrolled arrhythmia
             at the time of enrolment.

          8. The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability
             to give informed consent, or to comply with the study procedures.

          9. The patient has other concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy,
             that would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to
             unacceptable risk.

         10. The patient has received any investigational or non-registered medicinal product (drug
             or vaccine) within the 30 days preceding the date of enrolment, or plans to receive
             such a drug during the study period.

         11. For female patients: the patient is pregnant or lactating.

         12. Insufficient DNA/RNA for genome analysis at baseline

         13. Insufficient cells for immunology analysis at baseline (Singapore sites only)
