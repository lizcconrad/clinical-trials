  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) amongst elderly patient group is continuously
      increasing with population aging progressing. Mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is a common
      complication caused by ESRD, it raises the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in
      hemodialysis patients, as well as mortality.

      Joint effects of Kidney failure and aging on elderly hemodialysis patients make the
      contribution factors of CKD-MBD quite complex, and it also leads to differences in clinic
      manifestation between elderly hemodialysis patients and non-elderly hemodialysis patients.
      Since not much studies had been done for this specific subject, thus, research on elderly
      patients who is taking Maintenance hemodialysis is very necessary. This study is a
      retrospective research to identify optimized target value of Calcium and Phosphorus for
      elderly patients taking maintenance hemodialysis and hence provide guidance for clinical
      practices. The data for this study will be provided by Beijing Blood Purification Quality
      Control and Improvement Center. Clinical files and Calcium and Phosphorus metabolic indices
      will be collected amongst elderly patients who were elder than 65 years and was taking
      maintenance hemodialysis between Jan 1st, 2012 through Dec 31st, 2016. Relationship between
      Calcium level, Phosphorus level, iPTH index, all-cause mortality and CVD caused mortality
      will be analyzed to identify optimized range of target Calcium levels, Phosphorus level for
      hemodialysis treatment
