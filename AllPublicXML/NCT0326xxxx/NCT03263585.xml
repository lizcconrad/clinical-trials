    <textblock>
      Background: Back pain and osteoporosis with vertebral fractures are common conditions in
      elderly women and significantly affect their quality of life. A common complication of
      osteoporosis are vertebral fractures. Treatment with bone-specific drugs does often not help
      the pain condition caused by the vertebral fractures even when the progress of the disease
      has decreased. Vertebral fractures often result in deformation of the spine and poorer
      quality of life of the individual. The spinal kyphosis also affects the lung function and the
      effect of the kyphosis itself is severe. Alternative treatments of back pain may lead to
      reduced drug demand for pain. Physical activity is one of the most important factors that
      regulates bone mass and can also affect balance and fall risk positively. The back orthosis
      that we intend to use in the treatment study has been shown in some previous scientific
      studies to strengthen the muscles in the back and also decrease the pain.

      Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of treatment of back pain in
      elderly women with an activating functional orthosis versus treatment with a group of
      physiotherapeutic tools and a control group for a six-month treatment period and follow-up
      after 12 months from the start of study. The aim was also to study elderly women with
      osteoporosis and back pain in a follow-up study of a cohort of women at high risk of
      osteoporotic fractures, with focus on back pain, functional capacity and quality of life.

      The aim was to study the effect of treatment with activating functional orthosis versus
      physiotherapeutic treatment in a group and a control group without treatment. The main
      outcomes will be the experienced perceived back pain and back extensor strength. Additional
      outcomes will be quality of life, balance, lung function and kyphosis. Biochemical markers
      for pain will be measured in the RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial).

      Significance: Evaluation of alternative treatment methods such as exercise by a
      physiotherapist and treatment with a functional orthosis will give new additional treatment
      options for our patients. An activating functional orthosis could reduce the use of
      analgesics and increase the quality of life of the affected women.

      The aims: 1. Identification in a population-based cohort of elderly women the occurrence of
      vertebral fractures, back pain and their impact on quality of life.

      2. To study the effect of treatment with a functional activating orthotic and physiotherapy
      in an equipment training group, both in comparison with a control group, on the perceived
      pain, back extensor muscle strength, quality of life, balance and incidence of falls, lung
      function and kyphosis.

      3. Qualitative study of how participants experienced treatment and exercise in an activating
      orthotic. The investigators hypothesis was that a functional orthotic could be a
      complementary treatment method that could reduce the use of analgesics and increase the
      quality of life.

      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of treatment of back pain in elderly
      women with an activating spinal orthotic versus treatment with a physiotherapy equipment
      training group and a control group for a six-month treatment period and a follow-up six
      months after the end of treatment. The aim was also to identify the occurrence of vertebral
      fractures in a cohort of elderly women and to investigate their perceived quality of life.

      Background: Osteoporosis is a condition in the skeleton that is characterized by reduced bone
      density and an increased risk of fractures [1]. Back pain and osteoporosis with vertebral
      fractures are common conditions in elderly women that significantly affect their quality of
      life. Vertebral fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture [2]. Vertebral
      fractures are underdiagnosed and are a major problem. It is estimated that only one third of
      vertebral fractures are clinically detected [3]. The lifetime risk for a Swedish
      postmenopausal woman to get a clinically detected vertebral fracture is approximately 15%
      [4].

      In the acute phase, a vertebral fracture is very painful and in the aftermath the vertebral
      fracture often leads to chronic back pain, increased kyphosis mainly located to the thoracic
      and lumbar spine, reduction in body height and impaired lung function. There exists a
      correlation between increased kyphosis and increased risk of falls [5]. Vertebral fractures
      can affect important daily activities and provide a lower health-related quality of life
      [6-8].

      Treatment with bone-specific drugs does not relieve the back pain caused by the vertebral
      fractures despite improvement in the state of the disease. The kyphosis also affects lung
      function, and the effects of the kyphosis itself have previously been considered as very
      severe.

      An important part in the treatment of patients with osteoporosis is physical therapy with an
      equipment training group. The goal is to maintain or increase mobility, strength and balance
      that can improve health-related quality of life and prevent fractures. Training of the back
      extensor muscles have shown to have a positive impact on health-related quality of life,
      reduce back pain, and training could also affect fear of falling positively [5, 9].

      A German randomized controlled study from 2004 and one from 2011 has shown a positive effect
      of treatment with an activating spinal orthotic on body posture, back extensor muscular
      strength and quality of life in elderly women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures [10,
      11]. It was shown that wearing the spinal orthotic, back extensor muscle strength was
      increased through biofeedback. Training with the spinal orthotic also resulted in a
      significant decrease of the kyphosis, which also affected lung function and body height
      positively.

      The investigators now intend, in a randomized controlled study, to compare training in an
      activating spinal orthotic with training in an equipment training group, led by a
      physiotherapist, to see if positive results can be obtained in reduced back pain, increased
      muscle strength in back extensor muscle, increasing mobility, and decreased kyphosis in the
      thoracic and lumbar spine. It can also lead to improved lung capacity, and further increased
      health-related quality of life. If the training method in the activating spinal orthotic
      appears to work, it would improve the possibilities to train and treat patients with
      osteoporosis, vertebral fractures and back pain.

      Design A. A cross-sectional study of cohort elderly women regarding the occurrence of
      vertebral fractures and their impact on health related quality of life and back pain.

      B. A randomized controlled study where the effect of treatment with an activating spinal
      orthotic is compared with training in an equipment training group led by a physiotherapist
      and with an untreated control group for a six-month treatment period and a follow-up six
      months after the end of the treatment period.

      C. A qualitative study with interviews in focus groups were the participating women may
      describe their experiences of training in an activating spinal orthotic and how they
      experience health related quality of life during the treatment period.

      Methods Cross-sectional study All 186 women who participated in the follow-up study of the
      Primos project, a population-based cohort study in Stockholm were invited to participate in
      the current study [12-15]. All these women have been re-examined clinically in a longitudinal
      follow-up study with bone density measurements of the hip, lumbar spine, whole body and heel,
      clinical risk markers for osteoporosis and metabolic disease, nutritional status and a
      balance tests in 2007-2009.

      Women interested in participating in the study got an invitation to a study visit. During the
      study visit, written and oral information about the study was being given and then the women
      signed an informed consent.
