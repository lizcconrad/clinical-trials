  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this single patient study is to assess the safety and efficacy of
      setmelanotide as a treatment of severe metabolic abnormalities resulting from LD, especially
      refractory hypertriglyceridemia leading to recurrent bouts of pancreatitis.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-patient study to assess the safety and efficacy of setmelanotide in a unique
      patient with partal LD and severe metabolic abnormalities, most notably refractory
      hypertriglyceridemia leading to recurrent pancreatitis despite ongoing plasmapheresis
      treatment.

          3. Has physician-confirmed partial lipodystrophy and the following characteristics:

               -  Has atypical lipodystrophy.

               -  Has presence of neutralizing antibody to metreleptin

               -  Patient has life threatening hypertriglyceridemia and has had &gt;8 episodes of
                  pancreatitis, requiring weekly plasmapaheresis

               -  Has Type 1 diabetes melltus with HbA1c &gt; 10%. Age and Reproductive Status

          4. Female, under the the age of 18 years â€¢ The patient has primary amenorrhea at this
             time

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder or other
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) disorders that the
             investigator believes will interfere significantly with study compliance.
             Neurocognitive disorders affecting ability to consent will not be disqualifying as
             long as an appropriate guardian able to give consent has been appointed.

             2. History or close family history (parents or siblings) of skin cancer or melanoma,
             or patient history of ocular-cutaneous albinism.

             3. Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre-melanoma skin
             lesions, determined as part of a screening comprehensive skin evaluation performed by
             a qualified dermatologist. Any concerning lesions identified during the screening
             period will be biopsied and results known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the
             pre-treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient may need to be excluded from
             the study.

             4. Significant hypersensitivity to study drug. 5. Inability to comply with QD
             injection regimen.
