  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of chronic conditions is a challenge for health systems worldwide,
      particularly in the context of an aging population, and requires urgent improvement of health
      services. Integrated care and patient empowerment represent promising solutions: offering
      tailored self-management support in a collaborative framework led to good results in several
      clinical contexts. Yet, large scale implementation remains a challenge. An important
      limitation of existing solutions is a lack of utilization of behavioural and communication
      theory for identifying the dynamics of pluridisciplinary collaboration and the interactive
      effects of the activities performed by several actors involved in self-management support in
      a given chronic condition. A second limitation is not involving all relevant actors in the
      development of health service improvement solutions, which leads to limited programme
      adoption and sustainability in routine care.

      This study is part of a project that proposes to address these limitations and develop and
      interdisciplinary model of collaborative care in the self-management of chronic conditions
      (CoSMaS) that adopts a community-based participative approach. CoSMaS-ql is a qualitative
      study that will consist of semi-structured interviews with several types of stakeholders:
      patients, caregivers, and health care professionals of different specialties (e.g. general
      practitioners, nurses, specialist consultants, pharmacists). The main objective of the study
      is to explore the experiences and of patients, caregivers, and HCPs on how self-management
      support is currently delivered in asthma, cancer and stroke (content, communication,
      organisation of care), their needs related to self-management support provision, and
      envisaged solutions for improving current practice. Three different chronic conditions will
      be targeted: asthma, breast cancer and stroke. The qualitative data will be analysed via
      grounded-theory and template analysis. It will inform the development of a theoretical model
      of collaborative self-management support in chronic conditions. It will also result in three
      profiles describing 'real' versus 'ideal' care processes, which will represent needs
      assessment stages for future health services improvement interventions in the three
      conditions.

    <description>Interviews will be semi-structured and follow a topic guide designed to explore participants' goals, behaviours and determinants, perceptions of others' goals and behaviours, communication processes, tools used in self-management, support, and communication, and their vision on optimal processes and ways to implement them. Caregivers will be interviewed separately on their experiences of caregiving and self-management support by HCPs. HCPs will be interviewed regarding their experiences of providing care in one or more of the 3 chronic conditions (depending on their experience and time constraints) and their thoughts on collaborating with other professionals and solutions for integrated care and ensuring continuity of care.</description>
