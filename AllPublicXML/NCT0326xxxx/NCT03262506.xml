  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that computerized cognitive training can improve cognition in healthy older
      adults and in people at risk of developing dementia, although an effective model to implement
      the training in the daily life of people and to ensure engagement is missing. This project
      studies the adherence, engagement and progress on computerized cognitive training exercises
      that were offered by the Association of Retirees from the Telecommunications (ASASTEL) to its
      associates. One hundred subjects in three different cities (Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte
      and Brasilia) received licenses to perform the exercises on line and were followed by a team
      of psychologists. We will evaluate adherence, engagement and progress on the computerized
      cognitive training exercises of those subjects.

    <description>The cognitive training program consists of a set of computerized exercises designed to improve the speed and accuracy of auditory information processing while engaging neuromodulatory systems involved in attention and reward. These exercises continuously adjust the difficulty level to user performance to maintain an approximately 85% rate of correct responses. Trials with correct responses are rewarded with points and animations.</description>
