  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) ambitious goal for at least 90% of clinical decisions to be
      evidence-based includes nursing interventions and practice. Models and frameworks have been
      developed to meet the demand for practice transformation. While magnet facilities require a
      commitment to evidence-based nursing practice, military facilities currently lack such a
      requirement but are instituting evidence-based practice (EBP) initiatives in a purposeful
      path toward developing high-reliability organizations. Currently, little is known regarding
      the effectiveness of specific EBP models and frameworks within the military culture. The
      purpose of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of the Advancing Research and
      Clinical Practice through Close Collaboration (ARCC) model in an Air Force Medical Treatment
      Facility (MTF) beginning with nursing services.

      Research questions:

        1. What is the current state of organizational culture and readiness for EBP within the
           MTF's nursing services?

        2. Will utilization of the ARCC model significantly improve EBP beliefs, knowledge, and
           practice in MTF nurses over a two-year period?

        3. Is the ARCC model feasible for implementation in Air Force MTF's?

      This study includes an intervention group (n=70) of active duty nurses and technicians who
      attend an intensive 5-day EBP Immersion Workshop and a control group (n=70) who do not. The
      intervention group will have access to specialized resources such as: a) Center for
      Transdisciplinary Evidence-Based Practice (CTEP) expert EBP mentors, b) EBP toolkit and
      resources, c) one year of free access to the Ohio State University (OSU) virtual library.
      Control group participants will have standard MTF education opportunities. Established valid
      and reliable survey measures (EBP attitudes, knowledge, beliefs) will be hosted
      electronically by CTEP at baseline, three, and twelve months. Online measures include
      institutional and nursing process measures (EBP implementation, policy changes, and
      publications) over the two-year study period. De-identified data from the anonymous survey
      measures will be shared by CTEP with this study team. Data analysis will include T-tests or
      Mann Whitney U test for group comparisons. Repeated measures ANOVA or the nonparametric
      equivalent, Friedman's test will be used to compare three time points within groups.
      Feasibility metrics and demographics will be reported with descriptive statistics.

    <measure>Organizational Culture &amp; Readiness for System-Wide Implementation of EBP Scale (OCRSIEP) changes over time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 3, month 12</time_frame>
    <description>25-item assessment of organizational readiness and perceived strengths and barriers for EBP implementation. A 5-point Likert scale with, 1 (not at all) through 5 (very much) measures item response to questions focused on the extent that EBP is included in current organizational culture. For example, &quot;To what extend do you believe that EBP is practiced in your organization?&quot; Overall, the instrument measures the relationship between cultural factors and the organization's implementation of EBP over a 6-month time frame. Validity is reported with content and face validity and internal consistency reliabilities greater than 0.85</description>

    <measure>Evidence-Based Practice Beliefs (EBPB) Scale changes over time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 3, month 12</time_frame>
    <description>16-item assessment of an individual's beliefs regarding the value of EBP and capability for EBP implementation in clinical nursing practice. A 5-point Likert scale with, 1 (strongly disagree) through 5 (strongly agree) measures item response to statements about EBP, such as: &quot;I believe EBP takes too much time&quot;… &quot;I am clear about the steps of EBP.&quot; It is anticipated, based on the results of several studies, that higher scores on the EBPB scale are associated with greater implementation of EBP and better healthcare outcomes. Validity is reported with content and face validity as well as internal consistency reliabilities greater than 0.85.</description>

    <measure>Evidence-Based Practice Implementation (EBPI) Scale changes over time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 3, month 12</time_frame>
    <description>18-item instrument to measure the extent to which healthcare workers integrate scientific evidence in their clinical practice. A 5-point ordinal scale with frequencies listed from 0 times (0 pt.), 1-3 times (1 pt.), 4-5 times (2 pt.), 6-7 times (3 pt.) and &gt; 8 times (4 pt.) is used to assess how often each item has applied over the past 8 weeks. For example, how often have you: &quot;Used evidence to change my clinical practice…&quot;, &quot;Accessed the National Guidelines Clearinghouse…&quot; Total scores are summed where higher scores indicate greater integration of EBP in the healthcare workers practice. Validity is reported with content and face validity as well as internal consistency reliabilities greater than 0.85.</description>
