  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumors arising from the VIIIth Nerve (vestibulo-cochlear nerve) typically present with
      progressive unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. VIIIth Nerve tumors with documented growth
      on serial MRI scans typically lead to deafness in the affected ear over time. Radiation
      (Gamma KnifeÂ® or stereotactic radiosurgery) may preserve hearing in ~80% while surgery
      (middle cranial fossa or retrosigmoid approach) may preserve hearing in 16 - 40% of small
      tumors, although initial hearing preservation by both modalities may fail over time. Surgical
      resection via the translabyrinthine approach is the safest way to remove many of these
      tumors, but involves loss of all hearing. In all treatment modalities, the vascular supply
      (the labyrinthine artery, a terminal branch of AICA with no collaterals) to the cochlea is at
      risk. After devascularization, the cochlea frequently fills with fibrous tissue or ossifies
      (labyrinthitis ossificans), making it impossible to place a cochlear implant should it be
      required later. The incidence of this is 46% in our patients. This study seeks to determine
      the feasibility of preserving the cochlear duct with an obdurator so that patients undergoing
      translabyrinthine removal of VIIIth nerve tumors may retain the option of a cochlear implant
      at a later time.

    <description>This study uses a sterile dummy (i.e., not working) cochlear implant electrode inserted at the time of tumor removal to keep the inner ear from scarring or filling with bone. The significance of this to you is that if you ever become eligible for a cochlear implant sometime after surgery, it may be possible to remove the dummy and insert a functioning cochlear implant.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients of all ages with unilateral or bilateral acoustic neuromas who face loss of
             hearing in 1 ear from surgical removal via a translabyrinthine approach.

          -  patients do not meet criteria for conventional cochlear implantation or auditory
             brainstem implantation.

          -  tumor removal must allow preservation of the auditory division of the VIIIth cranial
             nerve.

          -  the patient must be willing to undergo preoperative S pneumococcus immunization
             protocol recommended by the US CDC immunization recommendations for cochlear implant
             patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  inability to preserve the auditory division of the VIIIth cranial nerve during tumor
             removal ossification or fibrosis of the cochlea found on preoperative imaging (CT or
             MRI) that precludes cochlear implantation.

          -  active middle ear disease.
