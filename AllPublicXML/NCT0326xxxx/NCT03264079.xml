  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study the impact of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) on the
      pharmacokinetics of bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) in healthy adult subjects.

      This is an open-label, fixed-sequence crossover pharmacokinetic (PK) study in healthy
      volunteers.

      Subjects will complete a screening visit within 28 days of Study Day 1. Subjects must qualify
      for the study based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. For Period 1, all qualified subjects
      shall receive a single oral dose of bardoxolone methyl (10 mg) on Day 1. For Period 2,
      following a washout of 14 days, itraconazole (SPORANOX®) capsules (100 mg) will be
      administered as a 200-mg single daily dose on Study Days 15 through 27, with bardoxolone
      methyl (10 mg) administered on Day 18 (1 hour after itraconazole administration).

      Bardoxolone methyl doses will be administered under fasted conditions. Itraconazole will be
      administered under fed conditions on Study Days 15-17, and Study Days 19-27.

      On study Day 18, itraconazole will be administered under fasted conditions. Subjects will be
      confined beginning on Study Day -1 through the last blood sample collection on Study Day 9
      during Period 1, and from Study Day 14 through the last PK blood draw on Study Day 28 during
      Period 2.
