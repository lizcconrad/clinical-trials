      This prospective, multicenter, observational study will examine the ability of real time
      electrogram processing mapping to identify driver domains to target for ablation in
      persistent AF patients.

      ABSTRACT: Recent clinical trials have shown that targeting rotors and focal impulses (FIs)
      during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation improves outcomes. This study evaluated whether a
      novel computational mapping algorithm (CMA) could identify FIs and rotors, and characterize
      rotors when incidental ablation resulted in rhythm changes. Three-dimensional (3D) left
      atrial electroanatomic maps were created from signals recorded from multipolar circular
      mapping catheters in 61 patients undergoing persistent AF ablation. Forty of 61acquired
      patient datasets were of adequate quality for analysis CMA, employing an AF pattern
      recognition algorithm, creating 3D panoramic AF maps identifying drivers of AF (FI and
      rotors) post procedure. Rotors were further classified as substrate (SBR) or non-substrate
      based (NSBR) on the basis of rotor stability, proximity to voltage transition zones and
      complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs). Incidentally ablated identified AF drivers,
      including SBRs and NSBRs, were evaluated for rhythm changes. A total of 172 drivers were
      identified in 40 patients (2.2 drivers/patient). Seventy percent were rotors (120/172) and
      30% were FIs (52/172). Sixty-seven percent of rotors were classified as SBR vs 33% as NSBR.
      Incidental ablation of SBRs resulted in rhythm change 91% of the time versus only 24% of the
      time for NSBR (p&lt;0.0001).

    <description>This software enables high resolution temporospatial mapping of atria for the identification of drivers of AF. CMA receives data from standard of care, commercially available 3D Mapping Systems (St. Jude Ensite System) and catheters and processes the data in a unique way. Electrogram and anatomy data are fed from the commercially available 3D Mapping System to an adjacent laptop computer, via an Ethernet connection, that is running CMA. CMA then processes the electrogram data and generates a map of where the potential AF driver domains are located and superimposes those potential AF driver domain targets onto the 3D geometry of the anatomy (provided by the 3D mapping system).</description>
