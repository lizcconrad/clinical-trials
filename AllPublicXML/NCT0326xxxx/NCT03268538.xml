    <textblock>
      Introduction: Chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD) is common condition in old age and
      the perception of hypoxia is often impaired in some COPD patients. Therefor it is need to
      monitor oxygen saturation in older people with COPD. A finger wearable device has been
      developed to measure oxygen saturation and heart rate variability. The investigators
      therefore will perform a cross sectional study to evaluate the clinical application of this
      finger wearable device in the detection and management of COPD in older people.

      Subject and method: 100 COPD subjects and 200 community dwelling older people without
      diagnosis of COPD will be recruited. Physical functioning and lung function test will be
      performed. Subjects will wear a finger wearable device to monitor heart rate variability and
      oxygen saturation and wear another wrist wearable device (Actigraph) to monitor physical
      activity and sleep for 6 days at the same time.

      Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis will be made to examine the potential association
      between oxygen saturation and physical activity and sleep, and the association between heart
      rate variability and physical activity and sleep.
