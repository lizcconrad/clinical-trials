    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of M5717 and
      to characterize the Pharmacokinetics /Pharmacodynamic relationship between M5717 PK and
      parasite clearance in healthy subjects following infection with Plasmodium falciparum.
