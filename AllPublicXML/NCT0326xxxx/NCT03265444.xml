      The purpose of conducting phase 1 trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells(CS10BR05) in subjects with Multiple
      System Atrophy.

      Evaluation of DLT by carotid artery(intra-arterial) injection according to dose-escalating in
      Multiple System Atrophy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system which is
      accompanied by signs of autonomic imbalance (orthostatic hypotension, urinary problems,
      erectile dysfunction), Parkinson's symptoms (movement decreases, limb tremors) and cerebellar
      ataxia symptoms (grogginess, pronounced incorrectly). It shows signs similar to Parkinson's
      disease, however, it doesn't show improvement of symptoms by dopaminergic drugs and occurs at
      any age.

      The clinical trial was designed as a single center, open-label, public phase 1 clinical
      trials.

      If that subject's written consent to participate in this clinical trial will be conducted the
      required examinations and tests in accordance with the study protocol.

      Then, the register for each dose step. For the final 3 subjects in the inclusion / exclusion
      criteria and be administered a drug test.

      And check the adverse events for more than four hours after administration of the
      investigational drug, and will determine whether the expression of adverse drug reaction(ADR)
      by the visit after 1 days, 14 days and 28 days.

      Except for dose administration, all subject are tested in the same schedule. As a result of
      evaluating severity of AE divided into subjective, objective in accordance with the CTCAE
      (Version 4.0) standards.
