  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are proposing a two-stage, prospective, cohort study of 138 subjects &gt; 28 days old and &lt;
      18 years old with respiratory distress, already getting a chest x-ray as part of their
      routine clinical care, who will get thermal pictures of their chest at the Massachusetts
      General Hospital (MGH) Emergency Department, Pediatric Wards, and Pediatric Intensive Care
      Unit. The thermal cameras will measure skin temperature, by taking a picture, in a
      non-contact way. We will recruit 138 patients using the FLIR ONE thermal imaging camera for
      iPhone and the newly designed irPNA application. The FLIR ONE thermal imaging camera will be
      attached to a study-designated iPhone which will only have the ability to take pictures. This
      phone will not have the capability to make calls or use the internet. The iPhone will be
      password protected, as encrypted by Partners regulations. Demographic and diagnostic data
      will be collected from patient charts.

      I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE

        1. Historical Background

           Every day 16,000 children under the age of 5-years die. Although strides have been made
           in early diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia, it still accounts for about 15% of deaths
           of children under 5-years (1). Unfortunately care providers in low- and middle-income
           countries (LMICs) are limited due to lack of resources and training. Chest x-rays are
           especially difficult to obtain in these LMICs (14). Ironically, smartphones are readily
           available. Since its development in 1960, Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras have
           made several technological strides. Notably they are now more affordable and compact,
           attaching to smartphones. FLIR cameras now have the potential to aid in early diagnosis
           and subsequent treatment of childhood pneumonia.

           FLIR imaging was first developed in 1956 with military funding at the University of
           Chicago. From the 1960s into the 1970s, FLIR technology was modified independently by
           both the Air Force and Texas Instruments Inc. for use by military planes (2). Wendell
           Smith first documented the use of thermal imaging in medical diagnosis in 1964. Smith
           required 6 minutes to take each thermograph of the horses he was studying (3). Multiple
           veterinary studies have been performed since then, and now thermal imaging has been
           validated as a means to assess musculoskeletal injuries in animals (4,5).

        2. Previous Clinical Studies Supporting the Proposed Research

           Interestingly, very few clinical studies have been performed to validate the use of
           thermal imaging in medical diagnosis for human diseases. The use of thermography to
           diagnose lung disease was studied in Russia in 1976, 1981, and 1991 in three separate
           studies, but these studies were neither controlled nor randomized (6-8). In 1970 Potanin
           demonstrated through a case series that patients with pneumonia had increased overlying
           chest temperatures and patients with pulmonary embolism had decreased overlying chest
           temperatures (12). The most recent and impactful study evaluating pneumonia with thermal
           imaging was a case series performed by Wiecek et al. (2001), which showed that patients
           with pneumonia demonstrated a reduction in thermographic signal as they positively
           responded to treatment (13). More modern studies have attempted to validate infrared
           thermal imaging in measuring the size of brain tumors intra-operatively (9), screening
           for fever in children (10), and predicting length of recuperation after burn injuries
           (11), among others. However, there has not been a modern study validating thermal
           imaging in diagnosing pneumonia.

        3. Rationale behind Proposed Research and Potential Benefit to Society

      Pneumonia is one of the primary contributors to under-five mortality worldwide. Imaging to
      support the diagnosis of pneumonia can be very difficult to obtain in resource-limited
      settings due to lack of equipment and trained staff. Easy-to-access imaging of pneumonia with
      thermal imaging technology may allow practitioners to diagnose pneumonia earlier and more
      accurately, which would lead to decreased morbidity and mortality. In LMICs where x-ray
      availability is already limited in peripheral centers, excessive use of these facilities can
      lead to consumption of limited medical resources. Validating thermal imaging in the diagnosis
      of pneumonia would likely lead to cost savings, and obviation of side effects of
      antimicrobials and excessive radiation.

      II. SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. To determine whether the FLIR ONE camera can be used to detect differences in a
           temperature spectrum that is clinically applicable. Temperature as measured by a
           temporal artery thermometer on hospitalized patients can vary from less than 96°
           Fahrenheit to over 104° Fahrenheit. The basis of the FLIR ONE camera and the irPNA
           application is to detect asymmetry of temperatures. We hope to demonstrate that this
           technology has the capability to demonstrate this difference.

        2. To validate thermal imaging with the FLIR ONE camera and irPNRA application as a
           sensitive modality to diagnose pneumonia. We hope to demonstrate that there are few
           false negatives when using this modality to diagnose pneumonia.

        3. To validate thermal imaging with the FLIR ONE camera and irPNRA application as a
           specific modality to differentiate pneumonia from other pulmonary processes, such as
           asthma, pulmonary embolism, and bronchiolitis. We hope to demonstrate that there are few
           false positives when using this modality to diagnose pneumonia.

           III. SUBJECT SELECTION:

             1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

                Inclusion criteria are 1) patients 28-days to 17-years of age, 2) who have
                respiratory distress, and 3) who receive a chest x-ray. We will exclude patients
                with known chronic lung disease.

             2. Source of Samples

           We will acquire consent from patients and parents in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit,
           (PICU) Pediatric Emergency Department (ED), and Pediatric Wards at the Massachusetts
           General Hospital

           IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT:

             1. Methods of Enrollment

                Trained clinical research staff will be present in the MGH PICU, pediatric wards,
                and ED and identify potential subjects through providers. Additionally, the EPIC
                electronic medical record system will be used by qualified research staff (research
                assistants, coordinators, managers) to electronically identify patients who may be
                potential candidates for the study. Subjects having a chest x-ray taken will be
                approached for study participation. This study will not interfere with the
                subject's medical care.

                If a patient appears to be eligible, the patient's provider will first approach the
                subject and ask if they are willing to be approached about a research study. If the
                potential subject declines, no further attempts will be made to enroll the subject.
                If the subject agrees to speak to someone about research, a study staff member will
                approach him or her about participation.

                Recruitment will not involve restrictions on socio-demographic factors including
                ethnic characteristics. Recruitment will be devoid of any procedures, which could
                be construed as coercive.

             2. Procedures for Obtaining Informed Consent

                At enrollment, in a private room, the investigator/designee will obtain written
                informed consent from participants' parent(s) or guardian for this study. During
                this encounter, s/he will remind participants that they are free to choose to take
                part in the research or not. We will use a General Consent Form for the
                parents/guardians of the patients. Children 14-17 can provide assent by co-signing
                the General Template consent form when able. We will obtain Assent from the
                subjects verbally, when possible.

             3. Treatment Assignment and Randomization

           Treatments or changes in the health care plan will not be made based on this research.

           V. STUDY PROCEDURES:

             1. Study Parameters to be Measured

                In addition to obtaining thermal images with the FLIR ONE camera, we will obtain
                several patient data points. These include 1) chief complaint, 2) temporal artery
                temperature, 3) cutaneous temperature, 4) ambient temperature, 5) respiratory rate,
                6) oxygen saturation, 7) chest x-ray results and relevant data, 8) discharge
                diagnosis, and 9) disposition. Additional chest x-rays will not be obtained, we
                will use x-rays already procured as part of the patient diagnosis and treatment
                approach and plan.

             2. Drugs to be Used

             3. Devices to be Used

                FLIR ONE camera, attached to an encrypted iPhone. We will also use the irPNRA
                application on the iPhone designed by research team member Jim Lewis to help direct
                the thermal imaging. The iPhone is encrypted by Partners regulations and cannot
                connect to a phone network or the Internet. The iPhone will remain in 'airplane
                mode' at all times. Biomed has already investigated and approved these devices.

             4. Procedures/Surgical Interventions

             5. Data to be Collected and when the Data is to be Collected

           We will obtain FLIR ONE thermal images within 4 hours of the subject's chest x-ray. We
           will also collect the following data: 1) chief complaint, 2) temporal artery
           temperature, 3) cutaneous temperature, 4) ambient temperature, 5) respiratory rate, 6)
           oxygen saturation, 7) chest x-ray results and relevant data, 8) discharge diagnosis, and
           9) disposition. The vitals will be obtained at the time nearest to the chest x-ray.

           Patient data will be collected prior to being de-identified. We will use the patient
           name and medical record number to access their chart in the EMR. Then the following data
           will be obtained from the chart: 1) chief complaint, 2) temporal artery temperature, 3)
           cutaneous temperature, 4) ambient temperature, 5) respiratory rate, 6) oxygen
           saturation, 7) chest x-ray results and relevant data, 8) discharge diagnosis, and 9)
           disposition. The x-rays will be obtained, uploaded to the LifeImage application,
           de-identified, and then sent to the radiologist on our research team with the
           appropriate study ID. The patient information will then be de-identified and replaced
           with a study ID.

           VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

             1. Specific Data Variables to be Collected

                We will collect the following variables from the patient chart: 1) chief complaint,
                2) temporal artery temperature, 3) cutaneous temperature, 4) ambient temperature,
                5) respiratory rate, 6) oxygen saturation, 7) chest x-ray results and relevant
                data, 8) discharge diagnosis, and 9) disposition.

                We will collect the following identifiers from the patient record prior to
                de-identifying them: 1) name, 2) DOB, 3) age, 4) gender, and 5) MRN.

                Interpretation of the x-rays will be blinded. The x-rays will be uploaded to
                LifeImage, de-identified, and then sent to the radiologist on our research team.
                The de-identified x-ray images will then be evaluated by the radiologist.

             2. Study Endpoints

                We will assess for temperature asymmetry with the FLIR ONE thermal camera with
                images taken of the chest. We will compare these results with the results of a
                chest x-ray taken within the last 12 hours.

             3. Statistical Methods

                We will compare chest x-ray results to FLIR ONE thermal imaging results. We will
                use sensitivity and specificity calculations based on the positive and negative
                results from those studies.

             4. Power Analysis

           Using the standard α = 0.05, sample size = 31, observed false positive (TI+|CXR-) rate
           =0.38 and the observed false negative (TI-|CXR+) rate = 0.20, the power (β-1) for the
           test applied to the overall population was calculated at 0.26. In order to achieve a
           power of 0.80 with the conditions encountered in this study, we would require 138
           patients.

           VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORT:

             1. Complications of Surgical/Non-Surgical Procedures

             2. Drug Side Effects and Toxins

             3. Device Complications and Malfunctions

                The FLIR ONE device is a thermal camera that attaches to an iPhone. Complications
                of the device will not affect the patient. If it malfunctions, we will fix or
                replace it.

             4. Psychosocial (non-medical) Risks

                The risk of loss of confidentiality will be minimized by using study IDs on study
                documentation to identify subjects. The list linking the study subjects to the
                study IDs will be kept in a secure location, with access limited only to staff
                directly involved with the research study.

             5. Radiation Risks

           There are no known radiation risks. As mentioned above, only x-rays obtained as part of
           the patient diagnostic and treatment plans will be used. No additional x-rays will be
           taken.

           VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS:

             1. Potential Benefits to Participating Individuals

                Participants will not receive any direct benefit from their participation in the
                study.

             2. Potential Benefits to Society

           Worldwide, pneumonia is one of the leading causes of mortality in children in the first
           5 years of life. In both developed countries and resource poor settings, detection of
           bacterial pathogens by culturing blood or other specimens is time consuming, lacks
           sensitivity and ranges from difficult in the U.S. to impossible in the developing world.
           In the U.S., the inability to determine which children have a bacterial infection
           results in excessive use of antibiotics and increased risk of infection with multi-drug
           resistant organisms. In the developing world, the consequences are delays in timely
           initiation of antibiotic therapy and excessive referral of children for hospitalization
           that overwhelms referral facilities. Regardless of setting, there is an urgent need for
           point of care diagnostics to determine which children likely have bacterial pneumonia
           and will benefit from administration of antibiotics.

           Furthermore, aiding diagnosis of pneumonia with thermal imaging may obviate chest x-rays
           as the primary diagnostic tool and reduce unnecessary exposure of patients to radiation.
           In the PICU and the Wards, it is not uncommon that some patients require daily or even
           more frequent chest x-rays. If we are able to validate thermal imaging as a tool to
           detect pneumonia, we could potentially minimize the radiation exposure of these
           patients.

           IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE:

             1. Independent Monitoring of Source Data

                Given the relatively small size of this study and the lack of an investigational
                agent, there will not be a data and safety monitoring committee set up for the
                purpose of evaluating data and safety of the participants. The principal
                investigator, as well as the Partners IRB, shall provide oversight and review of
                the study protocol throughout the duration of the study.

             2. Safety Monitoring

                There will be no official safety monitoring. We anticipate the risks of
                participation in this research study to be minimal.

             3. Outcomes Monitoring

                There will be no outcomes monitoring. Treatments or changes in the health care plan
                will not be made based on this research.

             4. Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines

           The principal investigator will review all reports of safety or other concerns within 24
           hours of being notified and communicate these to the IRB as per Partners IRB policy
           &quot;Reporting Unanticipated Problems Including Adverse Events&quot;. We will not require a DSMB
           for this study.
