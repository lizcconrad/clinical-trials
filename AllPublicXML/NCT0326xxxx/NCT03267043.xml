  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare neurodevelopment and activity in infants born preterm
      (26 to 33 6/7 weeks gestational age (GA)) receiving Standard Care (SC) or Family Nurture
      Intervention (FNI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

      The investigators hypothesize that FNI will improve: i) neonatal electroencephalographic
      activity ii) maternal caregiving and wellbeing (psychological and physiological, and iii)
      infant behavior and neurodevelopment at 18 months corrected age (CA).

      The two-phase effectiveness study aims to:

        -  Phase 1 - Examine the existing Standard Care Approximately 30 infants and their mothers

        -  Phase 2 - Examine effectiveness by implementing FNI unit-wide so that every baby
           receives the intervention Approximately 30 infants and their mothers
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to build upon the findings of the earlier randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      conducted at the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) comparing effects, both
      physiological and emotional, of the current standard method of encouraging contact between
      mothers and their babies in the NICU with the more specific approach of Family Nurture
      Intervention (FNI). In addition to receiving standard care, NICU families assigned to FNI
      received added intervention that focused on supporting the parents and facilitating emotional
      connection between mother and infant during the infant's NICU stay.

      The investigators wish to conduct an effectiveness trial to evaluate if the family nurture
      intervention's findings can be replicated on a unit-wide level. This effectiveness trial will
      take place over two parts. There will be two groups; standard care (SC) and intervention
      (FNI). Phase 1 of the effectiveness study will evaluate the standard care (SC) group in the
      unit as a baseline measurement and point of comparison to determine if unit-wide FNI
      reproduces its prior findings (Phase 2). The standard care group (Phase 1) will receive the
      current standard of care in the NICU. In Phase 2, FNI will be implemented unit-wide, but
      infants born between 26 weeks and 0 days to 33 weeks 6 days gestation will be eligible to be
      enrolled into the study. In addition to receiving standard care, patients enrolled during
      phase 2 will receive added interventions from the trained FNI nursing staff. These added
      interventions will include supporting the parents and facilitating contact between mother and
      infant during their infant's NICU stay.

    <measure>CES-D Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To examine maternal depression, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a 20 item self-report inventory designed to assess current but nonspecific distress rather than clinically diagnosed depression. It is the most frequently used measure in the field of infant research and maternal depression. Items probe for depressive symptoms and attitudes within the past week.</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To examine Maternal Anxiety, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) comprises 2 separate self-report scales of 20 items each that measure state and trait anxiety. The S-Anxiety Scale (measuring state), has been found to be a sensitive indicator of changes in transitory anxiety experienced by patients in counseling, psychotherapy, and behavior-modification programs, and has been used to assess the level of anxiety induced by unavoidable real-life stressors. The T-Anxiety scale has proven useful for identifying persons who differ in motivation or drive level. The STAI has been used in studies examining parents of hospitalized children, the transition to a maternal role, perception of illness severity in infants, and maternal anxiety during pregnancy and fetal attachment.</description>

    <measure>Neurobehavioral Assessments of Infants - Bayley Scales or Infant and Toddler Development, Bayley III</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the 18 month corrected age follow-up, infants are administered the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Bayley III consisting of three developmental domains: Cognitive, Language (receptive/expressive) and Motor (fine/gross). For each domain, a composite score is provided and is scaled to a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. A child will receive 1 point for every item successfully completed. The administration of each section will end if the child received 0 points on 5 consecutive items. Scores &lt;70 indicate significant developmental delays and scores &lt;80 indicate mild to moderate developmental delays.
Cognitive Scale - comprised of 91 items Language Scale - comprised of 97 items Motor Scale - comprised of 138 items</description>

    <description>To examine Mother-Infant Emotional Connection, this is a brief 4-item assessment requiring 5 minutes or less, which assesses the character of the relationship between study mothers and infants. It is filled out by study staff who rate mothers and infants in a dyadic interaction on their attraction, their vocal communication, facial expressiveness, and sensitivity and responsivity towards each other.</description>

The CBCL can also be used to measure a child's change in behavior over time or following a treatment. The CBCL consists of 100 items. This will be administered at the 18 Months CA Follow-Up.</description>
