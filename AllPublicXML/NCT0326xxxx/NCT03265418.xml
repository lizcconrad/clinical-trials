  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the feasibility and accuracy of BioXmark fiducial markers for image guided
      radiotherapy (IGRT) based rectal tumor boosting in 20 patients referred for long course
      chemo-radiotherapy of the locally advanced rectal cancer.

      This study is a prospective non-randomized open label trial.

      A total of 20 patients who will undergo neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy for rectal cancer
      will be included in this study upon informed consent.

      During an extra sigmoidoscopy after enema preparation, 4 liquid marker spots will be placed 1
      cm from the tumor; two in the in the cranial and two in the caudal direction of the tumor (4
      markers in total per patient).

      Participants will undergo standard treatment for their rectal cancer.

      As part of standard patient set-up directly before each radiotherapy treatment, kilovoltage
      (KV) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) will be acquired. Treatment positioning will be
      based on the regular clinical decision protocols for treatment of rectal cancer and not on
      the markers. During treatment potential fiducial movement will be assessed using an
      externally positioned ultra-sound probe (this probe will be positioned against the abdominal
      or perineal skin of the patients depending on de position of the tumor/fiducials in the
      rectum). Moreover, for patients in this study 2 orthogonal kV images will be made immediately
      after each radiation using the electronic portal imaging (EPI) device.

      As part of standard clinical practice an Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the rectum will
      be made for response evaluation 6-8 weeks after the end of neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy.

      As part of standard clinical practice patients whose tumor has not responded completely will
      be operated on 8-12 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. Patients with a
      complete response will be follow-upped according to the &quot;wait-and-see&quot; protocol.

      Cone-beam CT and MR images which are obtained as routine practice during treatment of the
      participants will be compared with images of 20 non-participating patients treated at our
      institute in the same period.

Potential BioXmark induced alteration in the surgical specimen will be scored by 2 independent observers using a subjective scoring system.In case the markers can't be located in the surgical specimen standard clinical evaluation of the specimen will take place. If the marker got lost during tissue processing potential inflammation/perforation will be scored as follows:A) 0 = no signs of extra inflammatory changes possibly related to the fiducials, 1 = limited extra inflammatory changes possibly related to the fiducials, 2 = severe extra inflammatory changes possibly related to the fiducials; B) 0 = no perforation of the rectal possibly related to fiducials, 1 = perforation of the rectal possibly related to the fiducials</description>
