      This is a non-randomized, phase II, open label study of apatinib mesylate tablets plus
      tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsules induction chemotherapy in locally advanced
      squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck patients who were judged surgically unresectable or
      appropriate for non-surgical definitive therapy.The primary purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of apatinib mesylate tablets plus tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium
      capsules in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed SCCHN or poorly differentiated or
             undifferentiated cancer of the head and neck.

          2. Measurable disease.

          3. All primary sites are eligible excluding nasopharyngeal.

          4. Surgically unresectable and/or refuse surgery; Note: surgical unresectability will be
             defined as the combination of the treating surgeon's judgment of unresectability plus
             one of the following objective criteria:

             Encasement of tumor or nodes to the carotid artery or ¾ encasement of the carotid
             artery.

             Involvement of prevertebral musculature Invasion of the bone of the skull base Need
             for glossectomy or extensive glossal resection where functional outcome is considered
             unacceptable to surgeon or patient Involvement of the cervical spine Severe,
             unacceptable functional deficit that would result from any proposed definitive
             surgical resection.

          5. ECOG performance status 0-1

          6. Age &gt; or = 18 years. Men and women are eligible for participation.

          7. Must have acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below. Laboratory tests
             should be completed within 14 days prior to registration:

             Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt; or = 1,500/mm3 Platelets &gt; or = 100,000/mm3

             upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal, glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 30 mL/min (by standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or measured
             via 24 hour urine collection)

          8. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with poor-controlled arterial hypertension (systolic pressure ≥ 140 mmHg
             and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) despite standard medical management;

          2. Suffered from grade II or above myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction,
             uncontrolled arrhythmias (including QT interval male ≥ 450 ms, female ≥ 470 ms). Grade
             III-IV cardiac insufficiency according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria
             or echocardiography check: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&lt;50%;

          3. Patients who have had prior allergic reaction to Apatinib and Tegafur Gimeracil
             Oteracil;

          4. The subject has had another active malignancy within the past five years except for
             cervical cancer in site, in situ carcinoma of the bladder or non-melanoma carcinoma of
             the skin;

          5. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to: active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities;

          6. Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents.

          7. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding;

          8. Patients with any other concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for participation in the study.
