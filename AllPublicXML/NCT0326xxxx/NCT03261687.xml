  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to address whether a water exercise programme improves pain and quality of
      life in pregnant patients with Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) compared to a land-based exercise
      programme and the feasibility of undertaking a large-scale research programme.

      This study aimed to address whether a water exercise programme improves pain and quality of
      life in pregnant patients with Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) compared to a land-based exercise
      programme and the feasibility of undertaking a large-scale research programme. Twenty-three
      participants with diagnosed PGP, recruited at St George's Hospital London, were randomised
      into two groups (water or land exercise). Each group received, four, once-weekly exercise
      sessions on land or water. Exercise effects on PGP were measured using a variety of outcome
      measures. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and post four weeks exercise.
