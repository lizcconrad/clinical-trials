  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would like to determine if the introduction of the Safe Childbirth Checklist and
      associated mentorship can improve the adherence of skilled birth attendants (SBAs) to the
      essential practices of childbirth delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a pre-post study design to measure health worker adherence to the
      essential practices for delivery care outlined in the Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC). The
      intervention, including the introduction of the SCC and mentorship visits to support uptake,
      will be tested in four purposively selected health facilities in Nchelenge District, Luapula
      Province of Zambia. Since the essential delivery care practices outlined in the SCC are
      evidence-based practices broadly accepted to support positive clinical outcomes for mothers
      and infants, this evaluation will focus on adherence to the checklist rather than on patient
      outcomes. Data will be collected through observations of skilled birth attendants assisting
      with childbirth delivery before the start of the intervention and again at 3 months and 6
      months post-intervention. A health worker questionnaire will be administered at the time that
      the SCC is introduced and six months later to gather their perspectives on incorporating the
      SCC into clinical practice in Zambia.

    <description>Adaptation of the SCC tool to Zambia: In order to produce a tool that is fully relevant to the Zambian context, a team of clinical experts from the MOH adapted the language of the SCC.
Training of trainers on the SCC by international experts: Ariadne Labs has designed a training-of-trainers (TOT) for coach training to support quality improvement initiatives, including the implementation of the WHO SCC. Members of the district mentorship team for Nchelenge District will receive this type of TOT training.
Following the TOT session, the district mentorship team will conduct facility-level training for health workers on using the SCC. Within target facilities, all public sector health workers will be invited to participate in the training.
Mentorship and support to facility-level health workers on using the SCC: The district mentorship team will carry out coaching and support visits to health facilities following the initial SCC training.</description>

        All births will be observed at any time of the day (with two data collectors taking 12-hour
        shifts). Observations will be conducted for a minimum of three days in all four facilities,
        or as long as required to observe at least 7 births. It may not be possible for the
        observer to observe every delivery process at all times, particularly if multiple
        observations are taking place at one time, so observations will relate to activities at
        four specific periods (pause points): on admission, when the mother starts pushing, through
        the delivery to one hour after delivery, and before discharge.
