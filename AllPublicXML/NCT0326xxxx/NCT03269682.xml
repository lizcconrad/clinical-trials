  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve or &quot;III&quot;) palsy is a relatively frequent cause of
      consultation in ophthalmology.

      It may reveal a life-threatening pathology such as aneurysm rupture, pituitary apoplexy, and
      therefore need imaging in emergency. Apart from few extreme emergency situations, MRI of the
      oculomotor tract is the first-line examination required. In our usual clinical practice, we
      noticed in several patients unusual contrast enhancement within the oculomotor nerve on T1
      sequence with gadolinium injection, observed in various locations along the nerve path
      (cavernous and/ or intra-orbital segment).

      This contrast enhancement, could confirm the nerve impairment This study aims to analyse the
      efficiency of a new sequence 3D PD T1 which isotropic spatial resolution less than 1mm, not
      yet described in the literature, to depict this enhancement.

      In patients with ophthalmoplegia involving probably the third cranial nerve, disclosing this
      MRI sign could help (i) to confirm the involvement of the oculomotor nerve and eliminate
      differential diagnoses such as myasthenia (ii) to orientate the etiological diagnosis
      (inflammatory or ischemic origin). This new sequence 3D PD T1 sequence focused on the III
      could thus be systematically included in the usual MRI protocol.

    <description>A double separate reading of the imaging will be carried out by an experienced radiologist and a junior radiologist on anonymized MRIs, with no access to clinical elements and interpretation of the other radiologist. In case of discrepancy between the radiologists, the final decision will be made by a third experienced radiologist under the same conditions (no access to clinical data, no access to the other evaluations).</description>
