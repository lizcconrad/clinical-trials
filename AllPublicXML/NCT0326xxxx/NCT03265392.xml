  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of our in vitro studies strengthen the hypothesis that the contribution of
      salivary alpha-amylase to starch digestion has been underrated and that this enzyme can play
      an important role in this process. As a result, its inhibition could constitute an
      opportunity to reduce the glycemic response elicited by starch-rich foods. The main goal of
      this study is to verify whether inhibition of salivary alpha-amylase, upon the consumption of
      starchy foods, can have an impact on the postprandial glycemic response, and/or satiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-blind, randomized, crossover study will be divided into two parts. Part 1
      comprises a total of 3 test-meals for which postprandial glycemia, subjective appetite levels
      and consumption in the following meal (ad libitum meal) will be evaluated.

      Part 2 is to be carried out with another group of 10 participants and the same test meals as
      in Part 1. Digestion of these meals will be monitored in real-time with Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI). Postprandial glycemia and subjective appetite scores, will be measured in
      parallel to enable the comparison with the results of Part 1.
