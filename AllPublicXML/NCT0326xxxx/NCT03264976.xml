  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common causes of blindness worldwide. It is a
      progressive disease and its detection in early phases is very crucial for visional outcomes.
      miRNA of exosomes has been recently considered as a potential circulating marker of
      oculopathy, including age-related macular degeneration and uveal melanoma. Therefore, the
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the serum exosomal miRNA could be
      prospective prognosis biomarker to investigate the initiation and development of DR. This
      case-control study is planned to include diabetic patients, and patients without DR, which
      serve as controls. Other participants will be divided into four groups by different DR stages
      according to the guideline from AAO. Information and samples of all trial participants will
      be collected at the inception of the study, including basic information, medical history,
      serum samples, and several ophthalmologic examinations. Then these information and
      examinations will be collected at regular intervals: every 12 months until 5 years. Different
      statistical methods will be used to identify significant associations between DR progression
      and different exosomal miRNA. We hypothesis that there could exist alert level of exosomal
      miRNAs which indicate the onset and development of DR in diabetic patients. Moreover, the
      selected exosomal miRNAs, being considered together with other information including medical
      history, blood indicators and ophthalmologic examinations, to be chosen-optimized as a
      prognostic model for DR, which may help predicting high risk groups of DR and those with poor
      prognosis. Based on clinical trial data, we will further discuss about possible roles of
      identified miRNA of exosomes in the pathogenesis of DR.

    <description>In discovery set, miRNA sequencing of serum exosomes will be performed for each sample. Data will be analyzed using statistical methods. Potential miRNAs that show group-differentiation will be selected in combination with information and test results.Based on these selected miRNAs, the same assays will be repeated on all validation set samples to screen out significant miRNA.</description>
