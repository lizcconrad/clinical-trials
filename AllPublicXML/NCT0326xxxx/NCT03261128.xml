  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cancers are diagnosed after 75 years. Treatment in chemotherapy begins without evidence
      of geriatric risk factors. A new tool for screening for geriatric fragilities is used, a
      self-administered questionnaire carried out by the patient before each chemotherapy cure. The
      objective is to secure the quality of patient care and to detect the appearance and / or
      aggravation of geriatric fragilities.

      Evaluation of the feasibility of a new geriatric fragility screening tool (D-FOG) in patients
      aged ≥ 75 years during oncological treatment:

        -  Number of D-FOGs filled in: comparison with the number of patients included in the study
           and the number of visits of each patient.

        -  Regularity of the D-FOG self-questionnaire by the patient: comparison with the number of
           visits of the patient for a chemotherapy cure (HDJ or HDS).

        -  Number of criteria entered by D-FOG: comparison with the total number of criteria to be
           filled in

        -  Criterion analysis of D-FOG
