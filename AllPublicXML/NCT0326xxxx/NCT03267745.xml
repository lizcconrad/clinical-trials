        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Generally healthy, non-smoking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Subject has any concurrent medical, orthopedic, or psychiatric condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would compromise his/her ability to comply with the study
             requirements;

          3. History of cancer within the last 5 years, except basal cell carcinoma, non-squamous
             skin carcinoma, prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ with no significant progression
             over the past 2 years;

          4. Significant orthopedic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, liver, infectious disease,
             immune disorder (requiring ongoing medical care), or metabolic/endocrine disorder
             (e.g., diabetes, high cholesterol, elevated fasting blood sugar) or other disease that
             would preclude oral protein supplement ingestion and/or assessment of safety and study
             objectives;

          5. Any cachexia-related condition (e.g., relating to cancer, tuberculosis or human
             immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome) or any
             genetic muscle diseases or disorders;

          6. Current illnesses which could interfere with the study (e.g. prolonged severe
             diarrhea, regurgitation, difficulty swallowing);

          7. Subject participated in a study of an investigational product less than 60 days or 5
             half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer, before enrollment in
             this study;

          8. Hypersensitivity to any of the components of the test product;

          9. Excessive alcohol consumption (&gt;21 units/week); (&gt; 21 standard drinks/wk); e.g., 18oz
             glass of 5% beer - 1.5 standard drinks, a 750 mL bottle of 12% wine = 5 standard
             drinks.

         10. Known sensitivity or allergy to amino acids or any ingredient in the test
             formulations;

         11. Prior gastrointestinal bypass surgery (Lapband, etc.), irritable bowel disease or
             irritable bowel syndrome;

         12. History of bleeding diathesis, platelet or coagulation disorders, or
             antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy (up to 81mg of baby aspirin per day taken as a
             prophylactic is permitted);

         13. Personal or family history of clotting disorder or deep vein thrombosis. Deep vein
             thrombosis is a serious, and potentially lethal, medical condition, therefore, it is
             imperative if you have personal or family history it is disclosed this to the research
             staff.

         14. Concomitant use of corticosteroids, testosterone replacement therapy (ingestion,
             injection, or transdermal), any anabolic steroid, creatine, whey protein supplements,
             casein or branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) within 45 days prior to Screening;

         15. Contraindications to an MRI scan (e.g. subjects with non-removable ferromagnetic
             implants, pacemakers, aneurysm clips or other foreign bodies, or subjects with
             claustrophobic symptoms that would contraindicate an MRI scan).

         16. Hemoglobin &lt;11.5mg/dl at Screening;

         17. Platelets &lt;150,000/uL (150x109/L) at Screening.
