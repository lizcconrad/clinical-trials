  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter non-randomized prospective clinical study assessing the safety and feasibility
      of the esophageal through-the-scope HILZO Covered self-expandable metal stent placement for
      palliation of malignant dysphagia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of placement of the
      esophageal HILZO Covered stent with the TTS method in patients with non-operable malignant
      obstruction of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction, extrinsic malignant compression, or
      recurrent malignant dysphagia after esophagectomy.

      Other (secondary) objects are to assess the effect of the stent on the presence of
      hyperplastic reaction after implantation, the functional complications and survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-operable malignant obstruction of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction,
             extrinsic malignant compression, or recurrent malignant dysphagia after esophagectomy.
             A tumor is considered inoperable if the patient has local tumor infiltration in the
             surrounding organs, distant metastases or a poor general health due to serious
             concomitant disease. OR

          -  Recurrent dysphagia after prior radiation with curative or palliative intent for
             esophageal or gastric cardia cancer.

          -  Requiring treatment for dysphagia (dysphagia score of ≥ 2, according to Ogilvie2)

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inappropriate cultural level and understanding of the study.

          -  Simultaneous participation in another clinical study

          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 months

          -  Stenosis after laryngectomy, or if the distance between the upper edge of the stent is
             less than 2 cm from the upper esophageal sphincter

          -  Tumor length of more than 12cm

          -  Previous stent placement for the same condition
