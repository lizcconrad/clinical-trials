  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab
      after primary resistance to anti- programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis therapy can lead to
      objective radiographic tumor regression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 percent of unselected patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and progression during or after standard first line chemotherapy will experience
      tumor response to nivolumab. Treatment options for patients who are not responsive to
      programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis inhibitor therapy are limited, and the mechanisms of primary
      resistance are poorly understood.

      The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of
      advanced melanoma based on superiority to either agent alone5. The results of a phase I study
      evaluating combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced NSCLC
      (NCT01454102) were presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
      meeting in 20166. Dosing of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6
      weeks yielded an objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 of 39%, with one-year survival rate of 69% and grade 3-4
      treatment-related adverse event rate of 33%. These results prompted an ongoing phase III
      study comparing this regimen to standard first line chemotherapy, nivolumab monotherapy or
      combination therapy with chemotherapy and nivolumab for patients with advanced NSCLC
      (NCT02477826).

      The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab
      after primary resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy can lead to objective radiographic tumor
      regression. It is hypothesized that ipilimumab will enable more effective immune priming in
      some patients, resulting in the trafficking of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells to the tumor,
      as well as depletion of tumor-permissive T regulatory cells. With concurrent nivolumab, PD-1
      inhibition in the tumor will enable effective anti-tumor attack by tumor-specific T cells.
      Serial tumor biopsies and blood collections will allow interrogation of changes in the tumor
      microenvironment (and periphery) that support this hypothesis.

      The investigators will primarily enroll patients who have experienced progression of NSCLC
      after anti-PD-1- axis therapy without initial response to such therapy ('primary
      resistance'). A smaller cohort of patients with acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy
      (i.e. progression after initial response) will additionally be accrued.

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic (i.e.,
             Stage IIIB not eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy, Stage IV, or recurrent)
             non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (per the American Joint Committee /AJCC staging
             system)

               -  Eastern Cooperative oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

               -  Anti- programmed death (PD)-1 Axis therapy (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, e.g.
                  nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) must be the most
                  recent systemic anti-tumor treatment received in all patients, with documented
                  progressive disease:

                    1. Patients to be enrolled to the primary cohort (primary resistance) must have
                       had progressive disease or stable disease less than 24 weeks as the best
                       clinical response to anti-PD-1-axis therapy.

                    2. Patients to be enrolled to the exploratory cohort (acquired resistance) must
                       have had stable disease for at least 24 weeks, partial response, or complete
                       response as the best clinical response to anti-PD-1-axis therapy, with
                       subsequent progression of disease.

               -  Chemotherapy naive and treated patients will be eligible, with no limit on number
                  of prior therapies. Patients with NSCLC known to harbor an ALK rearrangement, or
                  EGFR mutation known to be sensitive to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
                  approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), are only eligible after experiencing
                  disease progression (during or after treatment) or intolerance to an FDA approved
                  EGFR TKI or ALK TKI, respectively:

                    1. Patients with TKI treated EGFR mutant NSCLC harboring the secondary EGFR
                       T790M tumor must have received prior osimertinib.

                    2. Patients with crizotinib treated ALK rearranged NSCLC must have received a
                       next generation ALK inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib, alectinib or brigatinib).

               -  At least one tumor amenable to incisional, excisional, core or forceps
                  (transbronchial) biopsy. Patients must be willing to undergo tumor biopsies
                  before starting trial therapy, and 9 to 10 weeks after initiation of therapy:

                    1. If the initial biopsy will be excisional, the excised tumor cannot be
                       counted as a target lesion and there must be another lesion amenable to
                       incisional, excisional, core or forceps biopsy. In this scenario, the second
                       biopsy can only be excisional if the lesion to be excised is not a target
                       lesion.

                    2. Cytology tumor specimens (e.g. from fine-needle biopsies, or drainage of
                       pleural/ pericardial or ascites fluid) are not acceptable. Biopsies of bone
                       lesions that do not have a soft tissue component are also not acceptable
                       (i.e. decalcified tumor samples are not acceptable).

               -  Adequate hematologic and end-organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must not have a history of life-threatening toxicity related to prior
             anti-PD-1 axis therapy:

             a. Subjects with history of anti-PD-1 axis therapy toxicities that are unlikely to
             recur with standard countermeasures (e.g., hormone replacement after adrenal crisis)
             are eligible.

          -  Prior treatment with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecule(CTLA)-4
             therapeutic antibodies

          -  Symptomatic or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with a
             history of treated asymptomatic CNS metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of
             the following criteria:

               1. No evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy
                  and the start of trial therapy.
