  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of inspiratory muscle strength training
      for lowering blood pressure and improving physiological function (vascular, motor, and
      cognitive) in middle-aged and older adults with elevated systolic blood pressure.

      Over, the proposed research project has the long-term potential to influence clinical
      practice by establishing a novel lifestyle intervention for treating multiple domains of age-
      and hypertension-associated physiological dysfunction and thereby reducing the risk of
      clinical disease and disability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

          -  Willing to accept random assignment to condition

          -  Women will be confirmed as postmenopausal (either natural or surgical) based on
             cessation of menses for &gt;1 year.

          -  Resting systolic blood pressure 120-159 mmHg

          -  Resting diastolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg

          -  Subjects taking anti-hypertensive medications will be included provided they meet the
             other inclusion criteria, including elevated systolic blood pressure. These
             medications will not be withheld prior to experimental protocols.

          -  Free from alcohol dependence or abuse, as defined by the American Psychiatry
             Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual or Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current smoking

          -  Chronic clinical disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease/irritable bowel syndrome,
             coronary artery/peripheral artery/cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney
             disease requiring dialysis, neurological disorders or diseases that may affect
             motor/cognitive function [multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, polio, Alzheimer's
             disease, dementia, or other brain diseases of aging]), except hypertension

          -  Postmenopausal &lt;1 year

          -  Scoring &lt;21 on the mini-mental state examination

          -  Moderate or sever peripheral artery disease (ankle-brachial index 0.7)

          -  Taking a medication that your doctor deems unsafe to hold for &gt;1 week

          -  A graded exercise test will be performed by all subjects. If there is physician
             concern or an adverse event, the subject will not participate in the study.

          -  No weight stable in the prior 3 months (&gt;2 kg weight change) or unwilling to remain
             weight stable throughout study (rationale: recent weight change or weight loss can
             influence vascular function)
