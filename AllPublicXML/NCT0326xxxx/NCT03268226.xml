             of the subject or the evaluation of the result of the study according to the
             Investigator's judgment; history of atrial fibrillation, history of sustained and non

             investigational drug within the 30 days (60 days for biologics) before the screening
             visit or a more appropriate time as determined by the investigator (e.g. approximately
             5 half-lives of the investigational drug whatever is longer).
