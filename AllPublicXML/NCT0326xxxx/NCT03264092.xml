      The study's aim is to prospectively compare three different tissue acquisition techniques
      during EUS guided pancreatic solid lesions biopsies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been used since 1990's for
      the diagnosis and staging of esophageal, gastric, duodenal, pancreatobiliary, rectal
      mediastinal lesions and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Studies have shown a variable range
      of specimen adequacy when performing pancreatic biopsies with the standard fine needle
      aspiration (FNA) needles with this modality. There are several factors that affect the
      overall diagnostic yield of this procedure, such as endosonographer experience, presence of
      cytopathologist during the procedure, the needle diameter and the number of passes. In this
      study we will compare the yield of recently available fine biopsy needles (FNB) using three
      different techniques to obtain samples from pancreatic lesions. The three techniques to be
      compared in this study are: stylet slow pull (SP) vs dry suction (DS) vs wet suction (WS).

      wall cells.

      In the &quot;suction technique&quot; the stylet of the needle can be left in place or removed before
      puncturing the lesion. Once the needle is inside the target, negative pressure is applied
      through a 10 or 20 cc syringe connected to the needle.

      The wet suction technique consists of flushing of the needle with 5 ml of saline solution to
      replace the column of air within the lumen of needle with saline solution before needle
      aspiration. Once the needle is flushed, negative pressure is applied with a 10 or 20 cc
      syringe connected to the needle.

      In the slow pull technique, the stylet is left in place in the needle and is slightly
      retracted prior to puncturing the lesion. Once the needle is inside the target, the stylet is
      pushed completely into the needle to remove any contaminant cells and several back and forth
      movements are done while slowly withdrawing the stylet.
