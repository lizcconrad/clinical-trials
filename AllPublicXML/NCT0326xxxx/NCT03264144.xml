      The study involves a behavioural intervention with social norms approaches to correct smoking
      misperceptions, reduce smoking susceptibility and change smoking-related behaviours in Hong
      Kong adolescents. A 2-arm stratified clustered randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be
      conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. A total of 18 secondary schools
      will be randomly selected from the 5 regions in Hong Kong and invited to the RCT. The schools
      will then be randomly allocated to intervention or control group in the ratio of 1:1.
      Secondary 1 to 5 (US Grade 7 to 11) students will be invited. Students in both intervention
      and control group will complete a baseline survey, and the intervention group will receive
      the intervention after the baseline. Intervention materials includes posters and table tents
      at school, flyers to students, and online banner on school website. The intervention adopts
      social norms approaches, and will highlight the prevalence of adolescents who do not smoke
      and have no intention to smoke. It will last for 2 months. Both intervention and control
      groups will complete follow-up surveys at 3 and 9 months. The control group will receive the
      intervention materials after the RCT.
