  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)&quot; and &quot;early defibrillation&quot; are the most
      important parts of &quot;the chain of survival&quot;, and they are highly associated with the survival
      rate and life quality of patients with cardiac arrest. It needs the witness to perform
      bystander CPR and use the automated external defibrillator (AED) if CPR and defibrillation
      are expected to be performed earlier. Nevertheless, few patients with cardiac arrest received
      bystander CPR in Taiwan. It might be caused by some reasons. First, traditional training
      programs were inefficient and ineffective in the retention of skills and thus students were
      not confident in their CPR skills after receiving training programs. Second, the current
      training module focused on personal skill training only and lacked teamwork skills training.
      It led to poor performance of the students in actual resuscitation scene, where on-scene
      resuscitators were usually more than one. Third, the current training contents did not
      improve the attitudes and willingness of performing bystander CPR and it caused people who
      had received training program did not resuscitate the patients finally. To improve the
      above-mentioned problem, a three-year research project will be implemented. The aims of the
      project are the following:

        1. to explore the effect of different teaching contents and hand-on practice feedback
           methods on the students' performance of chest compressing, ventilating and using AED in
           the CPR and AED training courses.

        2. to analyze the current situation of teamwork when CPR and AED were performed, to build
           up the collaborating module accordingly and evaluate the effect of the new module on the
           students' performance of chest compressing, ventilating and using AED after the module
           is introduced into the training course.

        3. to understand the factors affecting the motivations and willingness of people to learn
           and practice CPR and AED by utilizing questionnaires, and then to evaluate the effect of
           the creative program, which was modified according to the results of the questionnaires,
           on the motivations and willingness of people to learn and practice CPR and AED.

      The investigators expect to design a more efficient resuscitation skill training course by
      implementing the research project and further to improve the motivations and willingness of
      people to learn and practice CPR and AED in the future.
