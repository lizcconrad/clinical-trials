        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 32.0 kg/m2 inclusive,

          -  Weight ≥ 50 kg

          -  Negative result for tuberculosis (TB) as evidenced by a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test
             at screening, or documentation of a negative result within 4 weeks before Cycle 1, Day
             1

          -  Women of childbearing potential with intact ovarian function, on a stable regimen of
             combination birth control containing EE without evidence of clinically significant
             breakthrough bleeding or spotting for at least 2 consecutive months prior to Cycle 1
             Day -1

          -  Subjects aged 21 years or older must have a normal Pap smear result within 3 years
             before Cycle 1 Day 1 (a Pap smear may be performed at screening if no result is
             available); a finding of abnormal squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS) is
             allowed provided it is an initial finding and not a follow up from an initial finding
             of ASCUS

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exposure to an investigational agent within 12 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Any significant acute or chronic medical illness including infection, any active
             infection, febrile illness within 7 days before Cycle 1, Day 1, or any condition that
             could predispose the subject to infection

          -  History of recurrent or chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, urinary tract
             infection (recurrent or chronic urinary tract infection is 2 episodes within 6 months)

          -  Any serious acute or chronic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (eg, pneumonia,
             septicemia) within the 3 months prior to screening

          -  Known or suspected autoimmune disorder, or any history of known or suspected
             congenital or acquired immunodeficiency state or condition that would compromise the
             subject's immune status (eg, history of splenectomy, primary immunodeficiency, etc)

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply
