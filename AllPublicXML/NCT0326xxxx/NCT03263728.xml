    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of myocardial ischaemia in asymptomatic
      high risk type 2 diabetic patients using stress cardiac MR and how many stress cardiac MR
      examinations are false positive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) is highly prevalent (ie. 17-59%) in type 2
      diabetic patients. In addition, cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death
      in type 2 diabetics. Previous trials using coronary computed tomography angiograms (CCTA) or
      nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to screen for asymptomatic coronary artery disease
      requiring intervention have been unsuccessful at reducing cardiovascular and all cause
      mortality when compared to optimised medical therapy where cardiovascular risk factors are
      treated in order to reduce cardiovascular complications. Possible reasons for this include,
      the choice of imaging modality, the intervention chosen (eg. bare metal stents vs drug
      eluting stents), patient cohort (eg. all diabetics vs high risk diabetics). Stress CMR is
      ideally suited to assess this group of high risk patients as there is no radiation exposure
      and it allows a more complete analysis of the heart including the assessment of myocardial
      viability, cardiac systolic and diastolic function. The significance of this envisioned
      randomised controlled trial is firstly to investigate if stress CMR screening will reduce
      major adverse cardiovascular events including death. Secondly, a study using stress CMR has
      never been performed.
