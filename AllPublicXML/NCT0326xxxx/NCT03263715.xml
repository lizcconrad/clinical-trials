    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a tocilizumab-based regimen compared
      with placebo on top of rapidly tapered glucocorticoid treatment in a double- blind,
      controlled fashion, focussing on glucocorticoid-free remission of disease.

    <textblock>
      Background. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory rheumatic disease of the elderly, with
      a usually rapid response to intermediate-doses of glucocorticoids (GCs). In many patients,
      relapses occur upon its dose reduction or cessation. Given the patients' age and the adverse
      event profile of GCs, steroid- free remission is the most desired target in patients with
      PMR, but typical GC sparing agents are often insufficient. Case series and small open studies
      suggested an excellent effectiveness of tocilizumab, an inhibitor of the Interleukin
      6-receptor.

      Objective. To assess the efficacy and safety of a tocilizumab-based regimen compared with
      placebo on top of rapidly tapered GC treatment in a double-blind, controlled fashion,
      focussing on GC-free remission of disease.

      Methods. In this double-blind, parallel group study, 32 patients with PMR will be recruited
      from three rheumatology centres and will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to tocilizumab or
      placebo over the course of 16 weeks, accompanied by a rapid tapering GC scheme over 11 weeks
      in both arms. The primary endpoint is GC-free remission at week 16, and follow-up will be
      performed until week 24 for safety and sustained efficacy. Patients will receive either the
      subcutaneous preparation of 162 mg tocilizumab weekly or matching placebo injections.

      Expected Results. In case of a positive result of this study, the benefits for patients with
      new-onset PMR will manifest in a reduction of the burden of GC intake in this elderly
      population with increased risk of GC-related adverse events.
