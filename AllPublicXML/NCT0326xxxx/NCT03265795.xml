  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical ablation of large maxillary cysts usually results in considerable hard and soft
      tissue deficits that ultimately affect the final esthetic and functional outcomes.
      Reconstruction of such defects; whether primarily or secondarily; offers much better
      long-term outcomes. However, primary bony reconstruction becomes potentially complicated in
      many cases of such large cysts encroaching or involving the maxillary sinus where a
      communication with the maxillary sinus lining may be unavoidable.

      Reconstruction of such defects can be accomplished using either vascularized or; more
      commonly; non-vascularized autogenous bone grafts. Different bone substitutes remain to be
      another viable option. The simultaneous use of titanium meshes provides physical
      three-dimensional support for the bone graft contained within as well as the overlying soft
      tissues. However, the drawbacks of titanium meshes in such defects remain to be mainly the
      difficulty in adequately shaping the mesh and the lack of proper isolation of the mesh
      contents from the maxillary sinus cavity.
