  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data on the impact of biological therapies, especially of IL6-blocker treatment, on the
      T-cell phenotype in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are limited, inconclusive, and mainly involve
      short-term follow-up.

      Here, the investigator prospectively measure the percentages of 15 circulating T-cell
      subtypes using flow cytometry. The investigators aim to obtained transversal and longitudinal
      data in 30 anti-TNF responders, 19 secondary anti-TNF-non-responders, 43
      IL6R-antagonist-responders before, 8 weeks and, after, at least, 6 months of biological
      therapy. These are then compared with results obtained in early, untreated RA patients and
      gender-and-age matched healthy controls.

        In the cross-sectional analysis, 92 RA patients (who had been treated with biological
        therapy for more than six months) were evaluated.

        As a further control group (healthy controls), we enrolled 30 age- and gender-matched
        healthy volunteers.
