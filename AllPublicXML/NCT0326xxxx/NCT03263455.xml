  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the third most common cause of
      disability. The effects of stroke are variable and may include impairments in motor and
      sensory systems, emotion and neuropsychological deficits such as a disorder of spatial
      awareness known as unilateral spatial neglect (USN). Approaches to ameliorate USN could be
      categorized in interventions as involving either bottom-up or top-down processing. The
      specific mechanisms underlying these effects on a number of manifestations of the USN
      syndrome may include the restoration of defective representations of the side of space
      contralateral to the lesion (contralesional), and of the ability to orient spatial attention
      contralesionally, through complex patterns of activation of both the damaged right
      hemisphere, and the contralateral left hemisphere, with differences related to the specific
      stimulation delivered to the patient. In recent years, increasing cutaneous stimuli through
      neuromuscular kinesiotaping has been proposed to enhance somatosensory inputs (24) and such
      as method could have positive effects on USN. The aim of the present study was to assess the
      effect of KTM applied on the sternocleidomastoid muscle controlateral side of the lesions in
      improving USN deficits in individuals with stroke patient in sub-acute phase. The hypothesis
      is that the KTM application could improved cognitive tests for assessing USN, motor deficits
      and kinesthetic neck sensibility.

    <description>The tape in the KT group will be applied with paper-off tension, which means applying the tape directly to the skin as it comes off the paper backing (approximately with 15% to 25% of available tension). KinesioTape will be applied over the SCM dystonic muscle by means of 2 &quot;I-strips&quot;: the first strip will be placed on the medial (sternal) head and the second will be applied on the lateral (clavicular) head of the SCM muscle. KinesioTape was applied from the mastoid bone to the clavicle (rostrocaudal direction) with the SCM placed in a position of maximum stretching.</description>
