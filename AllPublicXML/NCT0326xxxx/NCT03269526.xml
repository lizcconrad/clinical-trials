  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will confirm toxicities and estimate the clinical efficacy of combining
      anti-CD3 x anti-EGFR bispecific antibody (EGFRBi) armed activated T cells (EGFR BATs) given
      to patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who have received at least
      one dose of first line chemotherapy and may have responding, stable or progressive disease.
      Phase Ib will confirm a safe dose of 8 infusions, given twice weekly, of EGFR-BATs in 3 to 6
      subjects. The phase II portion of the trial will test the clinical efficacy of this dose in
      22 patients (including those in Phase Ib).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once subjects are determined eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via
      leukapheresis procedure at approximately 3 to 4 weeks prior to first EGFR-BATs infusion. The
      white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with two proteins - OKT3 and IL-2
      which activates the cells to multiply. After approximately 14 days in culture, the activated
      T cells are coated with the OKT3 and cetuximab to produce bispecific antibody armed T cells
      (BATs). Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to be infused.

      Within one to two weeks prior to infusion of the study treatment, subjects will receive one
      dose of chemotherapy. The choice of chemotherapy agent(s) is at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      At approximately 4 weeks following leukapheresis procedure, twice weekly infusions of the
      BATs cells will take place; a total of eight infusions will be given over a four week period.

      Follow-up appointment schedule will include clinic visits at 1 to 2 weeks, 4 to 5 weeks, 2
      months, 4 months and 6 months following the last infusion of BATs cells.
