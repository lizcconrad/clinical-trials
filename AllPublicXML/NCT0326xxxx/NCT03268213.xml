  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with refractory Clostridium
      difficile and/or Ulcerative Colitis or indeterminate colitis is its ability to reconstitute
      the normal microbial homeostasis leading to resolution or improvement of symptoms caused by
      the bacteria or underlying inflammatory bowel disease. This is becoming an especially
      important treatment modality as antimicrobial therapy for Clostridium difficile is becoming
      less efficacious due to resistant strains such as the hypervirulent NAP1/ribotype 027 strain.

      Currently long-term follow-up data on patients who have undergone FMT is lacking. There are
      only scattered reports documenting the alteration of the enteric microbial composition and
      function status post transplantation. This study will significantly increase understanding of
      the short and long term safety, efficacy, and tolerability of FMT. It will also enable
      researchers to assess the change in the fecal microbiome after transplantation. Answers to
      these questions may lead to identification of key bacterial taxa to target future therapy.

      The following hypothesis will be tested in this study:

        1. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a safe, tolerable, and efficacious procedure.

        2. The fecal microbial composition and function in stool recipients after fecal
           transplantation will change to a similar composition and functionality as found in donor
           stool.

      Primary objectives:

      1. To determine the short term safety and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation in
      patients with recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory
      Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis up to 12 weeks post-transplant.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To determine the long term safety and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation
           in patients with recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory
           Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis up to 1 year post-transplant.

        2. To determine the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with recurrent
           or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or
           indeterminate colitis in reducing or eliminating clinical symptoms.

        3. To determine eradication of Clostridium difficile by negative PCR and/or toxin at 2
           weeks post-transplant.

        4. To determine change in fecal microbiome in patients treated with fecal microbiota
           transplantation.

Safety will be assessed as a report of no new medical condition after the transplant, Tolerability, as recorded by report of no serious adverse events after the transplant and Efficacy of the procedure will be recorded as improvement in clinical symptoms during any clinically indicated colonoscopies after the transplant as compared to before transplant

The study participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0 will be reported to DSMB and IRB and appropriate clinical care will be provided to the patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients greater than 7 years of age with recurrent or relapsing C. difficile:

               -  At least two episodes of mild-to-moderate C. difficile diagnosed via positive PCR
                  or toxin and failure of standard treatment with at least two different
                  antimicrobial agents used to treat C. difficile such as metronidazole,
                  vancomycin, and/or fidaxomicin.

               -  At least two episodes of severe C. difficile within 6 months resulting in
                  hospitalization and associated with significant morbidity.

               -  For patients who have already been enrolled: Repeat FMT for patients who require
                  treatment with antibiotics for a recurrence.

          -  Patients greater than 7 years of age with unresponsive C. difficile:

               -  Moderate C. difficile colitis not responding to successive standard therapy (e.g.
                  metronidazole, vancomycin, and/or fidaxomicin) lasting at least 28 days.

               -  Severe and/or fulminant C. difficile colitis with no response to standard therapy
                  after 48 hours.

               -  Repeat FMT for patients already enrolled who require treatment with antibiotics
                  for a recurrence.
