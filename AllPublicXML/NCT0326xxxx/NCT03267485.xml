      &quot;Acute leukemia&quot; is defined by the World Health organization standards, in which greater than
      20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (Kabuto et al., 2006). Cure is a realistic
      goal and is achieved in more than 80% of affected children, although only 20-40% of adults
      are cured(Rose-Inman and Kuehl, 2014).

      There are two major forms of acute leukaemiasâ€”acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute
      myeloid leukaemia (AML) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an acute form of
      leukemiacharacterized by the overproduction and accumulation of cancerous, immature white
      blood cells, known as lymphoblasts(Rose-Inman and Kuehl, 2014).

      Internationally, ALL is more common in Caucasians than in Africans; it is more common in
      Hispanics and in Latin America(Greer, 2014; Urayama and Manabe, 2014).About 6,000 cases are
      reported in the United States every year(Inaba et al., 2013).

      Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML)Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a cancer of leukemic stem cells (LSCs)
      with a rapid progression. It is characterized by overproduction of immature myeloid cells in
      bone marrow which crowds out normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (Indian J Hematol Blood
      Transfus. 2017).

      DNA methylation is a covalent modification that is critical for the regulation of gene
      expression in a wide variety of biological contexts (Jaenisch and Bird, 2003; Bergman and
      Cedar, 2013). Methylation of DNA on cytosines is an important mechanism for silencing gene
      expression, and cytosine demethylation is required for gene activation (Ito et al., 2011; He
      et al., 2011). DNA methylation plays important roles in a variety of cellular processes,
      including genomic imprinting , X-chromosome inactivation and regulation of gene expression
      (Bird 2002).

      The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases, which includes
      Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 enzymes, has been recently implicated in DNA demethylation it converts
      5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) as well as to 5-formylcytosine and
      5-carboxylcytosine (Tahiliani et al., 2009; Ito et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2011a). 5hmC has
      been proposed to act as an intermediate in demethylation and the base-excision repair
      machinery (Guo et al., 2011a).

      Tet proteins contain several conserved domains (Tahiliani et al. 2009), including a CXXC
      domain that has high affinity for clustered unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and a catalytic
      domain that is typical of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenases (Loenarz
      and Schofield 2011) ), mutation of iron-binding sites of Tet proteins abolishes their
      enzymatic activities (Tahiliani et al. 2009; Ito et al. 2010). In addition,
      2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a competitive inhibitor of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, suppresses
      the catalytic activity of Tet proteins (W Xu et al. 2011).Both fully methylated and
      hemimethylated DNA in a CG or non-CG context can serve as substrates for TET1 (Tahiliani et
      al. 2009; Ficz et al. 2011; Pastor et al. 2011). In tumor cells, the normal pattern of DNA
      methylation is often altered, resulting in global hypomethylation of the genome in
      conjunction with hypermethylation at CpG islands within the promoters of critical genes such
      as tumor suppressors (Esteller, 2008).

      The TET1 gene, was initially identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a fusion partner
      of the histone H3 Lys 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) (Ono et al.
      2002; Lorsbach et al. 2003). TET1 is significantly upregulated and plays an oncogenic role in
      MLL-rearranged leukemia, rendering TET1 as a potential target for treating this form of
      hematopoietic malignancy ( Huang et al., 2013). Tet1 is abundantly expressed in hematopoietic
      stem/progenitor cells (HSC/HPCs) and differentiated lineages such as B cells and myeloid
      cells (Huang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2011 ; Moran-Crusio et al., 2011)

    <description>Real Time PCR is based on the detection of the fluorescence produced by a reporter molecule which increases, as the reaction proceeds. These fluorescent reporter molecules include dyes that bind to the double-stranded DNA or sequence specific probes . Moreover, there is no need for the post PCR processing which saves the resources and the time. .</description>
