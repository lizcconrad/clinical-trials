  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Partnership in Implementation Science for Geriatric Mental Health (PRISM) project
      proposes an evidence-based physical exercise intervention for older adults who exhibit
      behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The proposed evaluation study will
      conduct a randomized controlled trial with a Hybrid Type 3 design to compare the intervention
      arm that implements the culturally-adapted GTO model (GTO-ThAI) to deliver implementation
      support, with a control arm, which receives usual top-down administrative instruction for
      implementing a policy initiative.

  <detailed_description>

      The overall goal of this project is to establish a hub to integrate implementation research
      for scaling up sustainable, evidence-based mental health interventions with research
      capacity-building activities for East Asia. Specific scale-up study aims include: Aim 1:
      Assessing readiness for implementing the evidence-based physical exercise intervention for
      improving mental health of older adults in participating provinces of Thailand; Aim 2:
      Developing the GTO-ThAI implementation support model through a pre-implementation case study
      and formative evaluation; and Aim 3: Evaluation of implementation strategies and clinical
      outcomes through a hybrid Type 3 randomized trial to test an evidence-based implementation
      support strategy (i.e., the GTO-ThAI model) that emphasizes a systematic process to address
      implementation barriers to the delivery of the evidence-based physical exercise intervention
      (PEI), compared with the existing standard administrative procedures for delivering the same
      PEI.

    <intervention_model_description>The experimental group will receive physical exercise intervention (PEI) that is supported by standardized administrative procedures plus the GTO-ThAI implementation support system designed to improve the quality of implementation of the PEI program. The active comparator group will receive PEI that is supported only by standardized administrative procedures that the Thai government typically uses to promote policy-driven initiatives.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Adapted from the Quality Implementation Tool (Meyer et al., 2012), using a total score based on average of ratings, by site implementation team leaders, on a 7-point Likert scale over 48 items across eight dimensions of implementation (e.g. adoption, fidelity, dosage, program reach, differentiation, quality of implementation, implementation cost, sustainability).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BPSD will be assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), using the total score obtained by summing all the individual domain total scores; each domain score is the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score for that behavioral domain.</description>

    <description>The 12-week physical exercise intervention will be delivered by trained community health workers (CHW) who are supervised by nurses. The CHW will visit the patient's home—3 sessions per week for the first 2 weeks, followed by weekly visits for 6 weeks, and then weekly telephone support for 4 weeks—to instruct the family caregiver and the patient in the exercise routine. Each session includes physical activities designed to promote gentle stretching, strength, balance, flexibility, and endurance, with a progressive schedule (i.e., the total length of time increases from 10 minutes up to 30 minutes maximum) and its intensity adjusted based on the participant's level of fitness.</description>
