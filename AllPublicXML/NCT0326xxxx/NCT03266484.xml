  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is proposed as a single-site randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial
      requiring 4 study visits, where two of the visits are combined with their appointment for
      routine clinical care. The study population will consist of patients with quiescent CD and UC
      and IBD-unspecified recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital Crohn's and Colitis
      center. All eligible subjects will have a confirmed diagnosis of CD, UC, or IBD-unspecified
      according to accepted clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, and histologic criteria. Eligible
      patients will be contacted at the time of their routinely scheduled office visit and
      consented for the study. Self-report and review of medical records will be used to obtain
      detailed information regarding their disease on an intake questionnaire completed by a
      research study coordinator.

      The study is proposed as a 12-week double-blind randomized controlled trial of the probiotic
      supplement compared to placebo. We propose to examine the effect of a specific probiotic
      supplement on the changes in the gut microbiome, serum metabolomic profile, and fatigue
      symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD.

      Within 2 weeks of screening, eligible patients will be invited to visit MGH for a baseline
      visit. The patient will receive either the probiotic supplement or placebo for 4 weeks.

      The first follow up visit will be at week 4 to check for adverse events on study treatment,
      to check accountability of probiotics/placebo, and to complete the set of questionnaires.
      Also, subjects will receive probiotic/placebo samples for the remaining 8 weeks of treatment.

      At week 8, subjects will receive a phone call from a study research coordinator to check in
      with probiotics/placebo intake for treatment compliance and accountability records, and to
      complete the set of questionnaires ascertaining subjective symptoms.

      Last study visit will be at week 12 which is often combined with a regular office
      appointment. Subject will provide serum blood and stool sample, as well as complete the set
      of questionnaires.
