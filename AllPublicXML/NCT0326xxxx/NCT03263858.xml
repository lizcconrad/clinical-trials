        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is &gt; 18 years and &lt; 85 years old

          2. Written subject informed consent

          3. Subjects with stable or unstable angina pectoris or documented silent ischemia or
             hemodynamically stable NSTEMI patients

          4. Subject is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

          5. Subject is acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass surgery

          6. Subject is eligible for Dual Anti Platelet Therapy (DAPT)

          7. Subjects with a maximum of two single discrete de novo lesions in two separate native
             coronary arteries that can be treated with the study stent during the index procedure

          8. Reference vessel diameter of 3.0 mm to 3.8 mm by visual estimation.

          9. Target lesion length up to 22 mm by visual estimation.

         10. Target lesion with ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% stenosis by visual estimation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Left main coronary artery disease

          2. Three-vessel coronary artery disease at the time of index procedure

          3. Angiographic evidence of thrombus in target vessel

          4. Chronic total occlusion

          5. Heavily calcified or extremely tortuous lesions that would prevent complete inflation
             of a pre-dilatation balloon

          6. Bifurcation lesion requiring side branch intervention, if side branches &gt; 2mm in
             diameter are involved

          7. Ostial lesions (within 5 mm of vessel origin)

          8. In-stent restenosis

          9. Lesions with prior treatment with a drug coated balloon (DCB)

         10. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft

         11. Target lesion requires treatment with. rotational atherectomy

         12. Proximal or distal to the target lesion located stenosis that might require future
             revascularization or impede run off detected during diagnostic angiography

         13. Previous treatment of target vessel within 9 months of index-procedure

         14. Patients with cardiogenic shock

         15. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30%

         16. Impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl or 221 mmol/l, determined within
             72 hours prior to intervention)

         17. Hemodynamically unstable NSTEMI or STEMI within 72 hours prior to index procedure

         18. Cerebrovascular event (within 3 months of index procedure)

         19. Subject is receiving oral or intravenous immuno-suppressive therapy (inhaled steroids
             are allowed) or has known life-limiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g.
             human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, but not diabetes mellitus)

         20. Known allergies to: Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA), heparin, contrast medium, sirolimus,
             or similar drugs, exipients or the stent material

         21. Triple anticoagulation therapy

         22. Life expectancy less than 1 year

         23. Pregnant or breast-feeding females or females who intend to become pregnant during the
             time of the study

         24. Inability to understand or read the informed consent form

         25. Subject is currently participating in another study with an investigational device or
             an investigational drug and has not reached the primary endpoint yet

         26. In the investigators opinion subjects will not be able to comply with the follow-up
             requirements
