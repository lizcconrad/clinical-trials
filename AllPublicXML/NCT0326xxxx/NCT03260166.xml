      This clinical study will test the efficacy and safety of nicotinamide for lupus-associated
      skin lesions refractory to the treatment of hydroxychloroquine plus low-dose corticosteroids
      in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Backgrounds: Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an autoimmune disease affecting various organs.
      Lupus-associated skin lesions are the dominant clinical manifestations of cutaneous lupus
      erythematosus (CLE) and also occur in 70%~80% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE), and usually involve the sunlight-exposure sites such as the face, neck and hands,
      which affects the personal appearance dramatically and causes substantial psychological
      impact to the patients.

      While antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been widely used as a first-line
      treatment for lupus-associated skin lesions, 30% of patients with lupus do not respond to
      this medication. Other available therapies such as corticosteroids and thalidomide can also
      be applied, however, their toxic side effects limit the clinical use. Recent studies by the
      investigators have shown that nicotinamide, a water-soluble vitamin whose side effects are
      considered as minimal, can protect MRL/lpr mice (a lupus-like mouse model) from skin lesions
      and autoantibody production. Thus it is hypothesized that nicotinamide treatment could be a
      novel therapy for lupus-associated skin lesions in patients with LE.

      Design of Study: This is a single center, uncontrolled, open-label study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of nicotinamide for lupus-associated skin lesions refractory to the
      treatment of HCQ plus low-dose corticosteroids in patients with CLE or SLE.

      Methods: For CLE or SLE patients with lupus-associated skin lesions scoring &gt;=4 on the
      Revised Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (RCLASI) that have been
      refractory to the treatment of HCQ plus low-dose corticosteroids (&lt;=0.5 mg/kg/d) during the
      past two months, oral nicotinamide (500 mg twice daily) will be given consecutively for 3
      months while the current regimen including HCQ and corticosteroids be maintained without
      change. The end points include clinical response and immunological changes, as well as
      safety.
