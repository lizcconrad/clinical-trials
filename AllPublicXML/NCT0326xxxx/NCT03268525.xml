      The investigators aim is to study the effect of pre-operative local anesthetic on post
      vaginal hysterectomy pain.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial. To indicate a clinically significant reduction of
      postoperative pain, a sample size of 50 patients was calculated. Women admitted for elective
      vaginal hysterectomy, with or without anterior/posterior colporaphy, on benign indication
      would be offered to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria include age&lt;18 years,
      additional laparoscopic or abdominal procedures, operation time &gt; 3 hours, chronic pelvic
      pain, regular use of analgesic medication, and allergy to Marcaine.

      After giving written informed consent, the patients will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups: study group (injection of Mracine 0.5%), and control group (injection of Nacl 0.9%).

      A solution of Marcaine 0.5%, or NaCl 0.9% as a placebo, will be prepared prior to surgery, by
      one of the researchers (who is not one of the surgeons), according to the randomization. The
      surgeons, the pain assessing researchers, and the participating women will all be blinded to
      what the syringes contain. The solution will be injected before incision, and in a systematic
      fashion as a modified paracervical block. First, 2 ml will be injected through the vaginal
      fornices at 03.00, 06.00, 09.00, and 12.00 hours at 2 cm depth. Thus, 8 ml will be
      systematically injected around the cervical circumference before incision. In addition, 1 ml
      of the solution will be injected in each resection line (sacro-uterine and cardinal
      ligaments), adding up to a total of 10 ml. In case of performing additional anterior/
      posterior colporrhaphy, additional solution will be prepared blindly, according to the
      randomization: Marcaine 0.25%, or NaCl 0.9% as a placebo. Five ml of the solution will be
      injected to the cutting line of the anterior/ posterior vaginal wall, respectively, prior to
      incision. A total amount of 5-10 ml of Marcaine 0.25% or NaCl 0.9%, will be injected before
      anterior and/or posterior colporrhaphy is performed.

      Pain will be assessed using 10cm Visual-analogue-scale (VAS) at rest and during movement.

      Pain at rest will be scored with the woman lying in bed at 3, 8, and 24 hours after the
      operation. Movement-evoked pain will be scored at 8 and 24 hours after the operation, after
      the women will be asked to get up from bed, and sit in the chair.

      A uniformed, standardized, postoperative pain-relief regime will be conducted to all women,
      as follow:

        1. First-line: Dipyrone1 g, up to 4 times a day, orally - on request.

        2. Second-line: Paracetamol 1 g, up to 4 times a day, intravenously- on request.

        3. Third-line: Tramal 100mg + Pramine 10 mg, up to 3 times a day, intravenously- on
           request.
