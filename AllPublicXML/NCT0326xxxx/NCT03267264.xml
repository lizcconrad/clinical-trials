  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, prospective, open-label, randomized, 2 period cross over study
      comparing the subjects' current 32G pen needle (four groups of pen needles) to the BD Nucleus
      pen needle. The study will consist of two 15 day periods ( in which the subject will use each
      pen needle [BD Nucleus pen needle or subject's current pen needle, order randomized] for
      injection. At the end of the last study period, each subject will be asked to evaluate his or
      her perceptions using a 150mm relative VAS scale.

         11. A current or previous medical or physical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would place the patient at risk or make them unable to perform study
