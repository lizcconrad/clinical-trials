  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of blinatumomab and
      ponatinib can help to control Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (Ph+ ALL); BCR-ABL-positive ALL; or ALL that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to
      treatment (refractory). Ph+ and BCR-ABL positive are types of genetic mutations (changes).
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Blinatumomab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of other types of ALL. Ponatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of several types of leukemia, including some types of Ph+ ALL. It is
      investigational to use the study drugs in combination with each other.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 6 weeks. The first cycle is called an Induction Cycle, in which the study drugs
      are designed to create a response from the disease. Cycles 2-5 are called Consolidation
      Cycles, in which the drugs are designed to keep that disease response going. Cycles 6 and
      beyond are called Maintenance Cycles, in which just one study drug will be given to help keep
      the disease under control.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive a central venous
      catheter (CVC) if you do not already have one. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be
      placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this
      procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for
      this procedure.

      You will receive blinatumomab by vein non-stop on Days 1-28 of Cycles 1-5. Blinatumomab will
      be delivered by a small pump, which you will carry with you for the whole time you receive
      the drug. This allows you to receive the drug constantly over a long period of time. You will
      be given a shoulder or belt bag to hold the pump and infusion bag. You will be able to wear
      regular clothes, walk around, and perform daily living activities. You will be given
      instructions for taking a shower and other activities. However, because the line must be kept
      free of infection and connected to the pump at all times, some activities (like swimming) are
      not allowed during the study. The study staff will give you more information on activities
      you should not do while receiving the drug.

      If you have not been previously treated, you may need to stay in the hospital for your
      blinatumomab doses on Days 1-6 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2. Your doctor will
      discuss this option with you.

      If you do not have to stay overnight in the hospital for your doses, you will need to return
      to the clinic at certain times to have the infusion bag changed. This is performed
      approximately every 48 hours.

      You will receive dexamethasone by vein over 30 minutes within 1 hour before the start of each
      treatment cycle and at the time of any increase in dose to prevent side effects associated
      with blinatumomab treatment. If side effects do occur, you will receive dexamethasone by
      mouth or orally or by vein for 3 to 7 days.

      If you have not been previously treated, on Days 1, 15, and 29 of Cycles 1-4, you will also
      receive methotrexate and cytarabine. Methotrexate and cytarabine will be given intrathecally
      (by spinal tap) during a short infusion. If you are found to have disease in the brain/spinal
      cord, you may need to receive more doses after Cycle 4.

      You will take ponatinib by mouth each day during Weeks 1-4 of Cycle 1, followed by 2 weeks of
      no ponatinib. Beginning with Cycle 2, you will take ponatinib by mouth every day while you
      are on study.

      You will take between 1-2 tablets of ponatinib by mouth daily. The dose will be adjusted
      based on the status of the disease and if you experience any side effects with the higher
      dose. You should avoid taking antacids 2 hours before or after ponatinib. You doctor will
      discuss other drugs that you cannot take with ponatinib.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You will receive blinatumomab for up to 5 cycles. You may continue to receive ponatinib for
      as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take
      the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, the study
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest to stop taking part in the study, the study is
      cancelled, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) or two (2) times each week during Cycle 1, then every 1-3 weeks during Cycles 2-5,
      then every 4 to 8 weeks after that, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      On Days 28 and 42 of Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 5, then every 3-6 months after
      that, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration for cytogenetic testing and to check the
      status of the disease.

      Every 3-6 months, either your blood or bone marrow sample will also be used for biomarker
      testing.

      Follow-up:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, you may be called by a member of the study
      staff and asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be experiencing.
      This call should last about 5-10 minutes.

             if they have had a hysterectomy or are postmenopausal without menses for 12 months. In
             addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner
