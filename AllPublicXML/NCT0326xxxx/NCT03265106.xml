  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, uni-center, phase I/II study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of an experimental therapy called BinD19 cells in childhood patients with B-cell
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma, who are chemo-refractory, relapsed after allogeneic
      SCT, or are otherwise ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant.
