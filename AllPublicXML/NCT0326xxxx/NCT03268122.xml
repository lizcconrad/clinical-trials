  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired infections are common and frequently lead to poor outcomes, including
      death, in affected patients. Two common organisms that cause infections in the hospital are
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus
      (VRE). One strategy used to prevent these infections is contact isolation of hospitalized
      patients with MRSA and/or VRE. It is unclear whether contact isolation decreases the rate of
      infection with MRSA and/or VRE. The CONTACT-PILOT study is designed to test the hypothesis
      that contact isolation decreases the rate of infection with MRSA and/or VRE in patients in
      the intensive care unit (ICU). The study will enroll all adults in the Medical ICU and will
      run between September 2017 and April 2018. During some months, all patients in the Medical
      ICU patients will be placed in isolation for MRSA or VRE if they have a current infection or
      colonization with either organism, or a recent history thereof. During other months, patients
      will only be placed in isolation for MRSA or VRE if they have an active, highly-transmissible
      infection with either organism, such as a pneumonia or an open, draining wound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CONTACT-PILOT is a single center, pilot, multiple crossover, cluster-randomized trial of
      contact isolation for MRSA and VRE in the Vanderbilt Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in
      order to determine if contact isolation reduces the rate of ICU-acquired infection with MRSA
      and/or VRE. Specifically, the study will randomly assign the entire MICU to one of two
      contact isolation strategies for 2 months, and then switch the entire MICU over to the second
      strategy. The first strategy is the current practice, also referred to as standard contact
      isolation, which is to place all patients with MRSA and/or VRE infection or colonization (or
      a history of either) on contact isolation. The second strategy is targeted contact isolation,
      in which patients with MRSA and/or VRE would only be placed on contact isolation if they have
      an active infection with one (or both) of these organisms with a high risk of transmission,
      such as an open, draining wound or a pneumonia. The study will be divided into four
      alternating 2-month treatment blocks, two for each strategy, with one &quot;run-in&quot; week at the
      start of each treatment block in order to transition between the two treatment strategies,
      for a total study duration of 8 months. The interventions will occur between September 1,
      2017 and April 30, 2018. All adult MICU patients will be enrolled in the study. The primary
      outcome will be the rate of new ICU-acquired MRSA and VRE infections. Data analysis will be
      performed using a pre-specified data analysis plan. This study is being performed as a
      preliminary study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the study plan.
