      To evaluate whether indomethacin eyedrops plus intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) provides
      additional benefit over IVR monotherapy for treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
      in age-related macular degeneration.

    <intervention_model_description>This was a prospective, randomized, pilot study in 58 patients with naï ve CNV. Patients were randomized 1:1 into 2 groups: ranibizumab monotherapy (RM group) and ranibizumab plus indomethacin (RI group). All patients received monthly 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injections for 3 months, after which monthly injections were administered pro re nata. RI patients also self- administered one drop of indomethacin three times a day for 12 months. All patients were followed up for 12 months.</intervention_model_description>
