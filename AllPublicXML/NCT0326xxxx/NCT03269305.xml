      The study is to assess whether the staff in gastroenterology unit are sticking to the agreed
      up on unit's protocol in management of chronic diarrhea over the period of one year(september
      2017-september 2018)

      chronic diarrhea is defined as having loose or watery stools more than three times
      aday.Awakening at night to pass stools us often sign of an organic cause of diarrhea.In some
      cases chronic diarrhea is the result of intestinal infection that persists longer than
      expected. In other cases chronic diarrhea is apart of a systemic illness.

      Etiology:

        1. post enteritis diarrhea syndrome in whic small intestinal mucosal damage persists after
           acute gastroenteritis.Also secondary disaccharidase deficiency and reinfection may be a
           cause.

        2. infectious causes:enteric infection is an important cause.Associated conditions may be
           T.B or impaired immunity as in malnutrition potentiating the likely-hood of prolonging
           or acquiring another infection.Viral infection like Rota virus,parasites as
           E.coli,Giardia lamblia as well as amebiasis have been implicated in chronic diarrhea.

        3. Cytomegalovirus on the other hand may act as an opportunistic agent in immuno
           compromised patients.

        4. Non infectious causes include cow's milk allergy,lactose intolerance and inflammatory
           bowel disease,all of which may cause chronic diarrhea that is often associated with
           abdominal pain with or without elevated levels of inflammatory markers.

        5. Malabsorption syndrome e.g Celiac disease,cystic fibrosis where the stools are usually
           fatty in nature and bulky in amount.

      Good management of chronic diarrhea must include investigations and treatment.A protocol must
      be followed accurately therefore.

      Methodology:

      measurment of the degree of sticking of staff in Gastro-enterology unit to the agreed upon
      unit's protocol in management of chronic diarrhea over the period of one year (September
      2017-September 2018).
