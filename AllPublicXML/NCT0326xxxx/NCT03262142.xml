  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized multi-center trial investigating the impact of lower airway
      infection with P. aeruginosa in COPD patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate if
      targeted antibiotic therapy against P. aeruginosa can improve the prognosis in patients with
      COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      P. aeruginosa represents a potentially significant cause of acute exacerbation of COPD
      (AECOPD) and is possibly associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite this,
      the role of P. aeruginosa in the course of COPD is less well characterized, and evidence
      based guidelines for management and treatment of the bacteria are lacking.

      P. aeruginosa is more likely to be isolated from patients with more advanced disease and
      severely impaired lung function. It is, however, difficult to draw definitive conclusions
      regarding the extent to which the bacteria contributes to adverse clinical outcomes since
      severely reduced lung function by itself is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with
      COPD. Infection with P. aeruginosa might therefore be secondary to damaged lung tissue and
      decreased lung function, and thereby have no independent impact on the prognosis

      So far, and to the investigators best knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has been
      conducted to investigate whether specific antibiotic treatment of P. aeruginosa can reduce
      the risk of new exacerbations and improve the long-term prognosis of COPD patients.

      In Denmark, the first choice of treatment for P. aeruginosa is usually a 10-14 day therapy of
      intravenous combination treatment of P. aeruginosa active antibiotics
      (piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin).

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether the intervention with targeted pseudomonas
      active antibiotics can reduce the loss of lung function, reduce the frequency of
      exacerbations and mortality.
