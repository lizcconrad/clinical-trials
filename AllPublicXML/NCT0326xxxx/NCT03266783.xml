  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apixaban and rivaroxaban have been compared to standard therapy for treatment of acute
      symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and are both
      approved by Health Canada. No safety or efficacy data is available from direct head-to-head
      comparison of these two anticoagulants. Lawsuits in the United States over bleeding events,
      patient perceptions, and concerns with medication adherence are additional factors
      highlighting the importance of a comparison trial. This multi-center, pragmatic, prospective,
      randomized, open-label, blinded end-point (PROBE) trial aims to compare the safety of
      apixaban and rivaroxaban for the treatment of VTE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VTE is the third leading cause of mortality by cardiovascular disease. Standard treatment for
      acute VTE uses a combination of parenteral Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) and oral
      vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for 3 months, and carries significant bleeding risk. The major
      and/or clinically-relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) event rate is reported between 8.1-9.7%
      during initial treatment. This treatment is burdensome owing to subcutaneous injections, drug
      interactions, and laboratory monitoring. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are simpler to
      use and do not require laboratory monitoring.

      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are two DOACs targeting Factor Xa. Each DOAC was separately proven
      effective and safe when compared to standard treatment. Comparison of the bleeding rates
      between studies would favour use of apixaban over rivaroxaban; however, trial limitations and
      lack of direct comparison between these two agents makes it impossible to draw firm
      conclusions. This represents a dilemma in clinical practice because the absence of convincing
      differences in safety has led to genuine uncertainty about which DOAC has the best
      risk-to-benefit ratio.

      To address these limitations, a head-to-head randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to
      determine the safety (i.e. bleeding risk) of twice daily apixaban over once daily rivaroxaban
      during the first 3 months of acute VTE treatment. Eligibility criteria will be less stringent
      than the COBRRA pilot study and reflect real-world patients. Cost-effective analysis of
      apixaban twice daily compared to rivaroxaban once daily will also be performed.
