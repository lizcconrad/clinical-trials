  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wellness Rx is a 6 class prescription for a healthier lifestyle developed for people in Lake
      County at all levels of health including those struggling with chronic disease. The classes
      are running across the community at all times. It is designed for patients that could benefit
      from healthy diet, exercise, and other healthy lifestyle modifications.

      For those participants attending the classes, they have the option of engaging in this
      evaluation. For those that do, participants will answer questions about their current
      lifestyle, their and their previous history. They will register attendance at each class and
      answer questions about their perception of the class. Then at 45 days and 90 days the
      participants will revisit the same baseline lifestyle questionnaires.

      As participants attend classes, and complete questionnaires, they'll unlock grocery credits
      from online food store ThriveMarket, a basket of fresh produce from the local farmers market
      and local fitness classes to help you towards your goals. The use of these credits will be
      tracked through the 90-day point.
