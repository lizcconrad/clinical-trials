      Each subject will undergo a total of 9 visits. Subjects' eligibility will be assessed at
      Screening, which can occur up to 28 days prior to dosing. Following a repeat eligibility
      check at Day 0, eligible subjects will be randomized and dosed with the randomized treatment
      (BPL HRIG /vaccine or Comparator HRIG/vaccine on Day 0. Further administration of assessments
      will be conducted on Days 3, 5, 7, 14, 28, 49 and the end of study assessment on Day 140.

          -  No previous exposure to rabies virus, rabies vaccine and/or rabies immunoglobulin.

          -  No significant abnormalities in hematology, biochemistry, or urinalysis according to
             the Principal Investigator's judgment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant and/or lactating.

             within the last 3 months.

          -  Planned live virus vaccination, e.g., measles, mumps, varicella or rubella vaccine,
             within the 3 months after Day 0.

          -  History of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid hypersensitivity reactions to chicken egg;
             history of mild allergic reactions to chicken egg, e.g., skin rash only, is not an
             exclusion criterion

             rabies vaccine (US-FDA approved) e.g.: neomycin, bovine gelatin, trace amounts of
             chicken protein, chlortetracycline, and amphotericin B and in accordance with the
             product insert of the vaccine.

          -  Presence of psychiatric disorder, other mental disorder or any other medical disorder
             which might impair the subject's ability to give informed consent or to comply with
             the requirements of the study protocol.

          -  Previous enrolment in this study.

          -  Participation in an interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to baseline
             visit (Day 0).
