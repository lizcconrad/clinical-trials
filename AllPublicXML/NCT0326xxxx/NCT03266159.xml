  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK525762 is a novel inhibitor of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins. Trametinib is
      a potent inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase proteins (MEK1 and MEK2).
      GSK525762 and trametinib are critical for growth and survival of tumor cells. This will be
      the first study demonstrating the synergistic effect of BET inhibitor and MEK inhibitor
      administered together against tumor cell growth. This study aims to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of combination of GSK525762 and trametinib
      when administered concomitantly to subjects with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and rat
      sarcoma virus oncogene homolog (Ras) mutated solid tumors. The study will be conducted in two
      parts; part 1 will consists of dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts and part 2 will
      consists of four disease specific cohorts (SCLC, Ras-mutated adenocarcinoma [RMAC] of the
      colon [Ras-mutated colorectal cancer {RMCRC}] and/or rectum, Ras-mutated non small cell lung
      cancer [RMNSCLC], Ras-mutated pancreatic adenocarcinoma [RMPAC]) and an optional &quot;basket&quot;
      cohort (Ras-pathway activated solid tumors [RAST]). Part 1 will focus on selection of the
      Part 2 dose based on safety/tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy. Part 2 will investigate the
      overall response rate and clinical response. The total duration of study will be
      approximately three years (nine to twelve months for part 1 and two years for part 2).
      Approximately 138-156 subjects will be enrolled in the study.
