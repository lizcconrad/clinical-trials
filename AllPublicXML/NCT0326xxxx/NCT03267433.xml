    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies rituximab after stem cell transplant and to see how
      well it works compared with rituximab alone in treating patients with in minimal residual
      disease-negative mantle cell lymphoma in first complete remission. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving
      chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body
      and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to
      grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. More
      chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem
      cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed
      by the chemotherapy. Giving rituximab with or without stem cell transplant may work better in
      treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients in minimal residual
      disease (MRD)-negative first remission who undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (auto-HCT) followed by maintenance rituximab versus (vs.) maintenance
      rituximab alone (without auto-HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression-free survival in MCL patients in MRD-negative first remission who
      undergo auto-HCT followed by maintenance rituximab vs. maintenance rituximab alone.

      II. To define the overall survival and progression-free survival at 2 and 5 years of
      chemosensitive but MRD-positive (or MRD-indeterminate) patients who undergo auto-HCT followed
      by 2 years of maintenance rituximab.

      III. To describe the rate of complications (serious infection, hospitalization, need for
      intravenous immune globulin) in MCL patients undergoing maintenance rituximab following
      auto-HCT.

      IV. To determine the prognostic impact of MRD status at day 100, in MCL patients who were
      MRD-positive prior to auto-HCT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive standard of care preparative chemotherapy and undergo auto-HCT.
      Beginning 60-120 days after transplant, patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) once
      every 8 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care induction chemotherapy. Beginning 40-120 days
      after completion of chemotherapy, patients receive rituximab as in Group I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 and 6 months for 10
      years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SCREENING (STEP 0 - PREREGISTRATION)

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed mantle cell lymphoma, with documented
             cluster of differentiation (CD19) or CD20 expression and cyclin D1 (BCL1) by
             immunohistochemical stains and/or t(11;14) by cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ
             hybridization (FISH); the diagnosis must be confirmed by formal hematopathology review
             at the enrolling center, including assessment of Ki-67 proliferation index (=&lt; 30%
             versus &gt; 30% versus ?indeterminate? Ki-67 index)

          -  Patients should be deemed to be potentially eligible and willing candidates for
             auto-HCT by the enrolling physician

          -  Patient may be receiving or have completed induction therapy within 60 days prior to
             preregistration to step 0; no more than 300 days may have passed between the first day
             of induction therapy and preregistration to step 0

               -  For patients who have completed induction therapy, restaging evaluation must show
                  status of partial (PR) or complete response (CR); patients preregistered
                  post-induction with evidence of clinical disease progression are not eligible for
                  preregistration

               -  Up to two regimens of chemotherapy are allowed as long as a continuous response
                  was ongoing throughout therapy

                    -  NOTE: For example, a patient who started treatment with
                       rituximab/bendamustine and was then switched to

                       sulfate, and prednisone (CHOP) (due to insufficient response or excessive
                       toxicity) would be counted as having received 2 regimens; however, R-CHOP
                       alternating with R-dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP)
                       as a planned induction regimen would count as one regimen

          -  Patient does not have any documented history of central nervous system (CNS)
             involvement by mantle cell lymphoma; this includes no evidence of parenchymal brain,
             spinal cord, or cerebrospinal fluid involvement; radiculopathy symptoms from nerve
             root compression by lymphoma do not constitute CNS involvement

             Biotechnologies for ClonoSEQ ID molecular marker identification of unique clonal
             immunoglobulin deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence

               -  NOTE: Patients for whom the molecular marker is identified will have peripheral
                  blood collected after completion of induction (patient?s disease status is PR or
                  CR) and submitted to Adaptive Biotechnologies for minimal residual disease (MRD)
                  assessment

             of transplant (?day 0?) must not be greater than 365 days after the first dose of
             induction chemotherapy (C1D1) given

               -  Patient must have received at least four (4) cycles of induction therapy

               -  Up to two regimens of chemotherapy are allowed as long as a continuous response

                       response or excessive toxicity) would be counted as having received 2
                       regimens; however, R-CHOP alternating with R-DHAP as a planned induction
