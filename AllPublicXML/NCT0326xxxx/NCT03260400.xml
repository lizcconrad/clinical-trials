    <textblock>
      The device, a bipolar percutaneous intramuscular electromyography electrode, is intended for
      use in upper-limb amputation patients who have received the regenerative peripheral nerve
      interface surgical procedure, in order to enable the use of advanced prosthetic arms and
      hands.

    <description>Change in Pain Level as measured by SF-36 survey Pain will be assessed using the SF-36 survey instrument, to be filled out by the participant before and after each surgical procedure performed and at a minimum of once per month while electrodes remain implanted. Two questions related to pain with a score closer to 0 means a pain increase</description>

    <description>Change in Pain Level as measured by LANSS survey Pain will be assessed using the LANSS survey instrument, to be filled out by the participant before and after each surgical procedure performed and at a minimum of once per month while electrodes remain implanted. A score greater than 12 indicates neuropathic pain.</description>

    <measure>RPNI tissue degeneration measured by volume during ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>RPNI tissue degeneration will be assessed by ultrasound measurement of the length and diameter of the RPNI. This will be performed before electrode implantation and at a minimum of once per month while electrodes remain implanted. Ultrasound will also be used to assess electrode migration outside of the implanted RPNI graft or muscle.</description>

    <description>In this arm, participants will have an initial surgery to place partial muscle grafts on the amputated nerves.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be 22years of age or older.

          -  Participants must have previously undergone an upper limb amputation proximal to the
             wrist.

          -  For participants without existing RPNI grafts (at the time of enrollment), the
             residual limb must have sufficient soft tissue quality to support performance of the
             RPNI operative 305 8procedures. Participants sustaining severe crushing or avulsion
             injuries with substantial superficial and deep scarring may not be appropriate
             candidates for inclusion in the study. Â°Participants must be in good health and
             American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class I (low surgical risk).

          -  Participants must live within 2 hours of the University of Michigan Hospital.

          -  Participants must have reliable transportation.

          -  Participants must be able to attend at minimum 2 visits per month while electrodes
             remain implanted.

          -  Participants must be at least 12 months post-amputation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants may not be suffering from any severe pain syndrome including complex
             regional pain syndrome or severe phantom pain. All of these conditions would suggest
             pathological activity of the nerve and would exclude the participant from
             participation.

          -  Participants must not be suffering from any untreated mental health disorders and if
             they have any DSM-5 diagnoses, they must receive approval to participate from their
             mental health professional.

          -  Participants must not have any medical conditions that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, would place them at high risk for a surgical procedure
             including recent myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, deep venous
             thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, uncontrolled diabetes, or end stage renal disease.

          -  Participants must not have used tobacco for at least one month prior to enrollment in
             the study.

          -  Participants must agree to not use tobacco for the duration of the study.

          -  Participants cannot have sustained bilateral upper extremity amputation.

          -  Participants cannot be pregnant.

          -  Participants must not have other indwelling electronic implants like pacemakers,
             implantable cardioverter defibrillators, implantable neurostimulators, body worn
             insulin pumps, or body worn patient monitoring devices.

          -  Participants must not have severe peripheral vascular occlusive disease, venous
             hypertension of the extremity, or severe lymphedema of the extremity.

          -  Participants must not have an autoimmune condition which is not well controlled by
             medication.

          -  Participants must not be older than 65 years of age.
