      The purpose of the China Evera MRI® study is to confirm safety of the Evera MRI ICD System in
      the clinical MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) environment when subjects receive MRI scans up
      to 2W/kg Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) without positioning restrictions (MRI scans may occur
      anywhere on the body). Long-term device effects, such as long-term lead integrity, will not
      be assessed in the China Evera MRI® study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are indicated for implantation of an ICD at the time of study enrollment.

          -  Subjects who are able to undergo a pectoral implant.

          -  Subjects who are able and willing to undergo elective MRI scanning without sedation ,
             .

          -  Subjects who are geographically stable and available for follow-up at the study site
             for the length of the study.

          -  Subjects who are at least 18 years of age (or older, if required by local law).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of significant tricuspid valvular disease that precludes the
             ability to place the RV lead. .

          -  Subjects who may be contraindicated to the dexamethasone sodium phosphate and/or
             dexamethasone acetate.

          -  Subjects who require a legally authorized representative to obtain informed consent.

          -  Subjects with abandoned or capped leads.

          -  Subjects who require an indicated MRI scan, other than those specifically described in
             the China Evera MRI® study, before the one-month post-MRI follow-up (approximately 4
             months post-implant).

          -  Subjects with a non-MRI compatible device (such as neurostimulators) or material
             implant (e.g., non-MRI compatible sternal wires, neurostimulators, biostimulators,
             metals or alloys).

          -  Subjects with medical conditions that preclude the testing required by the CIP or
             limit study participation.

          -  Subjects who are enrolled or intend to participate in another clinical trial (of an
             investigational drug or device, new indication for an approved drug or device, or
             requirement of additional testing beyond standard clinical practice) during the China
             Evera MRI® study. Co-enrollment in concurrent trials is only allowed when documented
             pre-approval is obtained from the Medtronic study manager.

          -  Female patient who is pregnant, or of childbearing potential and not on a reliable
             form of birth control. Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative
             pregnancy test within seven (7) days prior to device implant

          -  Subjects with exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g., age, breastfeeding).

          -  Subjects who are diagnosed with terminal disease with life expectancy less than 4
             months.
