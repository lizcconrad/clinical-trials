  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a non-randomized clinical trial to examine the effect of pure
      oxygen breathing on the brain. The study will compare cerebral blood flow, cortical
      electrical activity, and cognitive performance in 32 persons during room air (21% oxygen)
      breathing and pure oxygen (100% oxygen) breathing. Subjects will be used as their own
      controls. The investigators aim to:

        1. Determine whether breathing 100% oxygen changes blood flow through the brain. The
           investigators will learn whether brain blood flow is increased, decreased or stays the
           same.

        2. Determine if changes that might occur in brain blood flow are also accompanied by
           changes in the brain's electrical activity (EEG).

        3. Learn whether changes in the speed at which the brain processes information (cognitive
           function) accompany changes in brain blood flow and electrical activity that may be
           seen.

      The investigators will conduct a two-arm crossover design clinical trial to compare the
      effect of room air breathing (21% inspired oxygen) with pure oxygen breathing (100% inspired
      oxygen) on brain blood flow and cortical electrical activity. The study involves a one-time
      data collection taking place at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center on the Case
      Western Reserve University campus in Cleveland, OH. The investigators will perform
      neuroimaging (MRI) with electroencephalographic (EEG) cortical network mapping and cognitive
      assessments in all participants during room air breathing and again while breathing 100% pure
      oxygen. Oxygen will be delivered through a non-rebreather mask. Arterial blood partial
      pressure of oxygen (PaO2) will be measured twice, from arterial blood samples drawn during
      breathing room air prior to the MRI scan and again after 30 minutes of breathing 100% oxygen
      immediately following neuroimaging. Thus, the investigators will be able to determine if
      breathing pure oxygen may temporarily change brain blood flow and breathing, leading to
      changes in cognitive status such as euphoria or slowed reflexes. Information gained in this
      study may have direct operational relevance by helping us to understand one potential cause
      of &quot;Unexplained Physiologic Events&quot; that are reported in some aircraft pilots when flying at
      high altitude. Information gained could lead to development of new gas mixtures for use by
      personnel working in low oxygen high altitude environments.
