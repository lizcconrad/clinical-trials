  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than a third of US Veterans who receive care through the VHA are obese, putting them at
      higher risk for multiple serious chronic health conditions. Developing evidence-based
      programs that are scalable, cost-efficient and serve a diverse Veteran population is a
      priority for the VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP). While
      the VA's MOVE! program is an effective lifestyle intervention for obesity, its reach had been
      limited. Some Veterans may best achieve weight loss with in-person group visits or by
      internet and mobile technology-intensive programs, while others with a population-based,
      self-directed program that uses minimal technology. This trial will examine the effectiveness
      of a 12-month self-directed, low technology, and low resource lifestyle program. The program
      uses a series of DVD sessions focused on healthy eating and physical activity, and encourages
      participants to monitor their weight, diet, and physical activity for 24-months. For those
      who want to, participants will be able to work with a lifestyle coach to help meet weight and
      activity goals. The investigators hope the program will lead to modest, clinically meaningful
      weight loss and increased physical activity among obese Veterans. If successful, this trial
      may help ease the burden that obesity places on Veterans and the health care system.

      More than a third of US Veterans who receive care through the VHA are obese, putting them at
      higher risk for multiple serious chronic health conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular
      disease, hypertension, and stroke. Losing even small amounts of weight can reduce the risks
      associated with those conditions. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of weight loss
      treatment. While efficacious lifestyle interventions for obesity exist, finding
      evidence-based programs that are scalable, cost-efficient, and serves a diverse VA population
      is a priority for the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP). In
      response, VA disseminated MOVE! Weight Management Program for Veterans (MOVE!) in 2006, a
      comprehensive, evidenced-based intervention that combines diet and physical activity
      counseling with behavior change strategies. MOVE! results in meaningful weight loss for those
      who actively engage in the program, but less than 5% of Veterans eligible for the program
      participate, and among those, few participate at a level that would result in meaningful
      weight loss. To address the growing burden that obesity places on Veterans and the health
      care system, VA now faces the challenge to improve access to comprehensive lifestyle
      interventions using a patient-centered and population-based approach. The investigators aim
      to fill this gap by producing evidence on the effectiveness of a proven 12-month pragmatic
      DVD-based self-directed lifestyle intervention targeting modest, clinically meaningful weight
      loss and increased physical activity among obese Veterans. The curriculum, aimed at gradual
      weight loss through progressive healthful changes in diet quality and physical activity and
      behavioral skills training, is grounded in the Diabetes Prevention Program's (DPP) Group
      Lifestyle Balance (GLB) 12-session DVD. The program encourages supplementary goal setting and
      self-monitoring via the Heart360 website, and optional remote lifestyle coaching. The
      investigators propose to leverage the VA's Corporate Data Warehouse to identify and enroll
      500 obese Veterans. The investigators will randomize participants to receive usual care or
      the lifestyle intervention. As primary outcomes, the investigators will test whether,
      compared with usual care controls, intervention participants have better outcomes through 12
      months of follow-up on weight loss and self-reported physical function. Secondary outcomes
      through 24 months include sustained weight loss, physical function, physical activity,
      sedentary behavior, diet quality, blood pressure, sleep quality, self-efficacy, and program
      reach. Dissemination work with NCP includes development of toolkits and budget impact
      analyses. The investigators hypothesize that intervention participants will have more weight
      loss and improved physical function, as well as improvements in physical activity, sedentary
      behavior, diet quality, blood pressure, sleep quality, and self-efficacy.
