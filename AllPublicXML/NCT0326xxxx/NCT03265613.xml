    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Adipose-derived
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (AD-MSCs) with moderate to severe psoriasis. Any adverse events
      related to AD-MSCs infusion will be monitored.The primary outcome is the reduction rate of
      PASI(Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and treatment response will be computed from PASI
      before and after AD-MSCs infusion.

    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both.
      Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis.
      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,
      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and
      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or
      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to
      find new treatment for psoriasis.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into
      bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were
      isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris
      and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease,
      involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions,
      limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs
      could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.
