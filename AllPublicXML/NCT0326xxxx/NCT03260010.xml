      The PROOF Study is an open prospective interventional non-randomized study which aim is to
      determine the outcome / effect and safety of fosfomycin in patients with hip, knee or
      shoulder PJI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To confirm a non-inferior effect and the safety of the investigated antimicrobial fosfomycin
      regimen in PJI of the hip, knee or shoulder against an assumed 80% effect (PJI-free
      proportion within one year for standard antibiotics aside fosfomycin), following a
      standardized surgical therapy involving retention, one-stage exchange or two-stage exchange
      (with short or long interval).

    <intervention_model_description>In this open prospective interventional clinical study patients with hip, knee or shoulder PJI (as defined below) caused by fosfomycin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci or gram-negative bacilli will be included. After inclusion and PJI-surgery, intravenous fosfomycin will be given 5 g every 8 hours for 1, 2, 3-or -4 weeks according to the pathogen and surgery procedure and generally as a part of the antibiotic combination therapy of the treatment algorithm. This Treatment is followed by oral antibiotics for a total of 3 months.</intervention_model_description>

             suppository); bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral tubal
             occlusive procedure (at least till the end of the ambulatory treatment phase);

          8. Subject has been previously enrolled in this study or was enrolled in another
             interventional medicinal product or medical device study in the last 30 days;

          9. Subject had prior exposure to fosfomycin within the past 4 weeks;

         10. Inability to read and understand the participant's information;

         11. Subjects institutionalized by warrant or court order;

         13. In pre surgery culture negative patients: All isolates unsusceptible to fosfomycin
