  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to infusion CD19 CAR-T cells to the patients with relapsed and
      refractory CD19+ B cell leukemia, to assess the safety and feasibility of this strategy. The
      CAR enables the T cell to recognize and kill the leukemic cell through the recognition of
      CD19, a protein expressed of the surface of the leukemic cell in patients with CD19+
      leukemia.

      Upon meeting the eligibility requirements and enrolling on study, Subjects will be collected
      large numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for the generation of the CD19
      CAR-T cells. The T cells are isolated from the PBMC, transduced with a lentivirus to express
      the CD19 CAR as well as a truncated EGFR that has no signaling capacity (noted EGFRt) and
      expanded in vitro and then administered to subjects.

      Subjects will have blood tests to assess safety and efficacy, and persistence of the CD19
      CAR-T cells on week 4 after their last infusion. Following the 6 months of intensive
      follow-up, subjects will be evaluated every 10 weeks for 1 year with a physical examination,
      blood tests, bone marrow aspirate, MRD and persistence of CD19 CAR-T.

      Some subjects will receive cetuximab for ablation of the genetically modified T cells.
      Criteria to receive cetuximab include acute toxicities that are life threatening.
