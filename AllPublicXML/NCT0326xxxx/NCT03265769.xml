  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pecutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusions (CTOs) is most commonly
      performed using bilateral transfemoral access and 8 French guiding catheters. However,
      transfemoral approach (TFA) is associated with higher risk of vascular access complications.5
      It has been reported that using transradial approach (TRA) reduces vascular complications and
      may be associated with a better clinical outcome. Transradial access is also used in complex
      PCI interventions.There is a growing body of evidence regarding the use of this approach also
      in CTO procedures. In available literature, all studies comparing TRA vs. TFA in CTO
      consisted of single center and single operator experience. Besides, none of them is
      randomized. To fill in the gap, we sought to examine the technique and outcomes of
      transradial vs. transfemoral CTO PCI in a contemporary multicenter randomized study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients undergoing a coronary CTO procedures between November 2017 and
      November 2018 at the catheterization laboratories of Acibadem University Kocaeli Hospital,
      Memorial Hospital Istanbul and Adapazarı Education and Training Hospital were considered to
      be enrolled in the study. The exclusion criteria are any acute coronary syndrome within 3
      months and failure to provide written informed consent. The patients are going to be
      randomized into 2 arms corresponding to 2 different strategies of CTO access approach. The
      intention was to include 400 patients with 200 patients in each group. All procedures are
      going to be performed by 3 interventional cardiologists at 3 different centers. The protocol
      was approved by the institutional review board and written informed consent is going to be
      provided by all patients.
