  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this acute intervention study is to examine the potential of minerals
      combined with botanicals to demonstrate unique and synergistic effects on oscillatory brain
      activity, cognitive performance, and stress reduction (endocrine, sympathetic, and subjective
      parameters) under conditions of acute stress in moderately stressed individuals
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Botanicals in isolation or combined, will be administered with a mineral and vitamin complex
      to moderately stressed, healthy adults in a parallel groups fashion in this randomised
      placebo controlled trial. Oscillatory brain activity (EEG) during rest and performance on
      cognitive tasks of attention will be examined after treatment intake under conditions of
      acute laboratory stress. The effects of treatments on stress responses (cardiovascular,
      subjective and cortisol responses) will also be assessed.
