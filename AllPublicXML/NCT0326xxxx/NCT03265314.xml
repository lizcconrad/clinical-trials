  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alternatives For Girls (AFG) is offering LeadHer as a gender-specific teen pregnancy
      prevention curriculum to girls between the ages of 14-19 years old who live in Wayne County,
      MI. The curriculum seeks to demonstrate that girls who participate in LeadHer will show
      increased rates of avoidance of unprotected sex, will show increased use of birth control and
      reduced rates of pregnancy. LeadHer will run over a 6-session period covering topics designed
      to prevent teen pregnancy and develop girls into leaders. The sessions will be co-led by
      youth (Peer Educators).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LeadHer is a 30-hour curriculum provided under rigorous evaluation, random assignment
      protocols and covering factual information related to sexual intercourse, including the risks
      of sex, sexually transmitted infections and use of birth control, along with the following
      adult preparation topics: Healthy relationships, Adolescent development, Healthy life skills,
      and Educational and career success.

      The project is designed to run for five years; years 2 through 4 will involve providing the
      intervention curriculum to a total of 300 girls. There will be a control group, Sassy Science
      running in tandem with LeadHer for 300 girls. Groups will take place at the Alternatives For
      Girls facility as well as off-site within the community at local schools, primarily during
      after-school hours and community centers.

    <intervention_model_description>Person-level random control trial. Participants randomly assigned to intervention (LeadHer) OR control (Sassy Science). Unit of analysis is individual (not groups/clusters). Baseline data collection is before randomization, in enrollment sessions, to prevent differential attrition post-randomization. Randomization via database developed for project. Evaluation Strategies (AFG's independent partner) developed an automated randomization method via random number generator. All randomized participants are tracked for study duration. In database, the button disappears once randomization occurs. The button is not active until consent/assent and all baseline measures are input to database. This randomization will occur after enrollment session, once enough participants for a cohort are enrolled. This helps prevent post-random sample loss. Randomization is electronic, via database, before first session. Once randomization occurs, AFG contacts enrolled girls about which their assigned program.</intervention_model_description>
