      The following hypothesis will be tested in this study:

        1. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a safe, tolerable procedure.

        2. The fecal microbial diversity, composition and function in stool recipients after fecal
           transplantation will change to a similar microbial diversity, composition and
           functionality as found in donor stool.

      Primary objectives:

      1. To determine the short term safety and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation up
      to 12 weeks post-transplant in patients with Crohn's disease.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To determine the long term safety and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation
           (FMT) up to one year post transplant in patients with Crohn's disease.

        2. To compare microbial diversity in healthy donor stools compared to pre-FMT recipient
           stools collected from patients (recipients) with Crohn's disease.

        3. To compare microbial composition in healthy donor stools compared to pre-FMT recipient
           stools from patients (recipients) with Crohn's disease.

        4. To compare microbial function in healthy donor stools compared to pre-FMT recipient
           stools from patients (recipients) with Crohn's disease

        5. To compare microbial diversity in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with
           1 week post-transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients) with
           Crohn's disease.

        6. To compare microbial composition in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools
           with 1 week post-transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients)
           with Crohn's disease.

        7. To compare microbial function in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with
           1 week post-transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients) with
           Crohn's disease.

        8. To compare microbial diversity in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with
           12 week post transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients)
           with Crohn's disease.

        9. To compare microbial composition in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools
           with 12 week post transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients
           (recipients) with Crohn's disease.

       10. To compare microbial function in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with
           12 week post transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients)
           with Crohn's disease.

       11. Stool calprotectin levels will be measured in the recipient at baseline pre-FMT, 1 week
           and 12 weeks post FMT to determine if FMT causes a statistically significant change.

    <description>Fecal DNA samples will undergo V3-V4 16S rRNA sequencing. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be produced by clustering sequences with identical taxonomic assignments. Alpha diversity indices (e.g. Chao1, Shannon complexity H, Shannon Evenness H/Hmax) will be calculated inferred through 1000 replicate resamplings using Explicet. Beta diversity (Bray-Curtis and Jaccard distances) will be calculated for the recipient Pre-FMT, 1 week post-FMT and 12 weeks post-FMT as compared to their pared donor using the adonis function in the R vegan package at the phyla, family and genus level. A linear mixed model will be used to compare alpha-diversity (ShannonH) and beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis and Jaccard distance) between each timepoint (FMT) and each disease group (Group). P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.</description>

    <description>Fecal DNA samples will undergo V3-V4 16S rRNA sequencing. . Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be produced by clustering sequences with identical taxonomic assignments. Linear mixed models analyses on individual OTUs at the genus level will be conducted on 105 OTUs after eliminating OTUs with an average relative abundance of &lt; 0.001% in the donor and recipient pre-FMT samples, and after discarding OTUs where more than 75% of the samples had a zero count. To compare the relative abundance of each OTU between timepoints before and after FMT [pre-transplant recipient, 1-wk. post-FMT recipient, 3-mos. post-FMT recipient] and each disease group, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) or generalized estimating equation (GEE) will be used by taking the actual counts of each OTU as the outcomes that were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution. The p-values will be adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni correction or by the Benjamin-Hochberg method (FDR &lt; 0.05).</description>
