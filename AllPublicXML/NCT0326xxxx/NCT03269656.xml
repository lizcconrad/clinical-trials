  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      5764 men and women in Iceland, aged 66 to 96 years entered the Ages Gene/Environment
      Susceptibility (AGES) - Reykjavik Study. Serum 25(OH)D was measured in 5,519 of all 5,764
      (96%) participants at study entry in year 2002 through 2006. The main emphasis was on
      exploring whether pre-diagnostic serum levels of 25(OH)D were associated with survival after
      cancer diagnosis.

        In 1967, all 30,795 men and women living in the capital area of Iceland and born between
        1907 and 1935 were invited by the Icelandic Heart Association to join a prospective cohort
        study. Approximately 19,000 attended the clinic at least once and became participants of
        the Reykjavik Study. Subsequently, in 2002, a random sample of the cohort comprising 5,764
        men and women who were still alive in Iceland and aged 66 to 96 years entered the Ages
        Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) - Reykjavik Study
