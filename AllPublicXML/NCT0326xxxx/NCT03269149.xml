      The goal of the project is to determine the extent to which indices of inflammatory
      biomarkers, cognition and mood, are influenced by a partnered, dance-based intervention vs
      control condition in African American (AA) female family caregivers, at high risk for
      Alzheimer's disease (AD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The importance of informal family caregiving in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well-established.
      African-American caregivers are most often middle aged adult children of AD patients (vs.
      spouses), women, and are at higher risk for chronic health problems. AD lifestyle
      interventions offer an alternative to medication, and are generally affordable, accessible,
      and adaptable to the lives of caregivers. To date, most non-pharmaceutical interventions have
      focused on exercise and nutrition, both of which have proven to be highly successful in
      conferring AD related benefits and decreasing AD risk.

    <description>The MoCA test is a 30-point test that assesses several cognitive domains. The short-term memory recall task (5 points) ; Visuospatial abilities are assessed using a clock-drawing task (3 points) and a three-dimensional cube copy (1 point); executive functions are assessed using an alternation task adapted from the trail-making B task (1 point), a phonemic fluency task (1 point), and a two-item verbal abstraction task (2 points). Attention, concentration and working memory are evaluated using a attention task (target detection using tapping; 1 point), a serial subtraction task (3 points), and digits forward and backward (1 point each). Language is assessed using a confrontation naming task with low-familiarity animals (3 points), repetition of two syntactically complex sentences (2 points), and the aforementioned fluency task. Finally, orientation to time and place is evaluated (6 points).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Tower of London test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after the intervention / control, offered twice per week, at least 20 times during 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Tower of London test is used for the assessment of executive functioning specifically to detect deficits in planning. It is related to the classic problem-solving puzzle known as the Tower of Hanoi.The test consists of two boards with pegs and several beads with different colors. The examiner uses the beads and the boards to present the examinee with problem-solving tasks. The performance of the examinee is compared to representative samples of individuals of the same age to derive hypotheses about the person's executive cognitive ability.</description>

    <time_frame>Before and after the intervention / control, offered twice per week, at least 20 times during 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Digit Span test is either conducted verbally or using a computer program. A sequence of numbers is shown or read out to the participant. The participant is then told to repeat the numbers that were shown or read to them. This process continues until the participant can no longer remember either the full sequence of numbers or the correct order.The Digit Span test is scored by the amount of numbers the participant was able to remember in each test. The scorer must add the total number of correct sequences, backwards and forwards.</description>

    <measure>Change in Buschke Selective Reminding Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after the intervention / control, offered twice per week, at least 20 times during 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Buschke Selective Reminding Test (SRT) is a test designed to measure verbal learning and memory through the use of a list-learning procedure over multiple trials. The adult SRT involves reading the subject a list of 12 unrelated words and then having the subject immediately recall as many of these 12 words as possible. Every trial after the first involves selectively presenting only those words in which the subject did not recall on the immediately preceding trial. The selective reminding trials proceed in this manner until the subject is able to correctly recall all 12 words on three consecutive trials, or until 12 trials have been completed. Scoring of the test has been automated according the instructions of Buschke.</description>

    <measure>Change in Reverse Corsi Blocks test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after the intervention / control, offered twice per week, at least 20 times during 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Corsi block-tapping test is a psychological test that assesses visuo-spatial short term working memory. It involves mimicking a researcher as he/she taps a sequence of up to nine identical spatially separated blocks. The sequence starts out simple, usually using two blocks, but becomes more complex until the subject's performance suffers. This number is known as the Corsi Span, and averages about 5 for normal human subjects.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Body position spatial task (BPST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after the intervention / control, offered twice per week, at least 20 times during 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body position spatial task (BPST) measures whole body knowledge of spatial position and ability to navigate in a remembered path. The examiner verbally and visually demonstrates combinations of 5 possible moves: step forward, step left, step right, quarter turn left, and quarter turn right. The examiner begins with 2 moves and progresses up to 9 moves, with 2 trials per level. Participants continue to the next level if one trial is correctly performed. The test ends when participants miss both trials of a level. Span length and number of correct trials are variables.</description>

    <description>The Fullerton Test is mainly intended to identify highly-active older adults who are at an increased risk to experience fall-related injuries due to sensory impairments. The test uses both dynamic and static balance under different situations to identify balance deficits in older adults. The test includes the following: 10 performance based activities in both static and dynamic phases; Score of 0-40/40 points possible (higher scores are better); tems scored on a 5 point ordinal scale (0-4).</description>

    <time_frame>Before and after the intervention / control, offered twice per week, at least 20 times during 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-item PAC scale will be administered to the caregivers. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale: disagree a lot (1), disagree a little (2), neither agree nor disagree (3), agree a little (4), and agree a lot (5). The overall PAC score, comprising all nine items, ranges from 9 to 45—a higher score reflects a more positive perception of the caregiving experience.</description>
