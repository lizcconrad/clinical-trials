    <textblock>
      Imatinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is used for treatment of Philadelphia positive
      chronic myeloid leukemia. Despite its efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, there
      is a large inter-individual variability in imatinib plasma concentrations, which may lead to
      treatment failure and disease progression. Polymorphisms in genes related to absorption,
      distribution, metabolism and excretion of imatinib may affect the bioavailability and
      consequently the response to the drug.

      The study aims to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms in certain
      metabolizing enzymes [CYP3A5*3 (rs776746), CYP2C8*3 (rs11572080 and rs10509681)] and membrane
      transporters [ABCB1 2677G&gt;T/A (rs2032582) and SLC22A1 1222A &gt; G (rs628031)] by PCR on the
      plasma level (by HPLC-UV) and molecular response (MMR) of imatinib in patients with CML.

      The study also aims to provide CML patients with a personalized treatment option, thereby
      probably improving the response and reducing the side effects.

      Introduction:

      Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease with an incidence of one to
      two cases per 100,000 adults. It accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of
      leukemia in adults.

      The introduction of imatinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in the early 21st century
      is considered a breakthrough in the treatment of CML. In the vast majority of patients,
      treatment with imatinib induces cytogenetic and even molecular responses with very low or
      undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. These patients remain free from progression to blast
      crisis. However, imatinib does not cure the disease because it is unable to eradicate the
      leukaemic stem cells, which therefore provides a potential reservoir for relapse.

      Despite its efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, there is a large inter-individual
      variability in imatinib plasma concentrations, which may lead to treatment failure and
      disease progression.

      Polymorphisms in genes related to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of
      imatinib may affect the bioavailability and consequently the response to the drug.

      Aim of the study:

      The study aims to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms in certain
      metabolizing enzymes [CYP3A5 * 3 (rs 776746), CYP2C8 * 3 (rs 11572080 and rs 10509681)] and
      membrane transporters [ABCB1 2677 G&gt;T/A (rs 2032582) and SLC22A1 1222 A &gt; G (rs 628031)] on
      the plasma level and molecular response (MMR) of imatinib in patients with CML.

      These polymorphisms were selected based on their relevance to the pharmacokinetics of
      imatinib and on their frequency in Caucasians.

      The study also aims to provide CML patients with a personalized treatment option, thereby
      probably improving the response and reducing the side effects.

      Patients and methods:

      Patients:

      The study will include patients with documented hematological, cytogenetic and molecular
      diagnosis of chronic phase CML, who are on continuous treatment with 400 mg oral dose of
      imatinib per day for at least 12 month at Medical Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer
      Institute (SECI), Assiut. Egypt.

      Exclusion criteria are: duration of imatinib therapy less than 12 months, poor compliance to
      treatment and identification of gene mutation(s) in the kinase domain of BCR- ABL1.

      The patients will be divided into 2 groups according to their molecular response to imatinib
      as follow:

      Group I: CML patients with MMR Group II: CML patients without MMR Patients in both groups
      will be compared as regard the plasma level of imatinib and the selected genetic
      polymorphisms.

      Methods:

      Blood sampling:

      Three blood samples (3 ml for each) will be collected into EDTA-containing tubes by
      venipuncture for measurement of imatinib plasma level, measurement of BCR- ABL1 transcription
      level and for genotyping.

      Measurement of Imatinib trough level:

      Blood samples will be collected after 24 hours from the previous dose (trough) and after at
      least 5 days of regular use of the drug to ensure that the steady state is reached. Within 1
      hour of collection, the blood samples will be centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at room
      temperature and will be stored at -20°C until analysis.

      Plasma level of imatinib will be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with
      ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) according to the method described by Barratt et al.

      Measurement of BCR- ABL1 transcription level:

      Total RNA will be extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes by the available RNA extraction
      kits. The BCR- ABL1 transcription level will be quantified by using real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) analysis to assess the molecular response to imatinib after 12 months of
      treatment with imatinib.

      Genotyping:

      The DNA will be extracted from leukocytes by the available DNA extraction kits and will be
      stored at -80°C until genotyping.

      Genotyping will be performed for CYP3A5 * 3 (rs 776746), CYP2C8 * 3 (rs 11572080 and rs
      10509681), ABCB1 2677 G&gt;T/A (rs 2032582) and SLC22A1 1222 A &gt; G (rs 628031) by the PCR

    <description>A major molecular response (MMR) to imatinib therapy is defined as a BCR-ABL1 RNA level ≤ 0.1% on the International Scale (a consensus standardized measurement scale intended to allow direct comparison of BCR-ABL1 RNA levels in any laboratory adopting its use). The International Scale was specifically designed so that, by definition, 100% is the median pretreatment baseline level of BCR-ABL1 RNA in early chronic phase CML and a 1,000-fold reduction from baseline is defined as 0.1% (MMR) (Press,</description>
