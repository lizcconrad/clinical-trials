      This study will determine whether peripheral blood flow cytometry can reduce or replace
      invasive bone marrow examinations in patients with slow growing lymphomas.

      Patients with certain types of slow growing (indolent) lymphomas, including the most common
      sub-type, follicular lymphoma, require a bone marrow examination for staging of their
      lymphoma. This provides prognostic information and can be important for planning treatment.
      However, despite the use of local anaesthetic, and in some cases sedation, bone marrow
      examinations can cause pain and discomfort to patients. Complications are rare but include
      risk of bleeding, infection and even nerve damage.

      Flow cytometry of peripheral blood samples can detect low levels of circulating lymphoma
      cells. A previous study has demonstrated that detection of lymphoma cells by peripheral blood
      flow cytometry has a good correlation with bone marrow involvement. This study will seek to
      find if this correlation is evident in a larger, statistically significant patient cohort.
      Depending on the study results, invasive and painful bone marrow procedures could potentially
      be reduced or eliminated in patients with certain slow growing lymphomas. Patients diagnosed
      with follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma and being treated at
      the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust will be eligible for this study. Participation in the
      study will require one peripheral blood sample to be taken before the patient's routine bone
      marrow biopsy. The study is expected to last between 2 - 3 years for data collection of 108
      samples.
