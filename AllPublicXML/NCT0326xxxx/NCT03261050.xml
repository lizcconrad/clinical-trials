  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people with an eating disorder (ED) do not receive good treatment. The investigators
      have developed a new brief group treatment that is supposed to work by reducing how much
      women with an ED value the impossible thinness standard promoted by the media and how much
      they value/crave binge foods. The investigators want to test whether the treatment actually
      changes those two mechanisms using brain scan data, which is more objective than completing
      questionnaires and even interviews.

      In the first phase of the study (R61), the investigators will compare women in the treatment
      versus those on a wait-list. If the investigators can show that the treatment &quot;works&quot; (does
      what the investigators think it does) compared to no active treatment (women will be allowed
      to seek and receive outside help but investigators will not provide it until after the
      wait-list), investigators will conduct the second phase of study (R33),where they will
      randomly assign women with an ED to either the new treatment or to a group treatment that
      represents what many college mental health clinics provide to their clients with ED.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only 3-20% of individuals with eating disorders (EDs) receive treatment, and those who do
      rarely receive evidence-based treatments because they are very intensive and costly, few
      clinicians deliver them, and they differ for the various EDs. These factors have hindered
      broad implementation of evidence-based treatments, implying that a brief frontline outpatient
      treatment for a range of EDs that could be easily, cheaply, and widely implemented would
      address a major public health problem. There is also limited experimental evidence regarding
      factors that maintain EDs and mechanisms of action for ED treatments. The investigators
      propose to conduct a project that translates basic persuasion research into clinical
      hypotheses and a novel treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that EDs are maintained by (1) excessive valuation of the thin
      beauty ideal, which prompts caloric restriction and other unhealthy weight control behaviors
      (vomiting, laxative use, excessive exercise) that increase binge eating risk, and (2)
      excessive valuation of high-calorie foods, which maintains binge eating. The investigators
      propose to evaluate a treatment that addresses these hypothesized maintenance processes. Two
      pilot trials evaluated a novel 8-session group dissonance-based treatment (Counter
      Attitudinal Therapy; CAT) wherein women with any ED appropriate for outpatient care completed
      activities in which they collectively discuss costs of pursuing the thin ideal and the ED
      behaviors in which they personally engage (unhealthy weight control behaviors and binge
      eating), which putatively creates dissonance about engaging in those particular behaviors
      that reduce valuation of the thin ideal and high-calorie binge foods.

    <description>In R61, participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the wait-list condition. Participants assigned to the treatment group receive Counter Attitudinal Therapy (CAT). Participants in the treatment group are compared with participants in the wait-list condition. Participants will complete target and outcome measures at pretest and posttest, plus self-report intervention target and outcome measures at weeks 2, 4, and 6 during treatment for dosage analysis. Additionally, at pre-test and post-test participants will complete two MRI brain scans where they will be exposed to pictures of women and different types of foods. This will assess participants' thin-ideal and binge food valuation. Electrocardiography (ECG) data will be collected at pre and post.</description>

At pre-test and post-test participants will complete two MRI brain scans where they will be exposed to pictures of women and different types of foods. This will assess participants' thin-ideal and binge food valuation. Additionally, thin-ideal valuation will be accessed outside the scanner at pre, post and follow-up. Similarly, binge food valuation will be accessed outside the scanner at pre, post, and follow-up and weeks 2, 4, and 6 during treatment for dose-response analysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) data will be collected at pre and post.</description>
