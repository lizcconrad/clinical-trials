    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of aldesleukin when given together
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of
      the body. Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving aldesleukin and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with kidney
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of aldesleukin (IL-2) combined with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with IL-2.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the association of PD-L1 protein expression by pretreatment tumor with
      response to treatment.

      II. To investigate the association of regulatory T cell (Treg) frequency and Treg to effector
      T cell (Teff) ratios in peripheral blood and tumor tissue with response to therapy.

      III. To investigate the association of de novo serological and cellular responses against the
      ubiquitous RCC tumor antigen 5T4 with response to therapy.

      IV. To investigate the association of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) repertoire
      clonality with response to therapy and to assess the detection of dominant TIL clones within
      peripheral blood over time in responding patients.

      V. To investigate the association of whole genome copy number alterations measured on
      pretreatment archived, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor with response to
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of aldesleukin.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also
      receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) weekly on days 1-5 of courses 1 and 2 or aldesleukin
      IV on days 2-6 of courses 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for every 3 months for up to 1
      year.
