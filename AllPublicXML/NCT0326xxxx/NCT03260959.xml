    <description>Experience of the man during the announcement of a pregnancy that it is expected or not, without identification of an average answer, but description of the diversity of situations, contexts, felt, taken of decision and actions.
Since this study is observational and descriptive, it does not have a primary judgment criterion, the aim being to describe the studied population. However, according to the method of hierarchical evocation, it can be said that the average frequency of occurrence of the words and their average polarity index will be some outcome measure.</description>
