      After the consent of the local ethics committee and informed consent of the parents, we
      conducted a prospective randomized, double-blind study, from 30 June 2014 to 31 December
      2014, including one to eight year olds, ASA I or II and Programmed for circumcision.
      Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane at 8% and maintained by the same agent at 2%. The
      children were randomized to 2 groups (n = 53 in each group) to receive 0.1% BPV
      non-adrenalinated 0.5% / kg on each side with either tramadol 2mg / Kg (G1: GroupBT ) Or
      saline serum at the same volume (G2: Group B or control). Postoperative analgesia was
      assessed by: the modified OPS scale at waking (H0), 1st (H1), 2nd (H2), and 24th (H24) PO
      hour at home, by the number of analgesic inThe hospital and at home, and by the time of the
      first demand analgesic.
