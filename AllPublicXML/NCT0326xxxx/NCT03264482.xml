      the investigators plan to test Thulium laser vaporization using high power ( 200w ) Front
      fire vaporization compared to standard M-TURP in reduction of LUTS secondary to BPH in a
      prospective randomized trial.

      When Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) are refractory to medical therapy and bothersome
      enough to warrant surgical intervention, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has
      been the historical reference-standard procedures for prostate size between 30-80 ml for
      years.

      Over the past decade, New minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST), new medications, and
      novel combinations of medical therapies have expanded the number of treatment options ranging
      from watchful waiting to open surgery. The range of treatment options is as broad as the BPH
      spectrum of symptoms.

      These treatment options include prostate vaporization, resection and enucleation using
      various energy sources , however the main theme for all these new procedures that they were
      done using physiological saline as an irrigant nullifying the risk of TUR syndrome.

      One of the biggest changes in surgical treatment of BPH over the past 2 decades has been the
      introduction and use of lasers. Two-micron (Thulium) continuous-wave (CW) laser may have
      several advantages, including sufficient homeostasis with minimal thermal injury, more
      precise tissue incision, and operation in CW/pulsed modes. Pieces of the prostate are
      vaporized small enough to evacuate through the resectoscope sheath and use of a mechanical
      tissue morcellator is not required.

      The introduction of the latest generation of the Thulium laser namely &quot;200w laser &quot; raises
      the expectations of the prostate vaporization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients' age ≥50 years

          -  LUTS secondary to BOO due to BPH who failed medical treatment

          -  International prostate symptom scores (IPSS) &gt;15 and bother score (QOL) ≥ 3 (according
             to IPSS question 8)

          -  Peak urinary flow rate (Qmax) &lt;15 ml/sec with at least 125 ml voided volume or
             Patients with acute urine retention secondary to BPH who failed trial of voiding on
             medical treatment.

          -  ASA (American society of anaesthesiologists) score ≤3.

          -  TRUS prostate size between 30-80 ml

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with neurological disorder which might affect bladder function as
             cerebrovascular stroke, Parkinson disease

          -  Active urinary tract infection,

          -  Presence of active bladder pathology (within the last 2 years)

          -  Known prostate cancer patients will be excluded preoperatively on the basis of digital
             rectal examination, prostate specific antigen level, and TRUS imaging followed by
             prostate biopsies if necessary.

          -  Patient has a disorder of the coagulation cascade (e.g., liver cell failure) or
             disorders that affect platelet count or function (e.g., von Willebrand disease) that
             would put the subject at risk for intraoperative or postoperative bleeding.

          -  Patient is unable to discontinue anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy preoperatively
             (3-5 d) except for low-dose aspirin (e.g., 100 mg).

          -  Patient has had an acute myocardial infarction or open-heart surgery &lt;180 days prior
             to the date of informed consent
