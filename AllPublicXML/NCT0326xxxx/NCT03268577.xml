      This research trial studies how well internet-based and self-report instruments measure food
      intake and physical activity levels and their relationship with disease within American
      Association of Retired Persons (AARP) members. Comparing new internet-based questionnaires
      developed by the National Cancer Institute that report all the foods consumed and activities
      performed in an entire day to standardized physical measurements may help to determine if the
      information collected is accurate.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the measurement error structure of self-reported dietary assessment instruments,
      including, a food frequency questionnaire (National Cancer Institute [NCI]?s Diet History
      Questionnaire-II [DHQ-II]), and 24-hour recalls using the new automated self-administered
      24-hour dietary recall (ASA24) instrument with respect to absolute energy intake, absolute
      protein intake, and protein density?and potentially other nutritional factors such as
      potassium intake.

      II. Investigate the measurement error structure associated with self-reported active and
      sedentary behaviors, including multiple administrations of a new 24-hour recall (activity
      completed over time in 24-hours [ACT24]) and selected questionnaires using energy expenditure
      from doubly labeled water (DLW) and physical activities measures of physical activity
      monitors as reference instruments.

      III. Evaluate alternative analytic approaches for combining different types of self-report
      data on diet and physical activity-related behaviors as well as self-report plus objective
      data (derived from activity monitors, heart rate monitors e.g.).

      IV. Within the context of an AARP-based cohort, explore the adjustment of observed RRs for
      several key cancer hypotheses related to diet and physical activity based on the measurement
      error data provided by the new study.

      V. Evaluate the potential for ?energy adjustment? that incorporates physical activity and
      body size.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete the ASA24 about foods, cooking methods, and other aspects of diet every 2
      months for up to 6 times, and complete ACT24 about activities and time reporting every 2
      months for up to 6 times. Patients also complete DHQ-II questionnaires at the beginning and
      end of the study about the frequency and portion sizes of foods consumed over the past 12
      months, provide a 7-day food checklist twice with the DHQ-II, and provide a 4-day food record
      twice, once every 6 months. Physical activity monitors are worn to measure movement at
      different intensity levels and sitting or standing periods, twice during the study with 6
      months between each time they are worn.

    <description>Will be analyzed for UN, potassium, para-amino benzoic acid (PABA), and other nutrients that are potential objective markers of intakes. First morning void urine also will be evaluated for its potential to be used as a source of biomarkers replacing 24-hr urine. Urine will be analyzed to characterize metabolic profiles of individuals.</description>

    <description>Evaluated using latent-variable (measurement error) models. The models allow total energy expenditure derived from a physical activity monitor to have intake-related and person-specific biases, but assume that reference biomarkers (doubly-labeled water, urinary nitrogen, urinary potassium) provide unbiased estimates of true usual intake at the individual level. Such models to help develop better algorithms for estimating total energy expenditure from the measurements of physical activity monitors.

    <description>Will be examined using energy expenditure measured by DLW, physical activity monitor data, and hear rate monitor data.

    <measure>Measurement error structure of self-reported dietary assessment instruments</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated using latent-variable (measurement error) models. The models allow self-reported dietary intake to have intake-related and person-specific biases, but assume that reference biomarkers (doubly-labeled water, urinary nitrogen, urinary potassium) provide unbiased estimates of true usual intake at the individual level. Such models allow one to estimate the joint distribution of true and reported intake, and to estimate parameters of interest such as the correlation of true and reported intake and the ?attenuation factor?, or slope in the regression of true intake on reported intake.</description>

    <description>Will use multivariate measurement error models to estimate the joint distribution of true and reported values (nutrient intake, total energy, physical activity, body size). Then calculate residual reported intake (given reported total energy, physical activity and body size) and residual true intake (given true total energy, physical activity and body size), and assess the measurement error properties of reported residual intake as a measure of true residual intake. Specifically, will calculate the correlation of true and reported residual intake and the attenuation factor for residual reporte</description>
