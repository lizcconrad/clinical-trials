    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the possible effects of an exercise program, nutritional and
      psychological, postural orientation and guidance of oral health on body composition, physical
      activity levels and lifestyle, physical fitness and health and motor performance, the factors
      risk of cardiovascular disease, eating habits, the cognition levels, the psychological
      profile, the body posture of children and adolescent with overweight and obesity, considering
      the presence of risk genotype associated with the development of obesity. In addition,
      identify the effects of orientation for oral health on the quality of life and healthy oral
      habits.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from body mass index (BMI) at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Weight and height will be evaluated early in the morning in a fasting state, with the student wearing light clothing and shoes. The BMI will be classified as normal BMI, overweight or obesity.The BMI will be classified according to the percentage curves of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention / National Center for Health Statistics (CDC/NCHS) (2010) according to gender and age, considering the low weight (&lt;p5), normal weight (p5 and &lt;p85), overweight (p 85 and &lt;p 95) and obesity (p 95).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from the percentage of body fat at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure body fat percentage (BF%), a Lange (Beta Technology Incorporated) compass will be used to measure triceps and subscapular skinfolds. The equation of Slaughter et al. (1998) will be applied, and data will be classified according to Lonman's data, as mentioned by Heyward and Stolarczyk (2000).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from the waist circumference (WC) at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference (WC) was measured with an inelastic tape, using the narrowest part of the trunk between the ribs and the iliac crest and the hip at the greater trochanter level as references. The subjects were then classified according to Taylor et al. (2000), defining the normal circumference percentile as &lt;80 and obesity percentile as &gt;80 according to gender and age.</description>

The exercise program, nutritional counseling and oral health will last for five to three months and will be held in the gym and rooms of the University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC).
The sessions will last two hours (one hour of physical exercise and the second time divided into nutritional counseling, postural, psychological and oral) with a frequency of three times a week.</description>
