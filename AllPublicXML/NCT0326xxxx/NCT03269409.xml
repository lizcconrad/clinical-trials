  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial aims to determine if cells from a patient's own adipose tissue
      is safe and capable of helping regenerate the femoral head in patients with osteonecrosis.
      The standard of care is known as hip decompression which simply removes dead tissue from the
      femoral head and creates a new cavity to be filled in by healthy bone. This trial will use
      hip decompression plus saline injection in one hip and hip decompression supplemented with
      adipose derived regenerative cells in patients with osteonecrosis in both of their hips.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical data suggest that ADRC may serve as a safe and efficacious adjuvant
      agent for the treatment of ON. However, no randomized control study in the United States has
      formally evaluated safety of ADRC in the setting of ON. Therefore, the primary endeavor of
      this Phase I pilot study will be to evaluate safety of ADRC for pre-collapse ON of the
      femoral head.

      The Celution System (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego, USA) for preparation of ADRC from
      lipoaspirate is currently being evaluated in FDA approved clinical trials including an
      orthopedic indication (osteoarthritis). In addition, the device has a registration in Europe
      and Class I approval in Japan. As such, it serves as a known platform that produces a
      clinical grade product for human use. Other devices on the market process lipoaspirate by
      either mechanical, washing, or centrifugation methods; however, the remaining components of
      original adipose tissue are significant and impair the regenerative process. Derivation of
      relatively pure ADRC has been achieved by few devices and the Cytori Celution System is the
      only one to our knowledge with a sufficient safety and efficacy track record enabling
      multiple investigational device exemption (IDE) approvals. The reagent used (CelaseÂ®) is of a
      clinical and pharmacologic grade for use in humans. The production of Celase is free of
      mammalian products.

    <description>The HOOS is a 40 item self-report questionnaire with 5 subsets. The five subscales include 10 items on pain, 5 items for symptoms (3 symptoms items, 2 stiffness items) 17 items for activities for daily living (ADLs), 4 items for sports and recreations, and 4 items for hip related quality of life.
Scoring: Each question contains five answer choices ranging from never (score of 0) to extreme (score of 4). A normalized score is calculated for each subscale with 0 indicating extreme symptoms and 100 representing no symptoms.</description>

    <description>The SF-12 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from a patient's point of view. It measures eight concepts commonly represented in widely used surveys: physical functioning, role limitation due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health distress and psychological well-being). We will use the standard 4 week recall version.</description>
