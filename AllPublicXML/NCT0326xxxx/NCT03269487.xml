      This study is part of the 5-year long (2013-18) PERFECTED (Peri-operative Enhanced Recovery
      hip-fracture Care of paTiEnts with Dementia) National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)
      funded research programme.

      PERFECTED's aim is to develop and pilot an evidence-based intervention to improve the
      hospital care of patients living with dementia who have fractured their hip. This protocol
      relates to Work Package 2 (WP2) of PERFECTED only.

      By working collaboratively with local clinicians and stakeholders, an action research
      (plan-do-study-act) approach will be used to generate knowledge to understand how to best
      implement the intervention (PERFECTED Enhanced Recovery Pathway), which was developed from
      learning and research undertaken as part of Work Package 1. During the current study the
      PERFECTED Enhanced Recovery Pathway (ERP) will be used to optimise care on three
      ortho-geriatric wards for 12 months. These wards are located in Norfolk, Nottinghamshire and
      Yorkshire. The sole participants are NHS personnel delivering care on selected wards.

      Data collection activities (observations, in-field interviews, documentary analysis and
      quantitative data generated from the PERFECTED ERP implementation checklist) will determine
      the staff training and cultural changes required to implement and maximise adherence to the
      PERFECTED ERP. Simultaneously, enabling the identification and exploration of areas of
      optimised, satisfactory and sub-optimal care. By working in partnership within and across the
      partner wards, action plans to address sub-optimal care will be generated, implemented and
      reviewed. Findings will inform the best ways to optimise care via the implementation of the
      PERFECTED ERP. Knowledge generated during this study will be used to develop an ERP and staff
      training manual. This will aid implementation of the intervention arm of a latter Cluster
      Randomised Control Trial (Work Package 3), ensuring the PERFECTED ERP can be utilised in the
      real world.

      As part of PERFECTED's commitment to Public Patient Involvement (PPI), lay researchers will
      be trained to assist with qualitative research activities.
