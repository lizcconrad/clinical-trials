  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that a Mediterranean diet can have a beneficial effect on brain health.
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes problems with brain function such as difficulty
      with day-to-day memory and concentration. It is at this stage that Mediterranean diet could
      prove beneficial in terms of prevention.

      Previous research by Queens University investigated the opinions of patients with MCI and
      their care givers to inform the development of Mediterranean diet education material to
      encourage behaviour change. The study suggested that MCI patients lacked awareness of the
      link between Mediterranean diet and brain function, although were interested to learn more.
      Feedback on the developed educational material was positive although there were suggested
      improvements such as tailoring information to memory loss, a potential staged approach to
      delivery and adaptations to the material content.

      This present study aims to pilot test refined educational material among MCI participants to
      evaluate the feasibility of encouraging dietary behaviour change among this patient group.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based, tailored Mediterranean
      lifestyle education intervention to encourage behaviour change in patients with MCI. The
      proposed study will be a 6 month RCT with a total of 60 MCI patients who will be randomised
      to 1 of 3 groups:

        1. Group 1 will receive the Mediterranean lifestyle education resource on one occasion at
           baseline

        2. Group 2 will receive the Mediterranean lifestyle education resource at monthly intervals
           for 5 months accompanied by telephone feedback from the research dietitian

        3. Group 3 will receive standard care (control group). Participants will receive the
           Mediterranean lifestyle education resource after their final 6 month study visit (i.e.
           delayed intervention).
