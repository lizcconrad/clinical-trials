    <textblock>
      The study compares early palliative care consultation to standard of care in the medical
      intensive care unit (ICU). The study will assess if the intervention leads to an increased
      proportion of clearly delineated goals of care and quality of life and examine if this
      intervention leads to decreased length of days in the ICU, Hospital, and on mechanical
      ventilation.

      -  The medical intensive care unit will be split into two groups, assigned as either early
           palliative care consultation or standard of care. Current standard of care in the ICU is
           that primary clinician providers determine the need and time for palliative care
           consultation, which can occur approximately 5 - 14 days after admission.

        -  A palliative care screening tool will be used to determine if a newly admitted patient
           is eligible for palliative care consultation. For patients in the standard of care
           group, medical records will be reviewed.

        -  The two medical ICU groups will be crossed over to the after 3 months for a total of 6
           months of study.

        -  Participants will be followed through his or her hospitalization.
