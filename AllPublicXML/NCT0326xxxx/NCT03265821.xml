      The aim of this study was to investigate whether cigarette smoking had any impact on the
      clinical outcomes 1 year after active periodontal treatment. Eligible for the study were 5680
      individuals 20-85 years, referred to the specialised clinic for periodontal treatment at
      GÃ¤vle County Hospital between the years of 1980 and 2015. Before examination, all individuals
      filled in a questionnaire regarding their medical health, medication and smoking habits.

      Excluded were edentulous individuals and where clinical data 1-year after active treatment,
      or smoking habits were missing (n=1453). Complete data for analyses was available for 4227
      individuals.
