      Programming is a crucial aspect of deep brain stimulation (DBS), directly influences the
      final success of DBS. Optimal programming helps patients achieve maximized control of
      clinical symptoms and higher life quality. However, there are a number of inadequacies in
      conventional programming methods. First, the programming probe must come into close contact
      with the implantable pulse generator (IPG) and test stimulator to complete programming. And
      during initial postoperative programming, only the parameters of one patient can be
      ascertained. In addition, the same frequency is typically used in the left and right brain
      for dual channel IPG. The patient also need to repeatedly travel between their home and the
      hospital, leading to increased time and expense. Therefore, the investigators developed the
      SceneRay wireless and remote DBS system to address the outline issues. This system has
      significant advantages over conventional programming methods on all the issues above. This
      research will test the safety of this remote and wireless DBS programming system.
