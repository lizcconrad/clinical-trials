  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the functional outcomes in patients undergoing
      proximal femur resection and reconstruction with an endoprosthesis, based on the abductor
      muscle repair technique. The investigators hypothesize that those patients who receive
      reattachment of the abductors directly into the prosthesis will have better functional
      outcomes overall. Furthermore, the investigators plan to develop a simple, cost effective,
      and reproducible method to assess abductor function at clinical post-operative visits through
      plain radiographs.

      Patients treated for proximal femur replacements at Duke University Medical Center by
      Orthopaedic Oncology trained surgeons. The Duke DEDUCE database will be used to identify
      retrospective patients using the above mentioned CPT codes. Individual chart review of the
      electronic medical record will then be used to identify those receiving a proximal femur
      replacement. Maximum number of charts to be reviewed in the study will be 300. Of these 300
      charts, the investigators plan to consent 25 subjects who have return appointments scheduled.
      The investigators also plan to consent 25 preoperative patients, for a total of 50 subjects.
