    <textblock>
      Investigators are doing this research study to find out the effect of T6 dermatomal
      electrical stimulation (delivered by a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)
      unit) on appetite and weight loss.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be treated before and after two meals of the day with T6 dermatomal
      electrical stimulation delivered by a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)
      unit. Participants will receive 15-minute T6 dermatome cutaneous stimulation with TENS unit
      applied immediately before ingestion of two of main meals of the day (breakfast and evening
      meal), and 60 minute stimulation applied immediately after ingestion of these meals.
      Participants will apply the stimulus four times daily for a treatment period of at least 3
      months. Participants will keep a diary of weight once weekly and a weekly appetite record.

    <measure>Fasting gastric volume by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months, approx 20 minutes after 99mTC injection</time_frame>
    <description>A noninvasive SPECT method will be used to measure gastric volume. Subjects will report to the clinic after an overnight fast. The first fasting scan will be obtained, and the study medication (99mTc) will be given subcutaneously. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan will be obtained. Each scan requires about 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall will be obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content. Volume will be measured in mL.</description>

    <measure>Postprandial gastric volume (gastric accommodation) by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months, approximately 30 min after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>A noninvasive SPECT method will be used to measure gastric volume after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC will be given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication (99mTc) will be given subcutaneously. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans will be obtained. Each scan requires about 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall will be obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content. Volume will be measured in mL.</description>

    <measure>Satiation volume (level 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 30 minutes after the liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will ingest a liquid nutrient drink at a rate of 120 mL every 4 minutes; the volume ingested at each level of fullness will be recorded. Participants record their sensations of fullness using a numerical scale from 0 to 5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal (&quot;volume to fullness&quot;), and level 5 corresponding to the maximum tolerated volume (MTV). Nutrient intake is stopped when subjects reach the score of 5.</description>

    <measure>Mean Kcal Intake at Buffet Meal as a Measure of Appetite</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months, approximately 30 minutes after the buffet meal</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of kcal intake as a measure of appetite buffet meal to measure total caloric intake. 5 hours after ingesting 300 mL liquid nutrient as part of the gastric volume study, participants will be invited to eat, during a 30-minute period, a standard &quot;free feeding&quot; meal. The total amount of food consumed will be analyzed by the study dietitian.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Appetite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ratings of appetite will be measured every 30 minutes between the time of ingestion of standard liquid breakfast and the start of the ad libitum meal. The appetite rating will be measured by 4- 100 mm long Visual Analog Scales (VAS). The VAS does not have any pre-set marks between the extremes of 0 for negative rating and 100 mm for positive rating. The investigator measures the mark made by the participant in mm and records this for the value. The overall appetite score will be calculated as the average of the four individual scores (satiety + fullness+100-prospective food consumption + hunger/4.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Overweight and obese adults (BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and ≤34.99 kg/m2) residing within 125 miles
             of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; these will be otherwise healthy individuals
             with no unstable psychiatric disease and not currently on treatment for cardiac,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, hematological, neurological, or endocrine

          -  Age: 18-65 years

          -  Gender: Men or women. Women of childbearing potential will be using an effective form
             of contraception, and have negative pregnancy tests within 48 hours of enrollment and
             before each radiation exposure.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent before any trial-related
             activities.

        Eligible individuals will be asked to avoid taking additional medications and supplements
        for the duration of the study, unless reviewed and approved by the study team.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abdominal surgery other than appendectomy, Caesarian section or tubal ligation

          -  Positive history of chronic gastrointestinal diseases, systemic disease that could
             affect gastrointestinal motility, or use of medications that may alter
             gastrointestinal motility, appetite or absorption, e.g., Orlistat

          -  Positive history of diabetes mellitus or use of hypoglycemic medications

          -  Positive history of spinal cord injury and/or chronic back pain

             Anxiety and Depression Inventory (HAD) (12), a self-administered alcoholism screening
             test (AUDIT-C) (13), and the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns (binge eating
             disorders and bulimia) (14). If such a dysfunction is identified by a HAD score &gt;11 or
             difficulties with substance or eating disorders, the participant will be excluded and
             given a referral letter to his/her primary care doctor for further appraisal and
             follow-up.

             therapy, thyroxine replacement therapy, low dose analgesia or anti-inflammatory
             medications (Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen) and any medication administered for
             co-morbidities as long as they do not alter gastrointestinal motility including
             gastric emptying and gastric accommodation.

          -  Subjects may also be excluded from participation for other factors at the discretion
             of the principal investigator.
