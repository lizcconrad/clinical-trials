    <textblock>
      Background: Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a common musculoskeletal disorder that
      causes pain and functional limitation. Although different nonsurgical conservative therapies
      such as bracing, physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid
      injections in addition to surgical approaches have been used, yet there is no standard
      treatment for lateral epicondylitis.

      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of nerve
      stimulator guided radial nerve block for treatment of lateral epicondylitis. The primary
      outcome measure is pain measured through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at 1 and 2 weeks.

      Methods: This is a prospective randomized, double blind clinical trial that will be conducted
      between September 2017 and March 2018. Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups.
      Group I will receive radial nerve block guided by a nerve stimulator. Group II patients will
      receive placebo through radial nerve block. Patients will be followed up for 2 weeks.

      Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a common musculoskeletal disorder that causes pain
      and functional limitation. It is a major arm disorder which occurs commonly in adults between
      30 and 50 years, with an estimated prevalence of 1% to 3% in the general population. Lateral
      epicondylitis results from the overuse of the extensor muscles, causing inflammation or
      irritation of the tendon insertion (4). It is common in workers whose job requires manual and
      repetitive work .

      Although different nonsurgical conservative therapies such as bracing, physical therapy,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections in addition to surgical
      approaches have been used, yet there is no standard treatment for lateral epicondylitis (5).

      To our knowledge, there are no studies that used nerve-stimulator-guided radial nerve block
      for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.

    <description>A nerve stimulator will be used to localize the radial nerve. Then radial block will be performed. At this point 3-5 ml of the anesthetic mixture is injected. Each 10 ml of the anesthetic mixture contained: 3ml lidocaine 2%, 3ml lidocaine 2% with epinephrine, 1:2000,000, 3ml bupivicaine 0.5% and 1ml clonidine 150 Âµg/ml.</description>
