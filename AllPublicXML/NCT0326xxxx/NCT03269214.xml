  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who had bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in stage II were allocated
      in two groups randomly : In group1, 10 patients underwent debridement and primary closer of
      the area,in group 2 , patients received Phenytoin + tetracycline topically in the debridement
      area.Wound dehiscence , infection and pain were in 1,6 and 12 months after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergo surgical necrotic bone debridement in combination with antibiotic
      therapy (clindamycin 300 mg q8h) for 4 weeks . Patients who had BRON of the mandible randomly
      allocated in 2 groups. Group 1 underwent debridement of necrotic bone and the involved area
      closed primary and in group 2 ,patients received topical Phenytoin 5%+ Tetracycline. Patients
      were evaluated after 1(time1) ,6(time2) and 12(time 3) months.

      The size of bone lesion was measured by using come beam computer tomography (CBCT).

      Wound dehiscence (Stage 0 :No dehiscence ,Stage 1: less than 10 mm dehiscence,stage 2 : more
      than 10 mm dehiscence) Infection: Pus, sinus tract (Yes/NO) Pain according to visual analog
      scale (VAS) 0-10.In the third follow up time ( 12 months) ,the number of patients who were a
      time span of 3 months without clinical symptoms were documented in each group.
