  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this pilot study is to test the extent to which adjunctive treatment with
      the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat improves brain plasticity and cognition
      in a pilot placebo-controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia who are on clozapine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to perform a pilot clinical study with a small sample of subjects
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of vorinostat when combined with clozapine treatment
      in patients with schizophrenia. The investigators will also evaluate the potential
      translation of our preclinical data into a clinical use of vorinostat for cognitive
      impairment in clozapine-treated schizophrenic patients.

      Potential participants will be receiving stables doses of clozapine for a minimum period of 6
      months before entry into the study. Clozapine was selected because i) the majority of our
      studies in mouse models were performed after chronic treatment with this atypical
      antipsychotic, and ii) the investigators' data in postmortem human brain samples of subjects
      with antemortem diagnosis of schizophrenia suggest up-regulation of HDAC2 in frontal cortex
      of schizophrenic subjects treated with atypical, but not typical, antipsychotic drugs.

      The HDAC inhibitor vorinostat was selected because preliminary data suggest that chronic
      treatment with vorinostat improves HDAC2-dependent cognitive function in rodent models.
      Additionally, vorinostat is the first HDAC inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Dose(s) of vorinostat
      have been selected based on previous clinical studies in such patients with brain metastasis.
