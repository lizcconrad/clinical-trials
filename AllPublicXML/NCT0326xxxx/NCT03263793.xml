  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this T2 translational research project is to pilot an interdisciplinary
      high-intensity group singing program to improve speech and swallowing in patients with
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) and to explore the impact of this program on quality of life (QOL).
      This research has three specific aims: 1) Determine the effects of a high-intensity group
      vocal training program on vocal function and laryngeal structure; 2) Determine the
      transference of vocal training to laryngeal aspects of swallowing; 3) Determine the effect of
      patient-reported changes in Quality of Life (QOL) as the result of participation in a group
      vocal training program.

      Twenty patients with Parkinson Disease will be recruited from the Fresco Institute for
      Parkinson's &amp; Movement Disorders to participate in a 12-week vocal training program. The
      program will train participants using maximum vocal function exercises targeting vocal
      deficits specific to PD. Choral singing therapy sessions will be conducted once weekly with
      daily home practice exercises based on principles that have been successful in other
      intensive PD vocal exercise programs.

    <textblock>
      Deterioration of speech and swallowing is a hallmark of Parkinson Disease (PD). There is
      emerging evidence that choral singing benefits people with PD across a range of modalities.
      Despite the increasing popularity of &quot;Parkinson's choirs&quot;, rigorous study of these benefits
      is lacking. There is a large body of evidence that intense vocal training improves speech and
      communication for people with PD. However, the intense training places high demands on
      clinical and patient resources and, due to its individualized approach, lacks the potential
      psycho-social benefits of a group intervention.

      It is hypothesized singing training program will increase vocal loudness, range of
      articulation, and prosodic variation during speech. Additionally, given existing evidence for
      neuroplastic transference of voice-related interventions to swallowing function, laryngeal
      components of swallowing function will also improve post-intervention. Finally, investigators
      expect to see improvements in patient-reported QOL measures corresponding with improved
      speech and laryngeal function and/or as the result of group interaction.

      All participants will complete a standardized battery of assessment pre- and post- treatment
      including acoustic and aerodynamic assessment of voice, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of
      speech and swallowing, and videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing. The outcome of this
      work will be a rigorous understanding of how choral singing therapy can positively impact the
      voice, swallowing function, and quality of life for patients with PD.
