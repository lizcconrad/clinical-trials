      Specific Aims:

        1. Establish in an open label clinical trial the tolerability and safety of various doses
           of l-histidine and lodosyn that may increase levels of l-histidine and histamine in the
           serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

        2. Perform pharmacokinetic studies in serum and CSF of study subjects the levels of
           l-histidine and histamine after treatment with various combination of l-histidine and
           lodosyn.

        3. Preliminary information will also be collected on the effects of this intervention on
           alleviation of fatigue.

      The findings from this study go beyond the effects of histamine on fatigue. If central
      histamine can be increased by the strategy outlined above, a number of other vegetative
      hypothalamic functions intricately associated with fatigue including sleep, cognition and
      satiety need to be examined in MS patients in future studies.

    <description>At the conclusion of the study, each individual would have completed a screening and baseline visit without any intervention and two weekly visits during intervention with the study medications. The two evaluations off drug will be compared to the two evaluations on drug. A drop of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score by 1 point or more will be considered a response. Once the information is converted into a binary function of response / no response, the data is amenable to conditional logistic regression analysis.</description>

    <description>This is a single-arm study. A total of 15 subjects will be recruited in batches of 5. The first 5 subjects (3 MS and 2 normal) will be tested on a dose of L-Histidine 250 mg plus Carbidopa 50 mg twice a day (BID) for seven days. If there are no safety concerns, the next 5 patients will be recruited (3 MS and 2 normal) to test the dose of L-Histidine 500 mg with Carbidopa 50 mg BID for seven days. If there are no safety concerns then L-histidine 1,000 mg plus Carbidopa 50 mg BID will be tested in the next 5 subjects (3 MS patients and 2 normal subjects) for seven days.</description>
