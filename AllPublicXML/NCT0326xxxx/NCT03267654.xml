  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase II clinical trial, which aims to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of gefitinib versus combination of gefitinib and
      doublet chemotherapy or apatinib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21
      L858R point mutation), accompanied with Bim deletion or low activating EGFR mutation
      abundance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BIM (bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) deletion polymorphism and low EGFR mutation
      abundance were poor clinical response markers to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations.This is a phase II
      clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of combination treatment for patients harboring
      above risk factors.

      Advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC Patients with Bim deletion or EGFR low mutation abundance were
      randomized divided into following three treatment groups:

      A: gefitinib 250mg Qd combined with doublet chemotherapy: pemetrexed (500mg/m²，day 1
      ，intravenously) plus carboplatin (AUC=5,day 1,intravenously) every 21 days.

      B: gefitinib 250mg Qd combined with apatinib 250mg/d intravenously per 21 days. C: gefitinib
      250mg Qd
