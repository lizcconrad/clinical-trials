      Purpose: To conduct a randomized controlled pilot study investigating the use of high dose
      intravenous (IV) thiamine to prevent delirium and mitigate the long-term effects of delirium,
      including health-related quality of life (HRQOL), functional status, and neuropsychiatric
      outcomes, in patients admitted to University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospital for allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      Participants: 60 adult inpatients admitted to the UNC Bone Marrow Transplant Unit for
      allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      Procedures (methods): Participants will be admitted for allogeneic HSCT and on the day after
      transplant randomized to seven days of high dose IV thiamine or placebo. Thiamine levels will
      be measured weekly and participants will be assessed for evidence of delirium using validated
      measures. Validated measures will also be used to assess cognitive function, depression,
      post-traumatic stress symptoms, functional status, and HRQOL prior to hospitalization and at
      one, three, and six months after transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common and potentially preventable neuropsychiatric complication in cancer
      patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) that has profound
      consequences. Among cancer patients hospitalized for HSCT, delirium occurs in approximately
      40% of patients and increases the risk of mortality. Long-term, delirium in this population
      results in worse physical health, mental health, and quality of life. Though strategies to
      prevent delirium have the potential to significantly improve the lives of people living with
      cancer, research in this area is extremely limited. Thiamine deficiency is also ubiquitous
      during HSCT and a known contributor to the development of delirium in other patient
      populations. High dose intravenous (IV) thiamine is an evidence-based and promising treatment
      for delirium, but no one has studied IV thiamine as a prevention strategy.

      This is a randomized double-blind controlled trial in participants undergoing allogeneic HSCT
      to determine if high dose IV thiamine can prevent delirium and minimize the deleterious
      impact of delirium on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), functional status, and other
      neuropsychiatric outcomes. The investigators will recruit 60 patients admitted for allogeneic
      HSCT at UNC, randomize them to treatment with high dose IV thiamine (n = 30) versus placebo
      (n = 30), and systematically evaluate all participants for delirium and related
      comorbidities. The investigators will use the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) to measure the
      severity and duration of delirium immediately prior to transplant and after HSCT until 30
      days post-transplant or discharge. If delirium is identified, the DRS will be administered
      daily until delirium resolves. The investigators will obtain thiamine levels and other
      laboratory parameters associated with delirium the day after transplant, and continue to
      monitor thiamine levels weekly thereafter. The investigators will also monitor HRQOL,
      functional status, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and cognitive function prior
      to transplant and at one, three, and six months after transplant to elucidate the persistent
      impact of delirium in this population and the potential for thiamine to mitigate these
      negative outcomes.

    <time_frame>Assessments will occur in the week prior to transplant, then 3 times weekly post-transplant until 30 days post-transplant or discharge, whichever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>Delirium incidence will be measured using the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS). The DRS is a is a 10-item, clinician-rated scale that rates the severity of delirium symptoms over a 24-hour period using all available information from the patient interview, mental status examination, medical history and tests, nursing observations, and family reports. The maximum possible score is 32. Higher scores suggest more severe symptoms. A cut-off score of &gt; 12 has been suggested to distinguish patients with delirium from patients with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Delirium incidence will be defined as at least one assessment with DRS &gt; 12.</description>

    <measure>Relationship between thiamine deficiency and delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>From end of 7-day intervention period until the development of delirium at any point during the post-transplant hospitalization up to a maximum of 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship between thiamine levels at the end of the seven day administration of thiamine and the development of delirium at any point during the thirty days post-transplant or the post-transplant hospitalization, whichever comes first, will be examined. Patients who develop delirium prior to the end of the thiamine treatment will not be included in this analysis. Sensitivity and specificity of this relationship will be assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to attempt to find a cutoff for thiamine levels that is associated with the development of delirium.</description>
