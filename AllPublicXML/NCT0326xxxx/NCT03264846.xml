  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal diseases are chronic inflammatory disease occurred by the interaction between
      pathogenic microorganism and the host defense. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a
      reproductive and metabolic disease associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events.
      Endocan is a proteoglycan secreted mainly by endothelial cells under the control of
      inflammatory cytokines.

      Periodontal diseases, including gingivitis, are common chronic infectious diseases caused by
      predominantly pathogenic microorganisms that colonize the subgingival area and cause local
      and systemic elevations of proinflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6).

      Several lines of evidence established the association between periodontal and systemic
      diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

      Because of the fact that both periodontal disease and PCOS are associated with systemic
      inflammation and insulin resistance, these two disorders may be linked through a common
      pathophysiologic pathway.

      A number of studies have indicated a possible relationship between PCOS and periodontal
      inflammation. Despite common risk factors, including oxidative stress, the relationship
      between chronic periodontitis (CP) and PCOS remains unclear.

      The aims of the study were to determine serum and saliva Endocan and IL-6 levels and to
      evaluate the correlation between these two biomarker in women with periodontal disease and
      PCOS.
