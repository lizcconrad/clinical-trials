  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, 1.5 million people abuse cocaine leading to a host of negative health
      and economic consequences, yet no FDA approved treatment exists. To develop effective
      treatments, the following must be considered: 1) do potential medications ameliorate brain
      disruptions associated with cocaine use? 2) are multiple, targeted treatments necessary? To
      meet these goals, innovative multi-modal neuroimaging will be used to determine whether
      rebalancing the serotonergic (5-HT) system reduces cocaine cue reactivity, impulsivity, and
      normalizes related neurochemistry and brain connectivity.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  - Participants will be male and female volunteers between the ages of 18-55

          -  Participants will report having used cocaine on at least four occasions within the
             month prior to screening; the urine sample obtained during the screening visit must be
             positive for the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine (&gt;300 ng/ml). They can meet DSM-IV
             criteria for cocaine abuse and dependence.

          -  Participants cannot meet DSM-IV criteria for current psychotic disorders (e.g.,
             bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder)

          -  Participants cannot meet DSM-IV criteria for a current major depressive episode

          -  Participants cannot meet DSM-IV criteria for current drug dependence (except nicotine,
             cocaine, and marihuana)

          -  Participants can report current dependence of alcohol

          -  Participants can report current abuse of marihuana, tobacco and alcohol but must test
             negative for alcohol on the day of the scan. Participants cannot have used marihuana
             within twelve hours of their study visits.

          -  Participants cannot be regular opiate users including prescription opiate analgesics

          -  Participants cannot have a history of major head trauma resulting in cognitive
             impairment, seizure, or other neurological disorders.

          -  Participants cannot have any conditions that are contraindicated for MRI (see next
             section)

          -  Participants cannot be pregnant (pregnancy test will be performed before each scanning
             session)

          -  Participants must be able to read screening materials including consent form and give
             informed consent

          -  Participants cannot be taking any medications with a 5-HT mechanism including
             serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake
             inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors
             (MAOIs) and St. John's Wort and tryptophan.

          -  Participants cannot be currently taking any medications that might affect the central
             nervous system including prescription analgesics, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and
             antidepressants. A complete review of medications will be evaluated by study staff.

          -  Cannot have any history of a medical condition that might affect the central nervous
             system at the time of scanning including: Abnormal structural MRI, or a history of
             head trauma or injury causing loss of consciousness lasting longer than 3 minutes or
             associated with skull fracture or intracranial bleeding or who had irremovable

          -  Certain medication patches (if they cannot be removed)

          -  Metal containing IUDs
