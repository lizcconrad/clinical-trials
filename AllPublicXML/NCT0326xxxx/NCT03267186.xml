  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in preventing acute leukemia in patients
      after reduced-intensity conditioning and stem cell transplant. Ibrutinib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To reduce the incidence of relapse at 18 months after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)
      and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis from a
      historical baseline of 45% to 25%, using ibrutinib maintenance therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the incidence and severity of post-transplant complications in subjects receiving
      ibrutinib maintenance after allogeneic HCT.

      II. To study the incidence of infectious complications in subjects receiving maintenance
      ibrutinib after allogeneic HCT.

      III. To study the impact of ibrutinib maintenance on minimal residual disease after RIC and
      allogeneic HCT.

      IV. To study the impact of maintenance ibrutinib on immune reconstitution and alloreactivity
      after allogeneic HCT, specifically on Th1/ Th2 polarization, T follicular cell number, T and
      B cell repertoire, serum immunoglobulin levels, and alloantibody formation.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 60-90 days after allogeneic HCT, patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) for up to 18 months post-transplant in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
