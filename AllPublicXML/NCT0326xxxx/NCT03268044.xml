  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is performed at the weekend for risk to life or limb, when mandated by clinical
      guidelines, or depending on resource availability. Weekend healthcare interventions have been
      associated with increased mortality and adverse clinical outcomes in the majority of the
      literature examining the weekend effect, but these findings are not consistent. Results from
      recent observational studies argue against a true weekend effect. Higher rates of adverse
      outcomes associated with hospital activity at weekends do not appear to be due to altered
      medical staffing as commonly hypothesized, but are thought to be in part a result of data
      artefact and confounding by severity or indication. For this study, we hypothesized that
      patients who are admitted to hospital at the weekend and require surgery have an increased
      risk of death compared with patients who are admitted and undergo surgery on weekdays. The
      primary aim was to examine whether patients who underwent surgery and were admitted at the
      weekend had an increased risk of 30 day all-cause mortality compared with patients who were
      admitted and underwent surgery on weekdays; secondary aim was to examine whether the timing
      of surgery (i.e., surgery on the same weekend or surgery on a subsequent weekday) for
      patients admitted at the weekend is associated with increased risk of 30 day all-cause
      mortality.
