  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to examine the contribution of intense pulsed light (IPL) for
      relieving signs and symptoms of dry eye due to meibomian gland dysfunction. The effect of IPL
      will be examined in a study designed as a randomized controlled trial. In the study arm,
      subjects will undergo 4 treatment sessions, consisting of IPL pulses immediately followed by
      expression of the meibomian glands. In the control arm, subjects will undergo the same
      treatments, except that the IPL pulses will be disabled. For each subject, the duration of
      the study will be 10 weeks, as explained in the detailed description,

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcome measures (tear break-up time, tear film osmolarity, meibomian gland assessment,
      number of meibomian glands yielding liquid secretion in lower eyelid , meibography,
      self-assessed symptoms and close up photos of the lid margins) will be measured at baseline.
      All subjects will receive 4 treatments at 2 weeks intervals. In each treatment session, a
      subject allocated to the study group will be treated with IPL administered in the malar
      region, from tragus to tragus including the nose, 2-3 mm below the lower eyelids. Immediately
      following the IPL administration, the meibomian glands will be manually expressed from both
      eyelids. Subjects in the control arm will receive exactly the same treatment, except that the
      IPL administration will be sham. A single follow-up will occur at 10 weeks after the baseline
      (or 4 weeks after the 4th treatment session). At the follow-up, the changes in the outcome
      measures will be evaluated, and compared between the two arms.

      For each subject, the duration of the study will be 10 weeks: 1st treatment at baseline; 2nd
      treatment at 2 weeks after baseline; 3rd treatment at 4 weeks after baseline; 4th treatment
      at 6 weeks after baseline; and a single follow-up at 10 weeks after baseline).

      Statistically significant differences between the two arms will support the study hypothesis
      that IPL treatment itself provides relief to both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Subjects in the study arm will receive a series of IPL pulses using the M22 IPL handpiece. In subjects of the control arm, the device will be disabled. The subject will feel the lightguide on the skin, will hear clicking sounds, but no light will be actually produced by the M22 device. Since during treatment both eyes of the subject will be fully occluded, no subject will be able to see if the treatment is actual or sham. There is no way to completely mask the subjects, since the IPL generally causes slight redness of the skin, and in some patients is may also cause some discomfort</masking_description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a sham treatment that will mimic the intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy. The tip of the IPL lightguide will be placed in 10-15 locations on the skin of the malar region (both cheeks, from tragus to tragus including the nose) and up to 3 mm from the lid margin of the lower eyelid, but IPL pulses will not be actually delivered. Following this sham procedure, subjects will undergo meibomian gland expression.</description>

    <description>Intense pulsed light therapy is a non-invasive and non-laser light treatment that is FDA-approved for various conditions in dermatology. Subjects will receive a total of 4 treatments over the course of the study, at intervals of 2 weeks. Each treatment will include applications on 10-15 IPL pulses in the malar region and close to the lower eyelids, followed by meibomian gland expression. Meibomian gland expression will be implemented by squeezing the meibomian glands with the aid of two Q-tips positioned on either side of the meibomian glands, or with a meibomian gland expressor forceps.</description>
