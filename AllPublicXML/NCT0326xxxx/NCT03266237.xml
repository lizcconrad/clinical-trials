  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to characterize the immune profile of frail and healthy aged
      individuals and investigate their immune responsiveness including the response to influenza
      vaccine over an 18-month period. The project will include a longitudinal study to define
      immune signatures and multi-parameter profiles associated with frailty and may lead to the
      identification of predictive markers of evolution to frailty and Immunosenescence in the
      elderly.

    <textblock>
      With better healthcare available and improved accessibility, people are living longer.
      However, a majority of older persons cannot be considered to be aging well. Approximately 70%
      of those aged 85 years or older require frequent long hospitalizations because of their
      increased susceptibility to infections, cancers, dementia, and other age-related health
      problems, along with overall loss of function and autonomy associated with old age. Previous
      studies have shown that vaccination against influenza, which significantly reduces all-cause
      mortality in the elderly (65 years and older), was less immunogenic and effective with age.
      Frailty, a geriatric syndrome associated with low functional activity, weight loss,
      exhaustion, disability, decreased resilience to stressors, has been shown to increase risk
      for adverse outcomes and death. Better understanding the relationship between aging and
      waning immune responsiveness will enable the development of strategies to improve response to
      vaccination in the elderly and reduce morbidity and eventually mortality associated with age
      related complications and outcomes such as infectious diseases or frailty. A comprehensive
      analysis of the immune phenotype and function after antigenic challenge in older individuals
      would be a unique approach to understand (i) the potential associations between aging,
      impaired immune function and transition to frailty, (ii) which components of the immune
      system are altered with aging (innate vs adaptive immunity) and (iii) if early and/or late
      immune responses are preferentially altered with aging and frailty.
