  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of GSK2982772 following administration of
      modified release formulations in a capsule relative to an immediate release reference tablet
      formulation and the pharmacokinetics of escalating repeat doses of a selected modified
      release prototype. The study is divided into two parts: Part A will be a non-randomized 6
      periods, sequential, 6-way fixed sequence design in which up to 4 MR minitab formulations of
      capsules will be evaluated. Periods 1, 2, and 3 will evaluate a slow MR release duration
      (nominally 24 hours), a fast MR release duration (nominally 10 hours), and IR tablet
      respectively. Periods 4, 5 and 6 will have flexible dose regimen and it will depend on the
      outcomes of Period 1 to 3. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic the previous day before
      dosing. Each in-patient period will consist of 3 days and 2 nights followed by a minimum
      washout period of 7 days between doses. In Part A 16 healthy subjects will be enrolled such
      that at least 12 evaluable subjects complete the study. Part B will be an open-label, repeat
      dose study in which the selected MR minitab formulation in capsule will be evaluated. Each
      in-patient period will consist of 5 days and 4 nights. There will be a minimum of 7 days'
      washout period between the last morning dose of one period and the first dose of the next
      period. In Part B 10 healthy subjects will be enrolled.
