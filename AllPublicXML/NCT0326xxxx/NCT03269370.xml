  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychological disorders, with prevalent onset in
      childhood and adolescence. While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the
      first-line treatment for pediatric anxiety, significant barriers remain in accessing CBT and
      other evidence-based treatments (EBTs), and credible self-help resources based in EBT
      concepts. This study evaluates a family-guided CBT game application (Anchors App), targeted
      to children ages 6-11 and their families, which focuses on delivering adaptive CBT-based
      coping skills to those who have sub-clinical to mild anxiety and related symptoms in a
      convenient and portable platform. Anchors App will be evaluated in two forms (standard and
      &quot;parent-enhanced&quot;) in comparison to use of a self-help book or waitlist control. The rapid
      advancements in technology allows richer interactive capacity, content scalability,
      customizability, and subscription to a broader range of content, which this app capitalizes
      on in order to increase access to CBT skill concepts directly to pediatric stakeholder
      populations. If found to be effective, Anchors App has the opportunity to promote engagement
      of EBT concepts in every-day use through smartphone technology, and will change the landscape
      of mental health prevention and early intervention for children and families.
