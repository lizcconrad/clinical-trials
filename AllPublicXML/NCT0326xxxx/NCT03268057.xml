      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV administration of
      VX15/2503 in combination with a fixed dose of avelumab in patients with advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer. The dose escalation portion of the study will determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of VX15/2503 administered in combination with avelumab.

      This is a phase 1b/2 study, designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      VX15/2503 in combination with avelumab in immunotherapy-naïve subjects diagnosed with
      advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC who have either progressed on cytotoxic chemotherapy or
      declined first-line treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The primary objective (Dose
      Escalation Phase) is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of VX15/2503
      Q2W in combination with avelumab 10mg/kg Q2W. The second primary objective (Dose Expansion
      Phase) is to evaluate safety and tolerability of teh recommended phase 2 dose of VX15/2503
      administered in combination with 10 mg/kg avelumab Q2W. The secondary objectives include
      (Dose Expansion Phase), a preliminary estimate of efficacy using the following in accordance
      with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, Objective Response (OR),
      Duration of Response (DoR) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), as well as making a
      preliminary estimate of efficacy using the following in accordance with iRECIST, OR, DoR and
      PFS. Additional secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetics profile of
      VX15/2503 and avelumab administered Q2W in combination, evaluate the immunogenicity of
      VX15/2503 and avelumab administered Q2W and evaluate VX15/2503 and avelumab pharmacodynamics
      markers including but not limited to receptor occupancy. Exploratory objectives include
      identification of candidate biomarkers of activity and biomarkers that may predict response
      to treatment with combination therapy of VX15/2503 and avelumab.

      Enrollment will involve approximately 40 individuals who are 18 years of age or older with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The study will be divided into two phases, dose
      escalation with up to 18 patients and dose expansion with up to 28 subjects. Subjects that
      are enrolled in the dose escalation phase may continue into the dose expansion phase, as long
      as there is no evidence of disease progression. The subjects entering the dose expansion
      phase from dose escalation, may have their dose increased to the recommend phase 2 dose, once
      it is determined. Any subjects that have evidence of disease progression will be taken off of
      treatment and will have a post treatment safety follow-up visit 10 weeks after last
      treatment. Subjects that have discontinued study drug will also continue to be followed every
      3 months for survival, or lost to follow-up. It is estimated that the study will take
      approximately 33 months between first subject enrolled and last subject visit.

             immunotherapy naïve.

          4. Escalation Phase: Subjects may be enrolled with ≤ 2 lines of prior systemic
             anti-cancer therapy (but no immunotherapy). Subjects who have had no prior systemic

             first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy or who have declined first-line treatment with
             cytotoxic chemotherapy will be enrolled. Subjects with no prior systemic anti cancer
             therapy (i.e. first line therapy) may be enrolled in a second cohort if approved by
             the SMC. Subjects previously treated with systemic adjuvant therapy, other than

               -  ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN (5.0 x ULN in the presence of liver metastasis).

         12. Highly effective contraception (i.e., methods with a failure rate of less than 1 % per
             year) for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception exists (Note: The
             effects of the trial treatment on the developing human fetus are unknown; thus, women
             of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception,
             defined in Protocol Appendix 9.3, or as stipulated in national or local guidelines.
             Highly effective contraception must be used for the duration of trial treatment, and
             at least for 60 days after stopping trial treatment or 6 months after stopping
             chemotherapy [or per label]. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this trial, the treating physician should
             be informed immediately).

         13. Resolution of toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy, to NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade 0 or
             1, except for alopecia. Subjects may be enrolled if their toxicity is determined to be
             irreversible and will not put them at undue risk from study treatment, based on the
             Investigator's assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior therapy with any antibody or drug targeting T-cell coregulatory proteins (immune
             checkpoints), such as PD-1, PD-L1, or cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4.

          2. Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1); however,
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 not constituting a safety
             risk based on Investigator's judgment are acceptable.

          3. Concurrent anticancer treatment within 28 days before the start of trial treatment
             (e.g., cytoreductive therapy, radiotherapy [with the exception of palliative bone

             erythropoietin.

          4. Major surgery within 28 days before the start of trial treatment (excluding prior

             be tapered off these drugs before initiation of the trial treatment (with the
             exception of subjects with adrenal insufficiency, who may continue corticosteroids at
             physiologic replacement dose, equivalent to ≤ 10 mg prednisone daily). Note: Previous
             or ongoing administration of systemic steroids for the management of an acute allergic
             phenomenon is acceptable as long as it is anticipated that the administration of
             steroids will be completed in 14 days, or that the daily dose after 14 days will be
             ≤10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent.

          6. Previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy to be investigated in this
             trial within the last 5 years (with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma
             skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of skin, bladder, cervix, colon/rectum, breast, or
             prostate) unless a complete remission without further recurrence was achieved at least
             2 years prior to study entry and the subject was deemed to have been cured with no
             additional therapy required or anticipated to be required.

          7. Rapidly progressive disease.

          8. ECOG performance status score ≥ 2.

             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible) or immunodeficiencies.

         12. Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on study is
             prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines (e.g. inactivated

         13. Significant acute or chronic infection including, among others: Known history of human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Hepatitis B

             with suspected brain metastases at Screening should have a CT/MRI of the brain prior
             to study entry.

         15. A history of hypersensitivity to other humanized monoclonal antibodies.
