  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent literature data suggest beneficial effects of dietary fats in patients with cancers,
      in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Milled mix of flax, sesame and pumpkin
      seeds provides a high amount of PUFAs and a desirable n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancers are characterized by inflammation and alternations in lipid and fatty acid
      metabolism. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma have impaired fatty acid profiles, low level
      of PUFAs, and high n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio. Moreover, these changes are related to clinical
      outcome.

      Flax seeds, sesame and pumpkin seeds are rich sources of PUFAs. Dietary intake of milled mix
      of these seeds has been shown to decrease inflammation and improve PUFAs status in patients
      on hemodialysis and to decrease breast cancer risk.

      The study design is single-blind, controlled, randomized nutritional intervention. The
      participants are randomly assigned into intervention and control group before starting
      chemotherapy. All patients receive nutritional counseling to achieve a daily energy and
      protein intake according to recommended dietary allowances, with (intervention) or without
      (control) of milled seed mix.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a parallel, randomized, single blind, controlled, 5-months nutritional intervention, investigating health effects of dietary intake of milled mix of flax/sesame pumpkin seeds in sour milk, in patients with NHL undergoing chemotherapy.
At the beginning of the study, all patients received nutritional counselling, where half of the study subjects are randomly assigned to a treatment arm with milled seed mix consumption, or control arm without seed mix. Treatment arm is provided with 450g of milled seed mix and instructed to consume 30g of the mix daily (18g flax seed, 6g pumpkin seeds, and 6 g sesame) in 180 mL of sour milk. Control arm is instructed to consume180 mL of sour milk.</intervention_model_description>
