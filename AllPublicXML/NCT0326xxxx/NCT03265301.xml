    <textblock>
      With the ongoing developments in the field of hysteroscopy during the past 15 years,
      hysteroscopic surgery is becoming safer and less invasive for the patient. Improved
      technology has enabled surgeons to perform many operative procedures in an ambulatory setting
      without significant patient discomfort and with potentially significant cost savings.

      Office operative hysteroscopy (see and treat hysteroscopy) reduces the distinction between a
      diagnostic and an operative procedure, shifting the focus in health care away from inpatient
      diagnosis and treatment. The development of smaller-diameter hysteroscopes with
      continuous-flow system features and working channels, through which operative instruments can
      be introduced, has made it possible to treat some uterine and cervical diseases without the
      traditional need for cervical dilation or general anesthesia.

      Use of specially designed hysteroscopic 5F mechanical instruments (e.g., scissors, biopsy
      cup, graspers, and corkscrews) has long been the only way to perform operative procedures in
      an ambulatory setting. However, although grasping forceps and scissors are excellent for
      treating adhesions, cervical polyps, and endometrial polyps smaller than or the same size as
      the larger endometrial polyps, or thick lesions (e.g., submucous fibroids) were difficult to
      treat successfully using such miniature, fragile instruments and without cervical dilation.

      An important technologic advance occurred in 1997 with the introduction of a versatile
      bipolar electrosurgery system dedicated to hysteroscopy, the Gynecare VersaPoint (Ethicon,
      Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA), which represents a key point in the history of office operative
      hysteroscopy. With the use of 5F bipolar electrodes, the number of pathologic conditions
      treated using office operative hysteroscopy has increased tremendously, reducing the use of
      the resectoscope and the operating room to a smaller number of cases.

      More recently, a new generation of electrical generators, allowing the use of bipolar energy
      on miniaturized electrodes, has been presented (Autocon 400 II; Karl Storz Endoscopy,
      Tuttlingen, Germany). The main advantage of these instruments is that they are reusable,
      thereby reducing the costs of office operative as those described for the Versapoint system.

      The feasibility of ambulatory uterine surgery is not just dependent on recent technological
      advances in instrumentation such as miniaturization of equipment, but also the favorable
      anatomical characteristics of the uterus itself. The sensitive innervations of the uterus
      originate in the myometrium and extend to the outer serosal surface, whereas the endometrium
      and any fibrotic tissue within the cavity are less sensitive. Thus, procedures can be carried
      out without the use of analgesia or anesthesia.

      However, a careful operative technique is of paramount importance, in particular, avoiding
      inadvertent deep penetration of the superficial myometrium when resecting lesions such as
      polyps, maintaining the lowest possible distension pressures, and expediting procedures
      through efficient surgical techniques.
