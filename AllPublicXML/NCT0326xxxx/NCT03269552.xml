  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well carfilzomib with or without rituximab work in treating
      patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or marginal zone lymphoma that is previously
      untreated, has come back, or does not respond to treatment. Carfilzomib may stop the growth
      of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and
      spread. Giving carfilzomib alone when disease is responding or with rituximab when disease is
      not responding may work better in treating patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or
      marginal zone lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate of single-agent weekly carfilzomib (CFZ), measured
      after 2 cycles of therapy, in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) and marginal zone lymphoma
      (MZL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety and tolerability of single agent, weekly CFZ in patients with WM and MZL,
      and determine the tolerability of weekly CFZ+rituximab for applicable patients.

      II. Estimate the time to best response, response duration, and survival with weekly CFZ for
      WM and MZL.

      III. Evaluate the overall response rate associated with weekly CFZ in a subset of patients
      with rituximab refractory WM or MZL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who fail to achieve at least 25% M-protein reduction for
      Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia or partial response for marginal zone lymphoma after 2
      courses of carfilzomib, receive rituximab IV weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 3 and
      then monthly on day 1 of courses 4-6 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year.
