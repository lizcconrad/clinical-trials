      This is a retrospective cohort study to assess the clinical outcome of patients with
      fulminant myocarditis using &quot;Life-support Based Comprehensive Treatment Regimen&quot; and
      conventional therapy. In the present study, participants receive various treatment as part of
      routine medical care without any assignment of specific interventions to them. The process of
      treatment during hospitalization were recorded in medical chart and was reviewed by
      independent research personnel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  16 years of age or older;

          -  Diagnosed as fulminant myocarditis:

               -  Evidence of myocarditis on biopsy or increased biomarkers of myocardial injury
                  (TNI and CK-MB and BNP or NT-pro-BNP);

               -  Acute onset of symptoms of cardiac dysfunction: dyspnea, palpation, chest pain,
                  and/or syncope;

               -  Image for cardiac injury: marked diffused reduction in left ventricle wall
                  movement, with dramatically decreased left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;
                  45%;

               -  Cardiogenic shock, e.g., systolic blood pressure â‰¤90 mmHg or mean arterial
                  pressure &lt; 70mm Hg or a systolic blood pressure decrease &gt; 40 mm Hg, which is
                  associated with the signs of hypofusion: cyanosis, cold extremities, oliguria,
                  and/or changes in mental status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Also considering acute coronary syndrome but unable to perform coronary angiography to
             distinguish acute coronary syndrome from fulminant myocarditis;

          -  Myocardial injury caused by sepsis, chemotherapeutical agents, or poisons;

          -  Unstable hemodynamics or shock caused by hypovolemia.
