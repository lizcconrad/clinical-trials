  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of anakinra in patients with newly diagnosed Still's
      disease, including SJIA (Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and AOSD (Adult-onset
      Still's disease).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled period with two
      dose levels of anakinra and a 4-week safety follow-up after last dose of investigational
      medicinal product (IMP). The primary endpoint will be evaluated at Week 2. Sustained efficacy
      and time to early termination will be evaluated during the full study period.

      A screening visit is optional and may be done to identify patients that could be suitable for
      the study. During the study 6 visits and 2 telephone contacts are scheduled i.e., Day 1
      (baseline visit), Day 4Tel, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16Tel (End of
      Study).

      Patients will be randomly assigned to study drug, after they meet all of the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Patients will receive treatment for 12 weeks,
      either anakinra or placebo. Patients will be randomized to anakinra in a dose of either 2 or
      4 mg/kg/day, with a maximum dose of 100 or 200 mg once daily, respectively. Patients will be
      randomized to placebo with corresponding volumes for each of the two anakinra dose levels.
