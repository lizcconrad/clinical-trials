  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a demonstration project focused on translating neuroscience insights into clinical
      practice. The researchers will evaluate how neuroscience assessments may be applied in the
      clinical setting to help inform care decisions. The aim of the study is to undertake a
      pragmatic pilot trial to assess whether the inclusion of structured feedback from
      neuroscience assessments has an effect on improving patient outcomes. The study will
      investigate how neuroscience assessments can be integrated into and improve clinical care.
      The impact of sharing information and conclusions from these assessments with psychiatric
      providers will be explored. Outcomes will include symptoms, social/occupational function and
      qualify of life.

    <description>All participants in the study will undergo a comprehensive neuroscience assessment including clinical questionnaires, a structured diagnostic interview, neuropsychological assessment, genetic testing, and structural and functional MRI. Participants randomized to the Feedback Group will have the results of this assessment shared with their psychiatric treatment team before they begin treatment. This data will be used at the full discretion of the treatment team to inform personalized treatment options. All treatment decisions remain up to the treatment providers and patient.</description>
