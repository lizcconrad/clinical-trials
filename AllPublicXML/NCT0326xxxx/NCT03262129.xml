      Type 1 - Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome (MEN1,) is an autosomal dominant disorder
      secondary to MEN1 mutations that predisposes carriers to endocrine tumors. The MEN1 gene
      located on chromosome 11q13 encodes menin, a 610 amino acid protein expressed in all tissues
      tested. Menin is a scaffold protein which interacts with a large number of intracellular
      molecules. MEN1 disease may display various clinical associations The tumors mainly develop
      from endocrine tissues and may arise from parathyroid glands, duodeno-pancreas, pituitary
      gland, adrenal glands, and at a lower frequency from the bronchi and thymus. The penetrance
      is very progressive but ultimately high during a lifespan.

      Although the syndrome was discovered in 1903 by Erdheim and properly documented in 1954 by
      Wermer, it was only in the 1970s that the variety of clinical presentations was acknowledged
      and first attempts to codify treatments were made. Most published studies deals with selected
      and small size populations. Thus, many aspects of the natural history of MEN1 remains unknown
      as well as the optimal care of patients. In addition, although advances in genetics improved
      the diagnosis of MEN1, there are still clinical forms whose attachment to the syndrome is
      difficult: atypical, paucisymptomatic, forms the negative genetic diagnosis (10%). These
      clinical forms need to be clarified to ensure optimum support.

      This cohort relies on the Groupe d'Ã©tude des Tumeurs Endocrines (GTE) network for MEN1,
      created in February 1991, and brings together clinical centers in France and Belgium (n=80)
      as well as the four genetics laboratories in charge of MEN1 diagnosis. It aims at improving
      the knowledge of the MEN1mainly in describing:

        -  its evolution over time globally and according to the initial presentation, (
           particularly accounting the risk of the occurrence of secondary MEN1 related or
           unrelated tumors, and death)

        -  the genotype-phenotype correlations and heritability of the disease

        -  the real life management of patients and its impact on cure and survival for each type
           of MEN1-related tumor

        -  the impact of the NEM on the patients' daily lives, their perception of the disease and
           their satisfaction with their care
