  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meningioma is the most common central nervous system (CNS) tumor and accounts for
      approximately 30% of all CNS tumors. For meningioma recurring after surgery and radiation
      therapy, there is no effective medical therapy. Repeat surgery or radiation therapy may be
      possible, but they are temporizing measures with limited durable relief. PD-L1 expression in
      meningioma is increased for recurrent tumors or prior radiation therapy, and a recent case
      study reported significant reduction of an intracranial meningioma after 6 months of PD-L1
      blockade. Radiation has been shown to augment immune response when combined with PD-L1
      blockade. Proton radiation therapy has higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and may
      further amplify the above immunological signals. Combination of proton radiation therapy
      administered concurrently with PD-L1 inhibitor may maximize immune response for recurrent
      meningioma. However, confirmation of the increased immunogenicity or increased tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes using the combination of radiation therapy and PD-L1 blockade have
      not been confirmed in patients. The proposed study will be a single institution, single-arm,
      open-label, phase Ib study to combine neoadjuvant avelumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) with
      hypofractionated proton therapy of 20 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent) over 5 fractions followed
      by planned surgery for recurrent radiation-refractory meningioma. This study is designed to
      provide proof of concept to demonstrate on-target effect of the combination to increase
      immunogenicity by directly examining the resected tumor for immune response and to evaluate
      preliminary clinical efficacy

Proton therapy 20 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent) will be given over 5 daily fractions of 4 CGE per day during weekdays
After 3 months of avelumab, patient will have a brain MRI evaluation, and radiological response will be assigned based on the iRANO criteria. Surgery will be performed as per routine clinical care
If the brain MRI after 3 months of avelumab shows complete response with no signs of residual tumor, no surgery will be indicated, and the patient may continue to take adjuvant avelumab for an additional 3 months.
After the patient has recovered from the surgery and if deemed medically eligible by the treating physician to receive additional immunotherapy, avelumab will be restarted and administered every 2 weeks for an additional 3 months</description>
