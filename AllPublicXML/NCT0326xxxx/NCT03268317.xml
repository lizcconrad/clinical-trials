      Neuropsychiatric adverse effects of direct acting antiviral drugs, especially Sofosbuvir and
      Daclatasvir combination therapy (with or without ribavirin) in patients with chronic
      hepatitis C , genotype four (the predominant genotype in Egypt).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of hepatitis C virus, a virus infecting over one hundred seventy million worldwide,
      has evolved over the last two decades and moved from interferon-alpha monotherapy to
      pegylated interferon-alpha in combination with ribavirin therapy. Despite enhanced sustained
      virological response rates, psychiatric illness remains a barrier to widespread hepatitis C
      virus treatment uptake due to the neuropsychiatric risks associated with interferon-alpha.The
      next generation of hepatitis C virus therapeutic agents is direct acting antivirals that
      still require the use of interferon-ribavirin combination therapy.

      Poorly managed psychiatric illness can lead not only to treatment discontinuation,but also
      poor adherence to treatment and serious psychiatric sequels, such as suicide.

      Data on neuropsychiatric adverse effects of direct acting antivirals is limited and
      predominantly derived from landmark clinical trials for boceprevir and telaprevir.These first
      generation direct acting antivirals are currently not in use due to their multiple side
      effects ,the need for concomitant interferon-alpha ,and there wide drug-drug interactions.
      Recently the treatment of hepatitis C virus has undergone a paradigm shift with the
      introduction of the second generation of direct acting antivirals. This interferon-free
      modality has brought about exceptional cure rates with sustained virological response
      exceeding ninety hundred percent, with better tolerability, minimized side effects and short
      duration of treatment . Of the current hepatitis C virus treatment regimens, the combinations
      of Sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir have shown a high efficacy rate in achieving sustained
      virological response in genotype one patients.

      To the investigators' knowledge, the development of neuropsychiatric side effects with the
      use of these second generation direct acting antivirals in absence of interferon therapy, as
      well as the impact of the expected high sustained virological response to therapy on the
      psychiatric condition of patients with chronic hepatitis C (in absence of cirrhosis) have not
      been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to evaluate the neuropsychiatric adverse
      effects of direct acting antivirals,especially Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir combination therapy
      (with or without ribavirin) in patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype four (the
      predominant genotype in Egypt).
