  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of undertaking CLN0020.p, which is a Substudy of the European Coil registry
      (CLN0014), is to investigate the use of COPD Co-Pilot AIRTM, a COPD disease management
      program manufactured and operated by HGE Health Care Solutions, LLC, in subjects undergoing
      the PneumRx Endobronchial Coil Treatment in a post market setting.

    <textblock>
      COPD Co-Pilot AIRTM combines a digital respiratory symptom reporting subject application (an
      &quot;app&quot;) with facilitation of rapid personalized clinical recommendations made by the subject's
      health care provider and communicated to the subject through the application. COPD Co-Pilot
      AIRTM provides early identification of an increase in a subject's respiratory symptoms
      relative to the subject's own baseline symptom profile which in turn enables health care
      providers to rapidly implement modified treatment plans.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has read, understood and signed a CLN0020.p informed consent prior to
             enrollment.

          2. Subject is appropriate for Coil treatment per the CE-Mark Approved RePneu IFU.

          3. Subject has been enrolled in and scheduled for treatment(s) with the PneumRx
             Endobronchial Coil procedure in the CLN0014 study.

          4. Subject's PneumRx Endobronchial Coil procedure is scheduled to occur no fewer than 14
             days from enrollment, providing enough time to establish a baseline of their daily
             symptoms.10 days minimum of baseline data are required, which is defined as the Run-in
             period going forward.*

          5. Subject is willing and able to use a smart phone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has undergone a Coil procedure.

          2. Subject has had an acute exacerbation of COPD that required hospitalization or ER
             visit or treatment with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics during the 28 days prior
             to CLN0020 enrollment.

          3. Subject has a COPD exacerbation or respiratory illness during the Run-in period that
             in the judgment of the investigator requires medical intervention (e.g., treatment
             with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalization).*

          4. Subject is suffering from terminal illness expected to adversely affect survival in
             the next 12 months.

          5. Subject has a history of non-compliance with medical therapies.
