      Case series prospective study All adult patients who were admitted to AUH with proximal
      femoral fractures within one year.

      We will evaluate the real treatment protocol which was applied for those patients.

      Surgical procedures, as plating, Proximal Femoral Nail , Dynemic Hip screw and others
      procedures according to needed for each types.

      This epidemological study in proximal femoral fractures will provide an update on incidence,
      admission, hospital stay and surgical procedures. This information will assist health
      providers in planning hospital beds, surgical intervention, and risk prevention, moreover,
      this data can be use for farther clinical studies.
