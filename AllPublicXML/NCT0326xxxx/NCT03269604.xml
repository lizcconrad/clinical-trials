  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) is the isolation of a bacterium in a sample of urine
      appropriately collected from a person who does not have signs or symptoms of urinary
      infection. It is common in diabetic women, in pregnant women, in men over 60 years and in
      patients with spinal cord injury.

      There is clinical evidence that AB should be treated in patients who will be operated on with
      urologic surgery because of the risk of presenting infectious complications; however, the
      timing of initiating antibiotic therapy has not been established, even in some studies the
      prophylaxis has been considered from one to seven days prior to the procedure, without
      determining the differences in the outcome for each one of the interventions and causing an
      undue and risky use of antibiotics.

      A randomized, parallel-design, single-masked clinical trial will be performed to compare and
      analysis the bloodstream infections, surgical site infections, readmissions and hospital stay
      in three intervention groups, 1) those receiving antibiotics during the previous 5 days to
      the procedure; 2) 3 days prior to the procedure; and 3) those who receive only a single dose
      of antibiotic on the day of the procedure.

      The main expected result is to identify the timing of initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis in
      urological procedures in patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, with the purpose of
      diminishing the bloodstream and of the surgical site infections. If it is scientifically
      demonstrated that those patients who receive a single dose of antibiotic on the same day of
      the procedure, have the same safety and effectiveness compared to the other two groups, would
      reduce hospital stay, surgical waiting time and indiscriminate use of antibiotics that
      generate multidrug-resistant microorganisms, thus generating an impact on Public Health and
      on the quality of care.
