  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus type 1 is characterized by an absolute insulin deficiency caused by
      T-cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of pancreatic Î²-cells . It is the predominant form of
      diabetes mellitus during childhood and adolescence. Hyperglycemia is a major cause of
      vascular and neuropathic complications that are seen in patients with diabetes mellitus type
      1.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular risk factors remain the most controversial chronic complication in diabetes
      mellitus type 1 Neuropathy in diabetes mellitus type 1 can lead to abnormalities in the
      response of the coronary vasculature to sympathetic stimulation, which may manifest
      clinically as resting tachycardia or bradycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic
      hypotension, loss of the nocturnal decline in blood pressure, or silent myocardial ischemia
      on cardiac testing. These abnormalities can lead to delayed presentation of cardiovascular
      disease. An early indicator of cardiac autonomic neuropathy is reduced heart rate
      variability, which can be assessed qualitatively in the clinic. Limited data suggest silent
      myocardial ischemia is more common in the presence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy .
      Cardiovascular mortality is a leading cause of death in Type 1 diabetic patients, in
      particular in patients with nephropathy.QT dispersion defined as the difference between
      maximal and minimal QT intervals from different electrocardiogram leads ( the QT interval was
      defined as the time between the first deflection from the isoelectric PR interval and the
      visual return of the T wave to the T-P segment ) ,Because these electrocardiogram
      abnormalities may confer an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac
      death , early identification may have prognostic value .
