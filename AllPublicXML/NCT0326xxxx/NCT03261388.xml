  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute, rehabilitation for individuals with spinal cord
      injury (SCI) is being led by the NIH funded NeuroRecovery Network (NRN) Community Fitness and
      Wellness Program through the Activity-Based Locomotor Exercise Program (ABLE). Any individual
      with a spinal cord injury who is eligible for the ABLE Program is eligible for participation
      in the NeuroRecovery Network Research Project (NRN). The purpose of the ABLE POWER Study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of activity-based locomotor exercise programs in individuals
      with SCI through a wait-list controlled design. Individuals who have a spinal cord injury and
      are on the wait list for ABLE will be enrolled in this project for a year while they wait for
      an opening in the ABLE program. Changes that occur while participants are on the wait list
      will be compared to changes that occur after they are enrolled in ABLE. A difference in the
      rate of improvement after enrollment in the intervention would be attributed to the ABLE
      intervention. Individuals participating in the ABLE program will receive the ABLE
      intervention regardless of participation in the ABLE POWER research study. In this design,
      there will be two measures in the year prior to enrollment in ABLE, and two measures in the
      year after enrollment, and the two time periods would be compared to the data collected at
      enrollment into ABLE.

    <description>The NRS measures motor function in individuals with SCI without allowing compensatory motions. This 15 item measure is collected while the participants are on the mat, in sitting, standing, and on the weight supported treadmill. Items include upper extremity function, lower extremity function, sitting, sit to stand, standing, and locomotor items.</description>

        Participants for this research study will be recruited from adults with spinal cord injury
        (SCI) on the wait list for the Neurorecovery Network (NRN) research study. These
        individuals have injuries at all spinal levels and categories of completeness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant must be eligible for the Neurorecovery Network (NRN) Study.
             Eligibility criteria for the NRN study are as follows: The participant must have a
             spinal cord injury, at any spinal level or time since injury. Individuals with
             uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled seizures, uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia,
             uncontrolled hypotension, unstable angina, history of heart attack, osteoporosis, or
             weight of more than 275 pounds (due to the weight limit of the partial weight
             supported treadmill system) are not eligible.

          -  The participant must be on the ABLE wait list.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • The participant must NOT have previously participated in ABLE.
