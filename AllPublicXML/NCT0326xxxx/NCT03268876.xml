  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on an improved understanding of how the extent of successful cytoreduction is
      influenced both by inherent tumor biological characteristics as well as the aggressiveness of
      the surgical approach this project aims to better define the value of cytoreduction and to
      use the knowledge gained to develop more individualized therapy and follow-up. This will be
      achieved through a translational biomedical research approach. Due to the research group's
      traditions clinical phenotyping, biomarker identification, and clinical trials will be the
      focus.

      The patients will be recruited at their follow-up appointment after their surgery. At this
      consultation the patient will be informed about the final diagnosis and extent of disease and
      a plan for their further chemotherapeutic treatment will be developed. All patients will be
      offered carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175mg/m2 q3w for 6 cycles [+ bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg
      q3w for 18 cycles in high-risk women of recurrence (IIIc not maximal debulked with a rest
      tumor of &gt;1 cm2 and stage IV)]. In they fulfill the inclusion criteria and agree the inform
      consent formula will be signed. During the screening period the study team will secure that
      the necessary information needed is available and study specific test and analysis will be
      undertaken. After inclusion the study specific consultations will be scheduled coinciding
      with the patient regular appointments for treatment and follow-up. The patients will be
      followed at predetermined time points (after finalizing the chemotherapy; and every 3 months
      thereafter for 2 years).
