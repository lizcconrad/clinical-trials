  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether Smart After-Care service (Internet-and mobile-based
      lifestyle intervention) has an effect on patients' satisfaction and clinical outcomes in
      patients with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy. Patients with prostate cancer
      on androgen deprivation therapy will participate in the study. The study design is a
      randomized controlled trial. The patients were randomly assigned to intervention or usual
      care groups. Intervention patients received Smart After-Care service for 3 months. Primary
      endpoint was an increase in patients' physical function as assessed using 2 minute walking
      test. Secondary endpoints included improvement in muscle strength, short physical performance
      battery, body composition, and health-related quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After-care is a process targeted towards restoration or maintenance of the physical, mental,
      intellectual and social abilities of an individual affected by cancer. Internet-and
      mobile-based lifestyle intervention have emerged as potential modalities to complement and
      increase accessibility to after-care. In order to meet the growing need for after-care
      services, we developed a Smart after-care system that will assess the efficacy of a web-based
      smartphone-enabled intervention. The system provided specialized tools on after-care of
      prostate cancer including information on nutrition, physical activity, medication adherence,
      and mobile device that can connect to the smartphone. Patients with prostate cancer on
      androgen deprivation therapy will be screened for having adequate musculoskeletal and
      cardiopulmonary function.The study design is a randomized controlled trial. The patients were
      randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups. Intervention patients received Smart
      After-Care management for 3 months. Primary endpoint was an increase in patients' physical
      function as assessed using 2 minute walking test. Secondary endpoints included improvement in
      muscle strength, short physical performance battery, body composition, and health-related
      quality of life.

    <description>Cardiorespiratory endurance was examined by 2MWT performed on a 15.2-m hallway out-and-back course. Patients were instructed to walk as fast as they could until asked to stop at 2 min; the distance covered was recorded.</description>

    <measure>Changes in muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>A handgrip strength test was used to assess upper extremity muscle strength using a hand-held dynamometer. Patients were instructed to apply maximal power for 3 s with the shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, elbow flexed at 90Â°, and the forearm and wrist in a neutral position. Three attempts were given with each hand and the best score (kg) for each was recorded. A 30-s chair stand test was used as a measure of lower extremity muscle strength. Each patient was seated in the middle of the chair (seat height of 40 cm, without armrests but with a backrest) with their back straight and both arms folded across their chest. The patients were instructed to stand up and sit down repetitively and encouraged to complete as many full stands as possible for 30 s while the instructor kept count.</description>

    <description>The SPPB is calculated from three components: the ability to stand for up to 10 seconds with feet positioned in three ways (together side-by-side, semi-tandem and tandem); time to complete a 3-m or 4-m walk; and time to rise from a chair five times.</description>
