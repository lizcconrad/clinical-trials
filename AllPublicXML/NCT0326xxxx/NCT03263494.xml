  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents and young adults with T1D and poor glycemic control (age 14-&lt; 25 years, T1D
      duration &gt;12 months, HbA1c 7.5-&lt;11.0%, using an insulin pump or MDI)) will be randomly
      assigned to either CGM or BGM. Sample size will be 150. The primary outcome assessment will
      be HbA1c after 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include HbA1c, CGM metrics (control group
      will wear blinded CGM at 13 and 24 weeks), and quality of life measures. The randomized trial
      will be followed by a 6-month extension study during which the RCT control group will
      initiate CGM and the RCT CGM group will continue CGM.

          9. Need for use of acetaminophen or acetaminophen-containing products on a regular basis

         10. Participation in a diabetes related intervention study in the past 6 weeks.

         11. Any medical, psychological or social situation where per investigator discretion it
             may be difficult for participant to participate fully in the intervention

         12. Any condition, per investigator assessment, that could impact reliability of the A1C
             measurement, such as (but not limited to) hemoglobinopathy, hemolytic anemia, chronic
             liver disease; chronic GI blood loss, red blood cell transfusion or erythropoietin
             administration within 3 months prior to screening
