  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that SYD985 [(vic-)trastuzumab duocarmazine] is
      superior to physician's choice in prolonging progression free survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized, active-controlled, superiority study in patients with
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The patients should
      have had either progression during or after at least two HER2-targeting treatment regimens
      for locally advanced or metastatic disease or progression during or after (ado-)trastuzumab
      emtansine treatment.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive SYD985 or physician's choice
      treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or study termination by the
      Sponsor. During treatment, patients will have to visit the clinical site to assess efficacy,
      quality of life (QoL), and safety using standardized criteria.
