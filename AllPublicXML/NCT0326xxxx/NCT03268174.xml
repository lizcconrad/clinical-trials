      The purpose of this study is to observe the performance of a cosmetic product, AO+Mist, on
      the appearance of arm skin in subjects with atopic dermatitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blind, bilateral, placebo-controlled study in subjects with
      Atopic Dermatitis affecting both sides of the body. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled to
      participate.

      Subjects will undergo a 2 week washout period prior to the Baseline procedure. Follwoing the
      Baseline visit assessments, subjects will be asked to apply &quot;AO+ Mist&quot; or placebo to the
      affected area of the arm twice a day (morning and night) for 30 days.

      After the 30 day initial study period, subjects will automatically be rolled over to
      participate in the extension of the trial for another 30 days using only AO+Mist on the body
      parts affected by Atopic Dermatitis.

    <description>Subjects receive 2 bottles of product at the Baseline visit for left and right side application. One bottle will contain Placebo only, the other bottle will contain &quot;AO+Mist&quot;.
Label on each bottle will indicate the arm the product is to be applied to. Subjects will be instructed in the use of the spray bottle and asked to self-administer the Test Product as follows:
LEFT arm where skin is affected: 4 pumps of Spray which is labeled accordingly must be applied twice-a-day to the area on the arm affected by AD- once in the morning and once in the evening for 30 days.
RIGHT arm where skin is affected: 4pumps of Spray which is labeled accordingly must be applied twice-a-day to the area on the arm affected by AD- once in the morning and once in the evening for 30 days.</description>
