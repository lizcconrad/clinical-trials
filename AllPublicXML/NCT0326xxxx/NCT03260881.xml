  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the visceral fat of the heart. EAT could locally affect
      the coronary arteries through local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EAT plays a role
      in the development of the coronary artery disease (CAD). EAT is a highly enriched with genes
      involved in inflammation. Given its rapid metabolism and simple measurability, as first
      developed by Iacobellis, EAT serves as target for medications targeting the fat.
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1A) are anti-diabetic medications with recently
      suggested cardio-protective properties. Liraglutide, a GLP-1A, has recently shown to reduce
      the cardiovascular risk. Iacobellis'group found that EAT thickness decreased by an
      unprecedented 36% after 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide. Remarkably, Iacobellis'group
      found for the first time that human EAT express GLP-1 Receptor (GLP-1R). GLP-1A effects may
      be therefore visceral fat specific and target EAT. Based on these preliminary data, we
      hypothesize that treatment with liraglutide will significantly and rapidly reduce EAT
      inflammation. Decreased EAT inflammation can reduce the burden of the coronary plaques. We
      will test our hypothesis in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      interventional study in 40 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and CAD, with an
      acceptable glycemic control on their current diabetes regimen who require elective coronary
      artery bypass graft (CABG) regardless of their participation in the study. Inclusion criteria
      for body fat markers will rule out the confounding effect of different body fast distribution
      at baseline. Interim fructosamine test will insure glycemic equipoise between study arms.
      Study subjects will be randomized in two groups of 20 patients to receive additional
      liraglutide or to remain on current treatment/ placebo prior to cardiac surgery. CAD subjects
      not allocated to liraglutide will be started on a supervised low calorie diet (LCD) to
      achieve approximately 5% of weight loss after 12 weeks to avoid the confounding effect of
      weight loss on the study outcomes. EAT samples will be collected during cardiac surgery and
      processed for analysis of mRNA and protein expression of EAT inflammatory genes such as Tumor
      Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and GLP-1R.

Liraglutide will be started and administered for 12 weeks prior to CABG with a starting dose of 0.6 mg (after a least one week) and subsequent increments to 1.2 mg (after a least one week) and to 1.8 mg (after at least a week on 1.2 mg). The dose of 1.8 mg daily will be maintained until the end of the 12-week study. Other and current diabetes treatment will be continued</description>
