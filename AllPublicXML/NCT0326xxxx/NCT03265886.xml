  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite PH adjustment of local anesthetic solution improves the quality of the block in all
      respects with special advantage of early onset of sensory and motor block, adequate level of
      analgesia, and prolongation of duration of block, the effect of warmed bupivacaine should
      have the same effect which have not been evaluated on supraclavicular plexus block for upper
      limb surgery.

      The warmed bupivacaine used in supraclavicular plexus block may reduce sensory and motor
      block onset and prolong the duration of analgesia when compared to bupivacaine at operating
      room temperature.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of warm bupivacaine 0.5% at 37◦C versus
      bupivacaine 0.5% at operating room temperature at 23◦C on ultrasound-guided supraclavicular
      plexus block characteristics as regard sensory block onset time, motor block onset time,
      duration of sensory and motor block , effective duration of analgesia, total analgesics
      requirement, complications and side effects.
