  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is great need for improved preoperative imaging in men with high-risk prostate cancer.
      Investigators propose to develop and validate an optimized simultaneous PET/MRI protocol for
      local, regional and whole body preoperative staging in a single imaging session using the
      amino acid PET tracer, F-18 fluciclovine. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of
      prostate cancer, the preoperative staging of men with prostate carcinoma (PCa) is currently
      problematic. Conventional imaging is falsely negative for regional lymph node metastases in a
      substantial fraction of men. In particular, approximately 35% of men with high-risk prostate
      cancer will have biochemical recurrence even after optimal surgical resection. A major
      benefit of simultaneous acquisition of a multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) and F-18
      fluciclovine PET includes having the patient undergo a single imaging study which provides
      both anatomic and molecular characterization of the tumor, including metastases which would
      potentially be missed by conventional anatomic imaging and size criteria. Additionally,
      simultaneous acquisition will improve co-registration of the PET and MR data which is
      valuable for small lesions and in anatomically complex regions. Although the use of
      fluciclovine in the characterization of the primary PCa remains to be established, the
      anatomic detail provided by conventional mpMRI will complement the detection of small volume
      metastatic disease by fluciclovine PET. Additionally, the use of hybrid PET/MRI technology
      allows for the assessment of dynamic tracer uptake and washout during the whole body and
      regional PET/MRI scan, which may demonstrate the ability to increase detection of the primary
      PCa on fluciclovine PET. If F-18 fluciclovine PET/MRI can reliably and accurately detect
      nodal metastases in high-risk prostate cancer patients, surgeons may use this new technology
      to develop new treatment algorithms for the optimal management of these patients.
