  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this exploratory phase II trial, the possibility of a personalized treatment after
      resistance to cetuximab will be evaluated. Therefore, tumor material of all patients shall be
      obtained, transferred into avatars and treated the same way as in the patient until
      resistance arises. These resistant tumor cells are subsequently treated by different targeted
      treatment combinations in the mouse avatar model to find the most active drug or combination
      of drugs. This drug or combination of drugs may then be offered to the patient after
      cetuximab resistance has occurred. Multiple liquid biopsies shall be obtained in patients
      during first‐line treatment with cetuximab as well as during second line experimental
      treatment to monitor mutations that may be associated with cetuximab resistance. Furthermore
      at the time of resistance a biopsy should be taken and analyzed to ensure that the mechanism
      of resistance seen in the avatar model matches with the mechanism of resistance in the
      individual patient.
