  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine whether segmental re-examination of the each segment
      (right colon, mid-colon, and left colon) could increase the proximal adenoma detection rate
      (ADR) and to evaluate the time-effectiveness of this approach.

      The investigators prospectively recruited patients (aged ≥45 and ≤75 years) who were
      scheduled to undergo colonoscopy at our center. Patients were excluded if they had advanced
      colonic cancer, prior resection of the proximal colon, inflammatory bowel disease, or
      polyposis syndrome, or were unable to provide informed consent. In addition, if the quality
      of bowel preparation was unsatisfactory (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale [BBPS] score &lt;2 in
      any segment of the colon), or if the cecum could not be intubated during the colonoscopy,
      patients were excluded.

      A randomization list was generated with the randomization algorithm of random sorting, using
      Excel program. Included patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: segmental
      re-examination group, in which the each segment (right colon, mid-colon, and left colon) was
      examined twice segmentally; or control group, in which the withdrawal time in the each
      segment was about 2 minutes.
