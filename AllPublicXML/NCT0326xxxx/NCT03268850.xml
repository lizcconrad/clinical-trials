  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of offering reimbursement for living donor lost
      wages on the rate of live donor kidney transplantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) accelerates the path to transplantation and yields
      superior outcomes compared to dialysis and deceased donor kidney transplantation (KT).
      However, the annual number of LDKTs has declined over the last decade, particularly among
      minority and low-income patients. The investigators hypothesize, and have preliminary data to
      support, that the financial impact on living donors (LDs) is a major contributor to the LDKT
      decline and for persistent racial disparities in LDKT rates. Many LDs have substantial
      non-reimbursed direct and indirect costs, most notably the loss of income or wages following
      surgery. In this study, the investigators will: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of offering
      reimbursement for LD lost wages on the LDKT rate; (2) examine whether offering reimbursement
      for LD lost wages reduces known racial disparities in LDKT; and (3) determine whether study
      outcomes differ significantly by maximum reimbursement amount for LD lost wages.

    <intervention_model_description>Candidates will be randomized 1:1 to the LW-A or LW-B arm, with stratification for race. The investigators will prepare the randomization schedule using permuted blocks of randomly varying size to limit predictability and imbalances in arm assignment throughout the study.

    <description>Enrolled KT candidates will be informed that, in addition to the National Living Donor Assistance Center (NLDAC) program, their LD may be eligible to receive reimbursement for wages lost during the donation recovery period - up to a certain amount, based on randomization. They will be given information describing the LW program, eligibility criteria, and application process to share with potential LDs. At the time of study enrollment, KT candidates will consent to the LD nurse coordinator informing all of their potential LDs about the study and the potential for reimbursement of LD lost wages.
Reimbursement will occur for those LDs who file an application, provide the required documentation, and meet eligibility criteria.</description>

    <description>Enrolled KT candidates will be informed that, in addition to the National Living Donor Assistance Center (NLDAC) program, their LD may be eligible to receive reimbursement for wages lost during the donation recovery period - up to a certain amount (different from LW-A), based on randomization. They will be given information describing the LW program, eligibility criteria, and application process to share with potential LDs. At the time of study enrollment, KT candidates will consent to the LD nurse coordinator informing all of their potential LDs about the study and the potential for reimbursement of LD lost wages.
