    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effects of 8-10 weeks of repeated hot water immersion (&quot;heat
      therapy&quot;) vs. thermoneutral water immersion on vascular function in late middle-aged to older
      (55-79 years) adults.

    <textblock>
      Advancing age is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which remain the
      leading cause of death in the developed world. The key process that links aging to increased
      risk of CVD is the development of arterial dysfunction, including impaired endothelial
      function and arterial stiffening. In addition, age-associated impairments in arterial
      function have been linked to other diseases/disorders of aging, including cognitive
      impairments, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and motor disorders/disability.

      Passive heat therapy, in the form of repeated use of hot baths and saunas, has been used by
      several cultures for centuries; however, the physiological benefits are only now being
      elucidated. For example, recent studies have found that lifelong habitual sauna use is
      associated with considerably reduced risk of all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac death,
      CVD-related death, and Alzheimer's disease and dementia. In addition, 8-10 weeks of hot water
      immersion in young adults has been shown to improve endothelial function and reduces arterial
      stiffness and blood pressure. Therefore, the investigators expect heat therapy to similarly
      improve vascular function, as well as cognitive and motor function, in middle-aged to older
      adults who are at greater risk of CVD and related diseases/disorders.
