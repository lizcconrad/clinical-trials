    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the immune response and safety profiles of two
      injections of EV71 vaccine administrated with or without adjuvant Al(OH)3 at 0.5-μg and 1-μg
      dose in children aged 3 to 6 years old and 2 to 35 months old infants/toddlers.
