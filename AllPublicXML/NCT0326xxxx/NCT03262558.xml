  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) yields a deep immune system dysfunction
      that exposes patients to postoperative infectious complications. Among these, post-operative
      mediastinitis with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) generates significant morbidity and mortality.
      Two radically different approaches have been proposed in recent years to reduce the incidence
      of this complication. A first approach has attempted, without real success, to decrease
      postoperative immunosuppression. The second, more efficient, consisted of screening and
      preoperatively treating patients colonized with SA. However, although its incidence has
      decreased, postoperative mediastinitis remains a terrible nosocomial infection. The authors
      believe that a thorough analysis of the immunological changes induced by cardiac surgery will
      initiate active therapeutics to reduce the post-operative immunosuppression phase, thereby
      decreasing the risk of nosocomial infections. In addition, a study of the interactions
      between the operated (host) and staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic) immune systems will
      provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that expose patients to this bacterium.

      In particular, changes induced by the ECC will be evaluated on:

        -  Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity (IDO)

        -  Apoptosis of lymphocytes and dendritic cells

        -  Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)

        -  Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC )

      After general anesthesia and arterial catheterization and prior to the start of ECC, blood
      samples will be taken for flow cytometry studies, for the purification of PMNs and monocytes.
      The purified PMNs and monocytes will then be used for the measurement of cytokine,
      phagocytosis and bactericidal production capacities.

      The morning following surgery, blood samples will be taken and follow the same process.
