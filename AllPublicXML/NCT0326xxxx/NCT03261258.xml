  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the vast majority of cases, the person of trust (or contact person) is not designated by
      the patient (emergency, severe disease situations, coma, sedation, etc.). The healthcare team
      thus identifies a person who 1) may not be the person the patient would have designated and
      2) may not be the most suitable to take on this responsibility. Though the first point is not
      easy, the main difficulty for the clinician is to know if he is dealing with the &quot;right
      person for the job&quot;, meaning a person who is able to take on the responsibility of the
      contact person. This is a heavy responsibility in terms of the information given, of passing
      on this information to relatives and friends, of consulting the doctors, of help or support
      in medical decisions, etc. This responsibility may also be difficult for one person alone to
      take on and it may be helpful to share it between several friends or relatives. In a princeps
      study (QUENOT, 2015), it was shown that the process used by the healthcare team to designate
      a contact person was based on criteria such as knowledge of the wishes and values of the
      patient, the strength of the relationship with the patient, and the person of trust
      designated before admission to the ICU. However, we do not know what criteria are used by the
      patients themselves or those used by their close friends and relatives. This study will make
      it possible to determine and to measure the possible differences between the criteria used by
      the ICU healthcare team (REPERE I), those used by patients (REPERE III) and finally, those
      used by close friends and relatives (REPERE II).

      In order to do this, 300 persons (150 patients and 150 relatives/friends) will complete
      questionnaires.
