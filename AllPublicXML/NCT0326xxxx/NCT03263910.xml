    <textblock>
      Chinese patients who require gastrointestinal endoscopy will receive an intra-gastric single
      dose of NPO-11 20ml. The superiority of NPO-11 compared to placebo as a premedication for
      endoscopy will be verified in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-assignment design based on
      the proportion of patients having no gastric peristalsis.

      The safety of NPO-11 will be evaluated based on adverse events and adverse drug reactions
      observed between informed consent and 7 days after administration in comparison with the
      placebo group.
