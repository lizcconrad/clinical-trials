      Not-randomized controlled study to evaluate a community intervention to promote self-efficacy
      parenting. The treated group will be composed by all newborns resident in S.Ilario d'Enza
      (105 in 2013) where the Baby Newsletter is implemented. Newborns resident in the Health
      District of Montecchio and born in Montecchio Hospital in the same period are the control
      group (278 in 2013). Preterm or hospitalized children are excluded.
