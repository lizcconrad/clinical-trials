  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), is the chronic form of orthostatic intolerance
      associated with excessive upright tachycardia, and occurs predominantly in young females
      (&gt;85%). Among its most troubling symptoms are lightheadedness, fatigue, and decreased memory
      often called &quot;brain fog&quot; by patients. Task-related neurovascular coupling (NVC) links neural
      activity to an increase in CBF known as &quot;functional hyperemia&quot;. Although memory task
      performance and NVC deteriorated with angle of tilt in POTS but not healthy controls,
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) remained similar to control. Instead, the investigators observed
      extensive narrow band low frequency (0.07-0.13 Hz) oscillations in BP (OBP) that entrained
      and amplified oscillations in CBF (OCBF). OBP and OCBF increased with tilt angle and caused
      impaired working memory and reduced functional hyperemia. The cardiovagal baroreflex couples
      BP to HR to buffer BP changes. The investigators hypothesize that the cardiovagal baroreflex
      becomes progressively impaired with orthostasis in POTS, but not in healthy volunteers, and
      accounts for OBP, OCBF, and loss of NVC; further, improving the baroreflex reduces OBP, OCBF
      and Brain Fog in POTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthostatic intolerance is defined by debilitating upright symptoms that are relieved by
      sitting or lying. Symptoms include upright lightheadedness, fatigue, confusion, and decreased
      memory called 'Brain Fog' by patients. The most common chronic form is Postural Tachycardia
      Syndrome (POTS), characterized by excessive upright tachycardia without hypotension. Of note,
      &gt;85% of POTS patients are female. The proposal that Brain Fog was caused by reduced cerebral
      blood flow (CBF) has been disproven, because graded incremental upright tilt failed to
      demonstrate difference in mean CBF compared to healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, memory task
      performance deteriorates with angle of tilt as does task-related neurovascular coupling
      (NVC), which links neural activity to an increase in CBF known as &quot;functional hyperemia&quot;. The
      investigators have previously observed that large low frequency (0.07-0.13 Hz) oscillations
      in BP (OBP), which entrained and amplified oscillations in CBF (OCBF), increased with tilt
      angle and were associated with impaired working memory and reduced functional hyperemia.

      The sympathetic baroreflex remains intact and HR is excessively increased in the absence of
      parasympathetic counterregulation. The cardiovagal baroreflex couples BP to HR to buffer BP
      changes. Large low frequency BP oscillations, representing a resonance within the sympathetic
      baroreflex loop, occur if there is central hypovolemia, an intact sympathetic baroreflex, and
      reduced parasympathetic buffering of BP by HR; conditions found in upright POTS. This leads
      to the following hypothetical paradigm:

      ↓Cardiovagal Baroreflex → ↑OBP → ↑↑OCBF → ↓NVC → ↓working memory. Therefore, in this
      application, the investigators hypothesize that the cardiovagal baroreflex is impaired in
      POTS while supine, becomes further impaired with orthostasis, and accounts for OBP, OCBF, and
      loss of NVC. Further, the investigators propose that improving the cardiovagal baroreflex
      improves hemodynamics and Brain Fog in POTS patients.

    <description>Cardiovagal Baroreflex during orthostatic stress in unmedicated POTS patients compared to unmedicated control subjects during each angle of incremental tilt. The unmedicated baroreflex measurement will be repeated in POTS patients to similar measurements after treatment with placebo, pyridostigmine or digoxin. Baroreflex measurements will be obtained using the standard &quot;modified Oxford&quot; technique.</description>

Cognitive ability will be repeated in POTS patients to similar measurements after treatment with placebo, pyridostigmine or digoxin. Cognitive ability will be assessed with a standard 2-Back test in which patients identify identical alphabetic characters appearing 2 characters before the current displayed character in a sequence of 29 characters.</description>

    <measure>Cardiac output measure by inert gas breathing technique</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac output measure by inert gas breathing technique. Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by the heart in one minute. The technique uses the Innocor system in which the relative levels of two inert gases - one blood soluble and one insoluble component - are measured over a few respirations (about 5 breaths or 15 seconds). The rate of disappearance of the soluble gas from the alveolar space is proportional to the flow of blood perfusing the lungs and equals the cardiac output.</description>

    <description>Arterial blood pressure in mmHg over each cardiac cycle will be collected using finger photoplethysmography. The arterial pressure is reported as an aggregate of 3 extracted quantities: the systolic blood pressure which is the maximum blood pressure over a cardiac cycle; the diastolic blood pressure which is the minimum blood pressure over a cardiac cycle; and the mean blood pressure which is the average blood pressure over a cardiac cycle.</description>
