  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether withdrawal of aminosalicylate (5-ASA) is
      non-inferior to continuation of 5-ASA therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) subjects in remission.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aminosalicylate (5-ASA) agents have proven effective for inducing and maintaining remission
      in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and thus are commonly used as first-line agents
      for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in remission. However, there is uncertainty regarding
      their effectiveness for CD.

      In this open-label, randomized study, participants with CD in remission will be allocated to
      either continue their 5-ASA therapy or withdraw their 5-ASA. The purpose is to investigate if
      withdrawal of 5-ASA therapy is not unacceptably less effective than continuing on 5-ASA in
      maintaining CD remission over a 24 month period.
