  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized, controlled trial of Vitamin D supplementation in patients on
      peritoneal dialysis and to explore if oral administration of vitamin D3 could reduce the risk
      of subsequent Peritoneal dialysis-related (PD-related) peritonitis and improve the prognosis
      of peritonitis

      Aims of the study are to:

        1. To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk for peritonitis among
           patients on peritoneal dialysis.

        2. To explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of peritonitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened for eligibility one month after the onset of PD-related
      peritonitis, those who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.

      All consenting participants will be randomized into the vitamin D treatment group or the
      control group, general information and baseline biochemistry data would be collected.
      Patients in the treatment group will be treated with oral Cholecalciferol (2000IU/day) apart
      from routine treatment for PD. Those in the control group will receive routine treatment for
      PD. Both groups will be followed for 24 months. During the observational period, any onset of
      subsequent peritonitis will be recorded, serum 25(OH)D, biochemical indices will be measured
      every 3 months. Follow up would take place frequently, any outcome events would be recorded.

      Aims and hypotheses:

      Aim 1: To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk for peritonitis among
      patients on peritoneal dialysis.

      Hypothesis 1: Exposure to oral administration of vitamin D3 will reduce the risk of
      subsequent peritoneal dialysis.

      Aim 2: To explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of peritonitis
      Hypothesis 2: Exposure to oral administration of vitamin D3 will improve the prognosis of
      subsequent PD related peritonitis.
