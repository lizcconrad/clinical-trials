      The investigators are comparing post operative analgesia provided for caesarean section
      patients, with the quadratus lumborum type 2 block and intrathecal morphine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Australia the rate of birth via caesarean section (CS) has significantly increased over
      the last twenty years. Improvements in the care of women undergoing CS are important locally,
      nationally and internationally. Compared to women birthing vaginally, women undergoing CS
      experience more adverse events and more pain. Effective pain relief following CS is important
      as it enables early ambulation, encourages maternal bonding, and promotes breastfeeding
      initiation and establishment. Traditional analgesic techniques following CS include opioid
      medications. Whist effective, the use of opioids are associated with frequent and significant
      side effects. Alternative analgesic agents are being explored in an attempt to improve the
      effectiveness of pain relief available to women and clinicians.

      The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) block is an innovative regional analgesic technique. Its
      role as an effective analgesic agent in abdominal surgery is increasing. However, it has not
      been studied for pain relief in Australia after cesarean section.

      In this study, the investigator aims to compare post-operative analgesia and side effects
      between the QLB blocks versus adding morphine the participant's spinal anaesthetic (ITM)
      during the elective C/S. Results from this study will provide information on the analgesic
      impact of this new and emerging therapy and assist in the development of a larger clinical
      trial.
