  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total body irradiation (TBI) is a standard part of the conditioning regimen for bone marrow
      transplantation (BMT). Several randomized trials have shown superior outcomes using TBI
      compared with non TBI-containing regimens. Standard TBI is usually delivered over three days
      for a total dose of 12 Gy with two daily fractions. However, as demonstrated by our group,
      increasing the TBI dose above 10 Gy is not necessarily associated with better outcome in
      patients undergoing allogenic BMT for hematologic malignancies. For this reason, patients
      older than 40 or grafted after relapse are treated at our center with a reduced-dose 10 Gy
      TBI regimen. This pilot study wishes to investigate in 10 patients with hematological
      malignancies unfit for a standard 12 Gy TBI conditioning regimen a more targeted, conformal
      form of treatment, referred as total marrow (TMI), using volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT). Our
      hypothesis is that using this technique that can allow deliver a higher total dose to the
      target while at the same time assuring to the organs at risk (OAR) the same dose normally
      delivered with a 10 Gy TBI we will improve the therapeutic ratio in these patients.

      This is a feasibility prospective pilot study. Ten patients ≥ 40 years with hematologic
      malignancies prior to Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) will receive a dose escalated
      hypofractionated Total Marrow Irradiation (TMI) (12 Gy in 3 fractions, daily, on 3
      consecutive days).

      The current project is a joint initiative in translational and clinical medical research
      between the Radiation-oncology workgroup and the Bone Marrow transplant workgroup of
      University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG).
