  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using the population-based data sources in Iceland and the well-characterized AGES-Reykjavik
      cohort, our overarching aims are on exploring whether pre-diagnostic serum levels of
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) among older individuals living in Iceland were associated with
      survival after cancer diagnosis. We also wanted to assess the risk of being diagnosed with
      cancer in association with 25(OH)D levels. In this population living just south of the arctic
      circle, vitamin D levels largely depend on dietary- and supplemental sources.

        In 1967, all 30,795 men and women living in the capital area of Iceland and born between
        1907 and 1935 were invited by the Icelandic Heart Association to join a prospective cohort
        study. Approximately 19,000 attended the clinic at least once and became participants of
        the Reykjavik Study. Subsequently, in 2002, a random sample of the cohort comprising 5,764
        men and women who were still alive in Iceland and aged 66 to 96 years entered the Ages
        Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) - Reykjavik Study (20). Serum 25(OH)D was measured
        in 5,519 of all 5,764 (96%) participants at study entry in year 2002 through 2006.
