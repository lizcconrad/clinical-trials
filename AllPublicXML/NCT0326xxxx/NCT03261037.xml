  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This international clinical study will enroll participants with a suspected diagnosis of
      IPF/ILD. This study will characterize the disease behavior of IPF and ILD in the
      peri-diagnostic period. This objective will be achieved using a multidimensional approach
      assessing changes in pulmonary function, measured by daily handheld spirometry and site
      spirometry as well as assessing physical functional capacity at home (accelerometry) and at
      site (6-minute walk tests [6MWT]). Daily handheld spirometry or physical functional capacity
      assessments are not routinely performed in this participant population. By following
      participants' lung function before and after diagnosis using home spirometry, levels of
      physical activity, as well as self-assessment data from the participants (patient reported
      outcomes; PRO), the study would provide potentially more rapid information on disease
      behavior and eventually progression compared to usual clinic measurements that occur only
      every 3-6 months. By receiving data from daily handheld spirometry measurements, treating
      physicians may have an improved chance of detecting earlier and outside of hospital visits a
      decline in lung function that could potentially lead to improvements in both diagnosis and
      treatment for participants with IPF/ILD.
