  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and cost of a simulation-based low dose
      high frequency (LDHF) plus m-Mentoring training versus the traditional group-based training
      approaches in improving knowledge and skill in maternal and newborn care and to determine
      trainees' satisfaction with the approaches in Ebonyi and Kogi states.

      The specific objectives are to:

        1. Compare knowledge and skill learning outcomes between the two groups of birth attendants
           trained through the simulation-based LDHF/m-Mentoring versus group-based training
           approaches in Kogi and Ebonyi states over 12-months.

        2. Assess the trainees' satisfaction with a simulation-based LDHF/m-Mentoring and
           group-based training approaches in improving skills of birth attendants in the selected
           facilities in Kogi and Ebonyi state over 12-months.

        3. Determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of LDHF/m-Mentoring and group-based training
           approaches in improving skills of birth attendants in the selected facilities in Kogi
           and Ebonyi state over 12-months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Simulation-based low dose high frequency (LDHF) training has emerged as a new strategy for
      delivering key content and improving the competencies of health workers. In facility-based
      driven simulation-based LDHF trainings, providers are not removed from clinical practice for
      the extended periods of time, and a heavy emphasis is placed on simulation with practice and
      feedback.

      The Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP) in Nigeria is working in selected health
      facilities in Ebonyi and Kogi States to improve the quality of care received by mothers and
      newborns on the day of birth using high-impact evidence-based lifesaving interventions. The
      simulation-based LDHF/m-Mentoring evaluation comparing it to the traditional group-based
      training will contribute to the body of knowledge on this approach.

      The study design is cluster randomized control trial. Sixty (60) health facilities will be
      selected from the list of 120 facilities which are supported by MCSP and randomized to
      intervention and control group. Selection will be based on caseload, level of service
      delivery, and ownership. Thereafter, these will be randomly assigned to simulation-based
      LDHF/m-Mentoring Group (intervention arm) or Group-Based Training Group (control arm).

    <description>Participants will undergo pre-training assessment comprising multiple-choice questions and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) using manikins. Training is divided into two 4-day &quot;low-dose&quot; sessions at the health facility or onsite training. Pre-training and immediate post-training assessments results will be compared. A score of â‰¥80% is acceptable competence (pass). During the one-month intervals between training sessions, participants practice using manikins to reinforce their competencies through simulation-based practices, facilitated by facility-based trained Peer Practice Coordinators (PPCs). The PPCs will also receive structured, monthly half-hour mentoring calls that will provide remote support, answering questions, providing guidance and reinforcing key messages. Acquisition of knowledge and clinical skills is measured.</description>

Both theoretical and practical through use of manikins - simulation. No reinforcement and further practice will take place once the participants are back in their work stations.
