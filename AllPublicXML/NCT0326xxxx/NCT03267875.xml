    <textblock>
      IgG4 Related Disease is a multi-systemic fibroenophilic disease that includes a basket of
      recently discovered medical conditions.

      The properties that bind them are: lesions similar to tumors in the mixed organs,
      lymphoplasms filtrate enriched with plasma IgG4 positive cells, storiform fibrosis, and
      often, but not always, a high level of IgG4 in the serum.

      This disease has been on the rise for the past two decades and since its recognition in 2001
      there has been impressive progress in understanding its various manifestations, so that today
      almost every body system can be involved.

      One of the conditions associated with this disease is oritis / periortitis and aneurysms

      IgG4 Related Disease is a multi-systemic fibroenophilic disease that includes a basket of
      recently discovered medical conditions.

      The properties that bind them are: lesions similar to tumors in the mixed organs,
      lymphoplasms filtrate enriched with plasma IgG4 positive cells, storiform fibrosis, and
      often, but not always, a high level of IgG4 in the serum.

      This disease has been on the rise for the past two decades and since its recognition in 2001
      there has been impressive progress in understanding its various manifestations, so that today
      almost every body system can be involved.

      One of the conditions associated with this disease is oritis / periortitis and aneurysms

      It is common to divide the aortic aneurysms according to the following etiologies:

        1. Inflammatory-Aortic Aneurisms (IAA) The internal division in this category is whether
           IgG4RD is related / not related.

        2. Atherosclerotic infrastructure.

      Differences between the etiologies: IAA - greater thickness of the wall, fibrosis and
      adhesion to nearby retroperitone structures. Also, younger age and non-specific symptoms. In
      addition, the laboratory findings are usually white counts and increased CRP.

      In this context, the investigators will examine the level of IgG4 in the blood of a
      population of patients with aortic aneurysms and try to understand the proportion of patients
      whose IgG4 level is higher than normal and their aneurysm can be attributed to IgG4 Related
      Disease.

      the investigator chose the blood IgG4 level because it is the most important diagnostic
      variable for the disease (it is customary to place the incision point at &gt; 135mg / dL).
