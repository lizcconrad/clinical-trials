  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avmacol is an over-the-counter dietary supplement containing broccoli seed and sprout
      extracts in tablet form, hypothesized to activate protective cellular pathways including
      detoxication. In this study, participants who have been curatively treatment for head and
      neck cancer, will take Avmacol twice a day for 3 months
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broccoli seed preparation (BSP) Avmacol® results in acute and/or sustained induction of
      NRF2 target gene transcripts in the oral mucosa of patients who have been curatively treated
      for a tobacco-related HNSCC, including high grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive
      carcinoma. This study is not designed to examine the therapeutic or reparative effects of
      Avmacol® on premalignant lesions of the oral cavity.

    <description>You will be given a higher dose of Avmacol® each month, taking 2 Avmacol® tablets per day the first month (Cycle 1), 4 Avmacol® tablets per day the second month (Cycle 2), and 8 Avmacol® tablets per day the third month (Cycle 3). Investigators will study how Avmacol® affects your body by collecting three different tissues: 1) your cheek cells (buccal cells); 2) your urine; and 3) your blood. After you have finished three months of Avmacol®, you will return one month later for an end-of-study visit.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must have completed curative-intent therapy (including surgery,
             radiation, and/or chemotherapy) for a first tobacco-related oral premalignant lesion
             (OPL) or HNSCC of any stage (eligible lesions include high grade dysplasia; carcinoma
             in situ; or stage I-IVa HNSCC).

          2. Primary site may include oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx. Oropharynx primaries must be
             HPV (-) as defined by routine p16 IHC at the local site.

          3. Participants may be enrolled between 3 months and 5 years AFTER completion of
             curative-intent therapy (including surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy).

          4. Participants may have untreated OPLs (i.e., hyperplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ)
             at the time of study entry, provided the index OPL or HNSCC was definitively treated.

          5. Participants must be at least 18 years old.

          6. Participants must have a Karnofsky Performance Status of 80% or higher or an ECOG of
             0-1 (Appendix A)

          7. Current and former tobacco users are eligible. The tobacco use assessment form must be
             completed following consent, to assure eligibility (Appendix B). Patients must have
             ≥10 pack-year cumulative tobacco exposure or its equivalent to be eligible. This is
             defined as follows:

               1. Cigarette exposure: ≥10 pack-years OR

               2. Cigar exposure: ≥ 10 cigar-years, where 1 cigar year is defined as having smoked
                  on average ≥ 1 cigar/day for a year OR

               3. Chewing tobacco: ≥10 snuff-years, where 1 snuff year is defined as using on
                  average ≥ 1 pinch (dip) of chewing tobacco/day for a year.

          8. Able to perform written, informed consent.

          9. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             within 7 Days prior to the first study intervention.

         10. WCBP and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
             birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate
             contraception prior to the study and for the duration of study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Participants have a history of another malignancy within 2 years prior to starting
             study treatment, except for excised and cured carcinoma-in-situ of breast or cervix;

             resected or under active surveillance; superficial bladder cancer; T1a or T1b prostate
             cancer comprising &lt; 5% of resected tissue with normal prostate specific antigen (PSA)
             since resection, or status post external beam radiation or brachytherapy with normal
             PSA since radiation.

             2) Primary oropharyngeal HNSCC which is HPV (+) as defined by p16 IHC. 3) Participants
             with acute intercurrent illness or those who had major surgery within the preceding 4
             weeks unless they have fully recovered.

             4) Participants who have a positive pregnancy test, are pregnant, or breast feeding.

             5) Patients who are not practicing adequate contraception are ineligible if they are
             of child bearing potential.

             6) Patients currently using anti-neoplastic or anti-tumor agents, including
             chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal anticancer therapy.

             7) Chronic anticoagulation with warfarin. Patients on low molecular weight heparin or
             fondaparinux may be enrolled.

             8) Chronic use of steroids at immunosuppressive doses. (Note, physiologic replacement
             doses of glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid are acceptable, eg. prednisone 5-10
