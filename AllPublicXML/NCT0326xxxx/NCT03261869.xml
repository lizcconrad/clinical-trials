    <textblock>
      this study evaluates the effect of cold application after impacted third molar extractions.
      Patients have bilateral impacted third molar tooth included in this study. Patients do not
      applied cold after extraction of third molar on one side and applied cold cold after
      extraction of third molar on the other side.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extraction of impacted teeth causes a trauma which results in an inflammatory response. Some
      postoperative symptoms may occur such as edema, pain, limitations in mouth opening and
      dysfunction as a consequence of the wisdom tooth extraction surgery.

      Local cold application reduces the magnitude of postoperative symptoms. The physiological
      effects of cold application are as follows: vasoconstriction of blood vessels, blood flow to
      the region decreases, edema and inflammation decreases, slowdown in cell metabolism and a
      decrease in local oxygen demand due to the vasoconstriction effect of the cold. Cold therapy
      also induces muscle constriction which reduces muscle stress, pain and inflammation.
