    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Patients with refractory CMV infection post allogeneic HSCT or with primary
        immunodeficiencies with either

          -  Increasing or persistent quantitative qRT-PCR DNA copies despite two weeks of
             appropriate anti-viral therapy AND/OR

          -  Medical intolerance to anti-viral therapies including:

          -  ANC &lt; 500/mm2 secondary to ganciclovir

               -  2 renal toxicity with foscarnet And/or

          -  known resistance to ganciclovir and/or foscarnet

        Consent: Written informed consent given (by patient or legal representative) prior to any
        study-related procedures.

        Performance Status &gt; 30% (Lansky &lt; 16 yrs and Karnofsky &gt; 16 yrs) Age: 0.1 to 30.99 years
        The first 3 patients entered and possibly the next 3 patients entered will be limited to
        age 12.0 - 30.99 years. See section 9.3.4 for age eligibility in the first 6 patients.

        There will be a temporary hold until 45 days after the 3rd patient and possibly the 6th
        patient has received their CMV-CTLs, The study should be reopened for patients of all ages
        (0.1-30.99 years). (See Section 9.3.4 for instructions) Females of childbearing potential
        with a negative urine pregnancy test

        Donor Eligibility Related donor available with a T-cell response to the CMV MACS® GMP
        PepTivator antigen(s).

          1. Original allogeneic donor if available, IgG positive for CMV and confirmatory testing
             to respond to MACS GMP Peptivator CMV pp65.

          2. Third Party Allogeneic Donor: If original donor is not available or does not have a
             T-cell response: third party related allogeneic donor (family donor &gt; 1 HLA A, B, DR
             match to recipient) with IgG positive to CMV and/or a T-cell response to the CMV MACS®
             GMP PepTivator .

        AND Allogeneic donor disease screening is complete similar to hematopoietic stem cell
        donors (Appendix 1).

        AND Obtained informed consents by donor or donor legally authorized representative prior to
        donor collection.

        3 Patient exclusion criteria:

        A patient meeting any of the following criteria is not eligible for the present study:

        Patient with acute GVHD &gt; grade 2 or extensive chronic GVHD at the time of CMV CTL infusion
        Patient receiving steroids (&gt;0.5 mg/kg prednisone equivalent) at the time of CMV CTL
        infusion Patient treated with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 4 weeks prior to CMV
        CTL infusion Thymoglobulin (ATG), Alemtuzumab or T cell immunosuppressive monoclonal
        antibodies within 30 days Patient with poor performance status determined by Karnofsky
        (patients &gt;16 years) or Lansky (patients ≤16 years) score ≤30% CMV retinitis Concomitant
        enrollment in another experimental clinical trial investigating the treatment of refractory
        CMV infection.

        Any medical condition which could compromise participation in the study according to the
        investigator's assessment Known HIV infection Female patient of childbearing age who is
        pregnant or breast-feeding or not willing to use an effective method of birth control
        during study treatment.

        Known hypersensitivity to iron dextran Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the
        protocol or unable to give informed consent.

        Known human anti-mouse antibodies
