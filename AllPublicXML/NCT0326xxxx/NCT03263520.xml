    <textblock>
      Compare the use of nandrolone associated with corticosteroid for the treatment of
      cancer-induced malnutrition to treatment with corticosteroids alone in patients with tumors
      in the high gastro-intestinal tract, liver, pancreas and bile ducts in palliative treatment.

      -  Compare muscle mass values obtained before and after the use of anabolic steroids upon
           assessment by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).

        -  Compare the anabolic effect on quality of life (QLo) of the patient before and after the
           use of anabolic steroids.

        -  Compare data from laboratory tests such as complete blood count, albumin, C reactive
           protein and transferrin with drug intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be made at the time of study enrollment by , where patients randomly selected as even number will be included in group 1 and those selected as odd number in group 2Group 1 (G1): the patient will receive an application of anabolic nandrolone decanoate at a dose of 50 mg (males) and 25 mg (females), intra-muscular form, in the first and fifteenth days. In addition to the anabolic steroid, the patient will use corticosteroids (dexamethasone) at home at a dose of 4 mg daily for both sexes.
