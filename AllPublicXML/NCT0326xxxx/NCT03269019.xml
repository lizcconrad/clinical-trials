  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a kind of catastrophic thrombotic complications
      after the application of heparin. If HIT without treatment, death rate is as high as 30% to
      50%. Early diagnosis of HIT and prevention of thrombosis is very important.

      This study is planned to assess the use of thrombotic biomarkers in patients with HIT,
      including thrombin-antithrombin complex, d-dimer, fibrin degradation products and
      Thrombelastograghy monitoring . These biomarkers are monitored in 5-14 days post-operation to
      assess the risk of thrombosis in HIT patients. All patients were followed up for 30 days, and
      clinical outcomes, including new thrombus and death, were recorded during follow-up.
