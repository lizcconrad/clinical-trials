  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of continuation of buprenorphine/naloxone in
      patients with history of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) scheduled for upper and lower extremity,
      thoracic and abdominal surgery compared to discontinuation of buprenorphine/naloxone 3 days
      prior to surgery on pain scores, opioid consumption, patient satisfaction, and severity of
      substance use dependence- including record of problematic use of any non-prescribed opioids,
      alcohol and illicit narcotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by non-remitting cycles of remission and opioid
      abuse relapse. It is associated with a high rate of psychiatric and physical co-morbidity
      when left untreated. Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone are effective opioid
      maintenance therapy (OMT) for OUD, however, treatment of acute post-surgical pain in patients
      taking buprenorphine is perceived to be challenging. Although not substantiated in clinical
      studies, the combination of high receptor binding affinity, long half-life, and partial mu
      opioid receptor agonism with buprenorphine/naloxone are thought to inhibit the analgesic
      actions of full mu opioid receptor agonists, potentially making standard postoperative pain
      control strategies less effective. There is no evidence based standard of care for optimal
      acute pain management strategies for patients taking buprenorphine and most recommendations
      are based upon provider opinion- occasionally conflicting along specialty lines. Some
      providers, mainly consisting of surgeons and anesthesiologists, recommend that buprenorphine
      should be discontinued at least 72 hours prior to elective surgery and replaced with low dose
      opioid agonists, in the interim. Other providers, mainly comprising of psychiatrists, contend
      that these patients should be maintained on buprenorphine throughout the peri-operative
      period to prevent an indeterminate risk of substance abuse relapse that can occur as
      consequence to the abrupt termination buprenorphine in the highly stressful surgical period.
      This study aims to inform this important unresolved question in the clinical care of this
      growing population. The investigators seek to determine the effectiveness of managing
      postoperative pain in patients with OUD where buprenorphine/naloxone is continued
      perioperatively compared to patients where buprenorphine/naloxone is discontinued.
      Longitudinally, the investigators also intend to determine if there is a difference in
      substance abuse relapse in patients where buprenorphine/naloxone is continued vs. held by
      using self assessments and urine toxicology screens.
