  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-MAG (Myelin Associated Glycoprotein) neuropathy is related to clonal B lymphocyte
      proliferation producing an monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgM) with anti-MAG activity. IgM may be
      a reflection of malignant lymphoproliferative syndrome (Waldenström disease) or, more often,
      monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance.

      The anti-MAG antibody has a direct toxicity on the myelin sheath of the peripheral nervous
      system responsible for a length-dependent demyelinating polyneuropathy. Clinically, this
      results in a sensitive, ataxic predominant polyneuropathy in the lower limbs, sometimes
      associated with a tremor of attitude and action tremor of the upper limbs.

      Clonal B cells at the origin of IgM production may have acquired mutations affecting MYD88
      (MYD88 L265P mutation) and CXCR4 (Whim-like CXCR4 mutation). The prevalence of the MYD88
      L265P mutation is estimated to be 50% in monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance
      and more than 80% in Waldenström disease. CXCR4 Whim-like mutations are found in 40% of
      patients with Waldenström's disease.

      No studies have reported the prevalence of these mutations in patients with anti-MAG
      neuropathies.

      This is a retrospective observational study in patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Mutational
      analysis will be performed for patients with a medullary or blood sample stored in a bio-bank
      during lymphocyte phenotyping. This phenotyping was carried out most often in search of a
      malignant haemopathy associated with the monoclonal peak. No new samples were taken from the
      patient (blood or spinal cord).

      Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement of the clonal B cells are also assessed.
