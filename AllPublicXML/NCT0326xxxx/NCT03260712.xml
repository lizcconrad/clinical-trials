  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-centre, phase II study in biliary tract cancer (BTC) patients.
      The main objective is to detect an increase in progression-free survival rate at 6 months
      (according to RECIST version 1.1) from 60% in patients with BTC treated with standard
      chemotherapy (CT) approach to 75% when treated with CT combined with pembrolizumab.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  Assess the treatment efficacy in terms of overall survival, immune related
           progression-free survival, response rate (according to RECIST version 1.1), safety,
           symptom control and quality of life (QoL) (according to EORTC QoL C30 and BIL 21)

        -  Exploratory objectives include assessment of immunological response (cytokines,
           lymphocyte phenotype, immunoglobulins), and evaluation of pathological and clinical
           predictive factors for response/toxicity

        -  Translational research will focus on biomarkers for prediction of response and toxicity.

             Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  Diagnosis of immunodeficiency, systemic steroid therapy or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment

          -  Patients with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism unless stable on hormone replacement

          -  History of another malignancy or a concurrent malignancy. Exceptions include patients
             who have been disease-free for 5 years, or patients with a history of completely
             resected non-melanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are
             eligible, for example cervical cancer in situ.

          -  Patients who received treatment with live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first
             dose of study medication. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to,

             flu, H1N1 flu, rabies, BCG and typhoid vaccine.

          -  Prior treatment with any anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody or anti-PD-1, or PD-L1 or
             PD-L2 agent. Examples of PD-1 inhibitors (include, but are not limited to):
             pembrolizumab (Merck); Nivolumab (also known as BMS-936558, MDX-1106, ONO-4538)
             (Bristol-Myers Squibb); Pidilizumab (CT-11) (Cure-Tech/Teva); and AMP-224

             RG7446) (Roche Genentech); and MEDI4736 (MedImmune).

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease.

          -  Prior adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed if the last treatment was completed at least 6
             months before trial entry and neither gemcitabine nor cisplatin were given. Also the
             following treatment modalities are allowed within the rules described (provided there
             has been a full recovery):

          -  Surgery - patients may have undergone a non-curative operation (i.e. R2 resection
             [with macroscopic residual disease] or palliative bypass surgery only). Patients who
             have previously undergone curative surgery, must have evidence of non-resectable
             disease relapse requiring systemic chemotherapy prior to study entry.

          -  Radiotherapy - patients may have received prior radiotherapy (with or without
             radiosensitising low-dose chemotherapy) for localised disease. However, there must be
             clear evidence of disease progression prior to inclusion in this study.

          -  Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for localized disease only with no evidence of metastatic
             disease - patients may have received prior PDT, provided the patient has fully
             recovered and at least 28 days have elapsed since the PDT and there is clear evidence
             of disease progression at the local site or disease or at a new metastatic site.

          -  PDT for localised disease to relieve biliary obstruction in the presence of metastatic
             disease - patients may have received prior PDT provided the patient has fully
             recovered and at least 28 days have elapsed since the PDT. Patients may enter trial
             provided the non-PDT treated lesion(s) only are followed for response assessment.

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions
             should be discussed with the patient before enrollment in the trial.
