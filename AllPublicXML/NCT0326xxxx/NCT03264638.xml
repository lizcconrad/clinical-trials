      This study evaluates the effects and biological mechanisms of Dingkundanï¼ŒDiane-35 and the
      combination of Dingkundan and Diane-35 in the treatment of polycystic syndrome(PCOS) in
      adults women. One third of participants will receive Dingkundan capsules, one third of
      participants will receive Diane-35 Pills, and the another third will receive Dingkundan
      capsules and Diane-35 in combination.

      Dingkundan,Diane-35 each ameliorate PCOS, but they do so by different mechanisms. We
      generally treat PCOS patients without immediate fertility requirement by short-acting
      contraceptives,Diane-35 is one of the most commonly used drugs.

      Dingkundan consists of multiple chinese herbs including ginseng,Panax notoginseng,deer
      antlers,Carthamus tinctorius L.,Radix Paeoniae Alba,prepared Radix Rehmanniae,Angelica etc.,
      which gains widespread application in the treatment of gynecological diseases. Based on the
      characteristics above, we try to explore its clinical application value in PCOS and its
      biological mechanisms.
