    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and radiation therapy in
      treating patients with stage I-III multiple myeloma that has come back after a period of
      improvement or that does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving
      pembrolizumab and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with stage I-III
      multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of concurrent single/low dose radiation therapy (radiotherapy) (8
      Gy/1fx) in combination with pembrolizumab in relapsed or refractory myeloma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize late toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] &gt;
      grade 2 toxicity at 6 and 12 months) and the effect of radiation in combination with
      pembrolizumab on systemic response rates using international myeloma working group (IMWG)
      uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma at 6 months and 12 months.

      II. To assess changes in positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a
      result of combining pembrolizumab and radiotherapy at 6 months and 12 months.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy on day 1. Patients also receive pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 2 or 3. Courses with pembrolizumab repeat every 3
      weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
