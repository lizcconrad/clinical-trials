  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While bracing has been shown to be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) in terms
      of function and strength, whether these unloader braces are also similarly beneficial after
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery needs to be examined. Therefore the investigators
      questioned whether wearing a brace that has previously been shown to increase strength and
      function in OA patients can also increase strength and function in patients after TKA.

    <description>Subjects will be fitted with the Ongoing Care Solutions, Inc (OCSI) Rehabilitator brace prior to surgery. This brace will be worn for 6 weeks before surgery. The brace will be worn again after surgery ~10 days after surgery or when staples are removed until the end of the study. Participants will also have two PT visits per week for 2 weeks, followed by additional PT visits at clinician's discretion.</description>
