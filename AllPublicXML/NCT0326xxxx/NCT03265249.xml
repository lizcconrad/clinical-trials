    <textblock>
      Auricular neurostimulation is a potential novel and non-invasive method of pain control
      following liver transplantation in a growing patient population with the probability of
      significant impact on economics and morbidity. The investigator propose a pilot study to
      investigate the effects of auricular neurostimulation in patients receiving a liver
      transplantation. The investigator will investigate the effects of auricular neurostimulation
      with this novel device and compare it to the current standard of care for pain management
      following liver transplantation.

      This is a prospective, randomized study to determine the efficacy of the BRIDGE device in
      reducing pain and opioid use in patients following liver transplantation. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ration to one of the below groups:

      Group 1: BRIDGE device will be placed prior to start of the surgery with standard of care
      pain control analgesia

      Group 2: Subjects will receive the standard of care pain control analgesia
