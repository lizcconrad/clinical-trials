  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perforator vessels are those where the source artery is deep and the branch that carries
      blood to the fasciocutaneous tissues passes through the overlying deep fascia.

      Soft tissue defects in the lower extremity, especially distal third of leg, present a
      challenge to reconstructive surgeons due to lack of reliable local flaps, conventional
      reconstructive options include split skin grafting, local random fasciocutaneous flaps, cross
      leg fasciocutaneous flap, pedicled muscular or musculocutaneous flaps or microvascular free
      tissue transfer. All these procedures have their limitations and associated morbidity at
      donor site

      Taylor and Palmer defined an angiosome as a three-dimensional vascular territory supplied by
      a source artery and vein through branches for all tissue layers between the skin and the
      bone, and showed that between neighboring angiosomes there are choked and true anastomotic
      arteries.

      Koshima and Soeda in 1989, described an inferior epigastric artery skin flap without the
      rectus abdominis muscle for reconstruction of floor of mouth, began the era of perforator
      flaps.

      The big popularity gained by the local perforator flaps was due to their main advantages: 1)
      Sparing of the source artery and underlying muscle and fascia, 2) Combining the very good
      blood supply of a musculocutaneous flap with the reduced donor-site morbidity of a skin flap,
      3) Replacing like with like, 4) Limiting the donor-site to the same area, 5) Possibility of
      completely or partially primarily closure, 6) Technically less demanding, because they are
      microsurgical procedures, but without microvascular sutures, 7) Shorter operating time.

    <description>Once the perforator is identified, the flap will be designed around the perforator or perforators according to the location and size of the defect.
A tourniquet is inflated without prior exsanguination. This maneuver facilitates identification of perforators as they remain filled with the blood.
An exploratory incision along the margin of flap is made keeping the position of marked perforator in mind. The incision is made through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, deep fascia (sub-fascial approach) and the perforator vessel is directly visualized. The incision is initially always made from one side of the flap only to properly identify the perforator.
Careful and meticulous dissection is done in a blunt way isolating the perforator.
After deflation of the tourniquet, hemostasis is performed.</description>

    <description>A two-team approach is used for microvascular free tissue transfer. The first team starts exploring the limb for the recipient vessel. The second team simultaneously begins elevating the perforator flap and its vascular pedicle.
Microvascular anastomosis will be carried out under operating microscope for one artery and one or two accompanying veins.</description>
