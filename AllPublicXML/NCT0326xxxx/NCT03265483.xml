  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One striking observation is that a large portion of the inter-person variation in serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels is unexplained. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate
      vitamin D synthesizing and metabolizing enzymes are Mg-dependent. Magnesium (Mg)
      supplementation substantially reversed the resistance to vitamin D treatment in patients with
      magnesium-dependent vitamin-D-resistant rickets. The investigators reported in 2013 from
      observational studies conducted in the general US population that Mg intake significantly
      interacted with vitamin D intake in affecting vitamin D status as well as interacted with
      serum 25(OH)D in risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and, maybe, colorectal cancer
      mortality. The potential interaction between Mg and vitamin D was supported by two subsequent
      studies, including a Finnish cohort study and a mouse study.

      In the parent study (Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial, NCT01105169), the
      investigators proposed to measure blood concentration of total 25(OH)D as a secondary aim
      using Elisa approach. However, following the novel finding of Mg-vitamin D interaction
      published by the investigators in 2013, they submitted a separate grant application to NCI
      which was funded in 2014. In the new study, the investigators proposed to use a LC-MS
      approach, which is more accurate and specific than an Elisa method, to measure 5 vitamin D
      metabolites. This new ancillary study allows the investigators to evaluate whether Mg
      supplementation differentially affects vitamin D synthesis and metabolism dependent on
      baseline serum 25(OH)D levels using existing biospecimens collected in our double-blind
      placebo-controlled randomized chemoprevention trial.
