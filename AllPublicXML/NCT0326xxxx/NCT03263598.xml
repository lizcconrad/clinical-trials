  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The low sodium intake is important for ascites control in liver cirrhosis patients.
      Therefore, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends reduction of sodium (Na) to 2g/day for
      adults. The 24-hour urine Na excretion has been regarded as a standard method to estimate the
      amount of daily dietary sodium intake. However, it is too inconvenient to apply to patients
      or the general population in practice. For this reason, it has been suggested that a spot
      urine Na/potassium (K) ratio could be replaced with the 24-hour urine Na excretion. However,
      the evidence is not sufficient for that. The investigators will evaluate the usefulness of
      spot urine Na/K ratio to estimate the dietary sodium intake. The investigators will also
      verify several formulas of estimating the 24-hour Na excretion with spot urine Na, K,
      Creatinine (Cr).

      ● Detailed Description:

        1. Measurements: they should be performed for 2 days (the urine collected within 24 hrs)

             -  24-hour urine Na, K and Creatinine (patients were instructed to collect all
                subsequent urine voids over the next 24-hour period including the ﬁrst void of the
                following day.)

             -  Spot urine Na, K, Creatinine with the same urine sample in some containers provided
                to patients. (every urination)

        2. Calculation

             -  Na/K Ratio with spot urine Na, K

             -  Estimating 24-hour urine Na with spot urine Na, K, Cr by using some formulas.

    <time_frame>After 24 hours of urine collection</time_frame>
    <description>Previous studies have reported that the spot urine Na / K ratio is 90 percent accuracy compared to 24hr urine Na excretion. To verify this, measure spot urine Na, K (mEq/L) by using the same sample as the 24-hour sodium and creatinine excretion and confirm with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to find the best cutoff point of spot urine Na / K ratio.</description>
