    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease usually associated with radical cystectomy
      operation which is the treatment of choice for invasive urinary bladders tumor.
      Peri-operative acute kidney injury (AKI) is common but poorly recognized and managed which is
      associated with increase surgical morbidity and mortality and hospital cost .Prospective
      human studies establishing a renal protective effect of dexmedetomidine are still
      questionable.

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that intra-operative intravenous
      dexmedetomidine infusion could improve early renal function after open radical cystectomy.

      This randomized comparative study will be carried out on 100 patients of either sex, ASA I
      and II with baseline serum creatinine below 1.4 mg/dl who will be submitted for radical
      cystectomy. The patients will be randomly allocated into two groups according to the drug
      infused intra-operatively; dexmedetomidine group and fentanyl group. Dexmedetomidine group:
      will receive loading dose (0.8μg/kg) over 20 minutes, followed by intravenous infusion
      (0.4μg/kg/h) and fentanyl group: will receive loading dose (1μg/kg), followed by intravenous
      infusion (1μg/kg/h) during intra-operative period till end of procedure. Assessment of renal
      function through evaluation of pre-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
      using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula based on baseline serum
      creatinine, serum cystatin C level at 24 hours post-operative, daily post-operative serum
      creatinine for one week post-operative and post-operative eGFR using MDRD formula.
