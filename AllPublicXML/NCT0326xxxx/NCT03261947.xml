  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and tolerability of TAK-931 in a cohort of
      Western participants with metastatic solid tumors and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of
      TAK-931 in participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC).

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-931. TAK-931 blocks the function of a
      specific protein in the body called CDC7 kinase. TAK-931 is being tested in participants with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer or metastatic colorectal cancer plus a cohort of US patients
      with metastatic cancer with no other standard therapeutic alternative. This study will look
      at safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TAK-931 in people who take TAK-931.

      The study will enroll approximately 88 patients. Participants will be enrolled in 3 cohorts:
      1) Western safety cohort to be enrolled in the US only which will include non-Japanese
      participants who have metastatic solid tumors with no standard therapeutic alternative, 2)
      Participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer 3) Participants with metastatic colorectal
      cancer. All participants will receive:

      • TAK-931 50 mg

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States and Japan. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 24 months. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic, and participants in both Western cohort and disease specific cohort will be
      followed-up for up to 12 weeks for progression-free survival. Once disease progression is
      confirmed, participants in disease-specific cohort will be followed for overall survival for
      up to 12 weeks after last dose of study drug.
