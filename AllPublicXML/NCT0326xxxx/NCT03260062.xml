  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop and evaluate a parent training program,
      which aims to improve language. The study is being conducted to see if teaching parents
      positive parenting techniques and behavior strategies will improve the rate of language
      development in children with cochlear implants when compared to standard speech therapy
      (e.g., auditory-verbal therapy).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parental sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Parent sensitivity (warmth, positive regard, respect for child autonomy) will be coded from video-taped parent-child interactions during two play activities. Sensitivity will be coded on a 1 to 7 Likert scale, with higher scores indicating higher sensitivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in use of higher-level versus lower-level language strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Parents use of higher level language strategies (open-ended questions, parallel talk, expansion) during video-taped parent-child interactions will be coded. Parent interactions will be transcribed and the number of specific language strategies will recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parental involvement and self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Parent involved and self-efficacy will be measured using the Scale for Parental Involvement and Self-Efficacy (SPISE) for young children with hearing loss. Higher scores indicate more parent involvement and higher self-efficacy</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Auditory Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Children's auditory skills will be measured using the Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS). Higher scores indicated better auditory skills</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. children who are severely to profoundly deaf and a cochlear implant candidate,

          2. children who are 12 to 48 months,

          3. English or Spanish as primary language spoken at home,

          4. families educating their children in spoken language,

          5. children who pass the cognitive screening, scoring 75 or above on the screening
             measure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. parents who do not consent to being videotaped,

          2. children with moderate to severe developmental delays (as assessed using the Battelle
             Developmental Inventory (BDI-2) 2nd Edition for children ages 0 to 24 months or the
             Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised),

          3. children with significant syndromes (e.g., CHARGE, autism, cerebral palsy) or severe
             brain abnormalities,

          4. families who do not receive their auditory-verbal therapy from University of Miami
             (UM). Further, children who have already completed the BDI-2 within the past year as
             part of their Early Steps (Florida Early Intervention) program will not have it
             re-administered.
