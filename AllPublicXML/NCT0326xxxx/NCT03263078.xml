      The purpose of this study is to compare the difference between total intravenous anesthesia
      to inhaled anesthesia in major surgery. The investigators will compare the hemodynamic datas
      which are collected from PiCCO-Technology hemodynamic monitoring and cerebral oxymerty which
      are collected from INVOS™ Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter.The investigators hypothesize that total
      intravenous anesthesia provide more hemodynamic stability, less extravascular lung water
      index (EVLWI), lower anesthesia cost and fewer postoperative complication.

    <description>Anesthesia was introduced by intravenous administration of 2ug/kg Fentanyl, 1mg‧kg-1 Lidocaine, 1-2mg‧kg-1 Propofol and 0.8-1.2mg‧kg-1 Rocuronium. After the endotracheal tube was inserted, anesthesia was maintained with TIVA using Target-controlled infusion(TCI) system (Orchestra® Base Primea; Fresenius Kabi, Germany) based on the pharmacokinetics model proposed by Schnider et al. with a target effect-site concentration of 3.0~5.0mcg‧ml-1. We set up routine hemodynamic monitoring including electrocardiography, oximetry, NIBP, as well as PiCCO-Technology and cerebral oximetry.</description>
