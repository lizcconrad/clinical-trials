    <textblock>
      This study examines muscle movements of elecromyography in adults with brain death. Half of
      the participants will have brain death, the other half will be healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In some of the patients who have brain death diagnosis, some movements may be seen. Because
      of these movements, the doctors sometimes avoid to make brain death diagnosis. So making
      brain death diagnosis may delay. And in these patients, even if the brain death diagnosis
      made the family members refuse to donate the organs of the patients because they think their
      patients may survive when they see muscle movements with touch. These patients with brain
      death are lost in a short time, so some of the patients can not be used as donors. In this
      study, the investigators aim to raise awareness the movements in brain death patients can be
      seen, to study the movements neurophysiologically by EMG, whether EMG can be used as
      auxiliary method or not in brain death diagnosis and to raise organ donation numbers from
      cadavers. Investigators will examine the motor response and F response in the facial nerve,
      median nerve, and tibialis posterior nerve with electromyography neurophysiologically.
