  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Dermatomyositis (DM) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) cause inflammation in the muscles.
      People with DM and JDM can develop calcium deposits in places they should not, known as
      calcinosis. Calcinosis can be painful and cause disabilities and other problems. Researchers
      want to learn more about calcinosis to find treatments for it.

      Objective:

      To test if sodium thiosulfate (STS) can treat people with DM with calcinosis.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 7 and older who have moderate or severe calcinosis. They must have stable DM and
      calcium deposits in the torso or at least 2 limbs.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Muscle strength and function tests

        -  Blood and urine tests

      Participants will have several visits:

        -  7-day pre-treatment visit about 10 weeks before starting STS

        -  Treatment visits over 10 weeks. They will get STS 3 times a week through IV infusion.
           They may be hospitalized the whole time. If they tolerate the drug, they may be
           discharged at certain times. During these times, they will return for the infusions.

        -  3- to 5-day post-treatment visits 24 weeks and 62 weeks after starting STS.

      Visits may include repeats of screening tests and:

        -  Questionnaires

        -  Scans: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They may be injected with
           a radioactive agent.

        -  Durometry: A small instrument applies pressure on the skin or exposed calcinosis.

        -  Measurements of blood flow in the arms and fingernail blood vessels

        -  Photographs of the skin

        -  Kidney ultrasound

        -  Tests of kidney function

        -  Calcinosis aspiration: A needle placed into areas of calcinosis removes liquid.

      Calcinosis, a serious complication of dermatomyositis, involves deposition of calcium
      (carbonate apatite) in soft tissue, and can result in negative impacts on quality of life and
      physical function. To date, there are no known effective therapies that are approved for the
      treatment of dermatomyositis-associated calcinosis, and there is no consensus within the
      medical community on the optimum treatment strategy for this often-debilitating condition.

      A few reports in the literature describe treatment successes with a variety of therapeutics;
      however, these data are from anecdotal reports or case series and thus provide limited
      scientific evidence of effectiveness. Recently published reports as well as personal
      observations within our group have suggested that intravenous sodium thiosulfate treatment
      may benefit calcinosis patients. In order to gather more robust data on the utility of this
      medication in the treatment of calcinosis associated with adult and juvenile dermatomyositis,
      we propose to evaluate its effects in the context of a prospective clinical trial.

      We plan to enroll participants at a single center into a single-arm, open-label study, with
      the overall objective of evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravenous sodium thiosulfate
      use in patients with moderate to severe extensive calcinosis associated with juvenile and
      adult dermatomyositis.

      The study will enroll a maximum of 18 participants over 4 years into the full study, but up
      to 250 patients may screen for study entry. Eligible patients will be age 7 or older, and
      will have extensive calcinosis (defined as calcinosis involving the torso or 2 extremities)
      and moderate to severe calcinosis (indicated by a calcinosis activity visual analogue scale
      score of greater than or equal to 3.5 cm out of 10 cm).

      Two separate evaluations performed at the NIH prior to initiation of therapy will be used as
      baseline data to compare in a pairwise manner to the change in assessments following
      treatment with sodium thiosulfate, with all other medications remaining stable. Study
      treatment will be 16 g/m2 sodium thiosulfate administered 3 times weekly over a period of 10
      weeks at the NIH. Subjects who complete 10 weeks of treatment or reach the primary end point
      by week 6 will be considered completers. Following the treatment period, all participants
      will return to the NIH for evaluations at weeks 24 and 62.

      The primary outcome will be change in calcinosis activity visual analogue scale score from
      week 0 to week 10 on therapy, compared to the baseline change in calcinosis activity visual
      analogue scale score from week -10 to week 0 pre-treatment. Secondary measures will evaluate
      safety and changes in components of the Calcinosis Assessment Tool, clinical assessments of
      calcinosis, Mawdsley Calcinosis Questionnaire, quality of life, functional disability, muscle
      testing (manual and quantitative), laboratory parameters (muscle enzymes, inflammatory
      markers, and endothelial activation markers), gene expression, calcification pathogenesis,
      time to improvement, and imaging. Myositis disease activity and damage will also be assessed
      by validated measures.

      A number of research studies will be incorporated into this clinical trial in an attempt to
      understand the immunologic markers associated with calcification in dermatomyositis as well
      as the immunologic effects of sodium thiosulfate treatment.

             with sodium thiosulfate. Methodology is as follows: He or she will perform a search in
             two individual validated medication interaction software programs. He or she will also
             perform a literature search via PubMed for case reports of interactions with sodium
             thiosulfate. As an additional safeguard, the PharmD will evaluate the medication list

             potential interactions not yet documented in the literature.

         19. Has any health conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, significantly
             increase the risk of taking sodium thiosulfate or participating in any of the study

         20. Weighs less than 26 kilograms.**

         21. Has a regimen of pulse steroids or IVIG that is at an interval besides every 1, 2, or
             5 weeks.

             but not limited to, hepatitis, HIV, HTLV 1, and HTLV 2.

               -  We will attempt to enroll patients at a weight greater than 28 kg as these
                  patients will be able to obtain all lab work for the study. Patients weighing 26
                  to 28 kg will only be able to obtain some of the research blood work. Patients
                  less than 26 kg of body weight will be unable to obtain all safety labs, so will
                  not be able to enroll.
