  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although fluid therapy is of paramount value in anesthetic practice, there is no guideline
      available for perioperative fluid management in major abdominal surgery. So, there is a need
      to establish whether goal directed fluid therapy protocol is effective during radical
      cystectomy and urinary diversion. A balance of perioperative fluid therapy is crucial, yet
      the method to achieve this equilibrium remains a highly debated subject. Therefore, this
      study will be designed to investigate the effects of two individualized goal directed fluid
      therapy during radical cystectomy to encourage an effective circulating blood volume and
      pressure. Accordingly, as a primary outcome, the investigators assume that stroke volume
      optimization could maintain better perioperative hemodynamic stability with low incidence and
      severity of hypotensive episodes together with achievement of maximal oxygenation. Hopefully
      this regimen could help to decrease the possibility of perioperative tissue hypoperfusion and
      the possible associated complications as a secondary outcome.

      Study protocol:

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two equal groups, according to
      computer-generated randomization sequence into:

        -  Stroke volume optimization group (SVO group).

        -  Central venous pressure dynamic group(CVPdyngroup).

      Stroke volume optimization group (SVO group):

      Colloid aliquots of 200 ml 6% hydroxy ethyl starch 130/ 0.4 (Voluven, Fresenius kabi,
      Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) will be administered within 10 minutes and stroke
      volume response will be recorded .If stroke volume increase by more than 10 % for 20 minutes,
      the aliquot will be repeated. No further aliquots will be given once stroke volume failed to
      increase &gt;10%. The last stroke volume without rise of &gt; 10% will be defined as optimum stroke
      volume (SVopt).When stroke volume decreases by 10% below (SVopt), this will be defined as
      trigger stroke volume (SVT). Stroke volume will be followed every 30 minutes during surgery
      and every 4 hours for 24 hours postoperatively .

      Central venous pressure dynamic group (CVPdyn group):

      Colloid aliquots of 200 ml 6% hydroxy ethyl starch 130/ 0.4(Voluven) will be administered
      within 10 minutes and CVP response will be recorded. If CVP failed to rise sustainably for
      more than 2 mmHg for 20 minutes, the aliquot will be repeated. No further aliquots will be
      given once CVP increases more than 2 mmHg above the recorded one.The last CVP with sustained
      rise of&gt;2 mmHg will be defined as CVP maximum (CVPmax).When CVP decrease below (CVPmax)by 3
      mmHg, this will be defined as trigger CVP (CVPT).CVP will be followed every 30 min during
      surgery and every 4 hours for 24 hours postoperatively
