  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) vs. treadmill training
      only on walking function in individuals post-stroke, a 6 week, single-blind, randomized
      training study will be conducted with three assessments of gait to determine the training
      effect. Subjects will be randomized to either the CIMT or treadmill training only groups at
      the initial test. Following the initial test, individuals from the 2 groups will undergo
      intensive locomotor training. Training will be performed 3 times per week for 6 weeks with
      the training time for each visit set to 45 minutes as tolerated. Data collection will proceed
      until 36 subjects from 2 groups have been trained.

      To determine the effect of constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) on locomotor function
      in individuals post stroke. In order to compare the effect of CIMT vs. treadmill training
      only on walking function in individuals post-stroke, a 6 week, single-blind, randomized
      training study will be conducted with three assessments of gait to determine the training
      effect. Subjects will be blocked by gait speed into slow (&lt; 0.4 m/s) or fast (≥ 0.4 m/s)
      subgroups and randomized to either the CIMT or treadmill training only groups at the initial
      test. Following the initial test, individuals from the 2 groups will undergo intensive
      locomotor training. Training will be performed 3 times per week for 6 weeks with the training
      time for each visit set to 45 minutes as tolerated, excluding set up time. Data collection
      will proceed until 36 subjects from 2 groups have been trained.
