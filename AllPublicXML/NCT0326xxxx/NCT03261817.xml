  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, an APA program by web (e-APA) will be offered to two groups of participants
      (21 patients and 21 healthy volunteers (HV)) in remote video (use of the SAPATIC (Santé
      Activités Physiques Adaptées utilisant les Technologies de l'Information et de la
      Communication) platform developed by the company V@SI). At the same time, two control groups,
      a group of 21 patients and a group of 21 HV will undergo an health education program (HE)
      through the collaborative SAPATIC health platform of V@Si and will constitute the control
      groups. The content of the APA sessions will be administered by V@Si. This program offers
      content aimed to improve aerobic capacity and muscular strength while relying on the
      motivation of the participants

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to demonstrate that APA can improve cerebral plasticity in patients
      with schizophrenic or schizoaffective disorders (SCZ), reflected by an increase in the
      overall volume of hippocampus.

      The secondary objectives will also be to assess the impact of APA on the SCZ compared to the
      HV:

        1. on other cerebral variables (changes in the different subregions of the hippocampus
           (Cornu Ammonis (CA: CA1,CA2-3-4), subiculum and dentate gyrus), cortical thickness,
           N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and glutamate as well as changes in the white matter through
           the diffusion markers (fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity in
           the frontomedial-hippocampal fibers) and cerebral irrigation

        2. on physiological variables (neuromuscular, cardiovascular (heart rate variability) and
           aerobic)

        3. on cognitive variables by measuring working memory, episodic memory, attentional and
           executive functions

        4. on circadian rhythms (temperature, actimetry and wake-sleep cycle)

        5. on the clinical status of patients (severity of symptoms, quality of life, level of
           activity and physical abilities).

        6. on biological variables (fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, High-density
           lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc)
