    <textblock>
      Diarrhea is one of the side effects of antibiotics. Antibiotic associated diarrhea can be
      encountered between two hours to two months after starting of antibiotics. The purpose of the
      study is to determine incidence,risk factors and severity of pediatric antibiotic associated
      diarrhea in Turkey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic associated diarrhea is a common adverse effect, occurring about 5-30% of patients
      either early during treatment or up to two months after the cessation of the treatment. The
      frequency differs according to the definition of diarrhea, the inciting antimicrobial agent
      and the host factors such geriatric age, immunosuppression, prolonged hospitalization. Almost
      all agents, especially the the ones acting on anaerobes may cause diarrhea. Clinical
      presentations range from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous enterocolitis. In Turkey
      still data about antibiotic associated diarrhea is not enough. Incidence and the factors that
      effect severity are not known.

    <description>Differences in incidence and severity of AAD in children in different cities in Turkey.
The incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhea will be expressed as proportion of new cases of diarrhea to total number of patients in the follow-up period of patients who receive oral antibiotics. The overall ratio will be calculated at the end of whole study period.</description>

    <measure>Follow-up of Severity of AAD in Outpatient Clinics and by Phone Calls for Two Months Period in Pediatric Population in Turkey.</measure>
    <time_frame>December 2018</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of AAD and interventional requirements of pediatric patients who develop AAD.
Development of diarrhea during study period will be determined by using Bristol Stool Charts. Stool charts will be provided to parents by the investigators. The parents will follow number and shape and consistency of stool , and decide according to the Bristol Stool Chart. Four times and more defecation and stool in type 5,6 and 7 according to Bristol Chart that will continue for a minimum of 2 days will be regarded as diarrhea. If the diarrhea necessitates hospitalization and/or intravenous hydration therapy, this will be regarded as severe diarrhea. If patient with diarrhea will treated by just observation and diarrhea will subside spontaneously, diarrhea will be regarded as mild.</description>
