      This study evaluates the impact of elective regional lymph node irradiation on N1 breast
      cancer patients receiving post-lumpectomy radiotherapy and anthracycline plus taxane
      (AT)-based chemotherapy. We randomly assign patients having one to three metastatic lymph
      nodes (pN1) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and AT-based chemotherapy to undergo either
      whole-breast and regional nodal irradiation (WB+RNI group) or whole-breast irradiation alone
      (WBI group).

      Objective:

        -  Compare the effect of post-BCS WBI vs. WB+RNI on disease-free survival in pN1 breast
           cancer patients who received AT-based chemotherapy.

        -  Evaluate the impact of WBI or WB+RNI according to molecular subtype of tumor.

        -  Compare the treatment-related toxicities between the WBI and WB+RNI.

        -  Compare the patient's quality of life between the WBI and WB+RNI.

      Outline: This is a a randomized, multi-center, phase III study. Patients are stratified
      according to molecular subtype of tumor (luminal A vs luminal vs luminal HER2 vs
      HER2-enriched vs basal-like), axillary lymph node management (sentinel lymph node biopsy
      [SLN] only vs axillary lymph node dissection+/- SLN) and participating institutions. Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive WB+RNI.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive WBI alone.

      Arm circumference and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 &amp; EORTC QLQ-BR23) are assessed within 2
      weeks prior to randomization, during the last week of radiotherapy, at 3 months after
      completion of radiotherapy, and then annually thereafter for five years.

      Patients are followed at 3 months after completion of radiotherapy and annually thereafter
      for seven years.
