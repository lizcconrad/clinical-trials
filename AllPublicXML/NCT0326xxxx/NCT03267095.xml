      medium of communication, expression and adapting it to the individual resources and abilities
      of the patient, music therapy can be beneficial in activating and supporting mental and
      psycho-physical recover .

      Students with developmental disabilities often have challenges in the areas of communication
      and social/emotional learning, which can lead to social isolation, problematic behaviors, and
      deficits in academic learning.These students have been found to respond well to the
      incorporation of music in intervention programs, in terms of both gains in communication
      skills and stronger social functioning . they respond more favorably and appropriately to
      music than other sensory stimuli
