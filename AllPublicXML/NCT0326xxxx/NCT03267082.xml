  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) was first reported by Semm in 1983. Since then, its
      advantages, such as the aesthetic appearance of the wound, less postoperative pain, and
      faster recovery which facilitates early discharge, have been highlighted, and the number of
      procedures performed has been continuously increasing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LA was performed mostly on uncomplicated appendicitis due to negative opinions about its
      safety when it was first introduced. However, the application of the procedure has been
      extended to complicated appendicitis (CA), and it is now considered as an alternative
      procedure to an open appendectomy (OA) as its safety record has improved . Nevertheless, it
      is still controversial because there are still concerns about surgical difficulties in
      managing CA with laparoscopy, overall surgery time, possible post-op complications and
      conversion to an OA during the surgery.

      this study aimed to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of LA for managing perforated
      appendicitis.
