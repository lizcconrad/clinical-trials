  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among primary care patients, compare the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-based
      intervention (Mindfulness Training for Primary Care[MTPC]) vs. a low-dose mindfulness
      introduction comparator on self-management of chronic illness and illness-related health
      behavior action plan initiation, as well as on measures related to anxiety, depression, and
      stress.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study builds on a pilot study that investigated the impact of Mindfulness Training for
      Primary Care on anxiety, depression, stress, and chronic illness self-management in primary
      care patients receiving care in an urban, community, multi-cultural safety net healthcare
      system. The current comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial takes place in a
      larger sample, and investigates the impact of a refined MTPC curriculum on specific aspects
      of self-regulation such as action plan initiation, while examining potential mechanisms of
      change, including self-efficacy, perceived control, mindfulness, self-compassion, emotion
      regulation, and body awareness. Participants randomized to MTPC are compared with
      participants who are randomized to a low-dose comparator condition and receive a 1-hour
      introduction to mindfulness with a referral to community mindfulness resources. Outcome
      assessments are conducted at baseline and study weeks 8-10.

For each unmet goal, patients are asked to rate the cause of not meeting the goal.</description>
