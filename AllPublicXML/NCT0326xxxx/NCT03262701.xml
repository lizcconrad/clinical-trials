  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been many adjunctive treatments for the additional clinical benefits to scaling
      and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Topical hydrogen peroxide
      (HP) delivered in a custom fabricated tray has been shown to improve pocket depth (PD) and
      inflammation. The purpose of this study is to assess the adjunctive treatment outcome of HP
      gel in custom tray application in individuals with chronic periodontitis receiving SRP. The
      purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to evaluate and compare the clinical effects
      of scaling and root planing (SRP) combined with local delivery of 1.7% hydrogen peroxide (HP)
      gel in customized trays to that of SRP alone.
