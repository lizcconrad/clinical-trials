  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, multinational, retrospective, non-interventional pilot
      study conducted in five haemophilia treatment centres from different geographical regions
      that maintain a local (Algeria, Malaysia) or national (India, Iran, South Africa) haemophilia
      registry. Data from a randomly selected sample of patients from national or local registries
      are anonymously collated and analysed.The aims are to determine the feasibility of combining
      data from national and local registries in countries with developing healthcare systems and
      to assess how existing registries implemented current recommendations for data collection in
      terms of available fields and their completion.

    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in five haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) from different
      geographical regions (Algeria, India, Iran, Malaysia and South Africa) that maintain a local
      or national haemophilia registry. Data will be collected from 20 randomly selected, active
      patient records from each participating registry/country. In countries with national
      registries, data from local registries will not be permitted for inclusion to allow adequate
      assessment of the possibility of registry harmonisation across various regions. Participating
      centres will report data as available in the data source without seeking additional
      information to fill source data gaps at the time of data collection. In addition, each
      investigator will complete a basic questionnaire on feasibility parameters to confirm the
      source and accuracy of the data, as well as challenges experienced during data collection.
      Analysed parameters will be grouped into three categories: sociodemographic, disease, and
      treatment and disease outcome parameters. Feasibility assessment will be performed for all
      study variables and the percentage availability of each study variable recorded in the
      participating registries wii be determined, as well as the proportion of missing data for
      existing variables.
