  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in three weeks of the bionic pancreas in the insulin-only
      configuration. Each week, subjects will use a different rapid acting insulin analog --
      Humalog, Novolog, or BioChaperone lispro -- in a randomized cross-over order.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that differences in the PK characteristics of insulin analogs
      will lead to differences in glycemic outcomes when delivered by the insulin-only
      configuration of the bionic pancreas. Specifically, the investigators predict that insulin
      analogs that have faster absorption (numerically lower Tmax and/or T½max) and insulin analogs
      that have faster clearance (numerically lower terminal half-life) will result in lower mean
      glucose and/or a lower percentage of time in the hypoglycemic range.

      Up to 30 subjects will participate in three 7-day study arms using insulin lispro, aspart,
      and BioChaperone lispro in the bionic pancreas in random order. The co-primary outcomes will
      be mean CGMG and fraction of time spent with CGMG &lt;54 mg/dl with comparisons made between
      arms for individual participants. In order allow statistical comparisons between insulin
      analogs within a single participant, the mean CGMG and % time &lt;54 mg/dl will be calculated
      for each day of each arm, and means of daily means (n=7 for each arm) will be compared for
      each three pairwise comparisons between arms. Secondary analyses will include time in
      glycemic ranges (&lt;50, &lt;60, &lt;70, 70-120, 70-180, &gt;180, &gt;250 mg/dl), coefficient of variation,
      mean postprandial excursion (difference in CGMG from the time of meal announcement to the
      peak CGMG in the first 4 hours after the meal announcement), number of symptomatic
      hypoglycemic events, grams of carbohydrate consumed to treat hypoglycemia, and TDD of
      insulin. For each outcome the mean of daily means will be compared for each three pairwise
      comparisons between arms.

                  will not affect the safety of the study and are not expected to affect any

               -  Willing to remain within a 250 mile radius of MGH. No air travel will be allowed,

               -  Willing to wear one Dexcom CGM sensor, and one steel cannula infusion set (6 mm
                  Contact Detach) that must be replaced every other day

               -  Have a mobile phone they will have access to at all times during the study for
                  making contact with study staff

          -  Unable to provide informed consent (e.g. impaired cognition or judgment)

          -  Unable to safely comply with study procedures and reporting requirements (e.g.
             impairment of vision or dexterity that prevents safe operation of the bionic pancreas,
             impaired memory, unable to speak and read English)

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the judgment
             of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or the safety
             of the subject

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception Subjects must use
             acceptable contraception for the two weeks prior to the study, throughout the study
             and for the two weeks following the study.

        Acceptable contraception methods include: Oral contraceptive pill (OCP), Intrauterine
        Device (IUD, hormonal or copper), Male condoms, Female condoms, Diaphragm or cervical cap
        with spermicide, Contraceptive patch (such as OrthoEvra), Contraceptive implant (such as
        Implanon, Nexplanon), Vaginal ring (such as NuvaRing), Progestin shot (such as
        Depo-Provera), Male partner with a vasectomy proven to be effective by semen analysis

          -  Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days) or other
             substance abuse (use within the last 6 months of controlled substances other than
             marijuana without a prescription)

          -  Unwilling or unable or to avoid use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce
             sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period
             of participation in the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the
             dose is stable and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia unawareness
             while taking that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics or other
             central nervous system depressants, even if by prescription, may be excluded according
             to the judgment of the principal investigator)

             interval (&gt; 440 ms). Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are not grounds for
             exclusion in the absence of symptoms or history of heart disease. A reassuring
             evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.

          -  Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, lower extremity edema,
             paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea)

          -  History of TIA or stroke

          -  History of eating disorder within the last 2 years, such as anorexia, bulimia, or
             diabulemia or omission of insulin to manipulate weight

          -  History of intentional, inappropriate administration of insulin leading to severe
             hypoglycemia requiring treatment

          -  Use of oral (e.g. thiazolidinediones, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitinides, DPP-4
             inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) or non-insulin injectable (GLP-1 agonists, amylin)
