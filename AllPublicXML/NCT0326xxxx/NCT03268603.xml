  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intrathecal treatment
      delivered to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mesenchymal stem cells in ALS patients every 3
      months for a total of 4 injections over 12 months.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of stem cell that can be grown into a number of
      different kinds of cells. In this study, MSCs will be taken from the subject's body fat and
      grown. CSF is the fluid surrounding the spine.

      The use of mesenchymal stem cells is considered investigational, which means it has not been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use. However, the FDA
      has allowed the use of mesenchymal stem cells in this research study.

      The Goal of the Proposed Study is to perform an open label, 60 subject, Phase II multi-site
      clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal treatment of aaMSCs in
      ALS. Patients will be treated with 1 x 10^8 aaMSCs every 3 months for a total of 4
      intrathecal injections over 12 months. Reduced dose treatments will be allowed based on
      specific adverse events. Multiple biomarkers will be tracked throughout the clinical trial
      and correlated with response to treatment. This study will initially be performed at Mayo
      Clinic in Rochester. Subsequently, the study will expand to the two other Mayo Clinic sites
      in Arizona and Florida as the manufacturing capabilities are finalized.

    <description>Autologous Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (aaMSCs) will be administered intrathecally at a single dose in a volume of 5-10 mL, all patients will receive 1 x 10^8 intrathecal aaMSCs at the first injection (Visit 4). Subsequent doses may be reduced to 5 x 10^7, based on Dose Modification Rules. One further dose reduction to 1 x 10^7 may occur in later injections.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients will have ALS diagnosed as possible, laboratory-supported probable,
             probable, or definite as defined by the World Federation of Neurology criteria for the
             diagnosis of ALS.

          -  Examination and neurophysiological testing confirm a pure motor syndrome compatible
             with the diagnosis of ALS. All other possible causes of weakness have been excluded by
             extensive investigations.

          -  Age greater than 18 years, if female, must be post-menopausal, had a hysterectomy, or
