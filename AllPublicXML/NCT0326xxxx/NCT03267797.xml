  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility and miscarriage ordinary events in reproductive failure in humans, as are
      affected one couple in every six couples of reproductive age and abortion is including in
      approximately 15-20% of all pregnancies. Over the decades since the beginning of Assisted
      Reproductive Technology (ART) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy rate still remains
      below 30% and Recurrent Implantation Failure in one of the most important limiting factor is
      the assisted reproductive techniques. According to studies conducted in recent years one of
      the most important mechanisms of implantation failure is maternal immune system because the
      fetus as an allograft toxic (Semi allograft) to the mother. Studies have demonstrated that
      ratio of Th1 to Th2 cells increase in maternal peripheral blood cells can be directly
      associated with implantation failure. Lymphocytes during implantation, in association with
      endometrium and blastocyst, participate in the production of cytokines, in particular Th1
      pre-inflammatory cytokines. TNFα, IFNγ ،LIF ،IL12 ،IL15 Among these are pre-inflammatory
      cytokines that appear to be necessary in the early stages of implantation. The initial
      inflammatory response should therefore be selectively reduced to preserve pregnancy.
      Inflammatory response impairment at the beginning of pregnancy causes fetal implantation
      failure, while high inflammation leads to acute rejection (spontaneous abortion) or chronic
      (pre-eclampsia) ). Preserving pregnancy requires a specific cytokine pattern, in particular
      Th2 cytokines (IL3, IL4, IL5, IL10, IL13, GMCSF), which causes the anti-inflammatory state of
      pregnancy required. Therefore, maternal immunity seems to be involved in creating and
      sustaining pregnancy through the Th1 / Th2 Thalassic Balance. An imbalance between the two
      systems can be an explanation for the implantation failure in some patients. The effect of
      intra-uterine lymphocyte therapy on the fertility rate of women with RIF in the mouse model
      has been shown to be controlled by the Th1 system. While the Th2 system has a protective
      role, two thirds of patients have had an incomplete endometrial admission. Since the immune
      cells of the uterus are balanced through a broad cytokine pattern, it is important to
      evaluate the implantation success of RIF patients after intrauterine insemination (IUI) of
      their own lymphocytes in the uterus in the pre-implantation phase. Laboratory tests on mice
      show an increase in the number of embryonic implantations with human PMBCs. Considering the
      importance of TH1 and TH2 cells in the success or failure of pregnancy and the relationship
      between the function and balance of these cells with pregnancy problems, such as implantation
      failure (RIF), and the role of factors and inflammatory cytokines in creating proper nesting
      conditions, by introducing the lymphocytes of a participants infected with RIF into the
      uterus in order to induce primary inflammation, the investigators will examine its effect on
      fertility and the success of implantation in women with RIF.

      Initially, written and informed consent will be received from people with RIF referred to the
      Tabriz Center for Infertility, who are our target population in this project . To start the
      study using the antagonist protocol, when the follicle reaches a diameter of 14 mm, the GnRH
      antagonist is injected subcutaneously. After seeing the 17 mm follicle, HCG is injected
      muscle. After that, oocyte is removed and IVF is done. After these steps, PBMCs should be
      collected from peripheral blood. For this purpose, on the day of ovulation induction, blood
      samples are taken from patients with RIF and stored in citrate tubes. Then, the PBMC
      separates with the ficus. After isolating and cultivating these cells, they are injected into
      the endometrium two days before embryo transfer (ET). The flow cytometry technique will then
      be used to count the number of Th1 and Th2 cells. Ultimately, after this period, the patient
      will be evaluated in terms of pregnancy by laboratory method and βhCG protein assay and by
      ELISA technique. The rate of fetal implantation is also measured by gestational sac and
      ultrasound. To monitor the number of newborns born by RIF people, we will continue to monitor
      patients with their βhCG test after positive treatment with obstetric and gynecologic
      doctors. After about 9 months, we will evaluate the number of newborns born by the subjects
      and compare them to the control group who received no treatment.
