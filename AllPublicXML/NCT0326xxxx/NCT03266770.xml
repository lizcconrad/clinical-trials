    <textblock>
      Traditional ureteral stents are commonly used in renal and ureteral procedures, and their use
      is associated with many morbidities which can affect patients' quality of life. However,
      replacement of the distal portion of the stent with a thin material may reduce bladder
      irritative symptoms and allow the ureterovesical junction to coapt---thereby, reducing
      urinary reflux. The hypothesis is that the RELIEF stent will offer the same function of
      traditional ureteral stents with the added benefits of minimizing urinary reflux and reducing
      irritative bladder symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Traditional ureteral stents are commonly used in practice to relieve renal obstruction or as
      a scaffold to promote healing after endoscopic or open/ laparoscopic surgeries involving the
      ureter. However, there are many morbidities associated with stent placement either due to
      bladder irritation or backflow of urine to the kidney. The most commonly reported symptoms
      include urgency, urinary frequency, dysuria, incontinence, hematuria, suprapubic discomfort,
      and fever due to urinary tract infections and flank pain, which can occur in up to 80% of
      stented patients. Sometimes, the symptoms are poorly tolerated and can negatively affect
      patients' quality of life. Shao et al have studied the relationship between bladder filling
      and the renal pelvic pressure (RPP) in stented patients, which revealed that RPP increased
      mildly during bladder filling and increased dramatically during voiding, indicating urinary
      reflux, and thus encouraging early stent removal. Another study showed that patients with
      stents whose distal coils cross the midline are at higher risk of post-stenting morbidities.
      Replacement of the distal portion of the ureteral stent with a thin material may reduce
      bladder irritative symptoms and allow the ureterovesical junction to coapt, thereby
      eliminating urinary reflux.

      The Ureteral Stent Company, LLC (USC) is developing the RELIEF™ Ureteral Stent, a single use,
      disposable ureteral stent (US) device that will provide the traditional function of allowing
      the passage of urine from the kidney to the bladder with new design enhancements to improve
      patient care:

        -  A low-profile tether through the intramural ureter segment, minimizing the potential of
           urinary reflux

        -  Polymeric solid distal coil that minimizes the potential for coil positioning on the
           trigone, reducing the potential for associated bladder spasms and pain.

      It is hypothesized that the RELIEF stent will offer the same function of traditional ureteral
      stents with the added benefits of minimizing the urinary reflux and reducing irritative
      bladder symptoms.
