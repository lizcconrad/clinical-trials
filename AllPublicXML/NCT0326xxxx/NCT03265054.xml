  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)
      affects about 1,200,000 individuals each year in Europe. About 50% of VTE are unprovoked and
      20% of these patients will face a recurrent event after the usual three to six‐month course
      of anticoagulant treatment. To date, most patients are given prolonged anticoagulant
      treatment. However, anticoagulant treatment are associated with a major risk of bleeding
      (3%/year). Thus an accurate identification of patients with unprovoked VTE with a low risk of
      recurrence is needed to avoid unnecessary anticoagulant treatment with a risk of bleeding.

      Over the past few years, microparticles (MPs) which are small vesicles originating from the
      budding of cellular membranes have emerged as important biological entities regulating
      hemostasis. MPs expose at their surface procoagulant molecules such as phosphatidylserin and
      tissue factor (TF). All data obtained in mouse models support a role of MPs in venous
      thrombosis mediated by the TF activation. Moreover, results from clinical studies showed that
      TF-MPs was associated with the risk of venous thrombosis. However, the predictive value of
      TF-MPs in the recurrence of VTE is unknown. Besides, no study has taken into account the
      recent progresses in the understanding of the role of MPs in haemostasis. Indeed, MPs
      vectorize molecules which are not only procoagulant but also profibrinolytic. The net result
      depends on a balance between both activities (the coagulo-lytic balance). This balance is can
      be measured by two complimentary assays on MPs.

      We hypothesized that the coagu-lytic balance of MPs is associated with an increased risk of
      VTE recurrence after stopping the anticoagulant treatment.
