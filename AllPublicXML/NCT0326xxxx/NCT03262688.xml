      to &lt;6 years of age who are scheduled for elective open inguinal hernia repair. Enrollment in
      this study will start with the oldest age group (12 to &lt;17 years) and will continue in a
      step-wise fashion until appropriate doses are established for all 3 pediatric age groups (12

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-dose study in children 12 to &lt;17 years of age, 6 to &lt;12 years
      of age, 2 to &lt;6 years of age who are scheduled for elective open inguinal hernia repair.
      Within 21 days of surgery, eligible subjects will be screened and have routine clinical
      laboratory testing and an electrocardiogram performed. Subjects will then undergo an open
      inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia according to the investigator's standard
      surgical practice on Day 1. Enrollment in this study will start with the oldest age group (12
      to &lt;17 years) and will continue in a step-wise fashion until appropriate doses are
      established for all 3 pediatric age groups. Within each age group, the study will be
      conducted in 3 parts.

      Children in each age group who are randomized to INL-001 will receive approximately 2.5 mg/kg
      of INL-001. Study drug will be administered prior to wound closure. The INL-001 matrix will
      be cut before placement into the surgical site using sterile technique. Children randomized
      to 0.25% Marcaine infiltrate with epinephrine will receive 2.5 mg/kg according to standard
      practice.

      After completion of the surgical procedure, all subjects will remain at the clinic for at
      least 3 hours and will be continuously monitored for safety. At the discretion of the
      investigator, subjects may receive rescue medication (opioid or non-opioid) upon request for
      the management of breakthrough pain and may receive an antiemetic for the management of
      nausea or vomiting. After the initial 3 hour period, subjects who are deemed stable can be
      discharged to the hospital ward. Subjects will remain housed in the hospital ward for at
      least 48 hours. Blood samples will be collected from the subset of 8 children in each age
      group after INL-001 is implanted for pharmacokinetic analysis.

          -  Has undergone major surgery within 3 months of the scheduled surgery or plans to
             undergo another surgical procedure within the 30-day post-operative period.

          -  Has known or suspected history of drug abuse or misuse or evidence of tolerance or
             physical dependency on opioid analgesics or sedative-hypnotic medications.

          -  Has participated in a clinical trial (investigational or marketed product) within 30
             days before surgery.

          -  Has any clinically significant medical history or condition (eg, unstable cardiac,
             neurological, immunological, renal, hepatic, or hematological disease or any other
             condition) that in the opinion of the investigator, substantially increases the risk
             associated with the subject's participation in the protocol or compromises the
             scientific objectives of the study.
