  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate the peak secretory flow rates and bicarbonate concentrations as
      determined by a 30 minute intraductal secretin stimulation test in patients with a low
      likelihood of pancreatic pathology and to compare these data to those obtained from our
      historical patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis. These will be patients in which
      inadvertent pancreatic cannulation occurs during therapeutic endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for biliary indications . All study subjects will receive a 5
      day follow-up phone call. Enrollment goal is 36 subjects.

        (e.g. suspected common bile duct stone, initial post-liver transplant evaluation, suspected
        or confirmed cholangiocarcinoma, suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis -- see exclusion
        criterion #12)
