  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the effectiveness of an integrative
      medicine (traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine) based structured education
      programme for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. The theoretical frame of this study
      is based on the health belief model and self efficacy theory. The hypotheses of this study
      are: 1) Participants in the intervention group will have higher level of self-management
      behaviour after intervention compared to participants in the control group; 2) Participants
      in the intervention group will have better diabetes knowledge after intervention compared to
      participants in the control group; 3) Participants in the intervention group will have higher
      level of self-efficacy after intervention compared to participants in the control group; 4)
      Participants in the intervention group will be less depressed after intervention compared to
      participants in the control group; 5) Participants in the intervention group will have better
      QOL after intervention compared to participants in the control group; 6) Participants in the
      intervention group will gain greater reduction in HbA1c after intervention compared to
      participants in the control group; 7) Participants in the intervention group will gain
      greater reduction in fasting blood glucose after intervention compared to participants in the
      control group; 8) Participants in the intervention group will gain greater reduction in BP
      after intervention compared to participants in the control group; 9) Participants in the
      intervention group will gain greater reduction in BMI after intervention compared to
      participants in the control group.
