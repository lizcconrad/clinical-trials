  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture
      treatment of postmenopausal women with overactive bladder (OAB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators targeted the patients of menopausal women with OAB. After treatment in 2
      groups - electroacupuncture treatment and acupuncture treatment - the investigators will
      compare the improvement of the urinary symptoms and the quality of life, and further the best
      treatment method. In addition, the investigators are going to evaluate the safety of abnormal
      reaction during the treatment.

    <measure>3-day bladder diary change</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 6 weeks of treatment (the end of the treatment period), after 10 weeks of treatment(follow up evaluation)</time_frame>
    <description>The daytime micturitions per 24 hr, nocturnal micturitions per 24 hr, total count of urgency (sum of urgency epi¬sodes defined as URS ≥ 3 for three days), total urgency score (sum of urgency score for three days), and total count of UUI (sum of UUI episodes for three days) is checked.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) change</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 6 weeks of treatment (the end of the treatment period), after 10 weeks of treatment(follow up evaluation)</time_frame>
    <description>The OABSS consists of four questions regarding OAB symptoms; day¬time frequency, nocturia, urgency, and UUI. The sum of the four scores runs between 0 and 15.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, after 6 weeks of treatment (the end of the treatment period), after 10 weeks of treatment(follow up evaluation)</time_frame>
    <description>The KHQ is a urine questionnaire that can assess the severity of urination symptoms and evaluate the impact of urination symptoms on quality of life. This questionnaire is known to have reliability and validity in measuring the quality of life of patients with incontinence. The 10 domains from the KHQ evaluated are general health perception, incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep/energy, severity measures, and symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, every treatment(12 sessions in 6 weeks, including after 6 weeks of treatment (the end of the treatment period), after 10 weeks of treatment(follow up evaluation)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) indicate undesirable and unintentional signs, symptoms, or diseases that develop after intervention during the period of a clinical trial.</description>
