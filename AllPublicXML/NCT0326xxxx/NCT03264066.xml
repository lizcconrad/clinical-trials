    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is defined as a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) on two consecutive tumor assessments ≥4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions. PR is defined as ≥30% decrease in tumor burden, in the absence of CR.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator(s), using RECIST v1.1, or to death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented, confirmed objective response to disease progression as determined by the investigator, using RECIST v1.1, or to death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Objective response is defined as a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) on two consecutive tumor assessments ≥4 weeks apart. CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions. PR is defined as ≥30% decrease in tumor burden, in the absence of CR. Disease progression is defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR), or stable disease at 16 weeks as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions. PR is defined as ≥30% decrease in tumor burden, in the absence of CR. Stable disease is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression. Disease progression is defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden.</description>
