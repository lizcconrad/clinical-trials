  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a &quot;before and after&quot; observational study of a therapeutic strategy to treat patients
      with confirmed ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) with remote ischemic conditioning
      (RIC) before undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). RIC is the
      purposeful application of brief, intermittent cycles of limb occlusion by inflation/deflation
      of a pneumatic cuff. The autoRIC device is an automatic RIC delivery device (the autoRICÂ®
      Device; CellAegis Devices Inc, Toronto, ON) that has received clearance from Health Canada
      for this use under the direction of a health care professional. Paramedics in the Peel and
      Halton regional emergency services and the Emergency department (ED) staff of Brampton Civic
      Hospital and Mississauga Hospital will treat patients experiencing STEMI with autoRIC, and
      study data will be collected from existing patient records.

      The 'before' group will include up to 900 patients who were treated before autoRIC
      implementation in the services and hospitals. These patients would have had a STEMI and
      undergone PCI, but did not receive the autoRIC device. The 'after' group will include up to
      900 eligible patients who have had RIC treatment with the autoRIC device at the two
      participating sites following implementation in the services and hospitals.

      The primary analyses will compare the short-term and long-term outcomes of eligible patients
      who have received completed primary PCI for STEMI in the time period before the
      implementation and following the implementation of this RIC strategy. In addition, a health
      economic analysis will be conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of the therapeutic
      strategy to treat STEMI patients with RIC prior to PCI.

        The study will be conducted in the regions of Peel and Halton in the province of Ontario.
        These two regions have a combined population of 1.6 million. The study population comprises
        adult patients meeting the study criteria who are diagnosed with STEMI out of hospital or
        in the ED and are accepted for primary PCI reperfusion therapy at Brampton Civic Hospital
        (Brampton, Ontario) or Trillium Health Partners (Mississauga, Ontario) during the study
        period.
