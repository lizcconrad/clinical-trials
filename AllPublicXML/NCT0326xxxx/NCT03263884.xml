  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to assess the mechanisms of repeated sessions of repetitive
      trancranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on the
      development of pain in a prolonged muscle pain model.

      This study aims to investigate whether i) rTMS of left DLPFC will reduce the severity and
      duration of experimentally induced muscle pain when a 5-day course of treatment is given
      immediately following an initial nerve growth factor (NGF) injection; ii) the analgesic
      effects of left DLPFC rTMS will be related to an improved cognitive network function as
      assessed by electroencephalography (EEG).

    <description>The experimental setup consists of a tourniquet cuff, a computer-controlled air compressor and an electronic visual analog scale VAS (Aalborg University, Denmark). The cuff is connected to the compressor and wrapped around the leg. The pain intensity is recorded with the electronic VAS and sampled at 10 Hz. The &quot;0 cm&quot; and &quot;10 cm&quot; extremes on the VAS are defined as &quot;no pain&quot; and as &quot;maximal pain&quot;, respectively. The compression rate of the cuff is programmed on and controlled by a computer.</description>

    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to stimulate small regions of the brain. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator, or &quot;coil&quot;, is placed near the head of the person receiving the treatment. The coil produces small electric currents in the region of the brain just under the coil via electromagnetic induction.
The protocol used in this research includes 20 minutes of 10Hz stimulation, 5 seconds on, 10 seconds off, at 110% RMT, for a total of 4000 pulses.</description>
