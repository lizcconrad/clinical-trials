  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varenicline is the most effective smoking cessation therapy available. Nevertheless, most
      smokers using varenicline relapse within the first few months after quitting. Varenicline is
      hypothesized to help smokers to quit in part by reducing the reinforcing effects of smoking
      during the standard 1-week pre-quitting treatment phase. Learning theory and previous human
      and animal research support the hypothesis that a longer period of varenicline treatment
      prior to the target quit date (TQD) will lead to greater reductions in smoking before
      quitting, and higher long-term cessation rates, compared to standard varenicline treatment.
      Building on promising preliminary clinical data, the study tests these hypotheses with a
      full-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT). 320 treatment-seeking smokers will be randomized
      to a standard run-in group (3 weeks of placebo, followed by the standard 1 week of pre-TQD
      varenicline) or an extended run-in group (4 weeks of pre-TQD varenicline). Both groups will
      receive brief individual cessation counseling and 11 weeks of post-TQD varenicline. The
      primary outcome measure will be bio-verified continuous abstinence at end-of-treatment (weeks
      8-11 post-quit; cessation at 26-weeks post TQD will also be examined. Hypothesized mediating
      mechanisms (e.g., smoking reinforcement) will be evaluated by behavioral, physiological, and
      subjective measures assessed both in the lab and using real-world, real-time electronic
      momentary assessments (EMA). The investigators predict that long-term, bio-verified smoking
      cessation will be improved among the extended run-in group compared to the standard run-in
      group. The investigators further predict the improved clinical outcomes with extended run-in
      varenicline will be explained (or mediated) by greater pre-quit reductions in smoking
      reinforcement among the extended run-in group compared to the standard run-in group. The
      significance of this work is clear: The project aims to make best available treatment for
      smoking cessation even better, using a method that is ripe for dissemination and an approach
      that will elucidate critical mechanisms to target in the next generation of treatment
      enhancement.
