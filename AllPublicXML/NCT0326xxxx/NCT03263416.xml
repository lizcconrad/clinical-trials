  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, comparative, open label, randomized, multicentric study evaluating the
      benefit of a dedicated and coordinated follow-up on treatment adherence in patients with
      metastatic solid tumor and starting a first cycle of treatment compared to standard
      follow-up. A dedicated and coordinated follow-up during the treament period will be based on
      a telephone follow-up and a pharmaceutical conciliation.

      Patients will be randomized into one of two study arms:

      Arm A (Experimental follow-up): coordinated follow-up performed by a dedicated nurse and a
      pharmaceutical conciliation made by the Center Pharmacist.

      Arm B: Standard follow-up during the treatment period.

      Patients will be followed during 6 months.
