      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For both portions of the study, participants must satisfy all of the following inclusion
        criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Written Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee-approved informed consent form
             (ICF), signed by participant or legally authorized representative.

          2. Participants must be determined to have histologically confirmed unresectable, locally
             advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the intra- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts
             and/or gallbladder.

          3. Participants (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), extrahepatic CCA, or gallbladder
             adenocarcinoma participants) must be determined to have hyaluronan (HA-) high tumor
             biopsies based on a co-developed investigational assay. Tumor tissue, from the primary
             lesion or a metastatic lesion are required.

             Note: Fine needle aspirates or brushing biopsies will not be acceptable. Archived
             resection specimens from the primary tumor without evidence of locally advanced
             disease or without radiologic evidence of metastasis at the time of resection are not
             suitable to determine HA-status and require new tumor tissue of a metastatic site.

          4. CCA and gallbladder adenocarcinoma cancer participants must have tissue available for
             PD-L1 testing. Tumor samples must meet the requirements noted in the Inclusion
             Criterion #3.

          5. One or more lesions measurable on computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) scan per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version
             1.1 (v1.1).

          6. Participants having Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0
             to 1.

          7. Life expectancy ≥3 months.

          8. Males and females aged ≥18 years.

          9. Screening clinical laboratory values as follows:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), except for Gilbert's syndrome

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 × ULN (&lt;5 × ULN is
                  allowed if liver metastases are present)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL)

               -  Serum albumin ≥2.5 grams/deciliter (g/dL)

               -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (transfusion and erythropoietic agents allowed)

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500 cells/millimeter squared (mm^3)

               -  Platelet count ≥100,000/mm^3

         10. Female participants of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine or
             serum pregnancy test within 7 days before Day 1 (first dose of study medication).

         11. For WOCBP and for men, agreement to use an effective contraceptive method from the
             time of screening throughout the study until 5 months (WOCBP) or 6 months (men) after
             administration of the last dose of any study medication. Highly effective
             contraceptive methods consist of prior sterilization, intrauterine device (IUD),
             intrauterine hormone releasing system (IUS), oral or injectable contraceptives, and/or
             barrier methods. Abstinence alone is not considered an adequate contraceptive measure
             for the purposes of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants are ineligible for enrollment if they meet any of the following exclusion
        criteria:

             anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), anti-programmed cell death

             surface antigen (HBsAg) test at screening

             • Participants with a past or resolved HBV infection, defined as having a negative
             HBsAg test and a positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test at screening,

             • Placement of central venous access catheter(s) (e.g., port or similar) is not
             considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted.

         28. Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study
             treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during the course of the study

             • Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately
             October to March in the Northern Hemisphere and approximately April through September
             in the Southern Hemisphere). Participants must agree not to receive live, attenuated
             influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist®) within 28 days prior to the start of study

               -  Participants with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism on a stable dose
                  of thyroid-replacement hormone may be eligible for this study after discussion

               -  Participants with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen

                  impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be treated prior to start
                  of study treatment. Participants should be recovered from the effects of
                  radiation. There is no required minimum recovery period.

               -  Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause
                  functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis that is not
                  presently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for
                  loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to the start of study treatment.

               -  Participants who are receiving denosumab must discontinue denosumab use and
                  replace it with a bisphosphonate instead while in the study. There is no required
                  minimum washout period for denosumab.

               -  Participants who are receiving bisphosphonate therapy specifically to prevent
                  skeletal events and who do not have a history of clinically significant
                  hypercalcemia are eligible.

         35. Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation.

         36. History of another primary cancer within the last 3 years that required treatment,
             with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, early-stage prostate cancer, or
             curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ.

         37. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding that lead to reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of
             the results, or may render the participant at high risk for treatment complications.

         38. Participant inability to comply with study and follow-up procedures, as judged by the
             Investigator.
