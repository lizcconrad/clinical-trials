  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of
      ASP8374 in participants with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors. Also
      primary purpose is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ASP8374 and to determine
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP8374.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of ASP8374.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion study of ASP8374. After discontinuation
      of study drug treatment, all participants will complete an end of treatment visit and safety
      follow-up visits. Participants will be enrolled in respectively escalation cohorts or
      expansion cohorts.

      The escalation cohorts will evaluate escalating dose levels of ASP8374 in a total of
      approximately 33 dose limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluable participants. If a confirmed response
      (partial response (PR) or complete response(CR)) occurs in a monotherapy escalation cohort, a
      tumor specific expansion cohort may be opened in that tumor type, at the dose level in which
      the confirmed response was observed and at all subsequent dose levels once each dose level
      has been deemed tolerable.

      It is estimated that approximately 144 participants may be enrolled in the expansion cohorts.

      As the number of participants in the escalation cohorts and the expansion cohorts will depend
      on the observed Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity,
      it is assumed approximately 200 participants are to be enrolled.

          -  Subject has received investigational therapy (other than an investigational epidermal
             growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) in a subject with EGFR
             activating mutations) within 21 days prior to start of study drug.

          -  Subject requires or has received systemic steroid therapy or any other
             immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects
             using a physiologic replacement dose of hydrocortisone or its equivalent (defined as
             up to 30 mg per day of hydrocortisone up to 10 mg per day of prednisone) are allowed.

          -  Subject has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases or subject has
             evidence of unstable CNS metastases even if asymptomatic (e.g., progression on scans).
             Subjects with previously treated CNS metastases are eligible, if subject is clinically
             stable and have no evidence of CNS progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior
             to start of study treatment and are not requiring immunosuppressive doses of systemic
             steroids (&gt; 30 mg per day of hydrocortisone or &gt; 10 mg per day of prednisone or
             equivalent) for longer than 2 weeks.

          -  Subject has an active autoimmune disease. Subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus,
             endocrinopathies stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy, or skin
             disorders (e.g., vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment
             are allowed.

          -  Subject was discontinued from prior immunomodulatory therapy due to a grade ≥ 3
             toxicity that was mechanistically related (e.g., immune related) to the agent.

          -  Subject has known history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to a known ingredient
             of ASP8374 or severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal
             antibody.

          -  Subject has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

          -  Subject is positive for Hepatitis B (HbsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C ([HCV];
             ribonucleic acid [RNA] detected by qualitative assay). Hepatitis C RNA testing is not
             required in subjects with negative Hepatitis C antibody testing.

          -  Subject has received a live vaccine against infectious diseases within 28 days prior
             to initiation of study treatment.

          -  Subject has a history of drug-induced pneumonitis (interstitial lung disease) or
             currently has pneumonitis.

          -  Subject has an infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Subject has received a prior allogeneic bone marrow or solid organ transplant.

          -  Subject is expected to require another form of antineoplastic therapy while on study
             treatment.

          -  Subject has had a myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to
             the start of study treatment or currently has an uncontrolled illness including, but
             not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant cardiac
             disease, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Any condition that makes the subject unsuitable for study participation.
