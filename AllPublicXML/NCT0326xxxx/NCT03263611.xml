      This clinical trial evaluate the safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy of targeted
      single injection of AMG0103 in subject with chronic discogenic lumbar back pain
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, double-blind, single ascending dose study designed to
      evaluate the safety of AMG0103 in adult male and female subjects with chronic discogenic
      lumbar back pain.

      This protocol anticipates that 8 subjects with symptomatic single level discogenic pain will
      be enrolled in each of up to 3 dose-escalation cohorts. Subjects in each cohort will receive
      AMG0103 or Placebo as a targeted, single, intradiscal injection.

         22. Has a positive screen for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, Hepatitis C antibodies, or
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by antibodies or nucleic acid test.
