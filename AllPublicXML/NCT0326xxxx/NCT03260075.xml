      The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between ward cats and patient
      satisfaction and stations atmosphere in patients with substance abuse, depression and
      psychosis. Moreover, we wanted to investigate the patients perception of the ward cats and
      the relationship between station atmosphere perceived by the employees working wards with and
      without cat at UKP Basel.
