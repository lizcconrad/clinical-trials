  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytochromes P450, main enzymes of drug metabolism, play a prominent role in the first-pass
      metabolism of oral substances. Inter-individual variability in their activity due to genetic
      and environmental factors has been observed and may be associated with adverse therapeutic
      outcomes (ineffectiveness or toxicity). The inflammation, whether acute or chronic, can
      theoretically modulate the pharmacokinetics of drugs by modulating enzyme activity. Indeed,
      in vitro data and animal models, as well as more limited data in humans, indicate a
      down-regulation of CYP in the context of inflammation.

      The cocktail approach developed and validated in Geneva (&quot;Geneva Cocktail&quot;) measures the
      activity of several CYP simultaneously using micro-doses of probe drugs and facilitating
      sampling (10uL capillary blood) on a dried blood spot.

      Investigators intend to measure the activity of CYP in an acute inflammation model (hip
      surgery) and chronic inflammation model (rheumatoid arthritis, RA). The effect of the
      biological agent tocilizumab (anti IL-6 receptor) in a treated patient subgroup (patients
      treated regardless of our study) will be measured after 3 months of treatment.

      The main objective is to determine if interleukin-6 levels are correlated with the activity
      of CYP450 in patients with acute (orthopedic surgery - hip) or chronic inflammation (RA).

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To correlate CYPs activities with the levels of other inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-α);

        -  To assess correlation between markers of inflammation, CYP activities and the intensity
           of fatigue and pain;

        -  To assess if tocilizumab reverse CYP activity in patients with RA after 3 months
           treatment.

    <description>The phenotyping probe drugs used in this study will be given as 2 capsules: one capsule of Omeprazole 10 mg and one capsule containing the remaining probe 'cocktail' drugs (caffeine 50 mg, flurbiprofen 10 mg, dextromethorphan 10 mg, midazolam 1 mg, bupropion 20 mg).
The enzymatic activities of the following CYP will be assessed by specific metabolite/probe single point concentration ratios (metabolic ratios-MR) in capillary blood:

CYP2C9
CYP2C19
CYP2D6
