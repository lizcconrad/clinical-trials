  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop a model for providing low-income people with mental illness with
      supports that enable them to manage their money as well as possible so that they are better
      able to meet their basic needs, to experience less anxiety about finances, and to live
      fulfilling lives in the community with the greatest possible degree of independence. The
      project will work within a citizenship-oriented approach to mental health care, which
      promotes recovery through linking people with mental illness to the rights, responsibilities,
      roles, resources and relationships necessary to achieve full membership in society. The aims
      of the project are to: train clinicians and peer staff so that they are able to integrate
      discussion of financial issues and concerns into their work with clients; provide on-site
      services including financial counseling, peer support groups, help with opening a bank
      account, and a savings club, and; develop a 'financial health' model which can be replicated
      by other providers of mental health services. The investigators hypothesize that the
      intervention will result in improved financial health, reduced financial stress, increased
      community participation, and improved satisfaction with care.

      This study will pilot and assess financial health interventions that will provide clients
      with financial counseling, and information about and access to financial management tools
      within the framework of citizenship-oriented care, which approaches recovery by linking
      clients to the 5 Rs of rights, responsibilities, roles, resources and relationships needed to
      achieve full membership in society. Based on results of previous research, the investigators
      hypothesize that the intervention will result in improved financial health, reduced financial
      stress, increased community participation, and improved satisfaction with care for the target
      group.

    <intervention_name>One-on-one financial counseling</intervention_name>
    <description>Clients will be given access to one-on-one financial counseling, provided by trained peer specialists, initially working under the guidance of the project director. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Your Money, Your Goals: Financial Empowerment Toolkit for Social Services Programs (21) will be used as a reference during counseling sessions, with a view to developing a manual based on clients' existing experiences and coping strategies, such that the desired behavior change is manageable, realistic, and based on real-life possibilities rather than idealized circumstances which may be far from the reality of people's lives. Counseling will in all cases be responsive to clients' particular needs and concerns, rather than following a predetermined sequence.</description>

Clients will also be advised regarding use of non-bank financial products such as prepaid cards and check cashers. Representatives from both bank and non-bank providers will be invited to come in and talk with clients about the services they offer, and clients will also be invited to visit the facilities to be guided around the available services.</description>
