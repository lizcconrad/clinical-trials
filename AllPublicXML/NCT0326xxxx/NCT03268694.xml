      Purpose: To investigate the electrophysiological correlates of human cognition and affective
      processing. Participants: Drug-resistant epilepsy patients undergoing epilepsy surgery
      cortical mapping with continuous electrocorticography (ECoG) with intracranial electrodes.
      Procedures (methods): Participants will perform computer-based cognitive and affective
      processing tasks during routine long-term monitoring. Intracranial EEG will be collected
      during the task

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oscillations in different frequency bands like theta, alpha, beta, gamma and high gamma are
      thought to underlie processing of cognitive and emotional information. For example, theta (3
      - 7 Hz) and alpha (8 - 12 Hz) oscillations are known to underlie working memory as well as
      attentional processing. Theta oscillations are known to differentiate emotional and neutral
      stimuli while gamma oscillations (30 - 50 Hz) are known to underlie rapid integration of
      information. The fact that these oscillations are also disrupted in neuropsychiatric
      disorders underline the importance of these oscillations.

      A lot of our understanding of these oscillations come from non invasive methods in humans
      like electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and invasive methods in
      animal models. However, EEG and MEG measure oscillations that are generated by collective
      firing of large cortical patches thereby losing spatial resolution. Also activity from deeper
      structures like amygdala and hippocampus cannot be picked up in these modalities. Animal
      models often suffer from the poor translation of behavior from animals to humans and vice
      versa. Intracranial EEG or Electrocorticography (ECoG) helps overcome the drawbacks described
      above.

      Studies using ECoG have become widespread and have been helpful in elucidating the functional
      roles of different brain regions in cognition and emotion. The investigators aim to utilize
      these established procedures to study the role of oscillations recorded from different brain
      regions in cognition and emotion.

      Patients with medically refractory epilepsy undergo long-term invasive monitoring for
      surgical resection planning. Electrodes are implanted subdurally over seizure focus to
      identify seizure onset zone and patients are often in the epilepsy monitoring unit at the
      Neuroscience hospital for approximately a week. During this period, intracranial EEG is
      constantly acquired for clinical investigation. The investigators plan to recruit these
      patients while they undergo long-term monitoring to leverage the rare access to direct brain
      recordings and study the role of oscillations in cognitive and affective processing. Patients
      who provide informed consent to participate in the study will perform computer based
      cognitive and emotional processing tasks.

    <description>As a part of the clinical monitoring, intracranial EEG is continuously collected when the participant is at the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at the UNC Neuroscience Hospital. We will use an FDA approved EEG amplifier/data acquisition system to collect the research data. Computer-based tasks will be presented through a laptop and task related timing information will be transmitted from the laptop to the data acquisition system. Computer-based tasks will include Working Memory task, Reward Learning Task and Facial Emotion Recognition Task</description>

    <description>Sternberg Task Items, which can be visually presented alphabets, shapes or numbers or sound tones presented through speakers, will be presented to the participant. The participant will need to maintain the presented items in their memory and indicate, when a single probe item is presented, whether the probe item was present in the immediately preceding list by pressing a key on the keyboard.
N-Back Task Items are presented continuously sequentially and participants are instructed to indicate whether items are repeated n items before by pressing a key on the keyboard. The task is divided into blocks of 0,1,2,3 -back trials based on the 'n'. For example in the 2 - back task, the participant has to indicate if the item presented 2 items before matches the current item. Similar to the previous task, the items can be presented visually or auditorily.</description>

    <description>Two abstract visual stimuli are presented on the screen and participant is asked to choose one. Unknown to the participant, each stimulus is associated with distinct probabilities of virtual reward such that one stimulus is associated with net gain while the other is associated with net loss. The participant's goal is to maximize the reward. Once the participant identifies the stimulus associated with net gain, the reward probabilities are reversed. This process is repeated 5 times.</description>

    <description>On a given trial, participants will be presented with images of two faces side-by-side. The faces will either match in terms of emotion category (e.g., 2 anger faces) or not (e.g., an anger face and a fear face). Faces presented together will always be of the same gender but different identities. Participants will be asked to determine whether the two faces presented depict the same emotion category.</description>
