  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A split-mouth design study will be performed regarding the use of platelet concentrates on
      ridge preservation: L-PRF vs A-PRF vs control. Patient needing multiple teeth extractions in
      the upper jaw (single-rooted teeth) will be recruited. The use of each platelet concentrate
      or control will be randomized by means of a computer program. The results will be analysed
      clinical and radiographically (CBCT). When the subject will choose for implant
      rehabilitation, a biopsy will be taken in the site of the preserved sockets. The region will
      be localized with a customized stent, fabricated with the position of the extracted teeth.
      VAS scales will be provided to evaluate the post-operative discomfort.

    <description>Platelet concentrates are produced from a small peripheral blood sample, which is immediately centrifuged without any anticoagulant. Coagulation starts during the centrifugation, and three layers are obtained: red blood corpuscles (RBCs) at the bottom of the tube, platelet-poor plasma (PPP) on the top and an intermediate layer called &quot;buffy coat&quot; where most platelets and leucocytes are concentrated. L-PRF has potential advantages, namely: it creates a bioactive construct that stimulates the local environment for differentiation and proliferation of stem and progenitor cells and it acts as an immune regulation node with inflammation control abilities, such as slow continuous release of growth factors over a period of 7-14 days.</description>
