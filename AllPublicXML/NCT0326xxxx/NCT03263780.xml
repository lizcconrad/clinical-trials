  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective trial aims to determine if enhanced prostate imaging using two novel imaging
      technologies (high resolution DWI and 18F-fluciclovine PET-MRI) will detect prostate cancers
      not seen on standard multiparametric prostate MRI in patients considered candidates for focal
      HIFU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 18F-fluciclovine PET-hrMRI
      versus standard mpMRI at identifying prostate cancer targets for HIFU therapy.

      Participants with clinically localized, unilateral high grade prostate cancer (Gleason score
      7-10 prostate cancer localized to one lobe on prior biopsies) OR at high risk for having
      unrecognized high grade prostate cancer (overall Gleason score 6 with &gt; half of systematic
      biopsy cores positive and &gt; 50% of core involvement in at least one core), interested in HIFU
      would receive both a standard mpMRI and 18F-fluciclovine PET-hrMRI.

      Participants would then undergo a mapping biopsy using a standard sextant template plus
      MRI/US-fusion targeted biopsy of any lesion suspicious lesion on mpMRI or PET-hrMRI.
