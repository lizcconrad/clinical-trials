      -  To investigate the product regiments' performance on moisturization related skin healthy
           signs (skin moisturization, barrier function, elasticity, translucency, roughness and
           skin conditions) through instrumental evaluation, clinical grading and self-assessment
           before, during and after 8 weeks' home usage under city environmental aggressors (Sun,
           change of temperature and humidity, wind and air pollution) among 3 product regimens and
           Non-treatment control;

        -  To explore the linkage among products efficacy, ambient aggressors, and life habits;

        -  To investigate product regimens' tolerance and safety via Home Use Test;

        -  To collect skin microflora/microbiome samples for potential research on skin microbiome
           distribution change as impacted by product application and/or environmental aggressors
           change (data will be analyzed and reported separately).

      This is a single center, double blinded, controlled and randomized 8-week home use clinical
      trial.

      Subjects will be randomly and evenly divided into 3 groups (40subjects/group) with different
      facial care regimens during the 8-week home use study.

      Group 1: NTG Hydro Boost Gelee Milk Cleanser + NTG Hydro Boost Kiwi Water Gel Group 2: NTG
      Hydro Boost Gelee Milk Cleanser + NTG Hydro Boost Water Gel Group 3: NTG Hydro Boost Gelee
      Milk Cleanser + NTG Hydro Boost Extra Dry Emulsion There will be a 3-day wash-in period after
      subject's enrollment. During the period, no product will be allowed to be applied on the face
      and upper chest but only water washes twice per day in the morning and evening for 3 days
      before baseline (BL) measurement.

      After baseline (BL) measurement, the product regimens will be applied on face at site under
      site instruction according to the randomization. Measurements will be taken at 2-4 hours and
      8 hours after product regimens' application. Upper chest area will be measured as no
      treatment control.

      A set of product regimen includes a facial cleanser and a facial cream will be distributed to
      each subject according to grouping and applied on the face at home for 8 weeks. Both cleanser
      and cream products will be applied twice a day in the morning and evening on the whole face.
      For the upper chest area, use water wash only twice per day in the morning and evening, no
      any other product is allowed.

      The usage of assigned product regimens will be discontinued after 8-week home use, no any
      other product is allowed but only water wash twice per day in the morning and evening on both
      face and upper chest for 3 days (regression period).

      Subjects will not be allowed to use sunscreen, makeup and any other cosmetic products on face
      and upper chest during the study period.

      Subjects will visit the site at Screening (-3D), Baseline (BL), 1-week (1W), 4-week (4W),
      8-week (8W) and 8-week+3-days (+3D) for measurements.

    <masking_description>Since this will be a blind study, the product randomization codes will be generated by study team member different from Study Manager, Study Director, Principle Investigator and any data producers or influencer. The product randomization codes and the corresponding product information (i.e. product name, formula number, batch number, manufacturing/expiry date, etc.) will be sealed in an envelope and before study filed work complete kept by PI until there is a unblinding needs due to medical emergency or report drafting.
In this study, in total 4 IPs include 3 facial creams and 1 facial cleanser will be evaluated. Subjects will be assigned to 3 groups randomly and evenly with different facial product regimens (one cleanser + one cream). The product regimens will be applied on the whole face for on-site study and the 8-week HUT. For each subject, left or right cheek area will be randomly chosen as experimental area for evaluation and middle upper chest will be the untreated control area</masking_description>
