  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two-center randomized, parallel, controlled trial which will compare a pragmatic combined
      training program with a health education program in 184 older adults with hypertension. This
      study will last 12 weeks with assessments conducted at baseline, previously to the group
      allocation, and after interventions. There is a set of secondary outcomes which show clinical
      importance to the elderly population and are possibly influenced by the tested intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol describes a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate blood
      pressure effects of a pragmatic combined training program, with low equipment needs, in
      comparison with a health education program. The sample is composed by 184 older adults,
      divided in two implementation centers. Randomization ratio will be 1:1 and interventions will
      last 12 weeks, with three weekly sessions for the exercise arm and one to the health
      education arm. In order to analyze the effects of interventions in a comprehensive way, a
      range of variables related to ambulatory blood pressure (primary outcome), physical fitness,
      vascular and autonomous function, together with emotional and cognitive aspects will be
      evaluated in a pre-post fashion. The study's hypothesis, as well as the sample size
      calculation and analysis plan, is based on a superiority expectation for the exercise program
      in comparison with the health education program, especially for the blood pressure control,
      functional capacity and quality of life. The present study was designed and will be conducted
      by a multidisciplinary staff and follows ethical and methodological recommendations for
      clinical trials. It is expected that this multicenter randomized trial will provide
      scientific evidences with a high applicability to the non-pharmacological management of
      hypertension in the elderly.

Data usage will be under the PI's auspices, but restrictions or screenings will not be imposed upon data requests. ABPM data and any deemed relevant support information (sociodemographic, clinical history and allocated groups) will be shared if available.Details regarding the study's design and statistical plan can be obtained consulting the trial's protocol. Data on other outcomes could be requested contacting the PI. Data access will be available after all participants completed the study and will remain accessible for as long as deemed necessary by the study's committee.
