  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the research is to test the hypothesis that participating in group-based
      gardening or group-based art activities may alter the mental health and cardiac physiological
      status of a wellness population of women ages 26-49. Assessment of the effects of gardening
      or art activities on the experimental population will take two approaches, the first being
      the use of physiological measurements of heart rate and blood pressure. The second approach
      will employ six widely used and well-established self-reported assessment instruments that
      will capture information about the health and well-being of participants. These measurements
      and assessments will provide a psychometrically-based before and after mental health status
      and between treatments health summaries of the participants in the gardening group and those
      engaged in the art group activities.

      The goal of this project is to better understand how interacting and working with plants in a
      group gardening activities program in a greenhouse, or a group art program that takes place
      indoors and is devoid of images or depictions of plants influences the overall health and
      well-being of participants.

      A total anticipated study population (N = 40) will consist of up to 20 healthy women randomly
      assigned to the art activities group, and up to 20 healthy women assigned to the gardening
      group. There will be measurements of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and
      psychometric assessments including satisfaction of social activities at baseline and post
      intervention. Heart rate and blood pressure measurements will be taken at the beginning and
      end of each of the eight gardening or arts sessions. Psychometric assessments of study
      participants will be conducted at baseline and post-intervention. Each treatment group will
      be divided into two smaller groups of up to ten women each that will receive the gardening or
      art interventions on different days of the week. The participants in the gardening or art
      groups will receive an experimental intervention consisting of 8 gardening or art sessions,
      each approximately 60 minutes in duration over a four week treatment period. Gardening and
      art sessions will take place at the same time of day twice each week, and follow a
      standardized programming sequence to ensure equivalency of intervention across all sessions.
      Ambient environmental conditions in the greenhouse during the gardening sessions will be
      monitored and recorded. The gardening activities will emphasize growing plants from seeds,
      plant propagation techniques, transplanting, and plant-mediated taste, visual, olfactory and
      touch sensory stimulation. All gardening sessions will begin with a short educational module
      introducing the plants and gardening activities taking place during each session. Art
      activities will include papermaking, image transfer, visual storytelling, linocut
      printmaking, paper batik, mixed media collage, and sensation drawing, and begin with a short
      educational module of the activity.

      In addition to the pre- and post-intervention assessments and measurement, psychometric
      assessments will be administered for depression symptomatology, mood states and perceived
      stress at specific points during the gardening and art activities to evaluate any changes
      over time resulting from the interventions. Participant heart rate and blood pressure
      measurements will be made at the beginning and at the end of all gardening and art sessions.

    <measure>Biometric Changes in Overall Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 Health Survey assessment instrument (Ware and Sherbourne 1992; Hays et al 1993) will be used to evaluate eight scales that link to physical and mental health over a 4-week recall interval. This will reveal whether engaging in gardening activities will or will not result in changes in the overall health status based on instrument's physical and mental health subcomponent assessments of the gardening treatment group compared to the control group. The overall assessment scale for the SF-36 ranges from a low of 36 to a high of 400, with the U.S. norm being 314.</description>

    <measure>Biometric Changes in Depressive Symptomatology</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The study protocol will use the Beck Depression Inventory 2nd edition (BDI-II) (Beck et al 1988) with a recall interval of 2-weeks to gain insight relative to the intensity of depression. This assessment will determine whether engaging in gardening will or will not result in changes in depressive symptomatology of the gardening treatment group relative to the control group. The assessment scale for the Beck BDI ranges from a low of 10 to a high of 63. Scores 0-13 indicate minimal depressive symptomatology and above 19 up to 63 moderate to severe depressive symptomatology.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) instrument (Form Y) (Spielberger et al 1983) will be used in this study to gain insight regarding the relative intensity of anxiety being experienced by the gardening treatment group relative to the control group. The STAI reports on &quot;at this moment&quot; status. The STAI assessment will seek to determine whether engaging in gardening will or will not result in changes in State Anxiety status of the participants. The overall assessment scale for the STAI-Y ranges from a low of 20 to a high of 80, with higher scores indicating greater intensity of anxiety.</description>

The POMS2-AS will assess whether engaging in gardening activities will or will not result in changes in mood and enduring states of affect status of the gardening treatment group relative to the control group, both during and following the completion of the gardening activities treatment regimen. The assessment scale for the POMS2-AS ranges from 5 to a high of 100 per scale .</description>

    <description>The study will use the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen et al 1983) with a recall interval of 4-weeks to gain insight relative to the intensity of perceived stress. This assessment will determine whether engaging in gardening activities will or will not result in changes in the perceived stress levels of the gardening treatment group relative to the control group. The assessment scale for the Perceived Stress Scale ranges from a low of 0 to a high of 40, indicating higher stress at higher scores. The norm score for women is 13.7.</description>
