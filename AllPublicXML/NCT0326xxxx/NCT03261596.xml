  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ghana study will hypothesize that both the multiple dose and single dose of mebendazole
      will achieve effective cure rates against hookworm among children and adolescents. This study
      is intended to be a pilot study for a planned Phase 3 registration trial of a new drug for
      hookworm, tribendimidine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the Cure Rates (CRs) of mebendazole regimens to be used as
      comparator drug regimens in the future pivotal trial of tribendimidine and will provide
      evidence of the efficacy and safety of mebendazole among children and adolescents infected
      with hookworm in Ghana. Children and adolescents bear a large burden of morbidity from
      hookworm infection, so building the evidence base for effective treatments in this population
      has important public health implications in Ghana and other endemic settings.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a single site Phase 4, open-label, randomized controlled study. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment allocations: 150 to receive a single dose of 500 mg mebendazole and 150 to receive a multi-dose of 100 mg mebendazole twice a day for three days.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cure Rate (CR) against hookworm, as determined by Kato Katz.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine point estimates for the efficacy of two mebendazole regimens: (i) 100 mg solid tablets twice daily for three days, and (ii) single dose of 500 mg solid tablets in participants aged 6 to 18 years infected with hookworm. The CR will be calculated as the percentage of children and adolescents (all hookworm egg-positive at enrollment) who are egg negative 20 days after treatment. The CRs will be tabulated by mebendazole dose regimen received, along with their corresponding 95% CIs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Egg reduction rate (ERR), based on geometric mean, against hookworm</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>In a simple analysis, the study will estimate a risk ratio between CRs by using log binomial regression. Baseline characteristics will be assessed by arm to determine any imbalance between the two randomization arms. Any factor (e.g., age, sex, school, weight, height, baseline hookworm infection intensity) out of balance at baseline will be adjusted for in the analyses. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted which will consider all participants with missing endpoint data as treatment failure or all as treatment success to test whether the results (of the CR comparison) are sensitive to potential differences in loss to follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CR and ERR against Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the ERR in the two treatment arms; EPG will be assessed by adding up the egg counts from the Kato-Katz thick smears and multiplying this number by twenty-four. The ERR will be calculated (ERR = (1-(mean egg count at follow-up/mean egg count at baseline))*100). Geometric mean egg counts will be calculated for the different treatment arms before and after treatment to assess the corresponding ERRs. The bootstrap resampling method with 5,000 replicates will be used to calculate 95% CIs for ERRs and the difference between the ERRs. Analyses of mebendazole efficacy against concomitant STHs will proceed similarly to those conducted for hookworm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 20 days of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>For the safety objective, the probability of observing zero, one or more, and two or more solicited AEs among the 150 subjects in each treatment arm given a true event rate. For example, if the true rate of an AE among subjects receiving single dose mebendazole is 1% then the probability we will see 1 or more subjects with this event is 78%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity of Kato-Katz and PCR for hookworm infection detection</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks following Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the sensitivity of Kato-Katz to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays among participants at day 20 of follow-up. As there is no true gold standard for hookworm diagnosis, we will consider individuals as &quot;true&quot; positives if they are identified as positive by PCR or Kato-Katz. This assumes no false positives for either diagnostic technique. While PCR has higher sensitivity than microscopy in general, microscopy has been noted to have high specificity. The study will therefore avoid discounting as &quot;true&quot; positives those who test negative by PCR but positive by microscopy and conduct an inter-method reliability study to separately compare hookworm and other STH diagnoses by PCR or the pooled microscopy in the full sample (N= 300) with the pooled (Kato-Katz or PCR positive) gold standard. Specificity cannot be calculated, as both diagnostic methods are contained within the pooled gold standard.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of hookworm genetic resistance markers</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks following Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the prevalence of hookworm genetic resistance markers among participants at day 20 of follow-up. The conditional prevalence is defined as the proportion of individuals who have a disease subtype among those who test positive for the disease. All participants identified as positive for hookworm by PCR at day 20 will be considered hookworm positive.</description>

    <measure>Distribution of hookworm species among participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks following Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the distribution of hookworm species among participants at baseline. All participants identified as positive for hookworm by PCR at baseline will be considered hookworm positive. The conditional prevalence(s) will be calculated as follows, pooled and separately for each arm.</description>
