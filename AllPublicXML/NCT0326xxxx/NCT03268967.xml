  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is vital for surviving critical illness. An
      admission to ICU without having a consistent structure, structured review of the patient and
      a solid team organization lead to unclear communication and responsibility. Factors that
      correlate with patient acceptance and safety, morbidity and mortality. The hypothesize was
      that a structured admission can improve patients safety, reduce delays in treatment, reduce
      ICU length of stay, and improve mortality rate. The overall objective was to optimize patient
      safety, and effectively use available resources to reduce admission time, delays in treatment
      and procedures and mortality by using both quantitative and qualitative methods.

      The quantitative before-data is a one-year observational period prior to the intervention
      measured by different perspectives; patients and staff outcomes.

      After the intervention, was qualititive data collected from participants, who received
      simulation training.

      The quantitative after-data is a one-year observational period post-intervention with same
      outcomes as before starting the intervention.

      Data is already collected registry data from hospital quality assurance board. Data will be
      compared before and after with assessor blinded analysis. Missing data will not be replaced
      but reported as missing.

      The investigators will try to compare the results with data from an approximately comparative
      ICU in Denmark due to the implementation of a new patient management system called the Health
      Portal.

      The statistical analysis plan is based on descriptive and comparative analyses of the group
      before and after the trial. The quantitative results are explained in in-depths description
      from participants.

    <description>A structured ICU admission was inspired by principles of Crisis Resource Management and simulation training of ICU staff members. The Principles of Crisis Resource Management consisted of a treatment manual, a learning video, clear precise communication tool based on Identification-Situation-Background-Analysis-Recommendations (ISBAR) and Closed loop, actions cards, and ABCDE-evaluation of the patient including debriefing, and training in the simulation environment.</description>
