  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring the wound
      surface area reduction of Diabetic Foot Ulcers) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of
      the medicinal product to be studied after one single application on the wound surface of
      patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of allogeneic ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in
      patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer. Allogeneic MSCs will be isolated ex vivo and will
      be expanded in vitro. The IMP incorporating the ABCB5-positive MSCs will then be applied on
      the wound surface of DFU.

      Patients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound
      healing from transient wound coverage.

      The wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size
      evaluation will start two weeks after IMP application. The quality of the wound healing
      process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization
      and wound exudation.

      Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated
      with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-DFU
      three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 post IMP applications are included.

          2. Patients with an existing diagnosis of diabetic mellitus Type 2, evaluated by blood
             test [HbA1c] &lt; 11%) at the Screening visit (Visit 1). The HbA1c value at visit 1
             should not vary more than 1.5% (absolute range) compared to a HbA1c value that was
             previously measured 1 to 3 months before visit 1;

          3. The presence of diabetic neuropathic ulcers &quot;malum perforans&quot; not involving subcutis

         11. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive
             methods during the course of the clinical trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of Charcot foot;

          2. Clinical signs of active osteomyelitis in the last three months;

          3. Active wet gangrenous tissue;

          4. Infection of the target ulcer requiring treatment as judged clinically;

          5. Presence of an ulcer Grade ≥3 according to Wagner on the same foot as target ulcer;

             vein thrombosis;

         11. Any chronic dermatological disorders diagnosed at the investigator's discretion;

         12. Skin disorders, unrelated to the ulcer, that are present adjacent to the target wound;

         13. Treatment of target wound with active wound care agents (e.g. iruxol, local
             antibiotics or silver dressings), which have not been stopped 14 days before IMP
             application;

         14. Any malignancy within the past 5 years, excluding successfully treated carcinoma in
             situ, basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin without evidence of
             metastases;

         15. Current use of steroid medication above Cushing threshold dose (&gt;7.5 mg/d prednisone
             or equivalent);

         16. Known abuse of alcohol, drugs, or medicinal products;

         17. Patients anticipated to be unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the
             protocol;

         18. Pregnant or lactating women;

         19. Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1&amp;2);

         20. Any known allergies to components of the IMP or concomitant medication;

         21. Current or previous (within 30 days of enrollment) treatment with another IMP, or
             participation and/or under follow-up in another clinical trial;

         22. Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, physical
             examination, or laboratory findings) that may interfere with the planned treatment,
             affect the patient's compliance, or place the patient at high risk of complications
             related to the treatment;

         23. Employees of the sponsor, or employees or relatives of the investigator.
