    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the effects of 4 weeks each of daily treatment
      with canagliflozin 300 milligram (mg) versus sitagliptin 100 mg as treatment adjuncts to
      metformin (at stable dosages) on intrapatient glycemic coefficient of variation (CV),
      expressed as a ratio percentage of standard deviation (SD) to mean glucose levels.
