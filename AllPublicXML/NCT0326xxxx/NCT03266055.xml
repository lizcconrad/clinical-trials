  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that nutritional intervention with dietary polyphenols can
      positively modulate the gut microbiota to improve cardiometabolic health. Whether the
      beneficial effects of blueberries on obesity and the metabolic syndrome can be linked to
      their potential impact on the gut microbiota and intestinal integrity remains speculative at
      this time. Moreover, the mechanisms of action underlying health benefits associated to
      blueberry consumption are still unknown. The investigators are thus proposing to combine the
      study of metagenomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics to test whether a prebiotic activity
      of highbush blueberries can play a role in the prevention of obesity-linked metabolic
      syndrome in a clinical setting.
