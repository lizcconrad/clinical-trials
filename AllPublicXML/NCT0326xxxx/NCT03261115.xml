  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial. is to test the efficacy of topical anesthesia
      against the use of no topical agent during buccal infiltration in maxillary anterior teeth.
      The rationale behind this comparison is to evaluate the practical, clinical outcome of not
      using any topical agent if in fact topical anesthesia does not reduce pain as reported by
      various studies and if consequently its usage was to be discontinued.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical implication of topical anesthesia and placebo being the same is to not use
      either of them prior to LA administration in dentistry. This clinical approach has rarely
      been studied and this study aims to compare the effects of the use of topical anesthesia
      against the use of no topical agent prior to buccal infiltration in maxillary anterior teeth.
