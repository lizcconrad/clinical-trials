      Objectives:

      This study aims to assess if the use of general anesthesia (GA) or sedation (CS) in patients
      with acute stroke undergoing intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy, leads to better
      neurological outcomes and less peri-procedural complications.

      Hypothesis Null Hypothesis: There are no differences in outcomes in patients with acute
      stroke treated by intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy using General anesthesia or
      Sedation.

The most common drugs utilized for sedation and wide dosing ranges are included in the protocol (i.e., sedation will be provided under the supervision of an anesthesiologist and may use a combination of fentanyl, midazolam, dexmedetomidine infusion (with or without loading dose), and/or low-dose propofol by intermittent bolus or infusion); however, the choice of specific drugs and dosages for achieving conscious sedation or general anesthesia will not be specified by the protocol but will be up to the anesthesiologist.</description>

The most common drugs utilized for GA and wide dosing ranges included in the protocol are (GA will be provided under the supervision of an anesthesiologist and induction of anesthesia may be achieved with propofol and/or etomidate; muscle paralysis may be achieved with succinylcholine or non-depolarizing paralytic (rocuronium or vecuronium); and adjuvant lidocaine and fentanyl; if intravenous maintenance of anesthesia is used, it may be achieved by propofol infusion at 50 to 150 mcg/kg/min with redosing of non-depolarizing paralytic and fentanyl as needed; if inhalational maintenance of anesthesia is used it will be achieved with sevoflurane 1% to 2% or desflurane 3% to 6% end-tidal concentration with redosing of non-depolarizing paralytic and fentanyl as needed)</description>
