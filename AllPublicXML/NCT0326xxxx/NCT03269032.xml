  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of a Mediterranean-style diet on microbiome diversity
      compared to a typical American diet. The study will observe the microbiome composition
      comparisons in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome with
      Diarrhea (IBS-D) to see if the consumption of a Mediterranean-style diet has a positive
      effect on improving symptoms of IBS-D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent and well-studied functional
      gastrointestinal disorder. While IBS has no direct mortality, it does compromise quality of
      life, incurs morbidity, and has a substantial economic impact on society. The gut microbiome
      may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of IBS. Even though the exact mechanisms
      underlying this relationship have not been presented, it is suggested that certain
      microorganisms may increase gut permeability, activate the mucosal immune response, increase
      visceral sensitivity and alter intestinal motility via a bidirectional brain-gut interaction.
      Recent studies suggest that the salutary impact of the Mediterranean diet may be due to its
      effects on the composition of the gut microbiome. In a recent cohort study in Italy, subjects
      who adhered most closely to a classical Mediterranean diet had more favorable bacterial
      enterotypes (e.g., Prevotella) in their stool, as well as higher levels of short-chain fatty
      acids - which are essential for colonic function. Studies have also showed that diet alters
      the predominant microbiome enterotypes and that microbiome composition can change quickly,
      within 24 hours, after a dietary intervention. Therefore, consumption of a Mediterranean diet
      may ameliorate the gut dysbiosis associated with IBS-D.

Phase 2 will study subjects who have IBS-D. As above, they will first eat a typical American diet for 2 weeks, and then cross-over to a Mediterranean-style diet.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A plasma inflammatory marker that will be analyzed is C-reactive protein (CRP). The CRP is measured through a blood test. A CRP level of 10mg/L or lower is considered to be normal. A higher CRP indicates that their is inflammation in the body.Data will be analyzed in comparison of time points Baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Changes in IBS Symptom Severity Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS Severity Scoring System is a validated measure to assess the severity of IBS symptoms, and can help monitor response to treatment. Each of the 5 questions generates a score from 0-100 points with a maximum total score of 500 points. Mild IBS=75-174 points, moderate IBS=175-299 points, and severe IBS=300 points of more.Data will be analyzed in comparison of time points Baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scores (HADS) is a self assessment scale designed to detect states of depression, anxiety, and emotional distress in patients who are being treated for a clinical problem. The scale has 14 questions that are scored on a scale of 0-3, with 3 indicating higher symptom frequencies. Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0-7, mild 8-10, moderate 11-14, and severe 15-21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.Data will be analyzed in comparison of time points Baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.</description>
