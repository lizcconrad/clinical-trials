  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is often used by anesthesiologists during cardiac
      surgery, as a monitoring tool in non-cardiac surgery, and as a point of care diagnostic tool
      in the intensive care unit (ICU). Furthermore, TEE is becoming a core skill in many
      specialties to facilitate focused cardiovascular assessment in hemodynamically compromised
      patients in various settings. Educators must determine how to best instruct current and
      future trainees to achieve clinical competence in TEE within a time limited and constantly
      expanding medical curriculum.

      In this study the investigators will evaluate a new online TEE Simulation module as a
      learning tool to accelerate and enhance traditional clinical teaching. This project will
      evaluate a new online TEE Simulation module that replicates the actions required to adjust
      TEE probe position and the ultrasound plane in relation to a 3D heart model.

      The investigators hypothesize that experience with the online TEE simulation module will
      improve the ability of trainees to independently perform TEE probe manipulations necessary to
      obtain standard TEE views. The proposed study will answer this question by measuring the
      performance of trainees in obtaining 10 of the 25 standard TEE views using the Vimedix
      mannequin-based ultrasonography simulator following an hour of review of the online TEE
      Simulation module.

      The educational benefit of the Web-based TEE simulation module, will be evaluated by 20
      novices randomly assigned to two groups, a control group of 10 subjects without exposure to
      the Web-based simulation, and an experimental group of 10 subjects with exposure to the
      Web-based simulation. Both groups will be assessed on their performance in attaining the 10
      standard TEE views with the Vimedix simulator.
