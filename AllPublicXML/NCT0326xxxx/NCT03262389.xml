  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are doing this study to determine which of four imaging techniques:
      Fludeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18 FDG PET) computerized tomography (CT), 18
      FDG PET Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), C-11 acetate PET CT, and C-11 acetate PET MRI) is
      the best test for finding sites of active myeloma disease.

      Participants who are clinically scheduled to undergo F-18 FDG PET/CT myeloma evaluation will
      also undergo F-18 FDG PET/MRI, and C-11 acetate PET CT/MRI. On Day 1 of study, participants
      will undergo F-18 FDG PET/CT-MRI. F-18 FDG radiopharmaceutical is infused intravenously,
      followed by a 60 minute waiting uptake phase. After 60 minutes, participant will undergo
      PET/CT imaging for 30 minutes. At 90 minutes, participant will undergo PET/MRI imaging for 30
      minutes. On Day 2 of study, participants will undergo C-11 PET/CT-MRI. C-11
      radiopharmaceutical is infused intravenously, followed by a 10 minute uptake phase. After 10
      minutes, participant will undergo PET/CT imaging for 30 minutes, followed by a 60 minute
      pause with the participant at rest. At the end of 60 minute pause, the participant is given
      the second C-11 acetate infusion, followed by a 10 minute waiting uptake phase. After 10
      minutes, participant will undergo PET/MRI imaging for 30 minutes. On Day 3, study team member
      makes a phone call to participant for follow up.

    <description>Participants will receive 4 different techniques of diagnosis: Fludeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) PET/MRI, Sodium Acetate (C-11 acetate) PET/CT, C-11 PET/MRI, and F-18 FDG PET/CT. Each participant will receive both PET drugs by both diagnostic techniques and is therefore included in the analysis population for the four reporting groups.</description>
