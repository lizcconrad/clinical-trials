  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a combinatorial
      therapy of breathing low oxygen in short bursts-acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) and upper
      limb training on arm strength and function, and comparing it with individual treatments in
      persons with spinal cord injuries.

      The investigators hypothesize that a combinatorial intervention with AIH therapy + upper limb
      training will be significantly more effective in improving hand function, compared to
      individual treatments alone.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will determine the impact of combined daily AIH
      therapy and high-repetition task-specific upper extremity training on arm strength and hand
      dexterity in persons with spinal cord injuries.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this research project is to determine the effect of a 5-day intervention
      with daily acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) therapy, either alone or coupled with
      task-specific training, on upper extremity function in individuals with chronic, incomplete
      SCI.

      Previous work already determined that breathing low levels of oxygen for short periods of
      time (also known as acute intermittent hypoxia) can improve lower limb motor function in
      persons with spinal injury. Specifically, this study is being done to determine if
      pre-treatment with intermittent hypoxia can enhance the beneficial effects of upper limb
      training on the restoration of limb function in persons with spinal injury.

      This is a blinded study, which means that the subject will not know which treatment they are
      receiving. They will either receive intermittent periods of low oxygen (hypoxia) or a session
      composed of only normal room air. They will be randomly assigned to a treatment based on
      chance. Neither the subject nor the researcher chooses the assigned group. They will have an
      equal chance of being in either group.

      The participant will receive a daily 5-day intervention with either acute intermittent
      hypoxia (AIH) therapy or room air, either alone or coupled with task-specific training, on
      upper extremity function in individuals with chronic, incomplete SCI. This will be preceded
      by a baseline testing visit prior to the intervention, and followed by a 4 week follow up
      period to assess the effects of the interventions over time.

      The total duration of participation in the study intervention protocol is 1 week. Including
      the follow up period, the subjects will participate for a total of 6 weeks.

    <masking_description>This is a blinded study, which means the participant will not know which treatment they are receiving. They will either receive intermittent periods of low oxygen (hypoxia) or a session composed of only normal room air. They will be randomly assigned to a treatment based on chance, like a flip of a coin. Neither you nor the researcher chooses your assigned group. They will have an equal chance of being in either group. Upon acceptance into the study, subjects will be assigned an identification number. Data pertaining to each subject will only be identified by this number. Any forms/files containing the subject's personal information and their ID number will be housed in a locked office/laboratory space. The outcomes assessor will also be blinded to the intervention the subject received.</masking_description>

    <description>Subjects will receive 45 minutes of task-specific, high repetition upper extremity training, given using an upper-limb robotic rehabilitation device, the Armeo SpringÂ®. Armeo Spring is a gravity support system based on an ergonomic arm exoskeleton with integrated springs. It cradles the entire arm, from shoulder to the hand, and counterbalances the weight of the user's arm. Therefore, it enhances any residual function and neuromuscular control, and assists in active movement across a large 3-D workspace. The Armeo software contains an extensive library of game-like movement exercises supported by a virtual-reality training environment that displays the functional task along with immediate performance feedback.</description>
