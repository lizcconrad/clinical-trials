  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Evaluate whether immediate or delayed reconstruction should be offered for breast
           reconstruction candidates with higher risk for surgical complications by comparing
           complications, quality of life, and hospital costs

        2. Determine the efficacy of risk reduction strategies for breast reconstruction patients
           with higher risk for surgical complications
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Primary Endpoint(s)

        1. Define the optimal timing of reconstruction in patients at a higher risk for developing
           breast reconstruction surgical complications through a randomized prospective cohort

        2. Compare immediate and delayed reconstruction outcome metrics through retrospective
           review

      Secondary Endpoint(s)

        1. Evaluate Quality of life of patients at a higher risk for developing breast
           reconstruction surgical complications undergoing immediate versus delayed
           reconstruction.

        2. Compare complications and reoperations between immediate versus delayed reconstruction.

        3. Compare the hospital costs between immediate versus delayed reconstruction

        4. Evaluate the effectiveness of risk reduction strategies

    <description>The surgical schedule will follow unaltered standard protocol for immediate reconstruction right after the patient's mastectomy. Patients will complete a quality of life questionnaire (Breast-Q) both pre-operatively and at different time points during the follow up. The patient's chart will be followed from the mastectomy surgery onwards until 1 year post-final reconstructive surgery for determining complications and hospital costs.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Delayed breast reconstruction</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will start the reconstruction process after cancer therapy has been completed. Patients will be directed to smoking cessation and weight loss resources such as the Bariatric Institute to most directly facilitate risk reduction goals. Risk scores will be assessed at a plastic surgery appointment every 3 months. Reconstruction will proceed after the cancer treatment has been completed, according to individual patient evaluation. Patients will complete a quality of life questionnaire (Breast-Q) both pre-operatively and after the final reconstruction surgery. The patient's chart will be followed from the mastectomy surgery onwards until 1 year post-final reconstructive surgery for determining complications and hospital costs.</description>

    <intervention_name>Immediate Breast Reconstruction</intervention_name>
    <description>Only implant based surgeries will be considered in this study. The patient will be followed for at least 1 year after the last reconstruction surgery. Reconstruction will be attempted immediately after mastectomy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Delayed Breast Reconstruction</intervention_name>
    <description>Risk reduction strategies on smoking, weight, and chronic disease control will be offered. The individual risk will be recalculated every three months. Delayed breast reconstruction will be offered when core cancer therapies (mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation) are complete. Only implant based surgeries will be considered in this study. The patient will be followed for at least 1 year after the last reconstruction surgery.</description>
