      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and the immunogenicity of
      extended treatment with natalizumab when administered at a dose of 300 mg intravenously (IV)
      to subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have completed natalizumab Studies C-1801,
      C-1802, or C-1803.
