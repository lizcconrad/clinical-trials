  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation and the leading cause of death more than 2 years after
      transplantation.During the past 30 years survival of patients with chronic GVHD has not
      improved and steroids remained the most often used therapy. Extracorporeal photoimmunotherapy
      (ECP)has shown to be efficacious in patients with GVHD. We propose a phase II study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of ECP as adjunct first-line therapy in patients with newly
      diagnosed chronic GVHD of liver or lungs and need for systemic immunosuppression defined
      according to the NIH consensus criteria.
