  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the outcomes of study participants who have had peripheral blood stem
      cell transplantation or with those who have had bone marrow transplantation from an unrelated
      donor for the treatment of serious hematological malignancies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, prospective, comparative trial of
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood stem cells verses
      marrow from unrelated donors for transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies.
      The study will be comparing two-year survival probabilities between process has many steps
      after a matched donor is found. The donor also needs to give permission to join this study.
      Participants will be randomized to either peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow.
      The kind of transplant the participant receives is random. Neither the participant nor the
      doctor may choose the type of transplant.

      Participants will receive vaccinations for diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and pneumococcus.
      Blood samples will be drawn as part of a participant's normal care. Blood samples will also
      be collected to see if infection fighting cells are working. These samples will be collected
      at 12 weeks, one year and then yearly until three years post transplant. Information will be
      collected from the participant's medical history. Participants will also have phone
      interviews conducted and questions will be asked about their physical and emotional health.
      Participants taking part in this study may be followed for up to 5 years.

    <description>Transplanted patients randomized to the two study arms will be compared for the following endpoints: survival, incidences of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, time off all immunosuppressive therapy, relapse, infections, adverse events, immune reconstitution, and quality of life. Donors in each arm of the study will be compared for time to return to baseline toxicity score, CBC and WBC differential values after donation and quality of life.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Participants may be eligible if they are between the ages of 18 to 66 years and are
        undergoing unrelated blood stem cell transplantation for the first time for the treatment
        of their hematological malignancy. Additional eligibility criteria will be gathered and
        evaluated by the transplant physician to determine if an individual is eligible to take
        part.
