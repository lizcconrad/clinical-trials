      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well etoposide works in treating young patients
      with ependymoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in young patients with relapsing and/or refractory
           ependymoma treated with a rapid schedule of intravenous etoposide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the possibility of second surgery or additional radiotherapy in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients whose tumor becomes resectable after courses 3 or 6 undergo surgical
      resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for approximately 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 14 patients will be accrued for this study.
