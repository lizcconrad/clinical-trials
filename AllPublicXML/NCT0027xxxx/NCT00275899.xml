  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a new member of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily,
      is a decoy receptor for FasL and could inhibit FasL-induced apoptosis, has recently been
      shown to induce costimulation of T cells. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune
      disease with pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes results from abnormal immune
      responses including T and B lymphocyte hyperactivity, and formation of pathogenic subsets of
      autoantibodies. Rhematoid arthritis (RA) is a multi-systemic autoimmune disease characterized
      by persistent inflammatory synovitis. Activated T lymphocytes infiltration to synovium is
      strongly correlated with the symptoms. DcR3 mRNA is expressed in peripheral-blood T cells and
      is up-regulated after antigenic stimulation. The DcR3 gene has been demonstrated to be
      overexpressed in patients with sclerosis or SLE; however, role of DcR3 in SLE and RA as well
      as the effects of DcR3 on T cell immune response is still not clear. This study is to
      investigate role of DcR3-induced T cell activation in SLE and RA. The genetic polymorphisms
      of DcR3 in association with SLE and RA will be studied to elucidate the genetic factors
      associated with development of SLE and RA. For further explore the possible molecular
      mechanisms of elevated DcR3 in association with SLE, we attempt to study whether DcR3 could
      induce T cell activation via costimualtion and/or inhibit the activation induced cell death
      (AICD) of activated T cells in SLE and RA. This study will provide a new direction of therapy
      in reverse T cell hyper-reactivity in SLE and RA.

      Specific Aim 1. Study DcR3-induced T cell activation in SLE and RA. A. Patients and controls
      Patients with SLE and RA in Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University
      Hospital will be studied. All patient meet the criteria of the American College of
      Rheumatologists for diagnosis of SLE and RA. As controls, 20 healthy age- and gender-matched
      volunteers will be used. All the studies including samples involving human is in accordance
      with institutional guidelines.

      B. Detection of serum DcR3 protein in SLE and RA patients C. T cell proliferation assay

      Specific Aim 2. Study effects of DcR3 on activation-induced cell death (AICD) in SLE and RA
      In order to understand whether DcR3 could reduce the AICD in activated T cells in SLE and RA
      patients, the T cells from these patients will be assayed their AICD in the presence and
      absence of soluble DcR3-Fc.

      Specific Aim 3. To investigate the association of clinical manifestation of SLE and RA with
      genetic polymorphism on DcR3 genes.

      A. The gene sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of DcR3 genes.

      B. The association of clinical manifestation of SLE and RA with genetic polymorphism on DcR3
      genes.
