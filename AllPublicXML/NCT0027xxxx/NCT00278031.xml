  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the quality of life of children who have been cured of
      retinoblastoma - a malignant eye tumor. The study is questionnaire-based, and uses
      standardized quality of life assessment tools.

    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma is the most common eye tumor of children. It can present in one eye
      (unilateral) or in both eyes (bilateral). The bilateral form is always hereditary.

      Retinoblastoma is a highly curable tumor. Using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy,
      radiation and local treatment modalities to the eye, over 98% of patients are cured. This
      means that most children diagnosed with retinoblastoma will become long-term survivors.

      The use of surgery (taking out one eye), chemotherapy, and radiation may be associated with
      long term side-effects, some of which may have significant impact on the quality of life of
      the child. In addition, in case where the disease is hereditary, additional psychological
      issues arise.

      The aim of our study is to assess, in a comprehensive and standardized fashion, the long term
      quality of life in children who were treated for retinoblastoma, and who are currently alive
      and well.

      The assessment will include the use of questionnaires that assess quality of life, as well as
      participation in age-appropriate activities.

      Each child, and his/her parent, will be interviewed and the questionnaires completed. The
      process will take about one hour for each child. No risk or discomfort to the child is
      involved.
