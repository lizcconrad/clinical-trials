  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the more common cancers in the United States with over
      145,000 new cases expected in 2005. Surgery is the main treatment for CRC. However for some
      who relapse after surgery, or are unable to have surgery, chemotherapy is the primary
      treatment for this more advanced CRC. Some chemotherapy drugs are given to the patient by
      themselves, but many are given in combination with other chemotherapy treatment drugs and
      they seem to work better together than by themselves. This study will investigate the
      effectiveness of the combination of three chemotherapy drugs in patients who have been
      previously treated for their CRC and it has returned. This study will also evaluate any rash
      that is associated with the drug Cetuximab. The three therapy drugs are Mitomycin C,
      Irinotecan, and Cetuximab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a phase II trial which combines mitomycin C, irinotecan and cetuximab in patients
      with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer with wild type non mutated K-Ras. The
      goals of this investigation are to develop an effective systemic therapy for previously
      treated patients with CRC with wild type K-Ras, to further explore the relationship of
      mitomycin C induced topoisomerase 1 gene expression and response to irinotecan, and to define
      and characterize the biology of cetuximab induced skin rash.

    <description>The primary objective of this single-arm phase II study is to determine the response rate (Percentage patients with Complete Response (CR) + Percentage of patients with Partial Response (PR)) for the combination of mitomycin C, irinotecan, and cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer with wild type K-Ras. Complete response will be defined as the disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease for at least 4 weeks without the appearance of new lesions. Partial response will be defined as a decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions by at least 30% for at least 4 weeks without the appearance of any new lesions.</description>

Patients will receive irinotecan 140 mg/m2 as a 90 minute infusion on days 1 and 15 of each 28 day cycle after cetuximab infusion. Patients found to be homozygous for UGT1A1*28 allele will receive irinotecan 110 mg/m2.</description>
