    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is disease believed to be due to immune cells, cells which normally
      protect the body, but are now attacking the tissue in the brain and possibly the spinal cord.
      The likelihood of progression of this disease is high. This study is designed to examine
      whether treating patients with high dose cyclophosphamide and CAMPATH-1H (drugs which reduce
      the function of the immune system) followed by return of previously collected blood stem
      cells will stop the progression of your multiple sclerosis. Stem cells are undeveloped cells
      that have the capacity to grow into mature blood cells, which normally circulate in the blood
      stream. The purpose of the cyclophosphamide and CAMPATH-1H is to destroy the cells in your
      immune system which are thought to be causing your disease. The purpose of the stem cell
      infusion is to restore the body's blood production, which will be severely impaired by the
      high dose chemotherapy and to produce a normal immune system that will no longer attack the
      body.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 18-50, inclusive.

          2. Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using Poser criteria (Appendix A).

          3. An Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 2.0 - 5.5 (Appendix B).

          4. Inflammatory disease despite primary disease modifying therapy with at least 3 months
             of interferon. Failure is defined as two or more clinical relapses with documented
             neurologic changes within the year prior to the study. (NOTE: Relapses must have
             required treatment with corticosteroids. Sensory only relapses are excluded.) Failure
             may also be defined as one relapse within the year prior to study if there is evidence
             on MRI of active inflammation (i.e., gadolinium enhancement).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any illness that in the opinion of the investigators would jeopardize the ability of
             the patient to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy.

          2. Prior history of malignancy except localized basal cell, squamous skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Other malignancies for which the patient is judged to
             be cured, such as head and neck cancer, or breast cancer will be considered on an
             individual basis.

          3. Positive pregnancy test.

          4. Inability or unwillingness to pursue effective means of birth control. Effective birth
             control is defined as 1) refraining from all acts of vaginal intercourse (ABSTINENCE);
             2) consistent use of birth control pills; 3) injectable birth control methods
             (Depo-provera, Norplant); 4) tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone
             vasectomy; 5) placement of an intrauterine device (IUD); or 6) use, with every act of
             intercourse, of diaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive
             foam.

          5. Failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a side effect of
             therapy.

          6. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) / forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 60% of
             predicted after bronchodilator therapy (if necessary).

          7. Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 50% of predicted.

          8. Resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50 %.

          9. Bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl.

         10. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl.

         11. Known hypersensitivity to mouse, rabbit, or E. Coli derived proteins, or to iron
             compounds/medications.

         12. Presence of metallic objects implanted in the body that would preclude the ability of
             the patient to safely have MRI exams.

         13. Diagnosis of primary progressive multipole sclerosis (MS).

         14. Platelet count &lt; 100,000/ul.

         15. Psychiatric illness, mental deficiency or cognitive dysfunction making compliance with
             treatment or informed consent impossible.

         16. Active infection except asymptomatic bacteruria.

After neutrophil recovery, the mobilised cells were collected by apheresis. The recovered cells were unselected and cryopreserved. There was at least three weeks between mobilisation and the conditioning regimen. The conditioning regimen used was 200 mg per kg intravenous CY , given in four equal fractions between day -5 and day -2 with IV mesna, and one 20mg dose of IV alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H) given on day -2 with 250 mg intravenous methyl-prednisolone as premedication. Alemtuzumab was changed to rabbit antithymocyte globulin rATG) in the last 4 patients, who received 6 mg per kg rATG over 5 days instead of alemtuzumab . Stem cells wer reinfused 36 h after completion of CY. 5 µg/kg/day filgrastim was given from day 5 until neutrophil recovery.</description>
