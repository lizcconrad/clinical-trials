  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and education groups on
      HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome) infection. Key outcomes include CD4 and viral load,
      stress hormones, depression and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress and depression are associated with more rapid loss of CD4 cells in HIV infection.
      Interventions that slow the advance of HIV infection and delay the introduction of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) could make an important contribution to HIV management in both
      the developed and developing world. We are conducting a 330 person randomized, controlled
      clinical trial of MBSR for persons with HIV-1 infection and CD4 T-lymphocyte counts &gt; 250
      cells/Âµm who are not on antiretroviral therapy. Participants are randomized in a 1:1
      distribution to either the MBSR intervention or to an education group that will control for
      the attention and social interaction aspects of MBSR. Participants are evaluated at 0, 3, 6
      and 12 months. Key outcome measures at 12 months include differences in CD4 T cell counts,
      HIV viral load, perceived stress, depression, and positive affect. We are also examining
      whether MBSR is associated with changes in neuroendocrine function (autonomic nervous system
      activity, cortisol secretion) and alterations in immune function that may serve as
      intermediate steps between the neuroendocrine effects of MBSR and CD4 T cell counts, such as
      changes in T cell activation. A subset of 90 participants will be studied in additional
      detail using a structured laboratory stress challenge.

    <measure>Change in Depression as Measured by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI is a widely used outcome measure for studies of depression. The BDI consists of 21 items that are rated on a 4-point scale according to how severely they are experienced. Scores range from 0-63, with higher scores reflecting greater depression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress as Measured by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of stress was measured with the 10-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale. This widely used measure of perceived stress was designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. Participants rate how often they felt or thought a certain way over the past month on a 4-point scale (0 = Never, 4 = Very Often). Scores range from 0-40, with higher scores reflecting greater perceived stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect (PANAS) Positive Affect (PA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion was assessed with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The PANAS measures intensity of positive and negative emotions over the past week. The scale consists of 20 items--10 positive and 10 negative emotions. Respondents are asked to indicate how strongly they felt each emotion on a scale from 0 to 4 (not at all to extremely). The Positive Affect (PA) score is derived from summing the scores on the 10 positive emotions. Scores on the PA subscale range from 0-40, with higher scores reflecting more positive affect over the past week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) Negative Affect (NA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion was assessed with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS\). The PANAS measures intensity of positive and negative emotions over the past week. The scale consists of 20 items--10 positive and 10 negative emotions. Respondents are asked to indicate how strongly they felt each emotion on a scale from 0 to 4 (not at all to extremely). The Negative Affect (NA) score is derived from summing the scores on the 10 negative emotions. Scores on the NA subscale range from 0-40, with higher scores reflecting more negative affect over the past week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression as Measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We used the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as a measure of depressive symptom severity. The PHQ-9 is the depression module of the self-administered version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) diagnostic instrument. Participants rate the frequency of 9 depression symptoms over the past 2 weeks from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores reflecting greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

This widely used measure of perceived stress was designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. Participants rate how often they felt or thought a certain way over the past month on a 4-point scale (0 = Never, 4 = Very Often). Scores range from 0-40, with higher scores reflecting greater perceived stress.</description>

The scale consists of 20 items--10 positive and 10 negative emotions. Respondents are asked to indicate how strongly they felt each emotion on a scale from 0 to 4 (not at all to extremely). The Positive Affect (PA) score is derived from summing the scores on the 10 positive emotions. Scores on the PA subscale range from 0-40, with higher scores reflecting more positive affect over the past week.</description>
