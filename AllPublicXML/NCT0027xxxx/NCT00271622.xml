      This study will screen children and adolescents (and their parents) to determine the child's
      eligibility for participation in NIMH research studies on autism spectrum disorders, such as
      autism and Rett's Disorder.

      Screening evaluations include some or all of the following procedures:

      Parent interview

      Parent and child evaluations including:

        -  Diagnostic interview

        -  Developmental or cognitive testing

        -  Ratings of psychiatric and medical symptoms

        -  Neuropsychological testing

        -  Personal, social an family history

      Child physical examination and possible blood draw

      Children who are determined eligible for a current NIMH research protocol are invited to
      participate.

      The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the careful evaluation of healthy volunteers and
      individuals with psychiatric disorders or neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism
      spectrum disorders. The evaluations will help determine if the participant meets criteria for
      participation in research protocols of the Pediatric and Developmental Neuroscience Branch
      (PDN) at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and other collaborative
      investigations. This protocol will be the entry point for PDN investigations. Since the entry
      criteria for these protocols vary, the screening evaluations will also vary. Behavioral
      evaluations will also be done through this protocol for individuals participating in
      IRB-approved protocols being conducted by collaborating scientists in NIH. The evaluations
      might include: a psychiatric interview; a diagnostic interview; developmental and/or
      cognitive testing; ratings of other psychiatric symptoms; neuropsychological testing; a
      medical history; a physical exam; blood; and a request for medical records. Parents of minors
      will be interviewed. Upon conclusion of the screening process, subjects seeking eligibility
      for PDN protocols will either be offered participation in a research protocol and will sign
      the appropriate informed consent, or will be considered not appropriate for participation in
      research and will be discharged from the protocol.
