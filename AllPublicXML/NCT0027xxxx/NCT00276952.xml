      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Gonyautoxin 2/3 epimers in
      the treatment of patients diagnosed with chronic tensional-type headache in accordance with
      International Headache Society guidelines

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gonyautoxin are phycotoxins, whose molecular mechanism of action is a reversible block of the
      voltage-gated sodium channels at neuronal level. They are axonal conduction blockers impeding
      nerve impulse propagation. In order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Gonyautoxin 2/3
      epimers in the treatment of patients diagnosed with chronic tensional-type headache, the
      patients were locally injected with placebo versus Gonyautoxin following a painful spots
      injection standarized protocol
