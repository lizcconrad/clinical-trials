  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flaxseed, a phytoestrogen, is a natural food supplement rich in plant ligands, which have a
      very weak estrogen effect. In this study, flaxseed is being evaluated in regard to its
      capacity to safely and effectively treat hot flashes. Specifically, this study seeks to
      determine if flaxseed will lower the number and severity of hot flashes and if women
      experience any side effects from taking flaxseed for this purpose.
