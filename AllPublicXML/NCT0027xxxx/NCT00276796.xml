      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, topotecan, and cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with topotecan
      and cisplatin works in treating patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent cervical
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Estimate the antitumor activity of the combination of paclitaxel, topotecan, and
           cisplatin in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity for this drug regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

        -  Determine the impact of prior chemoradiation on response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by topotecan IV over 30 minutes and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Advanced, persistent, or recurrent squamous or nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the
             cervix with documented disease progression

               -  Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required

          -  Disease must be measurable in at least one dimension by conventional techniques,
             including palpation, plain x-ray, CT scan, or MRI

               -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately
                  measured

               -  Each lesion must be ≥ 20 mm by conventional techniques or ≥ 10 mm by spiral CT
                  scan

               -  Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as &quot;non-target&quot;
                  lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm
                  persistence ≥ 90 days after completion of radiation therapy

          -  No prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs for advanced or recurrent cervical carcinoma

               -  Prior cisplatin as a radiosensitizer for primary treatment of disease allowed

          -  No previous cancer treatment that contraindicates study treatment
