      -  The primary objective of the present study is to verify the superiority of Telecare
           program vs. standard SMBG program in terms of mean HbA1c value (- 0,5%) at end-point.

        -  The secondary objectives of the study are the assessment of: total daily dose of
           insulin, changes in glycaemic and lipid profile, frequency of hypoglycaemias, changes in
           weight, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness of Telecare program vs.
           common ambulatory program; general safety (adverse event profile, other routine
           laboratory parameters).
