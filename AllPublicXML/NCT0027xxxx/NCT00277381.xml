  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treating hypertension is known to decrease morbidity and mortality. Despite this 70% of
      patients do not have adequately controlled blood pressure. The main reason for this is
      non-adherence to recommended drug therapy. Although strategies have been developed to improve
      adherence many are time consuming and expensive. We propose to use communications technology
      to develop a novel means of improving adherence to antihypertensive therapy. We will conduct
      a randomised, single-blinded, controlled study to assess the impact of a real-time, automated
      reminder system on adherence rates. This will involve adapting two pieces of currently
      available technology - the electronic pill bottle and the Ambient Globe. The Globe will
      change colour in response to information received, via a wireless link, from the patient's
      electronic pill bottle. We hypothesise that this will provide patients with an up to date,
      but unobtrusive, reminder of their adherence status and thus effect positive behavioural
      change. We will measure the impact of this intervention on adherence rates as well as
      assessing patient views and the impact on provider workload. This trial will elucidate the
      role of communications technology in improving adherence behaviour and allow us to develop
      further strategies to tackle this major health issue.
