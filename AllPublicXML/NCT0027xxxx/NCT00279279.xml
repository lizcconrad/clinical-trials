      The purpose of this study is to test specific device programming in patients without a
      previous history of a life-threatening, abnormally fast heartbeat who are implanted with a
      Medtronic ICD (Implantable Cardioconverter Defibrillator) or ICD with CRT (Cardiac
      Resynchronozation Therapy) device. The information learned from this study could be used to
      guide physicians in future ICD or CRT device programming.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient is a candidate for a non-replacement Medtronic ICD device from the Marquis family
        or has had a non-replacement Medtronic Marquis based ICD system implanted within the
        previous 6 months and has not had any appropriately treated spontaneous VT/VF episodes
        during that time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient has history of spontaneous sustained symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias.

        If patient has had an electrophysiology test in the past, and has sustained inducible VT
