  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether the combination of inhaled
      amiloride and a concentrated salt solution is better than the salt solution itself for cystic
      fibrosis (CF) patients. In CF, airway secretions are thick and dehydrated. Many patients use
      inhaled salt solutions to help draw water into their secretions so that they are easier to
      get rid of with chest physiotherapy (“chest PT”) and cough. Unfortunately, these salt
      solutions are reabsorbed very quickly by the airways, so the beneficial effects may not last
      very long. In the hopes of prolonging their effects, the drug amiloride could be used in
      combination to slow salt and water reabsorption from airways. Amiloride is a medication that
      has been given by mouth for high blood pressure for many years. It is possible that the
      combination of salt solutions and inhaled amiloride may significantly improve the clearance
      of secretions in CF, which would be expected to improve lung function in CF.
