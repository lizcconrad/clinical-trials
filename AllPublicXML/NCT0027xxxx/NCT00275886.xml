  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogen that infects over half of the world population.
      Infection initiates a series of changes in the gastric mucosa, beginning with gastritis and
      leading in some patients to peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphomas, and gastric
      adenocarcinoma. It is believed that host factors, in particular, the T cell-mediated immune
      responses may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases induced by H. pylori
      infection. Recent results revealed that there were higher IFN-γ secreting cells in gastric
      infiltrating T cells isolated from H. pylori infected patients than in uninfected patients,
      suggesting that the TH1 response and degree of IFN-γ production is associated with disease
      severity. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that apoptosis of the gastric epithelium is
      increased during infection and this response is associated with an expansion of gastric
      T-helper type 1 (Th1) cells. In this project, we are trying to further investigate role of
      host T cell mediated immune response in pathogenesis of Helicobacter infection by
      characterization of the expression of chemokine receptors on gastric infiltrating
      lymphocytes. We are going to investigate the mechanisms involving in chemokine/chemokine
      receptor interaction in recruitment of gastric infiltrating lymphocytes and pathogenesis of
      gastric mucosa damage in Helicobacter infection. This study will be helpful for understanding
      the mechanisms of activation and recruitment of gastric-infiltrating lymphocytes during
      gastric inflammation.

      Specific Aim #1: Characterization of the gastric infiltrating T cells from H. pylori
      gastritis patients A. Patients H. pylori infected gastritis and asymptomatic patients are
      selected from National Taiwan University hospital. The gastric biopsy specimen are taken from
      endoscopic biopsy in routine health check up or panendoscopic examination for the despeptic
      patients. HP negative gastritis patients will also be studied for negative control.

      B. Immunohistochemical identification of T cells and expression of chemokine receptors.

      Specific Aim #2 . Isolation and characterization of chemokines and chemokine receptors of the
      infiltrating lymphocytes in H. pylori-associated gastritis tissue

      A. Isolation of gastric infiltrating lymphocyte B. Identification of the expression of
      chemokine receptor in gastric infiltrating lymphocytes by flow cytometry C. Detection of
      expression of chemokines in gastric tissues
