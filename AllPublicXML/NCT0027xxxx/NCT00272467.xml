  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ulcer healing efficacy of rebamipide in
      comparison with omeprazole in Helicobacter pylori-positive gastric ulcer after eradication
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the ulcer healing efficacy of rebamipide administered
      following the eradication therapy in comparison with the well known PPI, omeprazole. This is
      a double-blind, comparative study which is expected to prove the role of rebamipide in
      gastric ulcer healing after the eradication therapy. This study may contribute to further
      clinical research on a new type of ulcer treatment by looking at the treatment modality based
      on the enhancement of defensive factors.
