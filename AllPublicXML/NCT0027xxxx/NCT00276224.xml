      The objectives of this study is:

        -  to establish the coverage rate of weekly iron supplementation in children in
           intervention schools over a period of nine months

        -  document any side effects of weeekly iron supplementation among children in intervention
           schools over a period of nine months asses the feasibility of incorporating the weekly
           iron supplementation programme into the normal school activity in intervention schools
           determine the extent of acceptability and support for the iron supplementation programme
           by staff at the health centre nearest to the intervention schools

        -  compare the praziquantel efficacy and schistosomiasis reinfection in children in
           intervention schools with that of children in control schools following the introduction
           of weekely iron supplementation over a period of nine months

        -  determine the impact of weekly iron supplementation on haemoglobin levels of children in
           intervention schools and compare with children in control schools over a period of nine
           months

    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia is a common denominator for both schistosomiasis and soil transmitted
      helminths. Iron deficiency appears to affect the immune response against schistosomes and
      intestinal helminths. It therefore follows that correcting the iron deficiency anaemia will
      improve the efficacy of anthelminthics such as praziquantel (against schistosomiasis) and
      albendazol (against soil transmitted helminths) and ability of the host immune system to
      resist reinfection with schistosomes and soil transmitted helminths.

      The aim of this study is to identify factors necessary for a successful weekly iron
      supplementation programme in schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminths control
      programmes. In addition impact of weekly iron supplementation programme n haemoglobin levels,
      efficacy of praziquantel, and schistosomiasis re-infection will be studied.
