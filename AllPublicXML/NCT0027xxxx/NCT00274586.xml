      Tolerability of a four weeks treatment with Aggrenox速 modified release capsules b.i.d,
      compared to reduced dose during the first two weeks of treatment in a double-blind,
      randomized controlled parallel group comparison trial among Taiwanese patients with previous
      TIA's or ischemic stroke.To monitor frequency and intensity of headaches and other safety
      parameters among Taiwanese patients with previous TIA's or ischemic stroke given Aggrenox
      using a titration scheme or not

      The major objective of the study is to evaluate the tolerance of headache and safety in
      Taiwan Taiwanese patients who are receiving two different dosing regimens of Aggrenox and
      Aggrenox placebo. The first group will start with placebo on days 1-4, daily dose on days
      5-14, and following by b.i.d treatment on 15-28 days. This group will also receive a matching
      placebo in the morning and one Aggrenox capsule in the evening before on days 5-14. It
      enables to reduce the perception of dipyridamole-associated headache. The second group will
      receive the placebo twice daily on days 1-4, and medication twice daily for the remaining
      course. The third group will receive the placebo twice daily for the whole course.

      Study Hypothesis:

      NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES

      From a subject diary, asking for the most frequent side effects observed in the ESPS2 trial,
      the cumulative headache (intensity x frequency) per day based on the first three days of
      treatment period defines the primary endpoint.

      I: H0: Median cumulative headache is equal for all treatment groups vs. HA: Median cumulative
      headache is not equal for all treatment groups

      II: H0: Median cumulative headache of low dose regimen?Median cumulative headache of regular
      dose vs. HA: Median cumulative headache of low dose regimen &lt; Median cumulative headache of
      regular dose

      Comparison(s):

      Compare Aggrenox full dose, reduced dose and placebo
