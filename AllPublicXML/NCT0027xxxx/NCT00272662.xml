      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple subcutaneously administered injections of peginesatide in
      anemic cancer participants receiving chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, open-label, multi-center, sequential dose finding study with up to 6
      treatment cohorts receiving chemotherapy with 15 participants per cohort. The primary
      objective of this study was to determine the dose of peginesatide administered every 3 weeks
      (Q3W) by subcutaneous injection associated with a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1 g/dL in ≥ 50% of
      anemic cancer participants receiving chemotherapy at 9 weeks following the first dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is informed of the investigational nature of this study and has given
