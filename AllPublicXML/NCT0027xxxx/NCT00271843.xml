    <textblock>
      This study evaluates multi-attribute utility, a modification of subjective expected utility,
      as a descriptive model of the adolescent's decision to initiate smoking or alcohol use.
      According to the model, the young decision maker envisions a set of consequences that will
      follow the two decision options, either to continue as a non-user or to initiate usage. Each
      consequence has three components. The components are the worth of the consequence, which may
      be positive or negative, the judged likelihood that the consequence will happen, and the
      importance of the consequence. Within an individual, importances will change with mood or
      circumstance, which is how the model accounts for impulsive decisions that may occur in
      social settings.

      The model will be tested by eliciting components of ten independent consequences from a large
      group of students early in the seventh-grade year. Current usage will also be examined;
      extant data suggest that most students will be non-users at that time. It is known that a
      fair amount of initiation takes place during the seventh and eighth grade years. The
      hypothesis is that those non-users whose model scores are high will be more likely to
      initiate usage than those whose scores are low. The same students will be queried regarding
      usage eighteen months later to evaluate the hypothesis.

      It is now well known that differential knowledge regarding the harmful effects of drug use
      does not distinguish adolescent users from non-users. The model approach quantifies the idea
      that anticipated positive consequences play a prominent role in the decision of those who
      choose to initiate. An important implication is that prevention campaigns might profit by
      addressing positive as well as negative consequences of usage.
