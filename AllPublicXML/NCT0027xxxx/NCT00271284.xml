      ·Main objective: To compare the variability of fasting capillary blood glucose concentration,
      observed with insulin glargine combined with insulin glulisine and with insulin detemir
      combined with insulin glulisine, in type 1 diabetics. It is a non-inferiority study.

      ·Secondary objectives:

      Efficacy:

        -  To compare the variability of blood glucose concentration before the evening meal,
           observed with insulin glargine combined with insulin glulisine and with insulin detemir
           combined with insulin glulisine, in type 1 diabetics.

        -  To record the intra- and inter-daily variability using the MAGE and MODD indices
           [1,2,3,4]

        -  To compare the glycaemic profiles (7 points)

        -  To evaluate the HbA1c concentration, at the end of each period of treatment, weight
           change, the dose of insulin used and the number of daily injections.

      Tolerance:

        -  To record undesirable events

        -  To evaluate the safety in use from the record of episodes of hypoglycaemia (symptomatic,
           diurnal, nocturnal, severe).

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  Belonging to a social security scheme or covered by such a scheme

          -  With type 1 diabetes (defined as a concentration of C-peptide &lt; 0.1 nmol//l and a
             fasting blood glucose of &gt;= 1.26 g/l), diagnosed not less than 5 years previously

          -  Treated for at least 6 months by intensive insulin treatment, following a basal-bolus
             system, using insulin glargine (Lantus®) as basal insulin. During the study, this
             insulin will administered in the evening

          -  Trained in the titration of prandial insulin (the dose of rapid insulin decided at
             each mealtime depending on the composition of the meal)

          -  With an HbA1c level of &lt;= 8.5% at the inclusion visit

          -  Capable of checking their blood glucose concentration using the material supplied by
             the sponsor: blood glucose meter and patient notebook

          -  Able to eat 3 regular daily meals on the days for recording the blood glucose cycle
             and similarly as much as possible on other days throughout the length of the study

          -  Able to continue their usual daily activities during the study

          -  Women of child-bearing potential should be using an effective method of contraception

             insulin glulisine) or to one of the excipients present in the insulin preparations,
             used in the study

          -  Working at night

             incapable of attending monitoring visits and probably incapable of finishing the
             trial)

          -  Subject deprived of his liberty because of an administrative or legal decision
