  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design,
      exploratory study of orally administered ERB-041 in subjects with active IC. The primary
      objectives of this study will be to investigate ERB-041’s activity on levels of urinary APF,
      explore the gene expression response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and to
      evaluate the safety of ERB-041 in women with active IC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects seeking medical treatment for symptoms consistent with IC that have been
             ongoing for &gt; 9 months or seeking medical treatment for a previous documented
             diagnosis of IC

          -  Subjects who are not surgically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic &gt; 12 months)
             must agree and commit to the use of a medically acceptable, highly–effective (i.e.
             double-barrier or IUD), non-hormonal form of birth control during the study and for 30
             days after the last dose of test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of herbal supplements (except for a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement not
             containing herbal components)

          -  History of cancer (other than resected cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinoma or
             in situ cervical cancer) with less than 5 years documentation of a disease-free state

          -  Vaginitis or vaginal infection within 1 month before randomization
