      RATIONALE: Questionnaires that measure quality of life may improve the ability to plan
      treatment for patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying quality of life in patients who have undergone
      previous treatment for primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the quality of survival of patients in the UK and other European countries
           enrolled in previous International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) 2 or 3 phase III
           trials for treatment of pediatric primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET).

        -  Compare the quality of survival between children allocated to different treatments in
           these trials.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the framework that will allow similar information to be collected across all
           participating countries in the PNET 4 trial that opened in autumn 2002.

      OUTLINE: This is a cross-sectional, multicenter study.

      Pediatric oncologists, teachers, patients â‰¥ 12 years old, and parents of children age 3-11
      years old complete six questionnaires to assess the patients' motor and sensory function,
      cognition, behavior, emotion, educational provision and achievement, social integration, and
      the subjective experience of the patients and their families.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 229 patients will be accrued for this study.
