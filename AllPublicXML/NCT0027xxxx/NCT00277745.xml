      This study is being conducted to test the ability and accuracy of a new instrument in the
      diagnosis of periodontitis (gum disease) by using fluids from the mouth. The diagnosis
      instrument will test two types of fluids, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva. GCF is
      the fluid that accumulates between your teeth and gum tissue. The fluids will be collected in
      three ways: 1. Direct GCF sampling 2. GCF rinse sampling and 3. Whole saliva. A total of 100
      adult patients will participate in this study. These subjects will be of two patient
      populations: 1) diseased population, with active gum disease; and 2) a low-risk disease
      population, with no active gum disease. Patients will be seen 6 times over the course of the
      study over a period of approximately 12 months. At each visit the patient will undergo oral
      fluid collection, as previously described, and thorough examinations of the mouth, including
      the taking of measurements for study purposes. Patients will also have radiographs taken at
      baseline, month 6, and end of study visits.

      The ultimate goal of this investigation is to validate the ability of the prototype platform
      (miniaturized microfluidic device that can rapidly (within 15 minutes) measure small volumes
      of oral fluids (on the order of nanoliters of fluid) and identify biomarkers of disease such
      as mediators of inflammation (interleukins -1 and -6; C-reactive protein (CRP), and a marker
      of bone resorption (ICTP). This analysis will aid in the diagnosis of active periodontal
      (gum) disease as well as diseases involved in systemic inflammation (e.g., cardiovascular
      disease) or systemic bone loss (osteoporosis). This project will have two specific goals: 1.
      To validate the ability of the diagnostic to measure the designated mediators from oral
      fluids; and 2. Determine the ability of the multiplexed format of mediator analysis to
      predict disease activity (future bone loss) in patients at high and low risk for disease.
      This proposed feasibility study will then aid in providing the impetus for sample size and
      other design requirements for larger, more expanded human clinical trial testing and
      subsequent technology transfer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must possess at least 20 teeth and not have received periodontal treatment or
             antibiotic-related therapy for medical or dental reasons 3 months prior to study
             inclusion.

          -  Low-risk inclusion: &lt; 3 mm of attachment loss, no pockets &gt; 4 mm, possess no
             radiographic bone loss, and &lt; 20 sites with bleeding on probing (BOP). Low-risk cohort
             will be comprised of at least &gt; 50% of the subjects above age 35 in order to exam low
             risk patients in other age strata (so as to decrease potential bias towards a younger
             population in the low risk cohort).

          -  Disease-susceptible inclusion: Exhibit at least 4 sites with evidence of radiographic
             bone loss, mean attachment loss &gt; 3 mm, pocket depths (PD) &gt; 4 mm and BOP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Long-term use of medications known to affect periodontal status such as
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS and aspirins)

          -  History of metabolic bone diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or post-menopausal
             osteoporosis.
