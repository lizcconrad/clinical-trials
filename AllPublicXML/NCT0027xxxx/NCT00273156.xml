  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel and exploratory nature of this intervention relates to the concept of incorporating
      patient-specific oral health information obtained during a dental hygiene visit into the
      tobacco quitline counseling. Linking the patient-specific oral health information obtained
      during the dental hygiene visit to the tobacco quitline counseling will close the therapeutic
      loop for oral health professionals and make them a focal point for the tobacco use
      intervention without increasing clinical burden.

      The overarching hypothesis of this line of research is: A brief office intervention with
      proactive tobacco quitline counseling incorporating patient-specific oral health information
      obtained during a dental hygiene visit (intervention) will increase prolonged abstinence
      rates from cigarette smoking compared to a brief office intervention alone (control) at 3 and
      6 months.To test our overarching hypothesis in a Phase III clinical trial, we are first
      seeking R21 funding through the NIDCR Clinical Pilot Data Grant (PAR-03-043) mechanism. This
      R21 funding will be used to refine the design of dental clinic staff training, study
      implementation, and data collection procedures, to optimize the design of the definitive
      trial, and to test and document recruitment and data collection mechanisms.

      The specific aims of this R21 proposal are:

        1. To design and refine preconceived models of training format, study implementation, and
           intervention through focus groups with dentists and dental hygienists.

        2. To define and refine study implementation, the referral process, recruitment, and data
           collection strategies and protocols through the sequential engagement of dental
           practices in active patient enrollment in a nonrandomized feasibility testing process.

        3. To develop a working Manual of Procedures (MOP) for a future Phase III clinical trial.

      The feasibility study will be conducted through private practice dental clinics surrounding
      the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. We are planning for a multicenter Phase III clinical trial
      involving private practice dental clinics in the communities surrounding Rochester, MN, and
      Indianapolis, IN, in collaboration with the Indiana University Nicotine Dependence Program.
