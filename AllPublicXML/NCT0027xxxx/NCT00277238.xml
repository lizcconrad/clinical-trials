      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and tolerability of CPG 10101 at two
      different dose levels with pegylated-interferon-alpha 2B (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV)
      compared to PEG-IFN and RBV without CPG 10101 in HCV positive subjects who were classified as
      non-responders to previous adequate PEG-IFN plus RBV therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        HCV positive subjects documented by serum HCV RNA concentration &gt; 100,000 IU/mL within 21
        days of first study treatment Receipt of adequate previous PEG-IFN and RBV therapy for a
        minimum of 12 weeks (PEG-IFN alpha-2a doses of &gt; 180 μg/wk or PEG-IFN alpha-2b 1.5 µg/kg/wk
        and at least 800 mg RBV daily) not resulting in a minimum of a 2 log decrease in HCV RNA
        concentrations while on treatment (null responders). Or, receipt of adequate previous
        treatment PEG-IFN and RBV therapy for a minimum of 24 weeks (PEG-IFN alpha-2a doses of ≥
        180 μg/wk or PEG-IFN alpha-2b 1.5 µg/kg/wk and at least 800 mg RBV daily) resulting in a
        minimum of a 2 log decrease in serum HCV RNA concentrations by 12 weeks of treatment but
        not resulting in an undetectable viral load after 24 weeks of treatment (partial
        responders). If dose modifications were necessary during the treatment due to adverse
        events, the subject must have received at least 80% of the PEG-IFN dose and 80% of the RBV
        dose to be eligible for the study.

        HCV genotype 1 only; other HCV genotypes are excluded. Adults, 18+ years old Written
        informed consent Liver biopsy within 5 years of the first dose of study drug, documenting
        changes consistent with hepatitis C

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 12 g/dL for females and &gt; 13 g/dL for males

          -  White blood cell (WBC) &gt; 3,000/mm3

          -  Neutrophils &gt; 1,500/mm3

             is &gt; upper limit of normal then calculated creatinine clearance has to be &gt; 100 mL/min
             (by Cockcroft-Gault formula) for patient to be eligible.

        Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential. Females of childbearing
        potential and males who have partners of childbearing potential must use two forms of
        effective contraception during treatment and during the 6 months after treatment has been
        concluded.

        suitable for treatment.

        Significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 3
        congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; unstable angina;
        coronary angioplasty within the past 6 months; or uncontrolled atrial or ventricular
        cardiac arrhythmias) History of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease including autoimmune
        hepatitis, allogeneic transplant, or pre-existing autoimmune or antibody-mediated disease
        including, but not limited to: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
        sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, or autoimmune thrombocytopenia.

        Other serious medical conditions including, but not limited to:

          -  HIV-1

          -  Hepatitis B (positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg])

             (inhaled and topical corticosteroids are permitted).

        Receipt of any vaccine or immunoglobulin within 30 days before the first dose of study
        drug. Flu vaccines are only allowed once the subjects are qualified for 36 additional weeks
        of treatment.

        Prior administration of oligodeoxynucleotides (including study medication CPG 10101),
        ribozymes, or any known allergy to CPG 10101, interferon, RVN or their excipients.

        Receipt of any investigational drug therapy within 30 days before the first dose of study
        drug.

        Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise the safety or
        compliance of the subject or would preclude the subject from successful completion of the
        study.
