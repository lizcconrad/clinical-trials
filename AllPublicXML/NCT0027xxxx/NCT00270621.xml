  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Strongest Families (formerly Family Help Program)is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the Strongest Families distance intervention compared to usual or standard
      care that is typically provided to children with mild to moderate Enuresis diagnoses. This is
      a single-centre trial based at the IWK Health Centre. The primary outcome is change in
      diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Family Help Program is to deliver, primary care mental health services to
      children and their families in the comfort and privacy of their own home. Approximately 46
      children (5-12 years of age)suffering from pediatric enuresis (at least 2 times a week) will
      be randomized.

      The intervention is delivered from a distance, using the urine alarm system accompanied by
      educational materials (manuals, video-tapes, audio-tapes) and telephone consultation with a
      trained paraprofessional &quot;coach&quot; who is supervised by a licensed health care professional.
      The telephone coach delivers consistent care based on written protocols, with on-going
      evaluation by a professional team.

      Fifty percent of the eligible participants will receive Family Help Program telephone-based
      treatment and 50% will be referred back to their family physician to receive standard care as
      determined by that physician. Those receiving standard care will be evaluated for outcome
      results and then compared to the Family Help treated participants. It is anticipated that
      Family Help treatment will be proven to be as or more effective than standard care.
