      Effects of AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan on the primary endpoint inflammatory
      parameters in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Secondary endpoints are
      alterations in clinical course and blood pressure

      Methodology:

      Randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group design

      Planned/actual number of subjects:

      Enrolled: 40/50 randomised: 40/42 completed: 40/42

      Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

      Treated essential hypertension with a mean seated DBP/SBP smaller than 95 mmHg/160 mmHg,
      coronary artery disease confirmed by catheterization and age equal or greater than 18 years
      of age.

      Duration of treatment:

      12 weeks: telmisartan 40 mg or placebo 40 mg

      Study Hypothesis:

      The statistical null hypothesis is that in patients with CAD and mild-to-moderate
      hypertension, a 84-day therapy with 40 mg telmisartan causes changes in inflammatory and
      leukocyte adhesion parameters. The alternative hypothesis is that this therapy does not
      influence inflammatory and leukocyte adhesion parameters. This hypothesis is tested by the
      nonparametric Wilcoxon test for unpaired samples.

      Comparison(s):

      Placebo 40 mg

          3. &gt; 18 years of age

          4. Ability to stop current antihypertensive therapy with ACE inhibitors, angioten-sin II
             receptor antagonist or lipid lowering therapy with statins without risk to the patient
             in the run-in period of two to four weeks and during the study period.

          5. Ability to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute coronary syndromes.

          3. Symptomatic valvular heart disease.

          4. Inflammatory diseases (e.g., acute infection, rheumatic diseases, collagenosis).

          5. Pre-menopausal women (last menstruation &lt; 1 year prior to start of run-in period) who:

          6. Known or suspected secondary hypertension.

          7. Mean sitting SBP &gt; 160 mm Hg or mean sitting DBP &gt; 95 mm Hg during any visit.

          8. Hepatic and/or renal dysfunction as defined by the following laboratory parameters:

               -  SGPT(ALT) or SGOT(AST) &gt; than 2 times the upper limit of normal range .

             medication allowed by the protocol (cf. 4.2.1).

         19. Current participation in another trial, or participation in a trial within a period of
             one month.
