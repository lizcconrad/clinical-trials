      RATIONALE: Genistein may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Interleukin-2 may stimulate
      the white blood cells, including natural killer cells, to kill melanoma or kidney cancer
      cells. Giving genistein together with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving genistein together with
      interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma or kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Measure the differences in peak and duration of the expansion of circulating
           CD4-positive, CD8-positive, and CD4-, CD25-, and CD56-positive cells (dim and bright) at
           different time points during therapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone and plus genistein
           in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma or renal clear cell carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression following
           high-dose IL-2 with and without genistein and compare to baseline.

        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial and complete) in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes twice daily on days 1 and 15 and
      3 times daily on days 2-5 and 16-19. Patients also receive oral genistein twice daily on days
      10-19.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.

               -  If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic
                  nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology
