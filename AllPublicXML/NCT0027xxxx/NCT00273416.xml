  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess how effective PF-00592379 is in restoring penile
      erections in patients with erectile dysfunction. Patients will attend for 4 treatment visits
      where they will receive the following in random order; 2 separate doses of PF-00592379,
      sildenafil 100mg used as a positive control, or placebo (dummy medication). The effect on
      penile erections will be assessed in the clinic using penile plethysmography (RigiScan PlusTM
      technique).
