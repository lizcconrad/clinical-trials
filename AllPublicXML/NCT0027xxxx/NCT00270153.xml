  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is the leading cause of longterm renal transplant loss.
      Angiotensin-II may play a role in the development and progression of CAN. Angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) comprise a drug class that inhibit the effects of
      angiotensin-II. However these drugs have been reported to cause elevated potassium and
      creatinine levels in some renal transplant patients. Yet, there are now several retrospective
      reports of long term benefits of improved renal function and graft survival in renal
      transplant recipients. There have been no reports of prospective randomized controlled trials
      of ACEI in renal transplant patients in the early post transplant period.

      The purpose of the present study is to assess the safety of enalapril, a drug in the ACEI
      class, when started 1-3 month post transplant. This is a double-blinded, randomized control
      trial of enalapril vs. placebo in new renal transplant patients with serum creatinine values
      no higher than 2.5mg/dl and normal serum potassium levels. The study drug will be
      administered for 6 months. Patients will be monitored in the renal transplant clinic every
      1-4 weeks according to routine protocol. Clinical end-points will be occurence of potassium
      &gt;5.9mEQ/L or sustained increase in serum creatinine &gt;50% from baseline.

      All new renal transplant recipients with functioning allografts and serum creatinine less
      than 2.6 mg/dl within the first 3 month post transplant would be eligible for this study of
      the safety of enalapril 5 mg vs placebo. Patients with serum potassium persistently over 5.5
      mEQ/L would be excluded. This is a double-blinded randomized control study. End-points of the
      study are a persistent rise in serum creatinine of &gt;50% from baseline not otherwise explained
      by clinical evaluation, and persistent serum potassium &gt;5.9mEQ/L. Study duration is 6 month.
      At the end of the study patients will be continued on ACEI if clinically stable
