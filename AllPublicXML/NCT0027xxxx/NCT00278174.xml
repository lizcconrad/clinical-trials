      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth
      of kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well interferon alfa works in treating patients
      with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic renal clear cell
           carcinoma treated with interferon alfa-1b.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive interferon alfa-1b subcutaneously daily. Treatment continues in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
