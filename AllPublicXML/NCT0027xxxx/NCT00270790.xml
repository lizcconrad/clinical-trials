      Purpose of this study:

      There is some evidence that the best treatment for head and neck cancer involves a
      combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is a form of cancer
      treatment using high energy x-rays. Chemotherapy is a form of cancer treatment that uses
      special medications. This study uses two chemotherapy drugs (Taxol and Carboplatin), which
      are FDA approved for treating head and neck cancers. This treatment combination has been
      associated with difficulty, pain, or a burning sensation upon swallowing (called
      esophagitis), and decrease in blood cells (cells in the blood which fight against infection).
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of another drug, Amifostine,
      can reduce the side effects of current combination treatment (radiation and chemotherapy
      which is standard of care). The addition of Amifostine is the investigational part of the
      study. The research study is also looking at the side effects of Amifostine and cancer's
      growth response to this combination treatment.

    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck (SCCHN)
      continue to represent a significant therapeutic challenge. The bulk of tumor burden often
      proves to be overwhelming for conventional radiotherapy. Attempts to improve upon these poor
      outcomes have led investigators to explore several new strategies, one such being
      chemoradiation. One of the trials conducted at the University of Maryland with carboplatin
      and paclitaxel with daily radiation showed 82% CR at the primary site. But the most commonly
      encountered grade 3 toxicities were mucositis (70%), leukopenia (30%) and 3% grade 4
      leukopenia. Amifostine: An organic thiophosphate is radioprotective and has shown to protect
      experimental animals from lethal doses of radiation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that
      amifostine can provide protection against the hematological toxicities and mucositis seen
      with various chemotherapeutic agents. Theoretically, drug interactions between amifostine and
      chemotherapeutic agents are not likely to occur, due to amifostine¿s rapid clearance from
      plasma (90% of the drug is cleared within 6 minutes). A promising venue would be the
      investigation of amifostine¿s role in reducing the toxicities associated with chemoradiation
      (which is standard of care of treating squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck).

      Principal objectives of the study: Primary: To evaluate whether the addition of the
      radioprotector amifostine can reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis and
      hematological toxicities caused by chemoradiation. Secondary: 1.To determine the toxicities
      of amifostine given in this setting. 2. To determine the response rate of this regimen in the
      population.
