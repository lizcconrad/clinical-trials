    <textblock>
      Malaria in pregnancy is one of the most important preventable causes of low birthweight
      worlwide and a major cause of severe maternal anaemia contributing to maternal mortality.
      Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the currently
      adopted government recommendation for malaria control during pregnancy in Benin, but the
      emergence and the spread of resistance to SP justifies the evaluation of alternative
      anti-malarial drugs. Mefloquine (MQ), which has been proven effective and reasonably safe in
      this indication, may be an interesting alternative to SP. The aim of this trial is to compare
      the efficacy and safety of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and mefloquine for IPT. It is an
      equivalent study designed to test the hypothesis that MQ is as efficacious as SP to prevent
      malaria in pregnancy, and that it could replace SP when resistance of Plasmodium falciparum
      becomes too elevated. Primary endpoint will be the proportion of infants with low
      birthweight. Secondary endpoints will be the proportion of mothers with placental plasmodial
      infection, and the proportion of mothers with anaemia at delivery.

      The trial will be conducted in two maternity clinics in Ouidah, 40km from Cotonou. A total of
      1600 women will be selected and randomised to receive either SP (1500 mg sulfadoxine with 75
      mg pyrimethamine) or MQ (15 mg/kg) twice during pregnancy at ante-natal clinic (ANC) visits.
      The first dose will be given between 16 and 28 weeks of gestation, the second between 30 and
      36 weeks, and at least one month after the first dose. Women will be visited at home within
      one week after the initial and subsequent ANC visits to check for adverse reactions due to
      the study drugs. Peripheral blood samples will be collected on each ANC visit to assess for
      haemoglobin level and parasitemia. Peripheral, placental, and cord blood samples will be
      collected at delivery for haematological determinations and parasitological examination.
      Birthweight will be recorded and the gestational age assessed by the Ballard method. The
      mother and her child will be assessed for general health status six weeks after birth.
