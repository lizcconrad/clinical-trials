      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, carboplatin, and paclitaxel work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with
      carboplatin followed by paclitaxel works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy and tolerability of gemcitabine hydrochloride and carboplatin
           followed by paclitaxel in patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer in
           regard to response rate, median survival, and one year survival.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is multicenter study.

        -  Part 1: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2
           courses. In week 7, all patients proceed to part 2 regardless of disease response.

        -  Part 2: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1-3 hours once weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment
           repeats every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.
