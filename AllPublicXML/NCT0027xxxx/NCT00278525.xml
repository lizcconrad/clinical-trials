  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scleroderma is a systemic disorder categorized as an immunologically mediated disease that
      causes collagen deposition of skin and visceral organs. The molecular pathogenesis of
      scleroderma has been elusive, although vasculopathy and immune mediated mechanisms are
      thought to be important. Once extensive cutaneous or visceral disease occurs, prognosis is
      significantly shorter than the general population. Although various treatments have been
      tried, none of them seems to have changed the natural history of scleroderma. Standard dose
      immunosuppressive treatment has been disappointing. Recently, cyclophosphamide at 1-2
      mg/kg/day orally or 800-1400 mg intravenous (IV) monthly for 6-9 months has proven effective
      in treatment of scleroderma alveolitis (1). Recent phase I studies of immunoablation with
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) showed some promising data, but
      the exact efficacy is undetermined (2,3). We now propose, as a phase II randomized study,
      autologous unmanipulated PBSCT versus pulse cyclophosphamide in patients with systemic
      scleroderma.

      To evaluate the efficacy of two treatment modalities: pulse cyclophosphamide versus high dose
      cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) rescued with autologous peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The primary endpoints to be considered in this study are:

      I)Time to Treatment Failure -Treatment failure will not occur until a minimum of 12 months
      after enrollment at which time failure is defined as:

        1. Failure of skin score (if &gt; 14 on enrollment) to improve or increase in skin score by a
           25% above lowest post treatment value and must be documented on 2 occasion 6 months
           apart

        2. Deterioration in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), diffusing
           capacity divided by the alveolar volume (DLCO/VA) or forced vital capacity (FVC) by 10%
           below enrollment level or 10% below best post treatment value, due to systemic
           sclerosis, and documented on 2 occasion 6 months apart

        3. Renal failure due to systemic sclerosis and defined as chronic dialysis for more than 12
           months

        4. Gastrointestinal failure due to systemic sclerosis and defined as initiation of total
           parenteral nutrition (TPN) for more than 12 months

      II) Disease improvement defined by at least 25% improvement in skin score (Rodnan), or 10%
      improvement in pulmonary function tests (DLCO, DLCO/VA, or FVC), or in cardiac tests
      [pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure by right heart cath) that persists &gt; 6 months or
      ability to wean off TPN

Failure of skin score (if &gt; 14 on enrollment) to improve or increase in skin score by a 25% above lowest post treatment value and must be documented on 2 occasion 6 months apart
Deterioration in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), diffusing capacity divided by the alveolar volume (DLCO/VA) or forced vital capacity (FVC) by 10% below enrollment level or 10% below best post treatment value, due to systemic sclerosis, and documented on 2 occasion 6 months apart
