      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IPI-504 in GIST and STS
           patients who have failed prior therapies

        -  Recommend a dose for subsequent studies of IPI-504

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPI-504 is a novel, water-soluble analog of 17-AAG and a potent inhibitor of Hsp90. Hsp90's
      role in the cell is to control the proper folding, function, and viability of various
      &quot;client&quot; proteins. Many of these client proteins (such as AKT, Her-2, Bcr-Abl, PDGFR-α, and
      c-Kit) are oncoproteins or important cell signaling proteins. In patients with GIST,
      mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor Kit play a critical role in the pathogenesis of
      this disease. Inhibition of Kit signaling with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib (IM) is
      a very effective treatment for GIST patients. However, new mutations arise in Kit conferring
      resistance to IM treatment which results in disease progression. Kit is a client protein of
      Hsp90 and is sensitive to IPI-504. In Soft Tissue Sarcomas, there may be genetic
      abnormalities that lead to the expression of certain proteins that drive the growth of
      cancer. These cancer-driving proteins may be stimulated by HSP90. This provides a scientific
      rationale for Phase 1 clinical testing of IPI-504 in patients with advanced GIST and STS who
      have failed prior therapies.
