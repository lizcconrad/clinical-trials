    <textblock>
      Qualifying patients who are scheduled for angiogram with endothelial function testing are
      approached to participate in this protocol (consent form reviewed with patient). Those who
      are willing to participate will have additional measurements taken during their angiogram as
      part of this protocol. Patients who are diagnosed with Endothelial Dysfunction as a result of
      a clinically indicated angiogram will be eligible to participate in a 6 month medication
      trial (Atrasentan vs. placebo - randomized, blinded trial). Patients are monitored closely
      during the 6 month trial via phone calls and blood testing for assessment. At the end of the
      6 months they return to Mayo for a repeat angiogram to assess endothelial function for any
      changes or improvements.

      Aim I: To determine the activity of the endogenous endothelin system in the coronary
      circulation in humans with coronary endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis risk factors.
      Aim II: To assess the potential of chronic endothelin receptor antagonists to improve
      preexisting coronary endothelial dysfunction and myocardial perfusion in humans and Aim III:
      To assess the effect of chronic endothelin receptor antagonism on the endogenous nitric oxide
      system in association with oxidative stress in humans with early coronary disease risk
      factors.
