      The primary goal of the study is to investigate the impact of a common genetic polymorphism
      in a histamine detoxification enzyme that may well have a common role in regulating the
      expression of atopic dermatitis (AD) and other related atopic diseases in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common condition in the pediatric population, affecting an
      estimated 15% of all children greater than 18 months of age in the United States. It is now
      recognized that AD is a disease of significant heterogeneity with respect to both disease
      severity and response to conventional pharmacologic therapies. With the recognition of this
      variability comes the understanding that, as with many other allergic disease, there exist
      many specific disease phenotypes that ultimately govern response to pharmacologic
      intervention. The characterization of these unique phenotypes and their associated biologic
      mediators is therefore of critical therapeutic importance in the development of disease and
      patient-specific treatment strategies.

      The long term objective of this research is to explore the effects of genetic, environmental
      and developmental influences on the primary determinants of histamine action in atopic
      children and to identify potential histamine &quot;haplotypes&quot; that may be predictive of disease
      severity, progression and/or response to therapy.

      The primary hypothesis is the presence of HNMT T314 allele and /or slow acetylation genotype
      is associated with childhood atopic dermatitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Caucasian, Hispanic and African American children ages 6 months to 5 years with a
             diagnosis of atopic dermatitis within the last 12 months will constitute the candidate
             pool for enrollment into the study group. The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis will be
             determined by the presence of at least 3 major diagnostic features (i.e., pruritis,
             rash,relapsing-remitting presentation, family history or atopy) in addition to at
             least 3 minor features (including but not limited to xerosis, elevated serum IgE,
             ocular involvement, food allergy). Healthy Caucasian, Hispanic and African American
             children within the same age range will comprise the pool for enrollment into the
             control group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any child with atopic dermatitis who has a documented history of asthma or
             bronchospasm or who is currently receiving treatment for either of these conditions
             will be excluded. Any control subject who has asthma or positive family history of
             allergy or atopic disease in a first-degree relative (biological mother, father or
             siblings) will also be ineligible for enrollment.
