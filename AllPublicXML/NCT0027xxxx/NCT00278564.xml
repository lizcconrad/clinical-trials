    <textblock>
      Myositis is a disease, believed to be due to immune cells, cells which normally protect the
      body, but are now attacking the muscles and other organ systems within body. As a result, the
      affected muscles and organs fail to work properly causing weakness, difficulty swallowing,
      skin rash, respiratory problems, heart problems, joint stiffness, soft tissue calcification
      and vasculitis (blood circulation problems). The likelihood of progression of this disease is
      high. This study is designed to examine whether treating patients with high dose
      cyclophosphamide (a drug which reduces the function of the immune system) and ATG (a protein
      that kills the immune cells that are thought to be causing this disease), followed by return
      of previously collected blood stem cells will stop the progression of myositis.

      Conditioning Regimen (In order to assure sterility testing, a minimum of 14 days will be
      required between stem cell collection and starting the conditioning regimen).

      The conditioning regimen is outlined in below:

      Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day will be given IV over 1 hour in 250 cc of normal saline on day
      -5, -4, -3, and -2. If actual weight is &lt; ideal weight, cyclophosphamide will be given based
      on actual weight. If actual weight is &gt; ideal weight, cyclophosphamide will be given as
      adjusted ideal weight. Adjusted ideal weight = ideal weight + 40% (actual weight minus ideal
      weight).

      Mesna 50mg/kg/day will be given IV over 24 hours in 250 cc of normal saline or D5W starting
      at 10AM each dose. Weight base is calculated same as cyclophosphamide as above.

      1ATG (rabbit) 0.5 mg/kg on day -6 and 1mg/kg on day -5, -4, -3, -2 and -1 (total 5.5mg/kg, no
      dose adjustment) will be given IV over 10 hours in 250 cc of normal saline beginning at least
      1 hour after infusion of cyclophosphamide. Premedicate with acetaminophen 650 mg po and
      diphenhydramine 25 mg po/IV 30 minutes before the infusion.

      Methylprednisolone A suggested dose of 250mg IV should be administered 30 minutes before each
      ATG infusion.

      Hydration A suggested rate of 125 cc/hr NS should be given starting 6 hours before the first
      cyclophosphamide dose and continued until 24 hours after the last cyclophosphamide dose. The
      rate of hydration will be aggressively adjusted. BID weights will be obtained. Amount of
      fluid can be modified based on patient's fluid status. Minimum target urine output is 2
      liters/m2/day

      G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day will be given subcutaneously and continued until the absolute neutrophil
      counts reaches at least 500/µl.

      Rituxan 500 mg will be given IV on the day before the first dose of ATG and the day after
      stem cell infusion.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 16 years and ≤ 65 years at the time of pretransplant evaluation.

          2. An established diagnosis of polymyositis, dermatomyositis, juvenile
             polymyositis/dermatomyositis, myositis associated with other collagen diseases.
             Diagnosis requires electrophysiological studies and histopathologic features. MRI
             evidence of muscle inflammation or histological evidence of active myositis is
             mandatory at entry. If patient had dermatomyositis/polymyositis associated with
             malignancy, the patient has to be free of malignancy for 5 years and considered to be
             cured.

          3. Patients who failed conventional treatment of at least 3 months duration including
             high-dose corticosteroids (equivalent dosage of prednisone &gt;1.0 mg/kg/day to start),
             and must also have failed two or more of the followings: cyclophosphamide,
             azathioprine, 6-MP, methotrexate, tacrolimus, cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil,
             TNF inhibitor (e.g. etanercept), IVIG or any other immunosuppressive drugs or immune
             modulating drugs.

             conditions):

               -  Persistent muscle weakness (grade 4/5 or worse by MRC) with elevation of muscle
                  derived enzymes (CPK, aldolase)

               -  Worsening pulmonary function especially %VC or DLCo &gt; 15% over 12 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Poor performance (PS) status (ECOG &gt;2) at the time of entry, unless decline of PS is

               -  Liver cirrhosis, transaminases &gt;3x of normal limits or bilirubin &gt;2.0 unless due
                  to Gilbert disease.

          3. HIV positive.

          4. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or any other illness that in the opinion of the

             malignancies for which the patient is judged to be cured by local surgical therapy,
             such as (but not limited to) head and neck cancer, or stage I or II breast cancer will
             be considered on an individual basis.

          6. Positive pregnancy test, inability or unable to pursue effective means of birth
             control, failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a side
             effect of therapy.

          7. Psychiatric illness or mental deficiency making compliance with treatment or informed
             consent impossible.
