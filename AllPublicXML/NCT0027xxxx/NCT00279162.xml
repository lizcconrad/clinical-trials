  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive either a gel containing both calcipotriene plus betamethasone or gel
      with no active ingredients as treatment for their scalp psoriasis for 8 weeks. After this
      time all patients will receive the gel containing both calcipotriene and betamethasone for 44
      weeks. In addition, patients will receive an ointment containing both calcipotriene plus
      betamethasone as treatment for their psoriasis of the trunk and limbs for 52 weeks.

      The objective is to study the short-term efficacy of the gel, and the short and long-term
      safety of the gel and the ointment.

             maximum of 40g of gel per week.

          -  A score for the investigator's assessment of clinical signs of scalp psoriasis of at
             least 2 (moderate severity) in one of the clinical signs (redness, thickness and
             scaliness), and at least 1 (slight severity) in each of the other two clinical signs.

          -  An investigator's global assessment of moderate, severe or very severe scalp
             psoriasis.

          -  Psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk and/or limbs amenable to topical treatment with a
             maxi-mum of 60g of ointment per week.
