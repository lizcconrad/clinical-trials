      The purpose of this study is to look at the heart rate and rhythm information collected daily
      in Medtronic implantable pulse generators (IPG), implantable cardioverter defibrillators
      (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices. The study will gather this
      information from many patients to see if heart rate or rhythm data can predict the risk of a
      patient having a medical condition such as stroke.
