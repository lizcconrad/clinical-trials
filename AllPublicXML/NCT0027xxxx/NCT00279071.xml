      Hypothesis:Acupuncture can be used as stimulation of labour in case of primary og secondary
      inertia.

      A randomized controlled trial including 150 pregnant women Acupuncture has become a natural
      part of the range of obstetric treatments offered in danish delivery wards, but there is only
      little evidence to the effect of the acupuncture.

      The women are randomized into to groups.

        1. Acupuncture, Acu.points: KI3, Ki6, SP6, BL60, LI4, BL67(acupressure)

        2. No treatment

      The women will be asked in case beginning signs of inertia, if they want to parcipitate in
      the trial.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Normal pregnancy

        2. In labour (orificium &lt; 8 cm), 37th week or thereafter

        3. Ruptured membranes

        4. Primary or secondary inertia

      The women will just before randomization be vaginally explored and fetal heart monitored. The
      meassure of effect happens two hours after randomization.

      The midwife who measures the effect, is blinded to the treatment or lack of, and also on the
      including exploration.

      Secondary effect meassures: length of labour, use of oxytocin and number of contracions
      pr/min meassured twice:

      1. before the randomization and again 1 hour after randomization.
