  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wanted to test the hypotheses that blood pressure level was lower, that the variability of
      blood pressure and blood glucose was reduced, and that quality of life was improved when
      glucose was added to the dialysis fluid.

      The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of glucose added to the dialysis fluid
      on 1.blood pressure and variation in blood pressure, 2.blood glucose and variation in blood
      glucose, and 3.quality of life in patients treated with chronic maintenance hemodialysis in a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, unblinded cross-over study.
