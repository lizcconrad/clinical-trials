  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney stone formation due to an excess of calcium in the urine is a common problem. It is
      treated with thiazide diuretics. These drugs often cause excessively low blood potassium
      levels that in turn require large doses of potassium supplements. These supplements are often
      large, unpleasant and easy to forget. We are trying the addition of spironolactone to these
      patients' medications to see if it allows them to take a lower dose of potassium.

      See rationale above

      Ten patients who have had multiple kidney stones primarily due to hypercalciuria and who are
      currently on stable dose of thiazide or thiazide plus amiloride will be enrolled in the
      study. In addition, pts have to require at least 60mEq of K supplementation a day or be on
      40mEq and be hypokalemic and unable to tolerate increased K supplements. We will then give
      them 50mg a day of spironolactone for four weeks. A complete 24-hour urine stone profile will
      be obtained before and after the drug is administered. After four weeks the patients' serum
      potassium will be rechecked, and their dose will be lowered according to a nomogram.

      Primary end point is the mean change in serum K before and after spironolactone. Secondary
      endpoints are the change in urine calcium on and off the drug and the mean reduction in K
      dose on the drug.
