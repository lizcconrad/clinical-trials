          -  Healthy subjects as determined by good health as determined by no clinically
             significant deviation from normal in medical history, physical examination, ECGs and
             clinical laboratory determinations.

          -  Body weight for all subjects will be &lt;- 100 kg.

             minimized.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  WOCBP and males who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid
             pregnancy for up to 10 weeks after he infusion of BMS-1886678. WOCBP must also be
