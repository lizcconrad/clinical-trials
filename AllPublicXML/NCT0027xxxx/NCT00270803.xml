  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of 17mg and 13mg Delta THC on orientation and motor
      coordination and brain metabolic activity in regular users of marijuana. Subjects were tested
      twice, after smoking cigarettes with marijuana and after smoking cigarettes without
      marijuana.On both occasions they performed on a virtual reality maze task. They were
      afterwards scanned in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG).
