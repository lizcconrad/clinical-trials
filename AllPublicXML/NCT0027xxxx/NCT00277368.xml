      Headache is often ignored as a symptom of epileptic seizures. The purpose of this survey is
      to investigate the prevalence, characteristics and classification of seizure-associated
      headaches and non-seizure-associated headaches in epileptic patients in Korea, according the
      criteria of the International Headache Society 2004. In this survey, 577 consecutive patients
      with a recent diagnosis of epilepsy are interviewed by questionnaire about headaches
      associated with epileptic seizures. It involves questions about headache in general,
      localization, severity, duration and frequency, as well as headache associated with seizures,
      and about patient's family history. This Observational study does not involve the
      administration of any drugs.
