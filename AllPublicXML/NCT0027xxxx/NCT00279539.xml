      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and bioactivity of intramyocardial gene
      transfer using VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in patients with ischemic heart
      failure. The research treatment of this CHF study will involve the use of an intramuscular
      injection with a catheter inserted in through the groin to transfer a type of DNA (phVEGF165
      gene) to the wall of the heart. Genes (which are part of the DNA molecules) carry
      instructions to allow the cells to produce specific proteins. Gene transfer or treatment with
      DNA (a necessary part of all cells) is being studied for the treatment of patients with heart
      failure. This research therapy, which is experimental and not proven, is designed to try to
      grow new blood vessels to improve blood flow to areas of the heart that are not receiving
      enough blood.

      DNA is present in all cells and provides the instructions for making proteins. After
      delivering a piece of DNA containing the vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (VEGF-1) gene
      (the product being studied) into cells, the cells may produce a specific protein called
      vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (VEGF-1). Animal studies have indicated that the VEGF-1
      protein may cause new blood vessels to grow. The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Gene (ph
      VEGF 165) is found on the VEGF DNA. Experiments performed in animals show that once in the
      heart wall, the DNA directs the cells of the heart muscle to make the VEGF protein. VEGF 165
      is a protein that has been shown to stimulate cells (known as endothelial cells), which form
      the inner lining of blood vessels. This protein causes cells to divide and grow, thereby
      forming new blood vessels. It is anticipated that this new blood supply may help the heart
      pump the blood more effectively and relieve some heart failure symptoms. We do not yet have
      enough information to know what will happen in humans, that is why we are doing this
      research.

      After gene transfer we will begin a process to help move some of the stem cells from the bone
      marrow into the blood circulation. Subjects will be given the drug called G-CSF (a drug used
      to move cells from the bone marrow into the blood stream). Stem cells are young cells
      produced by bone marrow (the spongy cavity in the center of large bones) that can develop
      into blood cells or other types of cells. This medication triggers the movement of stem cells
      out of the bone marrow and into the blood stream. Before being released into the blood
      stream, stem cells receive signals that direct them to become specific types of cells such as
      CD34+ cells (endothelial progenitor cells). CD34+ cells that move to or are in the area of
      damaged heart tissue may promote growth of new blood vessels that supply blood and nutrients
      and thereby improve the chance of survival of heart tissue, improve heart function, and
      possibly have a long-term benefit.

      We will be recruiting 12 subjects for this study. There will be no randomization and no
      placebo group. Once eligibility in the research study has been determined all subjects will
      be treated with the VEGF and G-CSF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be &gt; 21 years old.

          -  Have mild or moderate (NYHA Class II or III) CHF secondary to ischemic heart disease.

          -  Have left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%.

             anti-congestive medications) for 1 month prior to determination of their baseline
             functional status. The judgment regarding the optimal medical regimen for each
             individual subject will have been made by the referring cardiologist.
