  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MST-997 is a taxane analog with the potential to treat subjects with a variety of tumor
      types. Preclinical data demonstrated that MST-997 inhibited tumor growth when administered
      intravenously (IV). This phase 1 dose escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of if IV MST-997 formulated in Polysorbate 80 Diluent can be safely administered
      on a weekly basis.
