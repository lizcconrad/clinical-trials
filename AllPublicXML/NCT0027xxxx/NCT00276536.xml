      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and slow the growth
      of cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interferon alfa in
      treating patients with stage IV solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Confirm tolerance and safety of interferon alfa-1b (IFN-α1b) in patients with stage IV
           solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IFN-α1b given daily by subcutaneous
           injection in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive interferon alfa-1b subcutaneously once daily for at least 1 month. Treatment
      continues for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of interferon alfa-1b until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
