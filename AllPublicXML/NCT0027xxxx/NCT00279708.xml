      This study will determine if atorvastatin (Lipitor) can help patients with pulmonary (lung)
      sarcoidosis and replace or reduce the need for patients to take steroids, such as prednisone.
      Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can affect nearly any part of the body. Pulmonary
      sarcoidosis may resolve on its own or it may progress to irreversible lung damage,
      disability, and death. Many sarcoidosis patients are treated with prednisone, but the drug is
      not effective in all patients, and it can cause serious side effects, such as high blood
      pressure, sugar diabetes, eye cataracts, and bone thinning.

      Patients with stage II or III pulmonary sarcoidosis between 18 and 70 years of age who
      require prednisone may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with the tests and
      procedures described below.

      Participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: one group takes
      atorvastatin; the other takes a placebo (a look-alike pill that has no active ingredient to
      fight sarcoidosis). Both groups take the pills by mouth once a day for 12 months. When
      treatment begins, participants begin to have their prednisone dosage tapered (reduced). The
      tapering is done over 8 weeks until the dose is reduced by 90 percent. Patients are evaluated
      periodically to determine if the two groups differ in how long they can remain on the reduced
      dose of prednisone without having their symptoms recur, requiring an increase in the
      prednisone dose. A full battery of tests is done at the initial screening visit and at the
      26- and 52-week follow-up visits, requiring hospitalization for 3-5 days. Additional interim
      outpatient assessments are done at 6, 12, 18 and 36 weeks.

      The full battery of tests at the initial screening and the 26- and 52-week visits includes
      the following:

        -  Medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, assessment of disease
           severity and activity.

        -  Questionnaires.

        -  Chest x-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan.

        -  Abdominal ultrasound.

        -  Six-minute walk test (6MWT)

        -  Exercise testing and blood gases

        -  Pulmonary function tests (PFT)

        -  Maximum incremental ventilatory performance test (MIVP)

        -  Exhaled nitric oxide and carbon monoxide (Exhaled NO and CO)

        -  Bronchoscopy and lavage

      Interim testing at 6, 12, 18 and 36 weeks includes PFT, MIVP, Exhaled NO and CO, CXR,
      questionnaire, blood tests, and 6MWT.

      Six months after completing the study, participants fill out a questionnaire.

      Background

      Sarcoidosis is a multi-system granulomatous inflammatory disease. Pulmonary involvement is
      most common. Patients typically experience fatigue, weakness and dyspnea. Respiratory muscle
      weakness, which may be secondary to granulomatous inflammation, is associated with dyspnea
      and decreased quality of life (QOL). The disease can remit spontaneously or become chronic,
      with exacerbations and remissions. In some patients, it can progress to pulmonary fibrosis
      and death. Granulomatous inflammation is characterized primarily by accumulation of
      monocytes, macrophages and activated T-lymphocytes, with increased production of key
      inflammatory mediators, TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, IL-2 and IL-12, characteristic of a
      Th1-polarized response (T-helper lymphocyte-1 response). Corticosteroids are the current
      mainstay of treatment, but their long-term benefits are not certain. Because steroids often
      produce undesirable side effects, investigations to identify alternative therapies are
      warranted. There is sufficient evidence to test the proof of concept that pathways targeted
      by statins will have a therapeutic effect in sarcoidosis, since, in pre-clinical studies,
      statins blunt Th1-mediated inflammatory responses.

      Aims

      The study involves a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized trial which aims to
      determine if atorvastatin administration results in less steroid use and longer steroid-free
      intervals in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis who require prednisone treatment.

      Methods

      Patients, who are 18-70 years old, with stage II or III pulmonary sarcoidosis, diagnosed by a
      compatible clinical history and supported by a lung, lymph node, or tissue biopsy, will be
      enrolled in the study, if they require prednisone therapy. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to two groups; as prednisone is tapered, one group will receive placebo and the
      other, atorvastatin. The two study drugs will be administered for twelve months, during which
      time patients will be periodically evaluated as to their clinical status and prednisone
      requirements. Pill counts and patient diaries will be used to determine the amount of steroid
      use during the study period. Patients with pulmonary fibrosis greater than 50 percent of
      total lung volume or severe co-morbidities will be excluded from the trial.

      The primary endpoint is the duration of the steroid-sparing period. Secondary clinical and
      physiological endpoints are intended to analyze possible anti-inflammatory and beneficial
      effects of the drugs. Since there is no gold standard outcome measure in sarcoidosis, four
      categories of secondary endpoints will be used to characterize the effects of the therapeutic
      agent on the clinical course of the disease: imaging (high resolution chest CT); quality of
      life assessments (SF-36, and SGRQ), anti-inflammatory effects (biomarkers and relapse rates),
      and functional effects (CPET, PFTs). Finally, we will study the utility of exhaled nitric
      oxide and carbon monoxide in monitoring disease activity.

    <description>The duration of steroid sparing was defined as the date when the target dose of prednisone was reached until the date at which the dose was increased and/or met the relapse (flare) criteria; or until the 12 month study phase ended if no prednisone dose increase was required. The steroid sparing period was measured in units of days. The prednisone target dose was defined as a 90% reduction of the baseline dose or an absolute prednisone dose of 4 mg/day or less.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Flare rates and relative risk: Flares (relapses) were defined as the physiological deterioration in pulmonary function due to worsened pulmonary inflammation. The criteria used for a pulmonary flare included: &gt; 15% decline in static function (FEV1 post, FVC post); or (&gt; 20% DLCO adj); or a &gt; 15% decline in walk distance as measured by the six minute walk test, or via a decline in oxygen consumption collected during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Additional factors considered included an increase in dyspnea (&gt;15% increase in the dyspnea scale (TDI); and/or significant radiographic worsening. Clinical assessment of the patient's status may have been factored into the criteria for flare determination as well.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients are eligible for the trial if they are 18-70 years old with radiographic stages II
        and III pulmonary sarcoidosis, and are on prednisone, methotrexate, or azathioprine for
        pulmonary sarcoidosis or who are steroid-requiring. Patients with extra-pulmonary
        sarcoidosis (except cardiac and neurosarcoidosis) may be eligible as long as they have
        active pulmonary (stage II or III) sarcoidosis.

        Steroid-Requiring History:

        A steroid-requiring patient is one who was previously stable but who ultimately experiences
        (a) increased symptoms associated with radiographic deterioration, and/or, (b) met the
        criteria for relapse and/or functional deterioration. In addition, patients who were
        prescribed prednisone for sarcoidosis, but have self-discontinued it (yet still have
        clinical and symptomatic disease and/or evidence of pulmonary functional deterioration)
        will be considered steroid-requiring.

        This latter group of steroid-requiring patients is eligible for enrollment if they are
        willing to resume taking their latest stabilizing dose of prednisone for at least four
        weeks prior to study entry. If their dose cannot be determined, then 40 mg will be used.

        Therefore, a history of symptomatic or clinical deterioration leading to therapy
        initiation, or a history of decline associated with attempts to decrease therapy should be
        established. Medical records review and discussion with the prescribing physician will be
        used to establish this history.

        Radiographic Stages of Pulmonary Sarcoidosis:

        STAGE&lt; TAB&gt; DESCRIPTION

        0&lt; TAB&gt; Normal Chest Radiograph

        I&lt; TAB&gt; Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy

        II&lt; TAB&gt; Pulmonary Infiltration and Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy

        III&lt; TAB&gt; Pulmonary Infiltration alone

        Steroid-requiring refers to one of three situations:

        Patients who meet relapse criteria or functional deterioration.

        Functional deterioration criteria that warrants prednisone therapy includes:

        If VC fell to 75% of the best recorded value for the patient before any treatment

        If VC fell to greater than 50% of predicted value

        IF DLCO fell to less than 60% of the best recorded value prior to their treatment

        Patients who are on a previously prescribed systemic steroid, or alternative agent such as
        methotrexate or azathioprine, primarily for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Alternative agents must
        first be changed to roughly equivalent anti-inflammatory dose of prednisone and the patient
        should be stable on this dose for at least four weeks prior to randomization.

        Patients who have substantial respiratory symptoms (distressing cough or dyspnea, which
        interferes with daily activities that would warrant therapy as per the standard of practice
        in the US.

        Extra Pulmonary Sarcoidosis:

        Patients with extra pulmonary sarcoidosis (except neurosarcoidosis and cardiac sarcoidosis)
        may be eligible as long as they have active pulmonary (stage II or III) sarcoidosis. All
        patients will be referred to an NIH ophthalmologist. Steroid therapy may be modified based
        upon the recommendations of the consultants, as well as per the lapse criteria described
        above.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Moderate to severe pulmonary fibrosis (stage IV sarcoidosis greater than 50% fibrosis)

        unless they agree to discontinue usage at least two weeks prior to randomization and for
        the duration of the study period: grapefruit juice and herbal remedies that may lead to
        severe liver injury and/or muscle injury if taken with atorvastatin, including: Skullcap,
        chaparral, Germander, Jin Bu Huan, Valerian, Comfrey, and Eucalyptus. Since other products
        such as St. John s Wort, oat bran, and pectin can reduce the effectiveness of atorvastatin,
        they and similar agents, should also be discontinued at least two weeks before
        randomization and for the duration of the study period.

        Subjects with inactive hepatitis B will require antiviral prophylaxis with an agent such as
        lamivudine, while on prednisone therapy.

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were recruited by national advertising (self-referrals), physician referrals, and through a medical clinic sponsored by the NIH, from March 2006 through March 2015.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were screened by telephone and later during clinical testing a evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center. During this time subjects were evaluated to determine if they met the enrollment criteria, including that of treatment requiring disease, and relatively stable dosing prior to entry.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The duration of steroid sparing was defined as the date when the target dose of prednisone was reached until the date at which the dose was increased and/or met the relapse (flare) criteria; or until the 12 month study phase ended if no prednisone dose increase was required. The steroid sparing period was measured in units of days. The prednisone target dose was defined as a 90% reduction of the baseline dose or an absolute prednisone dose of 4 mg/day or less.</description>

        <title>Pulmonary Sarcoidosis Flares</title>
        <description>Flare rates and relative risk: Flares (relapses) were defined as the physiological deterioration in pulmonary function due to worsened pulmonary inflammation. The criteria used for a pulmonary flare included: &gt; 15% decline in static function (FEV1 post, FVC post); or (&gt; 20% DLCO adj); or a &gt; 15% decline in walk distance as measured by the six minute walk test, or via a decline in oxygen consumption collected during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Additional factors considered included an increase in dyspnea (&gt;15% increase in the dyspnea scale (TDI); and/or significant radiographic worsening. Clinical assessment of the patient’s status may have been factored into the criteria for flare determination as well.</description>
