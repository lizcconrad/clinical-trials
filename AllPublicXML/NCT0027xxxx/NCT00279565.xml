        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse, who are willing to
             undergo methadone or buprenorphine substitution.

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis C.

          -  Age 18-65.

          -  Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-ribonucleic acid (RNA) positive in serum as measured by
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) within the last 4 weeks.

          -  Genotype 2 or 3.

          -  Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

          -  In women of child-bearing age, pregnancy must be excluded prior to entry into the
             study, and the use of a safe contraceptive device (intrauterine device, oral
             contraceptive, diaphragm + spermicide, condom + spermicide, tubal ligation) must be
             documented.

          -  Lab parameters:

               -  Hemoglobin: &gt;=12 g/dL (women) or &gt;=13 g/dL (men)

               -  Leukocytes &gt;=3,000/µL

               -  Thrombocytes &gt;=100,000/µL

               -  Prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/coagulation within the
                  normal range

               -  Albumin: not more than 10% deviation from lower normal value

               -  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normal

               -  Creatinine normal

               -  Uric acid normal

               -  Antinuclear antibodies &lt;=1:160

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal by women of child-bearing age or by sexually active patients to use a safe
             contraceptive.

          -  Breast-feeding women.

          -  Cirrhosis stage B and C according to Child-Pugh.

          -  Signs of decompensated liver disease (ascites, bleeding varices and spontaneous
             encephalopathy).

          -  Confirmed co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus
             (HBV).

          -  Existing psychiatric comorbidity.

          -  Alcohol abuse.

             previous years (except for adequately treated basal cell carcinoma).

          -  Existing psoriasis or other dermatological disorder (relative exclusion criterion: due
             to great differences with regard to the severity of the disorder and the individual
             therapy compatibility, the therapy decision is at the discretion of the physician).

          -  Treatment with a study drug within the last 30 days.

          -  Any uncontrolled underlying medical conditions (e.g. diabetes).

          -  Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and / or significant
             cardiovascular dysfunction within the last 6 months (angina, heart failure, recent
             myocardial infarction, severe hypertension or significant arrhythmia) is an exclusion
             criterion. In case of other suspected heart disease, a cardiologic examination is
             required prior to inclusion of the patient.

          -  Any liver disorder of other genesis than the study indication (with regard to elevated
             iron levels, only patients with manifest hemochromatosis are excluded).

          -  Autoimmune disorder (except LKM-positive patients: these patients may be included in
             the study).

          -  Misuse of buprenorphine or methadone.
