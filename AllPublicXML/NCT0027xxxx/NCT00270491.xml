  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tolerance and efficacy of administration of capecitabine 5 out of 7 days associated with
      weekly paclitaxel compared to the recommended treatment plan of weekly paclitaxel -
      capecitabine, in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to know if we can optimize in term of tolerance even of efficacy
      the plan of administration of weekly paclitaxel associated with capecitabine.
