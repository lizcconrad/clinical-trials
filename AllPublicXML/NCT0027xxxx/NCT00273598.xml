  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic scoliosis affects 2-5% of adolescents. This study will compare the quality of
      life, functional outcome, cosmetic result, and the correction of spinal deformity of two
      instrumentation systems for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 8-18 years

          -  Diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis requiring posterior instrumentation and
             fusion(including those also requiring anterior release with or without anterior
             instrumentation) who could receive either the USS or the Moss Miami system

          -  Patients with scoliosis and an incidental finding of conus &lt; L1-2 disc level, provided
             they have no symptoms or signs

          -  Patients with scoliosis and an incidental finding of a small syrinx (provided the
             syrinx is non-progressive and does not require neurosurgical treatment)

          -  Patients with non-progressive spondylolysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Spinal cord abnormalities with any neurologic symptoms or signs

          -  Spinal cord lesions requiring neurosurgical interventions, such as hydromyelia
             requiring Arnold Chiari decompression

          -  Primary muscle diseases, such as muscular dystrophy

          -  Neurologic diseases (e.g. Charcot-Marie Tooth, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cerebral
             palsy, or spina bifida, etc.)

          -  Primary abnormalities of bones(e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta)

          -  Congenital scoliosis
