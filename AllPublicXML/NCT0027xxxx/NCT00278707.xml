      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral supplementation of glyceryl triacetate
      improves the clinical prognosis of Canavan Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Canavan Disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme named Aspartoacylase (ASPA). This
      disease is a devastating, progressive disease with no available treatment. As a result of the
      ASPA deficiency, there are high levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and low levels of
      L-aspartate and acetate.

      We hypothesize that one of the functions of ASPA is to provide sufficient levels of acetate
      for CNS myelinization. For this reason, we offer to supplement acetate levels by the oral
      administration of glyceryl triacetate (GTA). Such treatment must be offered to patients
      before the age of 18 months, prior to the termination of CNS myelinization.

        1. Two patients, aged less than 15 months, will receive daily doses of oral GTA

        2. The daily dose will be increased incrementally until the maintenance dose is reached.
           This will be done under close monitoring of the patients, including periodic blood gas
           sampling.

        3. GTA has not been shown to cause any known toxicity, according to the Cosmetic Ingredient
           Review Expert Panel (Fiume, 2003).
