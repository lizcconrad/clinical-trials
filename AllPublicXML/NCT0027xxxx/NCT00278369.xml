      RATIONALE: Combinations of biological substances in denileukin diftitox may be able to carry
      tumor-killing substances directly to kidney cancer cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate the
      white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. Giving denileukin diftitox together with
      interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects of denileukin diftitox
      and interleukin-2 in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of denileukin diftitox and high-dose interleukin-2 in
           patients with metastatic renal cell cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Perform transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta promoter and TGF-beta receptor genotyping
           to search for variants that may be associated with tumor response to therapy.

        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial and complete) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study.

      The first 3 patients enrolled in the study receive high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15
      minutes, 3 times daily, on days 1-5 and 15-19 and denileukin diftitox IV over 15-60 minutes
      once daily on days 8-10. If no dose-limiting toxicity occurs after receiving denileukin
      diftitox, subsequent patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive denileukin diftitox (at a higher dose than for the first 3
           patients enrolled in the study) IV over 15-60 minutes once daily on days -4 to -2 and
           high-dose IL-2 IV over 15 minutes, 3 times daily, on days 1-5 and 15-19.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive high-dose IL-2 as in arm I and denileukin diftitox (at a higher
           dose than for the first 3 patients enrolled in the study) IV over 15-60 minutes at a
           higher dose once daily on days 8-10.

      All patients may receive additional treatment with IL-2 alone in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13 patients will be accrued for this study.
