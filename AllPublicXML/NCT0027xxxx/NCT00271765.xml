  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety of INO-1001 in subjects who have
      experienced a heart attack and are to be treated with coronary angioplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, heart attacks may be treated with clot-dissolving medicines, coronary angioplasty,
      or a combination of both. Unblocking of blood flow to the heart following coronary
      angioplasty can cause side effects such as heart tissue and blood vessel damage, abnormal
      heart rhythms and death of heart muscle cells.

      In animal studies, the PARP enzyme has been shown to be involved in damaging heart muscle
      after the sudden unblocking of coronary arteries. INO-1001 blocks the PARP enzyme, and so it
      may reduce heart damage in humans who have had their coronary arteries unblocked after a
      heart attack.

      A total of 40 patients will be selected and randomly assigned to either INO-1001 or placebo
      (sugar water). One dose only of the drug will be given prior to coronary angioplasty.
      Patients will be followed until 30 days after surgery.

      The following information will be gathered: vital signs, symptoms, physical examination,
      blood and urine tests, electrocardiograms, and other information from medical charts.

      The information provided in this listing is disclosed solely to comply with regulatory
      requirements. The drug INO-1001 has not yet been approved for marketing and is only available
      to patients who participate in a clinical trial and are chosen for the treatment group.
