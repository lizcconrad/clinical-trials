      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and
      stop tumor cells from growing. Giving paclitaxel together with GM-CSF may be effective in
      treating melanoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with GM-CSF
      works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by
      surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the activity of paclitaxel and sargramostim (GM-CSF), in terms of objective
           clinical response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]), in patients
           with advanced unresectable melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine serum cytokine levels (GM-CSF, IFN-γ, aldesleukin, recombinant interleukin-4,
           and IL-10) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously
      on days 4-17. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses of therapy beyond CR for up to 12 courses.

      After study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for at least 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will accrued for this study.

                    -  Regional metastasis that, in the judgement of the treating physician, cannot
                       be surgically resected with clear margins

                    -  Regional metastasis that can be surgically resected with clear margins only
                       by extensive surgery that is inadvisable or unacceptable to the treating
                       physician and/or patient

               -  Staging of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma based on the revised American Joint
