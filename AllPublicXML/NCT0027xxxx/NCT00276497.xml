      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) subjects to study the effect of pioglitazone in preventing
      the conversion to Diabetes.

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study was designed to find out whether pioglitazone will prevent the
      conversion to diabetes in subjects who are non obese and with impaired glucose tolerance.

      It is a double blind prospective study for 3 years. The study was started in October 2003 and
      randomization was completed in May 2005. A total of 6643 subjects were screened and 406 were
      randomized either to pioglitazone or placebo(investigator blinded-groups assigned A and B).
      At randomisation subjects were given standard advice on diet,exercise and benefits of life
      style modifications.

      Subjects both male and female, aged between 35 and 55 years, with no known history of
      diabetes, willing and available for a 3 year study alone were screened. Pregnant women,
      subjects with major illness such as cancer, hepatic or cardiac diseases and on transferable
      jobs were excluded from the study. The initial dose of tablet was 15mg o.d. which was
      titrated after a month to 30 mg o.d. in subjects who did not show any adverse events.

      The subjects will be undergoing annual reviews with a repeat OGTT, for 3 years. An interim
      review at every six months is also being done. Proforma containing details of anthropometry,
      occupation, physical activity, dietary habits, details of medications, regularity of
      treatment will be done at each interview.

      The main expected outcomes of the study will be a reduction in conversion of IGT to diabetes
      and benefits of the drug on anthropometric variables and biochemical parameters.
