  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to confirm the clinical benefits and safety of OrCel in the treatment
      of venous ulcers. OrCel and standard care are compared to standard care alone. Standard care
      consists of currently accepted compression therapy.

      Patients are treated for 12 weeks. Patients with healed ulcers are followed for an additional
      12 weeks to assess durability of the healed wound.
