  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of C-peptide administration on nerve
      function in patients with type 1 diabetes and peripheral sensory neuropathy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been observed that C-peptide administration results in an activation of renal tubular
      and sciatic endoneural Na/K-ATPase of the rat and stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide
      synthase. The hypothesis is that C-peptide administration may improve peripheral nerve
      dysfunction in diabetic neuropathy by increasing nerve blood flow and Na/K-ATPase activity.
      The purpose of the trial is to investigate the effect of C-peptide administration on diabetic
      peripheral sensory neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic neuropathy in the
      lower extremities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a duration of type 1 diabetes of more than 5 yrs

          -  Subjects who are C-peptide deficient

          -  Subjects who have diabetic distal symmetric neuropathy, according to the criteria
             defined at the San Antonio Conference on Diabetic Neuropathy 1988

          -  Subjects who have measurable action potential in the sural nerves

          -  Subjects who have reduced nerve conduction velocity in the sural nerves

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have neuropathy or signs of nerve dysfunction which may be a consequence
             of factors other than type 1 diabetes

          -  Subjects who have concomitant medication that may interfere with the peripheral nerve
             function or measurement thereof

          -  Subjects who are transplanted (islet cell, kidney or pancreas)
