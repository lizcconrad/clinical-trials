  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community acquired pneumonia(CAP) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis
      of CAP from the microbiology perspective has been challenging. Recent reports suggest the
      utility of real-time PCR for rapid and accurate diagnoses of these pathogens. Real-Time PCR
      tests, using the LightCycler instrument, will be performed on excess or additional specimens
      after extraction of nucleic acid.

      Excess patient specimens normally collected for routine microbiologic testing for CAP and in
      some cases additional specimens (i.e.,blood, urine, throat swab) will be evaluated using
      real-time PCR tests developed in our laboratory. Specimens will be performed on patients
      suspect for CAP. Test will be directed at variety of pathogens including but not limited to
      M.pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumoniae, B. pertussis,
      influenza viruses, adenovirus, and metapneumovirus. The ultimate goal is to have a panel of
      highly accurate and rapid (same day) tests that can be orderable and performed in short
      period time for CAP cases.

      Real-Time PCR tests, using the LightCycler instrument, will be performed on excess or
      additional specimens after extraction of nucleic acid. Real-time PCR tests, using the
      LightCycler instrument, will be performed on excess or additional specimens after extraction
      nucleic acid. These tests will include the organisms listed above. As nucleic acid extracts
      will be archived, other pathogens can be tested in the future should we develop additional
      real-time PCR tests. All results obtained by real-time PCR will be compared to results for
      conventional testing as listed above. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values will be
      calculated. In cases where discordant results occur, additional PCR testing and or medical
      history review will be conducted.
