      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Internal radiation
      uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving
      radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving external-beam radiation together
      with internal radiation works in treating patients with cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of magnetic resonance-guided, endocavitary, high-dose rate
           brachytherapy implants in patients with stage IB-IVB cervical cancer.

        -  Provide more reliable dose-volume estimations based on three-dimensional imaging-based
           treatment planning in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects and treatment tolerance in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate three-dimensional dose-volume histograms of organs at risk with treatment
           toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the disease status, time and patterns of relapse, and survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy 4-5 days a week for up to 7 weeks.
      Patients also undergo MRI-guided high-dose brachytherapy comprising one brachytherapy implant
      a week for 3-6 implants. Brachytherapy may be administered during or after external beam
      radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
