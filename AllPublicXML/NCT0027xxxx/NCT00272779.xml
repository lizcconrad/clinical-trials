  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral effects of
      atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) versus a combination drug of lopinavir (LPV) plus RTV.
      A combination drug containing tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) will also be taken by
      participants in both arms.

    <description>MOS-HIV is developed to assess a participant's health and functional status associated with HIV infection. The questionnaire is applied to participants with adequate linguistic skills and consists of 35 items. The questionnaire derives an overall health score and 10 subscale scores (health transitions, pain, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, mental health, energy/fatigue, health distress and quality of life).The subscale and summary scores range from 0-100 with a higher score indicating better health.</description>

Higher scores=better IBS-related QoL. A 14-point change from BL in IBS-QoL score in women with moderate to severe functional bowel disorders is a minimally important difference based on pain and satisfaction.</description>

          -  Proven or suspected acute hepatitis in the 30 days prior to study entry;

          -  Intractable diarrhea (≥6 loose stools/day for at least 7 consecutive days) within 30

               4. total serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of study drug;

          -  Prohibited therapies;

          -  Any other clinical conditions or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would make the participant unsuitable for study or unable to comply with
             the dosing requirements;

          -  Prisoners or participants who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated)

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 1057 HIV-infected participants, 174 participants were not randomized to receive study drug, the main reason being that they did not meet the study criteria (133/174; 76%). 441 randomized to ATV received any drug and 437 randomized to LPV received any drug. 438 and 440 participants randomized to ATV and LPV, respectively, received correct drug.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>ATV 300 mg QD + RTV 100 mg QD + TDF 300 mg QD + FTC 200 mg QD</title>
          <description>Participants were administered an oral dose of Atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg and ritonavir (RTV) 100 mg once daily along with food. Doses were taken 24 hours apart at the same time as fixed dose combination tenofovir (TDF) 300 mg plus emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg once daily.</description>

          <description>Participants were administered lopinavir (LPV) 400 mg or ritonavir (RTV) 100 mg twice daily along with food. Doses were taken approximately 12 hours apart while tenofovir (TDF) 300 mg once daily and emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg once daily was administered at the same time as 1 of the 2 daily doses of LPV/RTV.</description>

        <description>TLOVR defines responders at Week 48 as participants with confirmed HIV RNA &lt;400 c/mL through Week 48 without intervening virologic rebound or treatment discontinuation. Virologic rebound is defined as confirmed on-treatment HIV RNA &lt;400 c/mL or last on-treatment HIV RNA &lt;400 c/mL followed by discontinuation. Participants are considered failures in this analysis if they experienced virologic rebound at or before Week 48, discontinued before Week 48, never responded by Week 48, never received study therapy or had missing HIV RNA at Week 48 and beyond.</description>

        <description>MOS-HIV is developed to assess a participant's health and functional status associated with HIV infection. The questionnaire is applied to participants with adequate linguistic skills and consists of 35 items. The questionnaire derives an overall health score and 10 subscale scores (health transitions, pain, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, mental health, energy/fatigue, health distress and quality of life).The subscale and summary scores range from 0-100 with a higher score indicating better health.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 48</time_frame>
        <population>Participants analyzed are as-treated participants with evaluable baseline MOS-HIV. The 'n' is signifying those participants who were evaluated for this measure at the timepoint for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (BL) in Quality of Life as Measured by the Impact of Gastro-intestinal Toxicity at Week 4 (IBS-QoL)</title>
        <description>The IBS-QoL questionnaire has 34 items and an overall score and 8 subscale scores: dysphoria,interference with activity,body image,health worry, food avoidance,social reaction,sexual, and relationships. Overall and subscores transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=lowest score, 100=highest possible score). Scores between these values represent the percentage of the total possible score achieved. Higher scores=better IBS-related QoL. A 14-point change from BL in IBS-QoL score in women with moderate to severe functional bowel disorders is a minimally important difference based on pain and satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Measured by the Impact of Gastro-intestinal Toxicity at Week 12 (IBS-QoL)</title>
        <description>The IBS-QoL questionnaire has 34 items and an overall score and 8 subscale scores: dysphoria,interference with activity,body image,health worry, food avoidance,social reaction,sexual, and relationships. Overall and subscores transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=lowest score, 100=highest possible score). Scores between these values represent the percentage of the total possible score achieved. Higher scores=better IBS-related QoL. A 14-point change from BL in IBS-QoL score in women with moderate to severe functional bowel disorders is a minimally important difference based on pain and satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Adhered to Regimen as Measured by Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study Adherence Questionnaire (MACS) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The MACS adherence questionnaire asks patients how many medication doses they missed during the previous day, 2 days, 3 days and 4 days. Adherence to regimen was defined as taking 100% of medicine (all doses and numbers of pills as prescribed for each medicine). This strict adherence cut-off was based on the guidelines stating that anything less than excellent adherence may result in a virus breakthrough and development of resistance.</description>

        <description>The mean percent change from baseline in limb, trunk and total body fat was measured by DEXA. Limb fat: a physical sign of lipoatrophy, clinical improvement in limb fat is associated with a decrease in values.

Total body fat: association of many factors like trunk fat, limb fat, weight etc. Clinical improvement in total body fat cannot be predicted based solely an increase or decrease of these values.</description>

        <description>The change-from-baseline was defined as the difference between the averages of post-treatment time points (Weeks 48 and 96) and baseline. Association analysis for each SNP was performed using a minor allele carrier (MAC) composed of heterozygous and rare homozygous genotypes, and wild type (WT, common homozygous). False discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values were calculated for each phenotype-genotype pair. VAT and TAT were measured by computed tomography (CT).</description>
