      INCA (Intervention and Neuropsychology of Cannabis Abuse) is a study combining two research
      goals. One is to study efficacy of a short intervention the ‘Problem Profile Intervention’,
      which utilizes individual feedback from a ‘substance problem check-up’. Subjects will
      randomly receive the ‘Problem Profile Intervention’ or the WHO Brief Intervention, a brief
      intervention, which has been shown to be efficacious. Currently efficiency studies are under
      way. The WHO Brief Intervention has been translated into German by our group. In contrast to
      most other cannabis intervention studies the current study is focussed on cannabis abusers
      not so much cannabis-dependent subjects. A total of 160 subjects are to be recruited. Half of
      them will randomly receive either the Problem Profile Intervention or the WHO Brief
      Intervention (active control). A total of 25% of subjects from each group will be placed on a
      3 months waiting list before receiving the intervention (inactive control). Intervention
      outcome will be assessed three months, six month and 12 months after the intervention. We
      hypothesize cannabis use to be reduced by 25% by the 'Problem Profile Intervention'. The
      second aim of the study is to study mechanism of substance abuse. Initial results from own
      studies and data from other groups point to executive cognitive functions as a subtle but
      important factor that can be compromised in cannabis users (Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2004;
      Garavan and Stout, 2005). Using an fMRI-study, we intend to examine a subgroup of our
      subjects on a specific aspect of executive functioning that has recently received major
      interest in drug research: Decision-making capability, or risk-taking behaviour, respectively
      (e.g. Ernst and Paulus, 2005).
