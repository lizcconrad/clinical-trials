  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there have been no published reports of normal variations in tracheal dimensions for
      pediatric patients undergoing MRIs. While there are reports of normals in CT studies, the
      reported dimensions were for average areas and lengths over the entire length of the trachea
      and not for normal variation in the dimensions at various sites in the trachea. Moreover, CT
      measurements are likely not entirely applicable to MRI measurements. Since cardiac MRI has
      become the procedure of choice to document the presence of vascular rings as well as the
      significance of any ring that is found, there is a need for normal values to be generated.
      This would in turn permit physicians to determine in cases of documented vascular rings the
      severity of the tracheal stenosis/deformity if found.

      To date, there have been no published reports of normal variations in tracheal dimensions for
      pediatric patients undergoing MRIs. While there are reports of normals in CT studies, the
      reported dimensions were for average areas and lengths over the entire length of the trachea
      and not for normal variation in the dimensions at various sites in the trachea. Moreover, CT
      measurements are likely not entirely applicable to MRI measurements. Since cardiac MRI has
      become the procedure of choice to document the presence of vascular rings as well as the
      significance of any ring that is found, there is a need for normal values to be generated.
      This would in turn permit physicians to determine in cases of documented vascular rings the
      severity of the tracheal stenosis/deformity if found.

      Hypothesis: Patients referred for cardiac MRIs to evaluate vascular rings will have
      significantly smaller tracheal dimensions (area, longest width, shortest width) based on a
      percentage of their maximal tracheal dimension in comparison with patients referred for
      cardiac MRIs for other indications.

      I would propose to retrospectively review cardiac MRIs for tracheal dimensions in 25
      consecutive patients referred for possible vascular rings and for 50 consecutive patients
      undergoing cardiac MRIs for other indications. As part of this study I would also propose to
      review the clinical findings that prompted the cardiac MRI to be ordered (i.e. respiratory
      symptoms, abnormal echocardiogram, abnormal CXR or barium swallow).
