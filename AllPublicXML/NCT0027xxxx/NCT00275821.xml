    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Best-corrected Visual Acuity of the Study Eye at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed in both eyes at each study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction. VA measurements were taken in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at an initial testing distance of 4 meters.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein angiography was conducted in conjunction with color fundus photography at screening and at Months 6 and 12. Investigators used digital fluorescein angiograms to determine presence or absence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</description>

    <description>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was performed on both eyes at screening and monthly from baseline through Month 12 prior to study drug administration. OCT images were evaluated at the central reading center (CRC) by trained graders and ophthalmologists experienced in clinical trials.</description>
