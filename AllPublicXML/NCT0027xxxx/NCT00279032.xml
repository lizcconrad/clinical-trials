  <brief_title>GW406381 In Patients With Peripheral Nerve Injury</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomised, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Parallel Group Study to Investigate the Effects of Chronic Dose Oral GW406381 on Pain and Areas of Hyperalgesia and Allodynia in Patients With Peripheral Nerve Injury as a Result of Trauma or Surgery.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The findings from preclinical animal models confirm the peripheral
      anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of GW406381 and also suggest contribution of a central
      site of action to the anti-hyperalgesic efficacy that may not be shared by other COX-2
      inhibitors. A central action is consistent with distribution of GW406381 into the CNS in
      animals. Furthermore, preliminary data from a positron emission tomography study in which 6
      healthy male volunteers received a tracer dose of 11C labelled GW406381 indicate that
      GW406381 is rapidly absorbed into the central nervous system in man.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Baseline average daily Pain Score of greater than or equal to 4 (averaged over the 7
             days prior to Treatment Visit 1), as reported on the 11 point pain intensity numerical
             rating scale.

          -  Subjects on medications for neuropathic pain or received nerve blocks for neuropathic
             pain.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Known history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to acetaminophen, paracetamol,
             aspirin, COX-2 inhibitors or NSAIDs.

          -  Subject is unable to discontinue NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors (except aspirin as a
             cardioprotective; certain doses apply), topical lidocaine and topical capsaicin for
             the treatment of pain for the period prior to randomization and for the duration of
             the study.

          -  Subject is unable to refrain from sedative use during the study (benzodiazepines
             prescribed as hypnotic sleep agents allowed).

          -  Subject is unable to refrain from nerve blocks for 4 weeks prior to randomisation and
             during the study.
