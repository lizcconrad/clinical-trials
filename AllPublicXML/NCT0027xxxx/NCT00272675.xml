      Does chlorhexidine gluonate, a simple broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent with virtually no
      adverse-effects lower the incidence of NI after cardiac surgery, especially with respect to
      LTI and SSI?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nosocomial infections (NIs) after open heart surgery are recognized as an important cause of
      morbidity and mortality with a prolonged hospital stay, increased need for of antibiotics,
      decreased quality of life and higher concomitant costs. Decontamination of the oropharynx
      seems important, since there is direct evidence of an association between pulmonary infection
      and oral health. Another important strategy involves the eradication of Staphylococcus
      aureus, the most important pathogen causing SSI. The most common reservoir of S.aureus is the
      anterior nares and eradication can be achieved by the application of topical antibiotics.
      Although promising results have been reported for both strategies, they are not widely used
      as routine prevention methods because of the variability of trial design, the concern about
      the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and increased costs. Further research is essential
      to evaluate different protocols, antimicrobial agents and cost-effectiveness.

      Fur this purpose, we designed a clinical trial to study wether a simple broad-spectrum
      antimicrobial agent with virtually no adverse-effects would lower the incidence of NI after
      cardiac surgery, especially with respect to LTI and SSI.

      Comparison(s): Oropharyngeal and nasal decontamination with chlorhexidine compared to placebo
      in patients after cardiothoracic surgery
