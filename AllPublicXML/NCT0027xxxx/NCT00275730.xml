  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostaglandins (PG) are known to alter regional ocular blood flow and exhibit vasoactive
      properties in isolated ocular blood vessels. A variety of animal experiments indicate that
      endogenous PGs play a role in the regulation of retinal (RBF) and choroidal (ChBF) blood
      flow. There is also evidence that the prostaglandin pathway is involved in the activation of
      NO production in humans, however, the mechanisms for interactions between PG and NO in ocular
      vasculature are still unclear.

      Animal studies suggest that retinal and choroidal blood flow decrease after administration of
      indomethacin (a nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor). More recently, it has been shown that
      indomethacin injected intravenously decreased optic nerve oxygen tension and reduced the CO2
      reactivity. This is probably the result of decreased blood flow through vasoconstriction of
      vessels in the optic nerve. Systemic administration of indomethacin also diminishes cerebral,
      renal and mesenteric blood flow by an unknown mechanism. However, no clinical trials exist so
      far investigating the effects of indomethacin on ocular blood flow. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to investigate the effect of indomethacin on ocular blood flow in healthy
      humans.
