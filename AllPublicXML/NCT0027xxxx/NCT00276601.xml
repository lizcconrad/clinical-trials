      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy works in
      treating patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the safety of incorporating arsenic trioxide (ATO) into
           cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride-based consolidation therapy followed by
           tretinoin maintenance therapy in patients receiving induction tretinoin and daunorubicin
           hydrochloride with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) induced into remission with
           tretinoin and daunorubicin hydrochloride.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this strategy in inducing and maintaining
           molecular remissions in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive oral tretinoin twice daily on days 1-60 and
           daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 4, 6, and 8. Patients are evaluated between days
           60-67 and proceed to consolidation therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-3,
           daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, and arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours once
           daily, 5 days a week, beginning on day 8 and continuing for 6 weeks. Patients with
           clinical and/or cytogenic, but not molecular, remission receive additional arsenic
           trioxide once daily, 5 days a week, for 30 doses (6 weeks). Patients achieving clinical
           and molecular remission after completion of 6 or 12 weeks of arsenic trioxide proceed to
           maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral tretinoin once daily on days 1-15. Treatment
           repeats every 3 months for 8 courses (2 years).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by morphologic and flow cytometric
             documentation (high orthogonal light scatter, lack of HLA-DR expression)

               -  Patients with classical APL as well as the microgranular variant (M3V) are
                  eligible

                    -  In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, consultation with a
                       hematopathologist is required before enrolling the patient in the study

          -  Patients found to have cytogenetic abnormalities that do not produce the PML-RARÎ± gene
             rearrangement will be removed from study and will not be included in data analysis

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Patients will not be excluded because of performance status or comorbid disease

          -  Premenopausal female patients must have a negative pregnancy test

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  No prior chemotherapy for APL except hydroxyurea
