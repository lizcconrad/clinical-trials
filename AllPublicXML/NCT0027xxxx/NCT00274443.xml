      This is a multicenter study conducted at study sites in Russia and the Ukraine where various
      doses of ABI-007 (Abraxane) will be given in combination with carboplatin to patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer to determine the recommended dose and schedule for this
      combination therapy for Phase III trials. The primary objective of this study is to obtain
      preliminary information on the antitumor activity and adverse events of ABI-007 in
      combination with carboplatin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC Stage IIIB with pleural effusion or
             evidence of inoperable local recurrence or metastasis (Stage IV).

          -  Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female, and ≥ 18 years of age. ( )If a female
             patient is of child-bearing potential, as evidenced by regular menstrual periods, she
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test (β-hCG) documented within 72 hours of the
             first administration of study drug. ( )If sexually active, the patient must agree to
             utilize contraception considered adequate and appropriate by the investigator.

          -  No other current active malignancy.

          -  Measurable disease

          -  Patients must have received no prior therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease.

          -  Patient has the following blood counts at baseline:

        ( ) ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L; ( ) platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L; ( ) Hgb ≥ 9 g/dL.

          -  Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at baseline:

        ( ) AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal range (ULN); ( ) total bilirubin
        NORMAL; ( ) creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL.

          -  Expected survival of &gt; 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Patient or his/her legally authorized representative or guardian has been informed
             about the nature of the study, and has agreed to participate in the study, and signed
             the Informed Consent form prior to participation in any study-related activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active brain metastases, including leptomeningeal involvement. Prior
             evidence of brain metastasis permitted only if treated and stable off therapy for at
             least 1 month.

          -  The only evidence of metastasis is bone metastases or other nonmeasurable disease.

          -  Patient has pre-existing peripheral neuropathy of grade 2, 3, or 4.

          -  Patient received radiotherapy in last 4 weeks, except if to a non-target lesion only.
             Prior radiation to a target lesion is permitted only if there has been clear
             progression of the lesion since radiation was completed.

          -  Patient has a clinically significant concurrent illness.

          -  Patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to be able to complete the study
             through the End of Study visit.

          -  Patient has received treatment with any other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent or
             investigational drug within the previous 4 weeks;

          -  Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug.

          -  Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems such
             that the investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive an experimental
             research drug.

          -  Patient is enrolled in any other clinical protocol or investigational trial.
