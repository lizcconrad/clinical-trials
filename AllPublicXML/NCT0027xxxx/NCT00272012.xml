      Primary objective:

      The primary study objective is to compare efficacy of Insulin glulisine, once a day at
      breakfast vs. Insulin glulisine given once a day at main meal in combination with insulin
      glargine + OAD in terms of change in HbA1c, from baseline to endpoint for the individual
      patient. The aim of the study is to demonstrate two-sided equivalence between the two therapy
      regimens receiving two different injection timing of Insulin glulisine.

      Secondary objective:

      Secondary study objectives are to compare efficacy and safety of Insulin glulisine, once a
      day at breakfast vs. Insulin glulisine given once a day at main meal in combination with
      insulin glargine + OAD in terms of:

        -  Change of fasting-, pre-/2h-postprandial-, mean daily and nocturnal blood glucose
           (baseline to endpoint)

        -  Change of fasting plasma glucose (baseline to endpoint)

        -  Response rate: Responders will be those patients with HbA1c smaller than 7.0% at study
           endpoint

        -  Insulin dose (rapid-acting, basal and total daily doses)

        -  Weight, body-mass index

        -  Hypoglycemic events

        -  Adverse events

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, previously treated with combination therapy of insulin
             glargine + OAD (maximal tolerated dose / approved in combination with insulin
             according to local SPCs (Summary of Product Characteristics), not including use of
             a-glucosidase inhibitors) for at least 3 months

          -  Pre-screening HbA1c value greater/equal 7% - smaller/equal 9%

          -  FBG (Fasting Blood Glucose) smaller/equal 120 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/l)

          -  Women are either not of childbearing potential (surgically sterile, or postmenopausal
             for more than 2 years) or are not pregnant and agree to use a reliable contraceptive
             measure for the duration of the study. Reliable contraceptive measures include the
             following: systemic contraceptive (oral, implant, injections), diaphragm with
             intravaginal spermicide, cervical cap, intrauterine device, or condom with spermicide.

          -  Ability and willingness to perform blood glucose monitoring using the sponsor-provided
             blood glucose meter and subject diary at home

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  More than two FBG greater 120 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/l) as measured on 5 consecutive days
             before visit II

          -  Active proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as defined by the application of focal or
             panretinal photocoagulation or vitrectomy, in the 6 months prior to visit 1, or any
             other unstable (rapidly progressing) retinopathy that may require surgical treatment
             (including laser photocoagulation)

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, neurologic, endocrine, or other major
             systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study
             results difficult

          -  Known impaired hepatic and renal function

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  History of hypersensitivity to insulin or insulin analogues or any of the excipients
             in the Insulin glulisine formulation

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug in the last month before visit I

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women, or women planning to become pregnant during the
             study

          -  Treatment or likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not
