  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe's disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II, is a genetic disorder due to
      deficiency of acid glucosidase (GAA), which results in lysosomal glycogen storage in various
      tissues.

      Very low levels of GAA usually present in infancy, lead to a progressive cardiac and skeletal
      muscle disorder and death before age 1 year.

      Most infants develop massive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which progresses to dilated
      cardiomyopathy and cardiorespiratory arrest.

      3D echocardiography can be a simple, non-invasive method of following cardiac disease
      progression in infantile Pompe's disease.

      We report the utilization of real-time 3D echocardiography and new in-line software to
      calculate cardiac mass, volume and function in two cases of infantile Pompe's Disease.
      Furthermore, the multi-dimension cine loop showed the severity of cavity obliteration during
      the cardiac cycle.

      We present 2 cases seen at our institution between January - February, 2005 in infants ages 1
      and 5 months, both with cardiac signs as initial presentation. The younger infant had
      cardiomegaly since birth and was hospitalized briefly for respiratory distress at 1 month.
      The older infant, diagnosed at 4 months with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was hospitalized
      after cardiac arrest one month later. Both children had various tests done during the course
      of diagnosis and treatment, including GAA enzyme assay, cardiac catheterization,
      endomyocardial biopsy, developmental assessment, genetic evaluation, EKG, CXR and
      echocardiography.
