      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Colony-stimulating factors, such as
      pegfilgrastim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral
      blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving
      rituximab and cyclophosphamide together with pegfilgrastim may be effective in treating
      leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving rituximab and cyclophosphamide
      together with pegfilgrastim works in treating patients with B-cell leukemia, low-grade
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or mantle cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of high-dose cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and pegfilgrastim in
           patients with B-cell leukemia or low-grade or mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the molecular response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 4, 8,11, 45, and 52,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 15-18, and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 19 or
      20 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  One of the following B-cell leukemias or lymphomas, as defined by World Health
             Organization criteria:

               -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma

               -  B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia

               -  Lymphoplasmacytic leukemia

               -  Marginal zone lymphoma (splenic, extranodal, or nodal)

               -  Follicular lymphoma (grade 1 or 2)

               -  Mantle cell lymphoma

          -  No more than minimal (approximately 10%) morphologically identifiable cancer cells on
             bone marrow biopsy

               -  When cancer cells are morphologically difficult to distinguish from normal cells,
                  flow cytometry must show no more than 10% identifiable cancer cells

          -  Must have received ≤ 12 months of prior cytotoxic therapy, achieving at least a
             partial response NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
             has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will
             replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma.
             However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
