  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic joint infection is a devastating complication of total joint arthroplasty
      ultimately leading to the failure of the total joint arthroplasty function and possibly
      death. Optimal treatment requires the resection of the infected total joint arthroplasty
      followed by prolonged parenteral antimicrobial therapy. This procedure is followed by
      reimplantation of a new total joint arthroplasty at a later date. Surgical debridement and
      retention of the infected total joint arthroplasty offers a more conservative surgical
      approach and has been proven to be cost-effective in selected groups of patients. Traditional
      medical therapy for staphylococcal infection would require an initial parenteral
      antimicrobial followed by chronic oral non-rifampin containing antimicrobial suppression
      regimen for the life of the total joint arthroplasty. With this strategy the success rate is
      close to 30%. Recently, several prospective studies of patients with THA, TKA and fracture
      fixation device infections conducted in Europe showed that the success rate with a 3-6 month
      course of a quinolone-rifampin combination is effective in 70% to 100% of cases. The proposed
      study will be a prospective open label observational cohort that will evaluate the outcome of
      Patients with S. aureus PJI treated with a medical regimen that includes oral levofloxacin-
      rifampin and debridement and retention of components. This medical regimen was approved for
      use by the Orthopedic Infectious Diseases focus group, Mayo Clinic, Rochester. 15 patients
      will be enrolled over a one-year period and followed up to minimum of 1 additional year. The
      outcome of this group will be compared to a historical group that is treated with traditional
      therapy.
