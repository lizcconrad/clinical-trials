  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test whether adding brief counseling visits with an ancillary health care
      provider (a nurse or nursing assistant) will induce additional weight loss, as compared with
      quarterly physician visits alone. All visits will take place at the site of usual patient
      care (i.e., the primary care clinic).
