    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in infants and children with acute otitis media, 6 months to less
      than 7 years old, in Costa Rica and Israel. The primary objective of this trial will be to
      describe bacteriologic efficacy in those with initial culture positive specimens with
      different dosages of faropenem
