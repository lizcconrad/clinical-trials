  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this safety study is to evaluate NATRECORÂ® hBNP (a recombinant form of the
      natural human peptide normally secreted by the heart in response to heart failure), in
      subjects with worsening congestive heart failure for whom inpatient intravenous therapy with
      medications that influence the tone and caliber of blood vessels is deemed appropriate.

    <textblock>
      The data from these previous studies suggest that doses of NATRECOR® hBNP may be a potent
      agent for the treatment of acute congestive heart failure (CHF) with a unique combination of
      desirable effects on the flow of blood throughout the body; the hormones secreted by the
      nervous system; and support of copious salt outputs by the renal system not provided by
      currently available therapies. The purpose of this safety study is to evaluate NATRECOR® hBNP
      in subjects with symptomatic, decompensated congestive heart failure for whom inpatient
      intravenous therapy with medications that influence the tone and caliber of blood vessels
      (other than, or in addition to, IV diuretics) is deemed appropriate. This is a multi-center,
      randomized, open-label, safety study designed to compare two doses of NATRECOR® hBNP for the
      treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure. One treatment group receives NATRECOR®
      hBNP fixed-dose infusion IV bolus of 0.3 µg/kg followed by a 0.015 µg/kg/min infusion; group
      two receives IV bolus of 0.6 µg/kg followed by a 0.03 µg/kg/min infusion. The duration of
      NATRECOR® hBNP therapy is determined by the attending physician. The study hypothesis is that
      doses of NATRECOR® hBNP in the range of 0.015 to 0.03 µg/kg/min provide an optimal
      safety/efficacy profile for the treatment of decompensated CHF. One treatment group receives
      NATRECOR® hBNP fixed-dose infusion IV bolus of 0.3 µg/kg followed by a 0.015 µg/kg/min
      infusion; group two receives IV bolus of 0.6 µg/kg followed by a 0.03 µg/kg/min infusion. The
      duration of NATRECOR® hBNP therapy is determined by the attending physician.

          -  presenting with symptomatic, decompensated CHF for inpatient intravenous therapy with
             medications that influence the tone and caliber of blood vessels (other than, or in

             pericarditis or primary pulmonary hypertension

          -  being treated with intravenous (IV) therapy with medications that influence the tone
             and caliber of blood vessels for &gt; 4 hours for this episode of CHF

          -  already being treated with IV therapy with medications that influence the tone and
             caliber of blood vessels that cannot be discontinued

          -  having cardiogenic shock, systolic blood pressure consistently &lt; 90 mm Hg or other
             significant blood circulation instability.
