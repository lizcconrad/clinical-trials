      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and docetaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with docetaxel
      works in treating patients with recurrent stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent stage IIIB and IV non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel.

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes followed by docetaxel
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 51 patients will be accrued for this study.
