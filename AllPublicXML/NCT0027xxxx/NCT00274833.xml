  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Erlotinib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving radiation
      therapy together with temozolomide and erlotinib after surgery may kill any remaining tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy together with
      temozolomide and erlotinib works in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with newly
           diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, temozolomide, and
           erlotinib hydrochloride.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-42 and undergo concurrent
      radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Four weeks after
      completion of radiotherapy and temozolomide, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on
      days 1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral erlotinib
      hydrochloride once daily beginning on day 1 of radiotherapy and continuing in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Erlotinib is available as 25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg tablets. It should be administered orally once daily at the prescribed dose specified in the clinical study protocol per dose escalation schema. Preferably, erlotinib should be taken in the morning with up to 200 mL of water at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.</description>
