      metformin and lifestyle modification in preventing the conversion to diabetes

      Lifestyle modification helps in primary prevention of diabetes in multiethnic Americans,
      Finnish and Chinese populations. In a prospective community based study, we tested if the
      conversion to diabetes could be influenced by interventions in native Asian Indians with
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) who were younger, leaner and more insulin resistant than the
      above populations.

      We randomized 531 (Men : Women, 421 : 110) subjects with IGT [mean age of 45.9 + 5.7 years
      and body mass index (BMI) of 25.8 + 3.5 kg/m2 into four groups. Group 1 was the control
      (CON), Group 2 was advised lifestyle modification (LSM), Group 3 was treated with metformin
      (MET) and Group 4 with LSM plus MET. Primary outcome measure was type 2 diabetes diagnosed by
      the WHO criteria.

      In a median follow up of 30 months, three year cumulative incidence of diabetes were 55.0%,
      39.3%, 40.5% and 39.5% in group 1 to 4 respectively. The relative risk reduction was 28.5%
      with LSM (95 % confidence interval (CI), (20.5 - 37.3), (p=0.018), 26.4% with MET (95% CI,
      19.1 - 35.1) (p = 0.029) and 28.2% with LSM plus MET (95% CI, 20.3 - 37.0), (P=0.022) versus
      control group. The numbers needed to treat to prevent one incident case of diabetes were 6.4
      for LSM, 6.9 for MET and 6.5 for LSM+MET.

      Conversion of IGT to diabetes is high in native Asian Indians. LSM and metformin
      significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes in Asian Indians with IGT. There was no added
      benefit by combining both.
