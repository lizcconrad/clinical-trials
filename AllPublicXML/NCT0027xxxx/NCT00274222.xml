  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the hypothesis that nebulized budesonide) might be an
      alternative to systemic corticosteroids (SC) in the treatment of patients with acute
      exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients, hospitalized with AECOPD, were randomized into three groups. Group I received only
      bronchodilator treatment (BDT), Group II received SC (40 mg prednisolon) plus BDT, and Group
      III received nebulized budesonide (NB)(1500 mcg qid) plus BDT. Improvement rates in multiple
      parameters during 10-day hospitalization, and acute exacerbation and re-hospitalization rates
      within one-month after discharge were compared between the groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  COPD patients who were admitted to our pulmonary department for an acute exacerbation
             were prospectively enrolled in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  COPD patients hospitalized with specific reasons like pneumonia, pulmonary emboli,
             congestive heart failure, pneumothorax etc. as the cause of acute exacerbation, or
             patients with risk of imminent respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or
             direct admission to the ICU were excluded.
