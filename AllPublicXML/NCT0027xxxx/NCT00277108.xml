      Primary objectives: Remission of Major Depression: To determine the efficacy of a flexibly
      titrated dose of Escitalopram (10mg to 20 mg) in the treatment of women with postpartum
      depression. The primary outcome measure will be remission of major depression, defined as a
      score of 12 or less on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale. A score of 7 or less on the
      Hamilton Depression Scale (21 item) will be used as a secondary measure of remission. The
      null hypothesis is that flexibly dosed Escitalopram does not lead to remission of major
      depression based on total MADRS scores after 8 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To determine if treatment with Escitalopram is effective in achieving significant
           reduction in symptoms of postpartum depression as measured on several instruments: HAM-D
           21, CGI, Beck Depression Inventory, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Specifically,
           a response will be defined as a reduction of the total scores of 50% or more from
           baseline on the MADRS or HAM-D 21.

        2. To determine the tolerability, safety and some dosing considerations for Escitalopram in
           this special subpopulation of depressed patients. Adverse events data (clinical and
           laboratory), compliance and early termination will be used as outcome measures.

        3. To determine in a post-hoc analysis if pre-study anxiety levels as measured with HAM-A
           correlate with primary and secondary outcomes.
