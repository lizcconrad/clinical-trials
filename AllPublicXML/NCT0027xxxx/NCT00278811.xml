      The purpose of this study is to compare two different kinds of follow-up care and their
      effects on psychiatric service use and psychological well-being. This randomized, controlled
      trial of subjects discharged from the psychiatric emergency services to outpatient care
      receive traditional hospital-based outpatient clinic referrals (treatment as usual) or
      appointments for community-based follow-up by a mobile crisis team.

      There are subgroups of patients who only seek care in emergency settings. An effective
      strategy to link that group to ambulatory care involves extending contact with psychiatric
      emergency services beyond the initial hospital-based visit. The &quot;window of opportunity&quot; to
      promote successful treatment linkage is brief. This is a study of a novel treatment format
      that seeks to expand the concept of the emergency contact, the study patients method of
      entering the mental health system of care, and by doing this, enhance retention in prescribed
      outpatient care. The effects of the intervention on patient symptoms and mental health
      service use will be examined.
