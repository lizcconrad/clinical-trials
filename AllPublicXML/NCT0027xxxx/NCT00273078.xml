  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is about tongue’s pressure during speech, using a complete denture which allows
      respecting tongue and speech physiology at the best.

      A strain gauge transducer is placed inside this prosthodontics device. During speech, the
      pressure and the sounds are recording. The analysis of the twos signals should explain what
      pressure is needed for what sound. The comparison between old complete denture wearers and
      new one is realized to provide informations about tongue adaptation’s phenomenon.
