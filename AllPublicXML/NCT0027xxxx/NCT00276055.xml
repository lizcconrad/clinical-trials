  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has shown impressive activity in soft
      tissue sarcoma, we hypothesize that the addition of an antiangiogenesis agent (bevacizumab)
      would enhance the anticancer activity, as shown in other tumor types.

    <description>During the treatment phase, pts. will receive the drug combination of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and bevacizumab every 2 weeks for a period of 4 weeks. This 4-week period is called a cycle of treatment. The treatment consists of receiving docetaxel IV over a 60-minute period and gemcitabine IV over a 30-minute period. Pts. will then receive bevacizumab IV over a 30-minute period. Pts. will receive this treatment once every 2 weeks. Pts. will receive at least 2 cycles of treatment unless you have progression of your disease or unmanageable side effects. As long as the size of pts.'s tumor stays the same or gets smaller, pts may continue receiving treatment</description>
