      To compare the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, estrogen and placebo in the treatment of
      hot flashes and other climacteric symptoms.

      HRT is associated with an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events, breast cancer and
      cardiovascular events. Safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative therapies for hot
      flashes are needed. Gabapentin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-analog that we have
      reported is associated with a reduction in the frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal
      women who were taking gabapentin for other indications. However, it is not known whether the
      efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms is
      comparable to that of estrogen, the gold standard. For this study, 60 subjects are to be
      recruited and randomized into 3 arms of 20 each (gabapentin, estrogen and placebo).We will
      perform an analysis of the results after all 60 subjects have been recruited, screened,
      enrolled and completed the study. The investigators of the study continue to be blinded to
      the study groups and their randomization. To determine if gabapentin approaches the efficacy
      of estrogen in the treatment of hot flashes,postmenopausal women between ages 35 and 60 with
      7-20 moderate-severe postmenopausal hot flashes/day will be randomized into a double-blinded
      placebo controlled trial of estrogen, gabapentin and placebo. All patients must meet
      stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pre- and post-study hot flash diaries, depression
      and climacteria scales will be collected. Patients are required to undergo physical
      examination and blood work and to complete a daily hot flash and medication compliance
      records. Hot flash frequency and composite score for hot flashes will be calculated for the
      three groups based on the hot flash diary. Side effects, climacteric scale and depression
      scales will also be used.
