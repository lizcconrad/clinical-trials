  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted at multiple sites to determine the activity, safety,
      and tolerability of XL999 when given weekly to patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). XL999 is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple kinases including VEGFR, PDGFR,
      FGFR, FLT-3, and Src, which are involved in tumor cell growth, formation of new blood vessels
      (angiogenesis), and metastasis.

    <description>• The Study Treatment Period, in which subjects received a once-weekly, 4-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of XL999 at 2.4 mg/kg as outpatients for 8 weeks. Treatment was to be stopped at the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
