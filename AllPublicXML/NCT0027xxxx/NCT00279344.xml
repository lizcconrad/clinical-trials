      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine non-inferiority of FITpatch with regard to efficacy compared to standard
           opioid treatment

        -  To assess the safety of FITpatch compared to standard opioid treatment

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the intake of oral morphine as rescue analgesic to FITpatch compared to
           standard opioid treatment

        -  To assess Quality of life reported with FITpatch compared to standard opioid treatment

          9. Not participating in other clinical trials.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All exclusion criteria must be answered No for a patient to participate in the trial.

          1. Does the patient have significant skin lesions on the upper arms/flat surface of the
             upper torso or diffuse skin disease (psoriasis or eczema) that preclude application of
             fentanyl patches?

          2. Does the patient have a known abuse of drug, narcotic or alcohol?

          3. Is the patient pregnant or nursing?

          4. Has the patient neurological or mental impairment that may compromise data collection?

          5. Is the patient hypersensitive/allergic to fentanyl or morphine or any of the
             ingredients in the trial medication?

          6. Has the patient any major head injury, primary brain tumour, increased intracranial
             pressure or impaired consciousness?

          7. Does the patient participate in other clinical with other investigational drugs or
             investigation al medical devices or has been participating in such a trial for the
