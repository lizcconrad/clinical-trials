      Trial to evaluate steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine 150mg/m2 and
      nevirapine 4 or 7 mg/kg after 4 weeks, and efficacy and safety of the dosing when
      administered for 48 weeks in antiretroviral drug naïve paediatric patients.

      A randomised open label multi-centre trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, efficacy and
      safety parameters of nevirapine 150mg/m2 and nevirapine 4 or 7mg/kg when administered in
      combination with ZDV and 3TC for 48 weeks in antiretroviral naive pediatric patients.

      Primary objective: To evaluate steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine 150mg/m2
      in antiretroviral drug naive pediatric patients.

      Secondary objective: To assess efficacy and safety of nevirapine 150 mg/m2 and nevirapine
      4/7mg/kg after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment

      Study Hypothesis:

      Evaluation of recent pharmacokinetic data has suggested that a dose based on body surface
      area rather than body weight might be a better therapeutic regimen to achieve steady state
      plasma concentrations. The goal in this study was to determine if a Nevirapine suspension
      dose of 150 mg/m2 BID, following a two week lead-in of 150 mg/m2 QD, produces plasma
      nevirapine steady state concentrations of 4 - 6 ?g/mL in all age groups as was observed in
      adult safety and efficacy trials.
