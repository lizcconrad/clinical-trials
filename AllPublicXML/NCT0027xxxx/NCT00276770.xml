      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography using fluorothymidine
      F 18, may be effective in finding recurrent disease in patients with gliomas.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well positron emission tomography using
      fluorothymidine F 18 works in finding recurrent disease in patients with gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of fluorothymidine F 18 for visual and dynamic brain tumor images
           in patients with glial neoplasms.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Compare, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug to fludeoxyglucose F 18 in
           differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis.

        -  Determine the optimal time to image post injection of this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive fluorothymidine F 18 IV over 1 minute and then undergo positron emission
      tomography (PET) scanning of the brain over 2 hours.

      After completion of the PET scan, patients are followed for at least 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
