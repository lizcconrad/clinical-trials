  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the whether epoetin alfa stimulates the bone marrow
      to produce red blood cells and therefore increases a patient's ability to self-donate blood
      prior to major surgery. Epoetin alfa is a genetically engineered protein that stimulates red
      blood cell production.

    <textblock>
      Major surgical procedures may require several units of blood. Blood transfusions from other
      people may be associated with transfusion reactions that cause fever or uncommonly,
      blood-borne infections. However, self-blood collections may cause anemia in a patient who
      will be undergoing surgery a few weeks later. Previous research with epoetin alfa suggests
      that it increases the rate of red blood cell production and has a beneficial effect on
      anemia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 21-day study is designed to
      determine whether intravenous epoetin alfa will stimulate a patient's bone marrow to produce
      red blood cells and therefore increase a patient's ability to self-donate blood prior to
      major surgery for joint disease. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either epoetin
      alfa 600 units per kilogram of body weight or a matching volume of placebo injected into a
      vein on the first study day and every 3 to 4 days thereafter for 21 days, for a total of 6
      doses. The primary measures of effectiveness will be determined by the number of units of
      blood that can be obtained from patients during the study, the change in hemoglobin and
      hematocrit from pre-study to post-study, and the number of transfusions required around the
      time of surgery. Safety will be evaluated based on laboratory tests, vital signs, and the
      incidence and severity of any adverse or unusual experiences associated with drug
      administration. The study hypothesis is that patients treated with epoetin alfa will be able
      to donate more units of blood for their own surgery while receiving epoetin alfa than
      patients receiving placebo. Epoetin alfa 600 units per kilogram or an equal volume of placebo
      injected into a vein on the first day of the study, and every 3 to 4 days thereafter until
      day 21, for a total of 6 doses.
