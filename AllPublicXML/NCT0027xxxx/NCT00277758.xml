  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a treatment study trial, in which we will assess the safety and tolerability of daily
      dose IL-2, as monotherapy for 12 weeks, followed by IL2 in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV
      for 48 weeks in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study of 12 weeks of IL-2 lead in immunotherapy followed by 48 weeks
      of IL2 immunotherapy in combination with Pegylated Interferon Alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha)
      /Ribavirin (RBV) antiviral therapy for the treatment of individuals infected with Hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) genotype I. The study is designed to determine whether immunotherapy
      immunotherapy with low dose daily IL-2 can be safely added to the standard antiviral therapy
      of 48 weeks of PEG-IFN and RBV. Because IL-2 targets recently antigen- activated T cells,
      IL-2 therapy will be initiated 12 weeks before PEG-IFN/RBV therapy, when HCV antigen load is
      high, to activate and expand HCV antigen-specific T cells prior to the initiation of
      antiviral therapy.

          -  Hemoglobin ≥12 g/dL for women and ≥13 g/dL for men

          -  Subject must agree not to participate in a conception process (defined as active
             attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, donate sperm, in vitro fertilization
             etc.) while on study drugs and for 6 months following permanent discontinuation of
             study therapy.

        Women of reproductive potential (defined for this study as sexually mature women who have
        not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, or have not undergone
        hysterectomy or oophorectomy) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a
        sensitivity of at least 50 MIU/mL performed within 30 days prior to enrollment and again
        within 24 hours before initiating study therapy.

        All subjects must not participate in a conception process, and if participating in sexual
        activity that could lead to pregnancy, male subjects must take every precaution to avoid
        risk of pregnancy for their female partners, women subjects/male partners must use two
        reliable methods of contraception simultaneously, while receiving study therapy and for 6
        months following permanent discontinuation of study therapy.

        NOTE A: Reliable forms of contraception are a combination of two of the following methods:
        1) condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent. 2) diaphragm or cervical
        cap with spermicide, 3) IUD, or 4) hormonal-based contraception.

        NOTE B: An IUD is an adequate method of contraception but increases the risk of pelvic
        inflammatory disease.

             Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen (HBsAg) positivity, or positive plasma HBV DNA by

             HIV assay (PCR or bDNA)

          -  Cardiac condition that cannot be controlled by medication: Because of the risk of
             anemia associated with RBV use and the potential to induce cardiac ischemia, subjects
             with a positive cardiac stress test are ineligible. Therefore, subjects &gt; 40 years of
             age with ≥ 1 risk factor for ASHD (i.e., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking
             history, family history) should have an EKG preformed. If the EKG is abnormal and
             consistent with ischemic heart disease, the subject should have a cardiac stress test
             to R/O ASHD.

          -  CNS or psychiatric illness uncontrolled by medication. In particular, psychiatric
             illness, especially depression. Subjects with a psychiatric illness, a previous

             discretion of the investigator.

          -  Concurrent therapy with any immune-modulating agents, e.g,. interleukins, interferons,
             therapeutic vaccines, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine,

          -  Heroin or cocaine use within 9 months of enrollment.

          -  Inadequate venous access.

        NOTE: If screening TSH is abnormal, obtain free thyroxin index. If the free thyroxine index
        is normal, the subject may enter the study. If the free thyroxin index is low, the subject
        may be treated with thyroid hormone replacement medication and enter the study once the
        free thyroxin index is corrected. If the free thyroxin index is elevated indicating
        hyperthyroidism, the subject should not enroll in the study.

        Patients with preexistent antibodies against thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin should not
        be enrolled.
