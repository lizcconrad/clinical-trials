      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      single-agent AT-101 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. For the
      purpose of this study, B-cell malignancies can include one of the following disease
      sub-types: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell
      lymphoma (MCL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients will
      be enrolled according to disease subtype into one of four groups in two stages. The first
      stage of each group will enrolled 13 patients. If patients within any group experience
      disease response, an additional 14 patients will be enrolled into that group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a histologically confirmed B-cell malignancy (defined as FL [any grade],
             DLBCL, MCL or SLL/CLL);

          -  Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females age â‰¥18 years;

          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.;

          -  Have failed at least one prior therapy and have documentation of either, relapsed
             disease, or refractory disease (i.e., no response or stable disease on their last
             regimen of therapy);

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1;

          -  All clinically significant toxicities from prior therapy must have fully resolved;

          -  Must have discontinued treatment with monoclonal antibodies for a minimum of 90 days
             prior to first dose of AT-101, or have objective documentation of disease progression
             if within 90 days of monoclonal antibody administration;

          -  Patients with FL, DLBCL, MCL, and SLL with normal lymphocyte counts must have at least
             one bi-dimensional lesion that is radiographically measurable (skin lesions, palpable
             lymph nodes, and bone marrow as the only site of disease are not considered measurable
             disease);

          -  Patients with SLL whose lymphocytes are elevated at baseline or CLL must have palpable
             lymph nodes and/or disease localized to the bone marrow per the NCI-Sponsored Working
             Group Guidelines for CLL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Requirement of systemic corticosteroids within 7 days prior to and during AT-101
             administration;

          -  Must not have received anti-cancer therapy within 28 days of first dose of AT-101.
             Cannot have received hormonal agents or biologic dose modifiers (with the exception of
             HRT) or any investigational treatments within 28 days of treatment with AT-101;

          -  Patients with CNS lymphoma, HIV-related lymphoma, symptoms suggesting HIV infection or
             active auto-immune hemolytic anemia are excluded;

          -  Previous treatment with gossypol, or are hypersensitive to its excipient are excluded;

          -  Patients who have an uncontrolled, concurrent illness are also excluded.
