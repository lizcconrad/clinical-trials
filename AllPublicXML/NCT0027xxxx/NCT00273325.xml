      Premature infants are at a high risk for pneumonia. The PCV-7 vaccine effectively prevents
      the invasive disease from Streptococcus pneumoniae in full-term infants, but was not
      thoroughly studied in premature infants. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of
      the vaccine given in routine practice to very low birth weight infants, looking at blood
      antibody levels 4-6 weeks after the final vaccine dose, and adverse events, survival,
      infections, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-22 months corrected age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae causes an estimated 10-25% of all pneumonias in the United States,
      and is responsible for an estimated 40,000 deaths per year. Invasive pneumococcal disease has
      a peak incidence of 235/100,000 among children aged 6-11 months. Pneumococcal meningitis
      carries a higher risk of death (15%) or neurodevelopmental impairment (12-28%) than Hib or
      Neisseria meningitides.

      Premature infants are at a higher risk for invasive disease with Streptococcus pneumoniae.
      The heptavalent pneumococcal-CRM197 conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) effectively prevents invasive
      pneumococcal disease in full-term infants, but was been incompletely studied in premature
      infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that &quot;prematurely born infants,
      including infants of low birth weight, should be immunized at the usual chronological age in
      most cases&quot;, but cautions that &quot;some studies suggest a reduced immune response in very
      low-birth-weight infants (&lt;1500 g).&quot;

      This observational study assessed the effectiveness of the PCV-7 vaccine to generate a
      sufficient immune response in a safe manner when given to very low birth weight (VLBW)
      infants in routine pediatric practice. We hypothesized that among VLBW infants, the frequency
      of estimated minimum protective antibody titers to PCV-7 (&gt;=0.15 μg/mL) would decrease with
      decreasing birth weight.

      Infants 501-1500g birth weight and &lt;32 0/7 weeks gestational age were enrolled from nine
      NICHD Neonatal Research Network centers from 2004 to 2006. Enrollment was stratified by
      weight group to yield approximately 20 infants per 100g increments from 501-1500g birth
      weight whose primary PCV-7 series was initiated before 3 months and completed by 8 months
      after birth. The infants' primary providers gave PCV-7 vaccination at 2, 4, and 6 months
      after birth. Infants had a single 2-ml blood sample drawn 4-6 weeks following the third dose
      of PCV-7. Antibodies for each of the seven vaccine serotypes included in PCV-7 were measured
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Children were followed until 18-22 months corrected age
      to assess survival, infection, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

      Serum was separated from blood samples. After all study assays were completed on all
      subjects, if a subject's parents asked that his/her serum not be stored, the serum was
      destroyed. For subjects whose parents permit it, leftover serum was re-labeled with a new,
      randomly-generated unique de-identifier, linked only to the subject's gestational age, birth
      weight, and chronologic age at the time of sampling. The link to any other subject
      identifiers will then be destroyed. The serum will be stored indefinitely at the University
      of Rochester for other, non-genetic-testing-related research.
