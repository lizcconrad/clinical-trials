  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mastoidotympanoplasty is a recognised surgery that is performed for chronic otitis media. But
      whether mastoidectomy in addition to tympanoplasty is really necessary in each and every case
      of quiescent chronic otitis media still remains controversial. Hence this study has been
      undertaken to study the differences in the outcomes of the 2 surgical procedures performed
      for chronic otitis media in a randomized control design.

    <textblock>
      Design: single blinded randomized control study. Setting: Tertiary referral medical college
      hospital. Sample size: 60. No of groups: 2 [30 cases in each group]. Group 1: Patients
      undergoing mastoidotympanoplasty. Group 2: Patients undergoing tympanoplasty only. No of
      strata: 3.

      Outcomes:

        1. Improvement of hearing

        2. Closure of tympanic perforation

        3. Recurrence of disease

        4. external ear canal stenosis

      Tools for measurement of outcomes [before and after surgery]:

        1. Pure tone audiometry

        2. Impedance audiometry

        3. Otoendoscopy

        4. External ear canal dimensions
