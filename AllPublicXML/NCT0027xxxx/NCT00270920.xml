      This is a randomised controlled trial to compare antenatal preparation and postnatal
      counseling strategies for improving breastfeeding rates.

      The objectives are:

        1. to study the effect of a standard two-encounter postnatal lactation counseling protocol
           on the initiation and maintenance of exclusive breastfeediing in mothers

        2. to compare the effect of a standard two-encounter postnatal lactation counseling
           protocol with a single-encounter antenatal breastfeeding education protocol on the
           initiation and maintenance of exclusive breastfeeding in mothers.

      All pregnant mothers who wish to breastfeed after 34 weeks of gestation, and who do not have
      a high risk pregnancy as determined by investigator or have a multiple pregnancy in current
      pregnancy and have given their written informed consent will be randomised into three groups.
      Group 1 will receive standard hospital care. Group 2 will receive 1 session of antenatal
      counseling and Group 3 will receive 2 sessions of postanatal lactation counseling. All will
      receive postnatal follow up phone calls using questions from Case Report Forms at 2 weeks, 8
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. The mothers who are not contactable for 3
      consecutive months will be withdrawn from the study.
