  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare a new weekly administered growth hormone preparation
      with standard daily treatment in children with insufficient secretion of growth hormone
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (somatropin) has been proven to be effective
      in stimulating height velocity and improving height in children with short stature due to
      insufficient endogenous Growth Hormone secretion. Currently somatropin is available in daily
      injection formulations. The requirement of daily administration causes significant burden and
      interruption of normal daily life. A product with less frequent dosing regimen will provide
      considerable improvement over currently available conventional replacement therapy regimens.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical comparability in terms of
      safety and efficacy of a new sustained release recombinant human growth hormone formulation
      to that of daily growth hormone.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-pubertal children (boys age: &gt; 3 and &lt;12 years or girls: age &gt;3 and &lt;11 years)
             with isolated GH insufficiency, GH insufficiency as part of multiple pituitary hormone
             deficiencies, or organic GH insufficiency. If GH insufficiency occurred after
             treatment for any brain tumour, the patient has to be at least one year in clinical
             remission which has to be confirmed by computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) scan (with contrast) within 3 months prior to study entry

          -  Children with negative signs for intracranial tumour or tumour growth as confirmed
             with a CT or MRI scan (with contrast) within 12 months prior to inclusion or at
             inclusion visit

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of GH insufficiency as determined by two different GH provocation
             tests, defined as a peak plasma GH level of ≤7 ng/ml

          -  No prior exposure to rhGH therapy (GH-treatment naive)

          -  Height (HT), except in children suffering from organic GH insufficiency, of at least
             2.0 standard deviations (SD) (HT SDS £-2.0) below the mean height for chronological
             age (CA) and sex according to the 2000 standards from the Centers for Disease Control
             and Prevention (CDC).

          -  Height velocity (HV) of at least 1 SD (HV SDS £-1) below the mean HV for CA and sex
             according to the standards of Prader. The minimum time between two standard height
             measurements should be at least 6 month before inclusion.

          -  Baseline IGF-I level of at least 0.5 SD (IGF-1 SDS£-0.5) below the mean IGF-1 level
             standardised for age and sex according to the central laboratory reference values.

          -  Written informed consent of parent or legal guardian of subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             evaluate growth, such as, but not limited to, chronic diseases like renal
             insufficiency, spinal cord irradiation, and malnutrition (BMI must be above -2SD and
             below +2SD of mean BMI for the chronological age and sex according to the CDC
