  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARRON is a disease believed to be due to immune cells, cells which normally protect the body,
      but are now attacking the tissue in the retina and/or optic nerve. In addition, the disease
      may affect the nerves in the ear or other parts of the body . The affected nerves fail to
      respond, or respond only weakly, to stimuli causing numbing, tingling, pain, and progressive
      muscle weakness. If the nerves to the ear are affected, reduced hearing or deafness may
      result. The likelihood of progression of your disease is high. This study is designed to
      examine whether treating patients with high dose cyclophosphamide and rabbit ATG (drugs which
      reduce the function of the immune system) followed by return of previously collected blood
      stem cells will stop the progression of ARRON syndrome. Stem cells are undeveloped cells that
      have the capacity to grow into mature blood cells, which normally circulate in the blood
      stream. The purpose of the cyclophosphamide and rabbit ATG is to destroy the cells in the
      immune system which are thought to be causing this disease. The purpose of the stem cell
      infusion is to restore the body's blood production, which will be severely impaired by the
      high dose chemotherapy and to produce a normal immune system that will no longer attack the
      body.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 18-60.

          2. Diagnosis of ARRON syndrome. Diagnostic criteria described below.

             Unexplained visual loss over weeks to months. The visual loss includes both visual
             acuity and field loss define as follows:

               -  Visual acuity: 20/40 or less

             OR

               -  Visual field: perimetric mean deviation -5b

                    -  Positive antibody to retina or optic nerve.

             OR

             A response to immunosuppressive drugs or immune modulators (response is defined by
             improvement of vision or decrease the rate of decline of visual loss).

               -  Absence of malignancy {negative physical examination, gastrointestinal
                  endoscopies, mammography and gynecologic examination (for female), and serum PSA
                  measurement (for male) within a year}.

               -  Negative MRI of brain.

          3. The patient has failed at least 3 months of corticosteroids (prednisone 0.5mg/kg to
             start), IVIG and at least one other immunosuppressive drug such as methotrexate,
             Imuran, cyclosporine, etc. Failure is defined by decline of visual acuity (by standard
             Snellen acuity clinical testing) or visual field (by Humphrey Automated Machine with
             the 30-2 program or using Kinetic Visual Fields on the Goldman Perimeter)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Absence of light perception lasting more than 6 months

          2. Any illness that in the opinion of the investigators would jeopardize the ability of
             the patient to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy.

          3. Prior history of malignancy except localized basal cell, squamous skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Other malignancies for which the patient is judged to
             be cured, such as head and neck cancer, or breast cancer will be considered on an
             individual basis.

          4. Positive pregnancy test.

          5. Inability or unwillingness to pursue effective means of birth control. Effective birth
             control is defined as 1) refraining from all acts of vaginal intercourse (ABSTINENCE);
             2) consistent use of birth control pills; 3) injectable birth control methods
             (Depo-provera, Norplant); 4) tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone
             vasectomy; 5) placement of an IUD (intrauterine device); or 6) use, with every act of
             intercourse, of diaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive
             foam.

          6. Failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a side effect of
             therapy.

          7. FEV1/FVC &lt; 60% of predicted after bronchodilator therapy (if necessary).

          8. DLCO &lt; 50% of predicted.

          9. Active ischemic heart disease and/or those who have had a myocardial infarction within
             6 months.

         10. Resting LVEF &lt; 40 %.

         11. Bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl

         12. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl.

         13. Known hypersensitivity to mouse, rabbit, or E. Coli derived proteins, or to iron
             compounds/medications.

         14. Presence of metallic objects implanted in the body that would preclude the ability of
             the patient to safely have MRI exams.

         15. Diagnosis of primary progressive MS.

         16. Platelet count &lt; 100,00/ul

         17. Psychiatric illness, mental deficiency or cognitive dysfunction making compliance with
             treatment or informed consent impossible.

         18. Active infection except asymptomatic bacteruria.
