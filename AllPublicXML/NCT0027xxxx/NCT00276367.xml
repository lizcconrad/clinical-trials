  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single post-hospital discharge home visit by a geriatric nurse practitioner or geriatric
      fellow can bridge the gap and ease the transition for elderly frail patients returning home
      after hospital admission. We believe this intervention will reduce medication errors, ensure
      follow-up discharge plans, decrease re-hospitalization rates, and decrease morbidity and
      mortality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients admitted to the ACE unit during the study time frame, age 65 and over, and
        residing in the community before and after discharge from the hospital. Selected patients
        will have complex discharge plans including referrals to home care agencies, poly-pharmacy,
        multiple co-morbidities, history of repeated hospitalizations, and poor social support
        systems in the community. In addition, eligible patients will have at least one of eight
        admitting diagnoses, chosen for their high likelihood of requiring post-discharge home care
        needs. These diagnosis include: CHF, COPD, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus,
        stroke, hip fracture, peripheral vascular disease or cardiac arrhythmia. The GNP or fellow
        will then request permission from the patient's primary physician to do a one-time
        post-discharge home visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients discharged to settings other than their homes (i.e. nursing home, sub-acute
        rehabilitation, etc.)Patients discharged to settings other than their homes (i.e. nursing
        home, sub-acute rehabilitation, etc.)
