  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) during or
      immediately following high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) treatment with the Vest™
      in neurosurgical subjects.

      This study is a single site safety study to evaluate changes in intracranial pressure during
      or immediately following HFCWO treatment with the Vest™ in neurosurgical subjects with
      intracranial pressure monitors having normal opening pressures and ICP less than or equal to
      20 mmHg. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate changes in arterial blood gases
      that may result with Vest™ therapy in ventilated patients.
