      The purpose of this study is to measure the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound exam of
      the hip in diagnosing occult hip fractures.

      Introduction: Most hip fractures are diagnosed by history, physical examination and confirmed
      by plain radiographs. When initial X-rays are negative or equivocal, and there is a clinical
      suspicion of occult hip fracture, additional diagnostic tests are necessary such as MRI which
      is expensive and in many hospitals less available, or bone scan which needs to be delayed
      48-72 hours from injury to be indicative. Ultrasound examination has been shown to be an
      accurate measurement to diagnose occult fractures in the ankle and is a relatively easy,
      available, non-expansive examination. We propose the use of bedside ultrasound examination of
      the hip as a screening tool for occult hip fractures.

      Objective: To measure the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound exam of the hip in
      diagnosing or ruling out occult hip fractures.

      Materials and methods: We will include all patients 40 years and older with a painful hip
      after an injury, and with &quot;normal&quot; hip X-rays. Each patient will undergo two hip ultrasounds
      by two different examiners. Afterwards, the patients will undergo MRI of the hip. The MRI
      will serve as the gold standard for treatment decisions. The results of the ultrasound will
      be compared to the MRI to evaluate its sensitivity and specificity.
