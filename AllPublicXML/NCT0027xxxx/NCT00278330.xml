  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of flavopiridol when given
      together with vorinostat in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia or
      chronic myelogenous leukemia or refractory anemia. Flavopiridol and vorinostat may cause
      leukemia cells to look more like normal cells, and to grow and spread more slowly. Vorinostat
      may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving flavopiridol together with vorinostat may be an effective treatment for
      leukemia or refractory anemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine recommended phase II doses for the combination of flavopiridol and vorinostat in
      patients with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, or refractory
      anemia with excess blasts-2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety, toxicity, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of this drug
      regimen.

      II. Determine the pharmacodynamic and clinical anti-leukemic effects of this drug regimen.

      III. Correlate leukemia gene expression patterns with response in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of flavopiridol.

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and oral vorinostat three times
      daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
