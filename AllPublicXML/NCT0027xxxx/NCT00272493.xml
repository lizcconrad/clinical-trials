  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a naturally occurring substance
      that is made by the body in response to infection or inflammation, and greatly improves
      cellular immune responses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of GM-CSF as an adjuvant to improve the immune response to hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) vaccination in HIV infected individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved the life of HIV infected
      individuals. Before the introduction of HAART, the impact of HBV infection and liver disease
      was less prominent due to the rapid progression to AIDS. However, with the use of HAART,
      liver disease has become a leading cause of death in HIV infected individuals; therefore,
      prevention of HBV infection is essential. Most HIV infected people respond poorly to HBV
      vaccines. GM-CSF is a cytokine produced primarily by activated T and B cells and has been
      used extensively as a hematopoietic growth factor. GM-CSF increases neutrophil count,
      improves antigen-presenting cell function, and is involved in the development and improvement
      of cellular immune responses. Past research has shown that GM-CSF improves the immune
      response to HBV vaccination in people with kidney disease. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of GM-CSF as an adjuvant to improve the immune response
      to HBV vaccination in HIV infected individuals.

      This study will last 60 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms. Arm A
      participants will receive 40 mcg of HBV vaccine at study entry, Week 4, and Week 12. Arm B
      participants will receive 40 mcg of HBV vaccine and 250 mcg of GM-CSF at study entry, Week 4,
      and Week 12. Participants will be stratified by their screening HIV-1 viral load. After
      completing the vaccination series, study visits will occur at Weeks 16, 36, and 60. Blood
      collection, a physical exam, and liver function and hepatitis antibody tests will be
      completed at all study visits. Telephone follow-up by study staff will occur 48 to 96 hours
      post-vaccination.
