  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of telmisartan 80 mg
      administered once daily in patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD) and a
      probably cardiovascular risk profile concerning the amelioration of structural alterations
      and endothelial function.

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy in particular with regard to
      the percentage change of atheroma volume in the femoral artery.The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the change in the plaque size- assessed by intravascular ultrasound, the increase in
      Flow Dependent Dilation provoked by intraarterial infusion of three increasing concentrations
      of Acetylcholine, and the change in seated systolic blood pressure.

      Endothelial dysfunction is a primary event in atherogenesis and all known cardiovascular risk
      factors have been associated with endothelial dysfunction before atherosclerotic vascular
      disease manifests itself clinically. Pivotal to endothelial dysfunction is a disturbance in
      the function of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). Recently, it could be shown that acute
      and chronic angiotensin-1 receptor antagonism reversed endothelial dysfunction in
      atherosclerosis. In experimental atherosclerosis, AT1 receptor blockade appears to have
      protective effects. Respective potential mechanisms include the prevention of endothelial
      injury, the augmentation of NO activity, the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and an
      antiproliferative effect. These findings together with the most recent data that losartan
      improves endothelial function and NO activity suggest that AT1 receptor antagonism may also
      be antiatherogenic in patients with atherosclerosis. Angiotensin II influences smooth muscle
      cell migration, hyperplasia, and hypertrophy. Angiotensin II also enhances production of
      local superoxide anion, which will inactivate nitric oxide. Inhibition of these reactions by
      the AT1-Blocker telmisartan may therefore interfere with atherosclerotic plaque formation.

      Methodology:

      2:1 randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel-group design

      Planned/actual number of subjects:

      Enrolled: 30/33, randomised: 30/22, completed: 30/15

      Duration of treatment:

      9 months: telmisartan (80 mg) or Placebo (80 mg)

      Study Hypothesis:

      The trial is designed as a group comparison of telmisartan 80 mg and placebo, where the
      treatment groups are randomised in 2:1 relation, to investigate the efficacy of telmisartan
      on structural alterations and endothelial dysfunction as measured as the percentage change
      from baseline after 36 weeks of treatment of the atheroma volume in the femoral artery using
      IVUS .

      Secondary endpoints are the changes from baseline in the flow dependent dilatation after a
      acetylcholine challenge which follows a nitro-glycerin bolus, the change of the total
      atheroma volume, the percentage atheroma volume measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
      and the infalmmatory parameters MCP-1, CRP, ox LDL antibodies and sPLA2 activity and amount.

      In an analysis of covariance using baseline as covariate all endpoints will be investigated.
      If the assumptions of normal distribution are not fulfilled, nonparametric methods will be
      applied (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test).
