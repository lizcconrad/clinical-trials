  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with breast cancer often suffer significant distress and disability from their disease.
      A practice of meditation-based stress reduction and cognitive-affective-behavioral learning
      may help women with breast cancer decrease their suffering and improve their quality of life.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study in women recently treated for breast cancer is to determine
      whether an intervention program consisting of group and individual instruction in a
      meditation-based practice of stress-reduction and cognitive-affective-behavioral learning has
      the potential for reducing disabling distress and improving quality of life in a population
      vulnerable to the progression or recurrence of disease. Quality of life will be assessed at
      12 months.
