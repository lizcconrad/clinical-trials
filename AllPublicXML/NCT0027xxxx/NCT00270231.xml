  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite preclinical evidence supporting the role of the endogenous opioid system in the
      reinforcing effects of nicotine, the efficacy of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX) as a
      tobacco dependence treatment remains unresolved. Research is needed to identify those smokers
      for whom NTX will have the strongest beneficial effects on smoking behavior.

      The research bridges existing knowledge of genetic, pharmacologic, and behavioral responses
      to nicotine, and translates this knowledge to treatment for tobacco dependence. The immediate
      goal was to test whether genetic variation in the mu-opioid receptor gene predicts the
      effects of naltrexone (NTX) on nicotine reinforcement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a within-subject double-blind study of the effects of naltrexone versus placebo
      on the reinforcing value of nicotine, using a validated cigarette choice paradigm. A key
      question was whether smokers differ in their responses based on the mu opioid receptor gene
      (OPRM1) Asn40Asp (A118G) variant.

      Following informed consent, 64 smokers were enrolled in the study. Of these, 60 completed two
      4-day study phases interspersed with a 5-7 day washout phase. Baseline statistics are
      provided for the 64 smokers who enrolled.

      Each 4-day study phase included a 3-day drug run-up and monitoring phase, then on the 4th day
      participants came to our Biobehavioral Lab (BBL) where they took their final 50mg of study
      medication and completed a cigarette choice paradigm. Following a washout phase, the 4-day
      sequence will be repeated with the alternative study medication. The order of study
      medication was randomized and counterbalanced between subjects.

    <measure>Number of Nicotine Cigarette Choices Taken During the Cigarette Choice Procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>On day 4 of each study medication period, participants completed a cigarette choice procedure where the subject is asked to take 4 puffs from a nicotinized (nicotine-containing) or a denicotinized (no nicotine) cigarette every 30 minutes for 2 hours (maximum of 24 puffs). The outcome variable is the number of nicotine cigarette choices or puffs out of 24 total puffs during these cigarette choice procedures.
Subjects who had the A/A genotype took an average of 18.5 puffs from the nicotine-containing cigarettes. Subjects with the A/G or G/G genotypes took an average of 16.2 puffs from the nicotine-containing cigarettes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must be greater than or equal to 18 years

          2. Based on the medical history, physical and laboratory examination, female subjects
             must:

               1. Agree in consent to practice effective contraception during study, be status
                  post-bilateral tubal litigation or be post-menopausal.

               2. Not be pregnant, nursing, or planning pregnancy

          3. Based upon self-report, subjects must smoke greater than or equal to 10 non-menthol
             cigarettes per day

          4. Because the OPRM1 variant is common (25-30%) in persons of European ancestry, but very
             rare in other ethnic groups (e.g., 2-9% of African Americans) it is not scientifically
             justified to include members of other ethnic groups. Therefore, only persons of
             European ancestry will be recruited.

          5. Following orientation by the research staff, subjects must sign written informed
             consent and HIPAA form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current diagnosis of kidney disease or history of renal function impairment (unless
             they have recent kidney function tests (within last 3 months) and approval of their
             primary physician to participate in the study.)

          2. Women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or lactating

          3. Current alcohol use &gt; 25 standard drinks/week (this is because NTX is used to treat
             alcohol dependence, and effects of NTX on alcohol consumption in alcohol dependent
             subjects could have indirect effects on cigarette consumption).

          4. Current medical problems for which NTX is contraindicated including: active hepatitis
             (Liver Function Tests 3 times the Upper Limit of Normal).

          5. History of opiate dependence (prescription drug or illicit use).

          6. History of or current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Version
             IV) (DSM IV) substance use disorders (abuse or dependence involving alcohol, cocaine,
             stimulants, or benzodiazepines)

          7. Diagnosis of bulimia and/or anorexia nervosa in the last year

          8. Current or past use (with in past 12 months) of any medications containing NTX (e.g.,
             Revia, Trexan), allergy to NTX

          9. Concomitant medications (e.g., monoamine oxidase inhibitors or benzodiazepines within
             past 14 days, antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids,
             over-the-counter stimulants and anorectics)

        <title>Number of Nicotine Cigarette Choices Taken During the Cigarette Choice Procedure.</title>
        <description>On day 4 of each study medication period, participants completed a cigarette choice procedure where the subject is asked to take 4 puffs from a nicotinized (nicotine-containing) or a denicotinized (no nicotine) cigarette every 30 minutes for 2 hours (maximum of 24 puffs). The outcome variable is the number of nicotine cigarette choices or puffs out of 24 total puffs during these cigarette choice procedures.
Subjects who had the A/A genotype took an average of 18.5 puffs from the nicotine-containing cigarettes. Subjects with the A/G or G/G genotypes took an average of 16.2 puffs from the nicotine-containing cigarettes.</description>
