  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cure rates for patients with high grade glioma remain disappointing, in part because tumor
      cells are often resistant to chemotherapy, and because using higher doses of chemotherapy
      causes damage to normal blood cells. This trial is designed to try to overcome both of these
      barriers. The idea is to make tumor cells more sensitive to a chemotherapy agent,
      Temozolomide, by using 06Benzylguanine (06BG). In addition, patients will have a portion of
      their blood cells modified by the insertion of a chemotherapy resistance gene which may help
      protect blood cells from damage by the combination of the Temozolomide and 06BG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of temozolomide (TEM) both during and after irradiation is a promising new approach
      for the treatment of patients with high-grade glioma. However, this treatment is limited by
      tumor cell resistance and therapy-related hematologic toxicity. To overcome TEM resistance,
      in this study we will add the chemotherapy sensitizing drug O6-Benzylguanine (BG). To
      overcome hematologic toxicity, patients will receive autologous hematopoietic stem cells
      transduced with a chemotherapy resistance gene designed to protect these cells from
      subsequent therapy with this drug combination.

      The potential benefit of using transduced blood stem cells is the possibility for dose
      escalation of TEM, since hematologic toxicity has heretofore limited higher doses.
      Transduction will be accomplished with a retroviral vector carrying MGMTP140K, which codes
      for a mutated form of the resistance protein methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT).
      Successful transduction of hematopoietic cells with MGMTP140K makes them resistant to the
      toxic effects of both TEM + BG. Repeated doses of these drugs should therefore result in an
      increase in the percentage of transduced (and thus protected) blood stem cells, thus reducing
      the likelihood of hematologic toxicity with further therapy. Accordingly, patients who are
      tolerating therapy well and who have laboratory evidence of chemoprotection will receive
      intrapatient dose escalation of TEM + BG during courses 2-6.

      Eligible patients must be between 5 and 55 years of age and have newly-diagnosed high-grade
      glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme) which cannot be completely
      resected. No prior therapy other than surgery is allowed, and patients must have adequate
      performance status and organ function as defined in the protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        3.1.1 Age &gt; 5 years and &lt; 55 years. NOTE: Subjects ages 5-30 are eligible to be treated at
        Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; subjects over age 30 will be treated at Ohio
        State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.

        3.1.2 Anticipated life expectancy of at least nine months 3.1.3 Karnofsky score &gt; 50 for
        patients &gt; 10 years of age, and Lansky score &gt; 50 for patients &lt; 10 years of age. Patients
        who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be
