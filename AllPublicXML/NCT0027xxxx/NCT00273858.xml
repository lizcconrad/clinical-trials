  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4 open label, non-interventional, multi-center study to evaluate the safety
      of Enbrel (etanercept) treatment in patients receiving etanercept 25mg sc twice weekly or
      50mg of etanercept once weekly. The improvement of health-related quality of life will also
      be evaluated.

      Patients already prescribed to receive etanercept for the first time for treatment of
      Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis or Psoriatic Arthritis according to the Summary
      of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

      Patients have been recruited sequentially based on eligibility criteria up to the number
      limit assigned to each site.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated because at least one year follow-up was achieved for each patient and
    the achievement of 965 exposure years to the drug.

    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug was considered an AE, without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An AE resulting in any of the following outcomes, or deemed to be significant for any other reason, was considered to be a SAE: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; a life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

    <description>HAQ is a measure of functional limitations. Participants were rated on 4 point scale with scores as 'normal' (no difficulty=0), 'adequate' (some difficulty= 1), 'limited' (much difficulty=2), and 'unable to do' (=3) based on degree of difficulty they experienced with 20 tasks grouped into 8 areas of dressing, rising, hygiene, reach, walking, eating, grip and activities. HAQ total scores were expressed as overall mean score ranging from 0 to 3: 0-0.25=normal functioning; 0.25-0.5=mild functional limitation; 0.5-1=moderate functional limitation; greater than 1=significant functional limitation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) at 24 Month</title>
        <description>HAQ is a measure of functional limitations. Participants were rated on 4 point scale with scores as 'normal' (no difficulty=0), 'adequate' (some difficulty= 1), 'limited' (much difficulty=2), and 'unable to do' (=3) based on degree of difficulty they experienced with 20 tasks grouped into 8 areas of dressing, rising, hygiene, reach, walking, eating, grip and activities. HAQ total scores were expressed as overall mean score ranging from 0 to 3: 0-0.25=normal functioning; 0.25-0.5=mild functional limitation; 0.5-1=moderate functional limitation; greater than 1=significant functional limitation.</description>
