      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep tumors from forming, growing,
      or coming back. Zoledronate may prevent the growth of cervical cancer by blocking blood flow
      to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cells. The use of zoledronate may keep cancer from
      forming.

      PURPOSE: This randomized is studying how well zoledronate works in treating patients with
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 or 3.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess clinical response, in terms of lesion size and histological grade, of oledronate
           in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 or 3.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study. Patients are
      stratified according to degree of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (CIN2/3 vs CIN3).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Zoledronate: 100 cc of saline with 4 mg of Zoledronate intravenous (IV), over 20
           minutes, for 3 doses one week apart

        -  Placebo: 100 cc of saline (IV), over 20 minutes, for 3 doses one week apart

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses. In week 8, patients
      undergo surgical resection comprising loop excision or cone biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at week 10 by telephone.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
