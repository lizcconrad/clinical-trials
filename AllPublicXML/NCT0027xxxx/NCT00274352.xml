      The purpose of this study is to determine if adalimumab is an effective for the skin
      manifestations of sarcoidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis are often disfiguring and can produce functional
      impairment. They tend to be hard to treat with most topical therapies and often require
      systemic medications which carry the risk of significant side effects. Often such treatments
      are withheld unless there is a need to use them for visceral involvement. There is thus an
      unmet need for safe and effective treatments for these patients. In addition there is
      essentially no controlled trial data for any treatments for cutaneous sarcoidosis. This study
      is intended to determine if adalimumab might offer a viable therapeutic option for this
      condition by comparing the response of cutaneous sarcoid lesions to this drug as compared to
      placebo.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is &gt; 18 years of age.

          2. Subject must have moderate to severe cutaneous sarcoidosis with chronic indurated
             lesions (papules, nodules, and/or plaques), which histopathologically show
             non-caseating granulomas with negative special stains for microorganisms (AFB and PAS
             or GMS). Accepted clinical variants include, but are not necessarily limited to the
             following:

               -  lupus pernio

               -  nodular

               -  subcutaneous

               -  annular

               -  angiolupoid

               -  plaque

               -  papular

               -  lichenoid

               -  psoriasiform

          3. For purposes of this study &quot;moderate to severe cutaneous sarcoidosis&quot; is defined as
             the presence of sarcoidal skin lesions with any of the following features:

               -  At least 5 easily visible facial lesions, or

               -  Disease which involves &gt; 3% BSA, or

               -  Disease which confers functional impairment (e.g. nasal or visual field
                  obstruction), or

               -  Disease which confers significant symptoms of itching and/or pain.

          4. If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), or is using one of the following methods of birth
             control for the duration of the study and 90 days after study completion:

               -  condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm, or intrauterine device

               -  contraceptives (oral or parenteral) for three months prior to study drug
                  administration

               -  a vasectomized sole partner

          5. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening visit.

          6. Subject must have no history of nor evidence of tuberculosis, either active or
             previously treated. This determination will be based on a negative PPD skin test and
             negative chest radiograph at screening, negative history of previous tuberculosis, and
             negative history of previous exposure to tuberculosis.

          7. Subject must be willing and able to give informed consent and to comply with the
             requirements of the protocol.

          8. Subject must be willing and able to self-administer SC injections or to have a
             qualified person available to administer SC injections.

          9. The following criteria for concomitant treatments of sarcoidosis must be met:

               -  Topical therapies (corticosteroids) must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior
                  to baseline visit.

               -  Intralesional therapies (corticosteroids) must be discontinued at least 4 weeks
                  prior to baseline visit.

               -  Systemic therapies (MTX, antimalarials, prednisone, immunosuppressants,
                  thalidomide, tetracycline derivatives) must be discontinued at least 4 weeks
                  prior to baseline visit.

        OR if a subject is on such topical or oral medications, the dose has been stable for these
        same time intervals and is likely to remain stable for the duration of the study. Patients
        whose non-cutaneous disease is being managed by other physicians will continue to have
        their care directed by these physicians. The managing physicians will be kept informed of
        the patients' status, consistent with study blinding. If the patient's dose of a
        concomitant systemic therapy for non-cutaneous sarcoidosis must change by more than 20% of
        the dose at study entry due to a change in medical condition during the double-blind phase,
        the subject will be discontinued from the study. During the open-label phase the need for a
        greater than 20% increase in dose of concomitant treatment for non-cutaneous sarcoidosis
        will be viewed as treatment failure and the patient will be discontinued from the study.
        Reduction of the dose of such treatment of any magnitude will not result in discontinuance.
        Continued use of intralesional therapies is not permitted. Inhaled corticosteroids for a
        stable medical condition are allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of other active skin diseases or skin infections during screening that may
             interfere with evaluation of sarcoidosis.

          2. Subject has a known sensitivity to any component of the study medication. (See Table
             4.)

          3. Subject has an active infection requiring systemic antibiotics at time of screening.

          4. Subject has a history of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disease within the past 5
             years, excluding successfully treated non-melanoma epithelial skin cancer and/or
             localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          5. Subject has a history of congestive heart failure.

          6. Subject has a poorly controlled medical condition including, but not limited to,
             unstable cardiovascular disease, poorly controlled diabetes, recent stroke, history of
             recurrent infections, or any other condition for which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, participation in the study would place the subject at risk.

          7. Subject has a history of demyelinating CNS disease.

          8. Subject has a history of listeriosis, treated or untreated tuberculosis, exposure to
             individuals with tuberculosis, persistent or active infections requiring
             hospitalization or treatment with IV antibiotics, IV antiretrovirals, or IV
             antifungals within 30 days of baseline, OR oral antibiotics, antivirals, or
             antifungals for purpose of treating infection, within 14 days of baseline.

          9. Subject is currently using or plans to use antiretroviral therapy at any time prior to
             or during study.

         10. Previous use of anti-TNF agent(s).

         11. Receipt of any other investigational product within 30 days prior to the first dose of
             investigational product.

             year.

         15. Subject is considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable
             candidate for study participation.
