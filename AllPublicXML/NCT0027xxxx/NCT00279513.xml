  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hallux valgus is a common deformity of the big toe, defined as medial deflection of the first
      metatarsal bone along with lateral deflection of the first toe. Surgery has been shown to be
      beneficial when compared to orthoses or no treatment. While generally effective, surgery
      entails significant post-operative pain, inflammation and edema, and several weeks of limited
      mobility. This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comparing the
      homeopathic drug Traumeel S with placebo in pain reduction after surgical Hallux valgus
      correction.

      80 patients, over the age of 18 years, undergoing surgical correction of unilateral hallux
      valgus will be enrolled in the trial. The patients will be randomized to two groups, one
      receiving oral Traumeel S and the other oral placebo tablets. Patients will take active or
      placebo medication for 13 days or until they have a NRS score of 3 or less for 2 consecutive
      days. Pain will be reported daily by the patient on the patient diary, using an 11-point
      numerical rating score (NRS-11) during 13 days post-operatively. They will also be asked to
      report daily consumption of primary and &quot;rescue&quot; analgesics for 13 days post-operatively.
      Patients will be contacted daily by the research assistant to encourage compliance and to
      record their daily NRS and analgesic consumption in the CRF. Patients will be evaluated by
      physicians at six and 13 days postoperatively for redness and compliance.
