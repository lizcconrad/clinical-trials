      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of a brief motivational intervention on smoking cessation in
           smokers enrolled in a methadone maintenance program.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

        -  Group 1: Patients undergo assessment at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months.

        -  Group 2: Patients receive a brief motivational intervention at the time of their
           baseline assessment and undergo assessment as in group 1.

      All patients will be offered a 2- to 3-month supply of nicotine patches.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.
