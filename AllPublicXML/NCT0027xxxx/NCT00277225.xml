  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics and
      immunogicity of BMS-188667 administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion with extended
      pharmacokinetic sampling. Safety of all subjects will be assessed in a double blind fashion
      through the inclusion of placebo controls at each dose level.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects required to have a know diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris involving 5-49% of
             total body surface area (BSA) for at least six months prior to randomization.

          -  Subjects clinically insignificant abnormal laboratory or ECG test results who were
             otherwise healthy and met all remaining eligibility criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active bacterial or viral infections at the time of enrollment, including
             any history of or clinical evidence of infection with Human Immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

          -  Any underlying metabolic, hematologic, pulmonary, cardiac, renal hepatic, infectious,
             psychiatric or gastrointestional condition, which in the opinion of the investigator,
             placed the subject at unacceptable risk from participation in a study with potentially
             immunosuppresive therapy.
