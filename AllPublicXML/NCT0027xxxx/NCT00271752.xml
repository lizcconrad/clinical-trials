  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, single blinded, multicentre trial to evaluate whether daily
      procalcitonin (PCT) measurements and immediate diagnostic and therapeutic responses to
      abnormal values and day-to-day changes can reduce the mortality of critically ill patients in
      the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis and complications to sepsis are major causes of mortality in critically ill patients.
      Rapid treatment of sepsis is of crucial importance for survival of patients. In the ICU, the
      infectious status of the patient is often difficult to assess because symptoms cannot be
      expressed (unconscious or sedated patients) and signs may present atypically because of
      immunologic incompetence and masking by the drugs given and thermo-therapy. Biological and
      biochemical markers of inflammation (White Blood Cells (WBC), C-reactive protein) may often
      be influenced by other parameters than infection, such as: trauma, surgery, other types of
      inflammation such as rheumatoid diseases (C-reactive protein) and gluco-corticosteroid
      treatment (WBC), and may be unacceptably slowly released after progression of an infection.
      At the same time, lack of a relevant antimicrobial therapy in an early course of infection
      may be fatal for the patient.

      For these reasons, in the clinical setting, it is often necessary to initiate or adjust
      antimicrobial therapy on an unsure ground and the relevant therapy may in some situations be
      delayed for important hours or even days. Specific and rapid markers of bacterial infection
      have been sought for use in the ICU. Mortality in critically ill patients increases gravely
      when Procalcitonin levels increase from day to day (own submitted, though yet unpublished
      data). Low PCT levels have been shown to effectively rule out sepsis.

      However, no randomised controlled trials have been conducted to show if mortality in
      critically ill patients can be reduced by using a strategy of daily standardised
      Procalcitonin measurements as an early detector of serious bacterial infection. Therefore
      evidence is presently not sufficient to introduce daily consecutive Procalcitonin
      measurements to guide the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients admitted to the
      ICU .

      The rationale for this trial is to assess the ability of daily Procalcitonin measurements to
      reduce the mortality of critically ill patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Fulfilment of all of the following three criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged &gt; 18 years of age.

          2. Admitted to the participating Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at the following hospitals:
             Hvidovre Hospital, Bispebjerg Hospital, Amager Hospital, Herlev Hospital, Glostrup
             Hospital, and Gentofte Hospital

          3. Ability to understand and provide written informed consent to participate in this
             trial; or ability to understand and provide oral informed consent in the presence of
             at least one impartial witness who should sign and personally date the consent form;
             or the subject's legally acceptable representative can understand and provide written
             informed consent if the subject is not capable of this because of the present mental
             or physical condition of the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will NOT be eligible for inclusion in this trial if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Subjects with known hyperbilirubinaemia (&gt; 0.4 mg/ml) or hypertriglyceridaemia (&gt; 10
             g/l) since this can interfere with measurements. If subjects with unknown status on
             these points are included and have PCT measurements, the measuring equipment will
             detect these conditions.

          2. Subjects suffering from a blood disorder, where daily sampling of 7 ml of blood for a
             maximum of 28 days (210 ml distributed on 28 days) will be an inconvenience or a
             potential risk, which could compromise the safety of the subject.

          3. Subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding

        The a priori probability of surviving with the normal recommended diagnostics and treatment
        with the presently available means to detect infections and, on the other hand, the normal
        diagnostics and treatment together with daily procalcitonin measurements and prompt
        clinical reaction should be equal.
