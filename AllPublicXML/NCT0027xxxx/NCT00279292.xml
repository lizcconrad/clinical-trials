  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to determine more effective methods of controlling the pain in
      pancreatic cancer. Although narcotic pain medication are effective, they have many side
      effects and are underutilized due to social stigma and fear of addiction. Celiac plexus
      neurolysis is a nerve block procedure that has been shown to be effective in uncontrolled
      clinical trials. We hypothesized that celiac plexus neurolysis plus pain medication will be
      more effective and have fewer side effects than pain medication alone. We are evaluating the
      effectiveness of this standard pain medications with or without celiac plexus neurolysis in a
      randomized controlled trial. One half of the participants will receive pain medications only
      and the other half will receive pain medications plus neurolysis, delivered via an endoscopic
      ultrasound device placed in the stomach.

      This is a phase III randomized blinded sham controlled trial of endoscopic ultrasound guided
      celiac plexus neurolysis. Patients with pancreatic cancer who are unresectable and who have
      significant pain (&gt; 3 on 0-10 scale) will be enrolled. At the time of a staging endoscopic
      ultrasound, patients will be randomized to celiac neurolysis or sham (injection of same
      medication into lumen of stomach). Neurolysis will be performed using standard bupivicaine
      and ethanol. Patients will be followed for at least 3 months for pain, quality of life and
      narcotic usage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        3.1 Unresectable (T4 or M1 or non-regional lymph nodes) or inoperable (due to medical
        comorbidity) carcinoma of the pancreas as determined by CT or EUS. Patients with extensive
        portal vein or superior mesenteric vein involvement (T3 by 6th Ed. AJCC staging manual)
        will be included only if the consulting surgeon feels the patients is unresectable based on
        the CT scan information.

        3.2 Presence of mid-abdominal pain ( 3 on VAS scale) at least 2 days per week, lasting at
        least 1 hour per day.

        3.3 No known coagulopathy as measured by Prothrombin time (INR) 1.5. Pre-EUS INR is not
        required unless clinically indicated due to known warfarin use or suspected coagulopathy.

        3.4 Patient must not require more than 2 l/min oxygen supplementation to maintain
        saturation &gt;90%.

        3.5 &gt; 6 months since previous myocardial infarction or angina. 3.6 ≥ 4 weeks since previous
        surgery. 3.7 No institution or change in chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 7 days prior
        (or 14 days post) ESU-CPN. See section 7.0 and 7.1 for details of chemotherapy and
        radiotherapy allowances.

        3.8 Platelets ≥ 50,000. Pre-EUS CBC is not required unless clinically indicated due to
        known or suspected coagulopathy.

        3.9 Life expectancy &gt; 3 months 3.10 Signed and dated informed consent.
