      symptoms, functioning, and health care utilization of people with multiple medically
      unexplained physical symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Somatization disorder is a chronic psychological condition that causes numerous physical
      complaints for which no underlying physical problem can be identified. The disorder often
      lasts for several years and results in substantial functional impairment. The physical
      complaints most frequently involve chronic pain and problems with the digestive, nervous, and
      reproductive systems. Neither pharmacological nor psychosocial treatments for this disorder
      have been successful in suppressing symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a
      treatment that focuses on maladaptive patterns of thinking and the beliefs that underlie such
      thinking. This study will examine the long-term effects of CBT on the physical symptoms,
      functioning, and health care utilization of people with somatization disorder.

      Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT
      supplemented with augmented standard medical care (ASMC) as indicated by a psychiatric
      consultation letter or ASMC alone. Participants assigned to CBT plus ASMC will receive CBT
      for 10 weeks. Somatic symptomatology, functional impairment, and health care costs will be
      assessed at study visits at baseline and Months 3, 9, and 15. The visits at Months 9 and 15
      will assess specifically the long-term efficacy of the treatment.
