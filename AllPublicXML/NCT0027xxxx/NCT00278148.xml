      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Giving erlotinib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin together with radiation therapy before surgery
      may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.
      Giving these treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of erlotinib and the side effects of
      erlotinib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin when given together with radiation therapy and to see
      how well they work in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for stage III non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and feasibility of erlotinib hydrochloride, paclitaxel, and
           carboplatin in combination with accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients
           with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of erlotinib
           hydrochloride in these patients.

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of long-term maintenance erlotinib hydrochloride
           after completion of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the clinical and pathological response rate in these patients after neoadjuvant
           erlotinib hydrochloride, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy.

        -  Assess the impact of erlotinib hydrochloride on disease-free survival, overall survival,
           locoregional control, and distant metastatic control in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, phase I dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride
      followed by a non-randomized phase II study.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase I:

             -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once
                daily on days 1-28 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes
                on days 1, 8, and 15 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
                toxicity. Patients concurrently undergo radiotherapy twice daily on days 1-5 and
                8-12. Patients with complete response, partial response, or stable disease proceed
                to surgery. Patients who develop a medical contraindication to surgery (i.e.,
                medically unresectable) receive a second course of erlotinib hydrochloride,
                paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy as above within 2 weeks after completion
                of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Surgery: Within 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients
           undergo surgical resection and then proceed to adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Within 6-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive a second
           course of erlotinib hydrochloride, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy as in
           neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: All patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for 2
           years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I with erlotinib hydrochloride at
                the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
