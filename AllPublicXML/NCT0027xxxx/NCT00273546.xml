      -  1.To compare overall survival after treatment with the test tri-therapy (TPF: docetaxel
           plus cisplatin and 5FU) or the control treatment (PF: cisplatin plus 5-FU) followed by
           chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced SCCHN.

        -  2.The main secondary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS). The other secondary
           endpoints are to evaluate and compare improvement of local symptoms; time-to-treatment
           failure; quality of life; clinical complete response rate (CR and CR/PR); toxicity and
           to evaluate the relationship of tumor markers and response to therapy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1.Histologically or cytologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck.

          -  2.Primary tumor sites eligible: oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx. Although
             they are admittedly of squamous cell types, the following tumors will be excluded
             because their responsiveness to chemotherapy may differ: nasal, paranasal cavities;
             nasopharynx.

          -  3.Stage 3 or 4 disease without evidence of distant metastases verified with Chest
             X-Ray, abdominal ultrasound or CT (liver function test abnormalities); bone scan in
             case of local symptoms.

          -  4.At least one uni or bidimensionally measurable lesion.

          -  5.Tumor considered as inoperable after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team
             (surgeon, medical oncologist and radiation oncologist). Criteria include : Technical
             unresectablility-ie tumor fixation/invasion to base of the skull or cervical vertebrae
             involvement of the nasopharynx and fixed lymph nodes; Physician's decision based on
             low surgical curability which includes all T3-4 stages, all N2-3 stages excluding
             T1N2; organ preservation.

          -  6.No previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy for any reason and no previous surgery for
             SCCHN (other than biopsy) are allowed at time of study entry.

          -  11.Signed informed consent prior to beginning protocol specific procedures

             Hematology (Bone Marrow): Neutrophil count ³ 2.0 x 10 9/L; Platelet count ³ 100 X 10
             9/L; Hemoglobin ³ 10g/dL; Hepatic function : Total bilirubin WNL; ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT
             (SGPT) £ 2.5 X ULN; Alkaline phosphatase £ 5 X ULN; patients with ASAT or ALAT &gt; 1.5 x
             ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN are not eligible for the study;
             Renal function: the creatinine clearance ³ 60 ml/min (actual or calculated by the
             Cockcroft-Gault method as follows: Weight (kg) X (140-age)/K x serum creatinine.

          -  13.Patients must be available for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating center.

             Hypercalcemia; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization during
             the year preceding study entry.

          -  6.Patients requiring intravenous alimentation.

          -  7.Patients who experienced a weight loss of more than 20% of their body weight in the
