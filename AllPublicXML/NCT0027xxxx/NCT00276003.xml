      Primary objectives

        -  Assess the response rate in patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell NHL or Hodgkins
           disease, treated with the combination of the gemcitabine and irinotecan.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Assess progression free survival in these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess toxicity of this regimen in this group of patients.

      The purpose of the study is to see how well patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma
      respond to treatment with Gemcitabine and Irinotecan. Patients on this study take part
      because they have relapsed or refractory lymphoma. Additionally, the study will assess
      treatment-related side effects and time until disease progression or recurrence.
