  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to determine whether tiotropium inhalation capsules, compared to
      placebo, enhances the improvement in exercise tolerance seen in patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who participate in pulmonary rehabilitation. In
      addition, assessments of the effect of tiotropium on dyspnea and quality of life following
      pulmonary rehabilitation were taken.
