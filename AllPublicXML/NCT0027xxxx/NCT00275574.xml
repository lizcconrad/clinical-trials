    <textblock>
      Breast pain or mastalgia is a common and troublesome symptom for many women. Whereas cyclical
      breast pain related to hormonal fluctuations can frequently be treated, non-cyclical breast
      pain can go untreated due to its various etiologies and non-specific presentation.
      Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine that has been used for centuries to treat
      a vast array of illnesses and conditions. Research has shown that acupuncture has a link to a
      release of endorphins and other chemicals in the central nervous system. Thus, it is thought
      to help relieve pain. To date, there has been minimal research using acupuncture for breast
      pain. This pilot of 30 women will seek to determine whether four acupuncture treatments over
      a period of two weeks will significantly lower the level of pain experienced by these
      participants. Additionally, we will evaluate quality of life measures.
