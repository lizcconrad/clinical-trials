    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine if a New Arthroplasty Care Model, established on evidence-based
      medicine and best practices, will improve patient outcomes and improve cost effectiveness for
      patients with severe degenerative joint disease of the hip or knee in Alberta

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Alberta Orthopaedic Society through its Arthroplasty Service Design Working Group has,
      after carefully reviewing the existing conventional approach to arthroplasty care, developed
      what they believe could be a much improved new evidence based arthroplasty care model. This
      model represents how ideally a patient would access and receive health services across the
      complete continuum of care. In addition, wherever possible, evidence gathered from the
      literature and from &quot;known best practices&quot; has been utilized to develop standards related to
      access, wait times, clinical quality, resource use and health outcome measures. Where no
      evidence or &quot;known best practices&quot; exist, a standard that best support achieving other known
      standards are being developed. This new evidence based arthroplasty model seeks to
      significantly minimize and where possible, eliminate all the current gaps and barriers to
      arthroplasty care.

      This study will seek to prove that the new evidence based arthroplasty model will deliver
      improved patient outcomes with improved cost effectiveness. Once proven, it is anticipated
      that this new evidence based arthroplasty model will become the standard of care in Alberta,
      and a model for other jurisdictions to use in their health service re-designs
