      Selenium suppresses autoimmune destruction of thyrocytes and decreases titers of serum TPOAb
      in AIT patients. Older 4 clinical trials approved the efficacy of the daily dose of 200micg.
      It's believed that Se saturates the deficient stores of GPX so GPX saves the thyrocytes
      against to oxidative stresses. Although less than 70 micg/d is sufficient to maximize GPX
      activity, none of the authors tested the doses less than 200 micg/d. Our hypothesis was that
      If 100 micg/d can not suppress the TPOAb titers,it means autoimmune destruction can not be
      blocked by saturation of deficient stores of GPX solely and the mechanism of action requires
      more than repletion of deficient stores. It's important not only to estimate the optimal dose
      but to understand the mechanism of action. High dose therapy may also suppress TPOAb levels
      in Se-non-deficient AIT patients, if it is so, Se therapy may becomes the solely treatment
      modality which can suppress the autoimmunity in more than 400 million AIT patients. Because
      there've been no way to suppress autoimmune war and replacement of LT4 had been the only
      treatment modality for palliation. An other independent part of the study is to test the
      effect of Se in adolescent AIT patients.
