    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate decision making of i.v. tPA treatment in acute stroke within 3
      hours of symptom onset either remotely via videoconferencing system (investigational arm)
      beginning of treatment on-site and then transfer to stroke unit vs. decision after immediate
      transfer to stroke unit (usual care arm). Ten remote hospitals are connected to the BICHAT
      stroke unit. All patients will have stroke unit care at BICHAT hospital. Primary end-point is
      rankin 0-1 at 3 months.

      This study is a therapeutic trial, comparing a TELESTROKE decision making as the tested
      hypothesis to usual care (immediate transfer to stroke unit). Once the ER doctor in one of
      the 10 remote hospitals will judge his patient eligible for tPA thrombolysis, he will call
      the BICHAT stroke unit visio-conference system. Then, according to the randomization list,
      the patient will be allocated to 'standard care arm' which is the EMEA-approved tPA labeling
      (i.e., transfer the patient immediately to a stroke unit to have tPA thrombolysis if the
      patient arrives in due time -before 3 hours of stroke onset) or he will be allocated to
      'TELESTROKE ARM&quot;(i.e., remote neurological exam to perform NIHSS, assess the exact time of
      the first stroke symptoms onset and visualization of brain CT-scan by the vascular
      neurologist; then start the tPA thrombolysis on site if the indication is confirmed by the
      vascular neurologist, then transfer the patient to the BICHAT stroke unit). The primary
      outcome will be Rankin 0-1 (i.e., cured) at 3 months; secondary outcome will be death or
      dependency at 3 months and the frequency of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 10 days.
      Patients randomized will be systematically transfer to the BICHAT stroke unit, no matter the
      received or not tPA thrombolysis, and no matter the study arm, according to the
      intention-to-treat rule.
