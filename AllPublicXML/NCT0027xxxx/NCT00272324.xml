      This is a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and/or folate supplementation for the
      prevention of the recurrence of neoplastic polyps (adenomas) of the large bowel among
      subjects with a recent history of these tumors. The study is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 3 factorial design.
