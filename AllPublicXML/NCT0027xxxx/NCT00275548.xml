  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to study the impact of prophylactic administration of antiviral
      therapy as compared to initiation of antiviral therapy at the time of clinical recurrence of
      hepatitis C infection in liver transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study. The
      study is being done to see whether treatment using Pegasys (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) and
      Copegus (ribavirin) is safer and more effective in liver transplant recipients when given
      before hepatitis C infection reappears, or when it is given after clinical symptoms of
      hepatitis C reinfection appear. The study is also being done in liver transplant recipients
      to estimate how much hepatitis C is detected over time, how the body affects the study drugs,
      the safety of the study drugs whether or not the study drugs effect the participants' quality
      of life, and whether or not the participants feel more or less depressed as a result.

      Participants will be put into one of two groups. In the preventive group; participants will
      receive study drugs for the treatment of recurring (or returning) hepatitis C before
      developing actual clinical symptoms. The participants in the observational groups will
      receive study drugs for the treatment of recurring hepatitis C only if they develop the
      clinical symptoms of hepatitis c infection.

      This study will have four parts: a screening phrase, a treatment/observational phrase,
      follow-up phase and long term safety follow-up phase. Throughout all four stages of the
      study, participants will have physical exams, medical and surgical history's will be taken,
      blood and urine tests, eye exam, liver biopsy, chest x-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG). If
      participants are female, a pregnancy test will also be performed. Participants must also
      agree not to drink any alcoholic beverages or take any other drugs for hepatitis c infection
      while taking part in the study. Participants must be able to return for clinic visits at
      scheduled intervals.
