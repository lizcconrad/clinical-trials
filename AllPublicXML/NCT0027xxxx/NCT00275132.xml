      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether erlotinib is more effective than a
      placebo in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying erlotinib to see how well it works
      compared to a placebo in treating patients with stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer that is
           not suitable for first-line chemotherapy treated with erlotinib vs placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare progression-free survival and response rate.

        -  Compare toxicity.

        -  Compare the quality of life.

        -  Compare cost-effectiveness.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily for up to 24 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for up to 24 months. Quality of life is
           assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 664 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>QL will be measured using the patient-completed EORTC-QLQ C30 and lung cancer module (LC 14). The primary QL outcome measures will be changes in overall QL and the five most commonly reported lung cancer symptoms (fatigue, breathlessness, cough, emotional functioning and pain).</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>from date of randomisation to death</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness will be estimated in terms of quality-adjusted life years. Mean survival will be calculated on the basis of observed mortality (i.e. a within-trial estimate) and by extrapolating the survival curves if some patients remain alive at the end of the trial.</description>
