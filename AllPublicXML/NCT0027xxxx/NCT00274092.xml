    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the bronchodilator efficacy and safety of
      tiotropium inhalation capsules (18 mcg once daily) and Atrovent MDI (2 puffs of 20 mcg
      q.i.d.) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study to compare the
      bronchodilator efficacy and safety of tiotropium inhalation capsules and Atrovent MDI in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      Following an initial screening visit, patients will enter a 2-week baseline period. Patients
      who successfully complete this phase will be randomized into the double-blind portion of the
      study in which they will receive tiotropium once daily (morning) or Atrovent four times
      daily. Pulmonary function testing will be conducted just prior to the start of therapy at
      Visit 2 (i.e. randomization visit after completion of the 2-week run-in period) and at 120
      minutes post-dosing. Pulmonary function testing will be repeated at the same time intervals
      at the end of therapy.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Null and alternative hypotheses The primary objective of this study was addressed by a
      two-sided test at the 0.05 level of significance of the null hypothesis that, in patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the bronchodilator efficacy after one
      month is no greater on tiotropium inhalation capsules (18mcg once daily) than on ATROVENT MDI
      (2 puffs of 20 mcg q.i.d.), against the alternative hypothesis that the bronchodilator
      efficacy is greater on tiotropium inhalation capsules (18 mcg once daily).

      Comparison(s):

      Trough FEV1 response will be analyzed. Peak FEV1, FVC trough and peak response, number of
      Rescue Medication and change from baseline in total score of Patient Evaluation Questionnaire
      will be analyzed. Change from baseline in each category score of Patient Evaluation
      Questionnaire will be also analyzed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          1. COPD patients with an Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1)&lt;= 65% of predicted
             normal and FEV1 &lt;= 70% of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC).

          2. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.

          3. Patients must have a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A pack-year is
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for a year.

          4. Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests as required in the protocol.

          5. Patients must be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler device and should have
             a good technique of inhaling aerosol administered from an MDI..

          6. All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial
             i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications.

        Exclusion:

          1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study.

          2. Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion will
             be excluded.

          3. All patients with a SGOT and SGPT twice the upper normal limit, bilirubin 150% or
             creatinine 125% of the upper normal limit will be excluded regardless of the clinical
             condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will not be conducted in these subjects.

          4. Patients with a recent history (i.e. one year or less) of myocardial infarction.

             total eosinophil count bigger or equal 400 per ul (males) or bigger/equal 320 per ul
