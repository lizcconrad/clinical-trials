      In this study we aim to assess whether unsolicited occupational therapy compared to no
      therapy can decelerate the increase in disability in high-risk elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-dwelling elderly, and particularly the oldest old, are generally viewed as highly
      susceptible to the ‘inverse care law’. That is, those in greatest need for preventive
      assessment and surveillance have the highest potential benefit but are most likely to be
      missed. Hence, active case-finding and close follow-up might be an important strategy for
      maintaining the health, independence, and well-being of very elderly people who are at a
      particularly high risk.

      In this study we aim to assess whether unsolicited occupational therapy compared to no
      therapy can decelerate the increase in disability in high-risk elderly. Subjects in the
      intervention group will be visited by an occupational therapist who provides training and
      education about assistive devices that are already present and will give recommendations and
      information about procedures, possibilities, and costs of assistive devices and
      community-based services. Control subjects will not be visited by an occupational therapist.

      The primary outcome measure of the trial will be the score on the Groningen Activity
      Restriction Scale (GARS). Secondary outcome measures will be well-being and feelings of
      loneliness.
