      The purpose of this study is to compare the risks and benefits of steroid elimination versus
      steroid therapy in renal transplant patients particularly looking at the effects on bone
      mass, lipids, hypertension, and new onset diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of steroids after renal transplantation has been invaluable, resulting in higher
      rates of long term survival of the transplanted kidney. However, post-operative steroids are
      also associated with frequent post-operative and long term complications. There have been
      steroid elimination studies analyzing acute rejection rates, graft and patient survival.
      These studies show that many patients can safely have steroids withdrawn with equivalent
      results whan compared to those who remain on steroids.

      With this study we will be using a rapid steroid elimination protocol for 40 patients and
      compare 20 patients who remain on steroids. We hope to show a decreased rate of complications
      such as osteopenia/osteoporosis, new onset diabetes, and a decrease in cardiovascular risk
      factors such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension.

      Solumedrol will be given to all patients at the time of transplant followed by a prednisone
      taper. Those remaining on steroids will be discharged on prednisone 5 mg daily. Those in whom
      steroids are eliminated will be off prednisone by discharge.
