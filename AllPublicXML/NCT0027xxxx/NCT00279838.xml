  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intraoperative computer-assisted navigation
      improves prosthetic implant positioning as compared to conventional intraoperatve
      instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).

      Primary data to be obtained is to determine whether mechanical axis of the limb malignment
      differs between patients whom have computer-assisted TKA and those treated with conventional
      intraoperative instrumentation.

      Three months after surgery follow-up radiographic data will provide evidence on the initial
      implant position as determined with a series of x-rays including: full length standing,
      standard AP weight bearing, lateral, patellar, kneelingfilm views and CT evaluation. In
      addition, a correlation betweeen the CT measures and the kneeling x-ray can be performed at
      this time. Clinical (Knee Scale Society, WOMAC, and SF-36) data will also be obtained at the
      three month interval.
