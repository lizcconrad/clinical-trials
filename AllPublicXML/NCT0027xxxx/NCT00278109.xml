      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      radiation therapy together with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin after surgery may kill any
      tumor cells that remain.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of radiation therapy when given
      together with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin and to see how well they work in treating
      women with stage I or stage II breast cancer who have undergone surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the potential acute and late skin and subcutaneous toxicities in women with
           resected stage I or II breast cancer treated with partial breast irradiation (PBI) and
           concurrent cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin (AC) chemotherapy.

        -  Assess the cosmetic effects of partial breast irradiation/chemotherapy (PBIC) in these
           patients.

        -  Assess the local control rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo partial breast radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks.
      Patients also receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes
      on day 1. Treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide repeats every 2 weeks for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for approximately 10
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
