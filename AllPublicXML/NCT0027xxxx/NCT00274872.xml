      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more
      effective in treating colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying two combination chemotherapy regimens
      to compare how well they work in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that
      cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients with inoperable metastatic colorectal
           cancer treated with oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil with vs without
           maintenance leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil.

        -  Demonstrate that time of disease control (TDC) can be increased by 15% at 9 months and
           that maintenance therapy can be avoided.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall survival and response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the salvage surgery rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the duration of chemotherapy-free intervals in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the pharmacoeconomy and pharmacogenetics of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center, performance status (0-1 vs 2), number of
      metastatic sites (1 vs &gt; 1), age (18-50 years vs 51-75 years vs 76-80 years), adjuvant
      chemotherapy, and baseline alkaline phosphatase (≤ 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN] vs &gt; 3
      times ULN). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I

        -  FOLFOX chemotherapy: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium
           IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2.
           Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Patients then proceed to maintenance chemotherapy.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1
           and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14
           days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with disease progression on maintenance chemotherapy receive 6 additional courses of
      FOLFOX as above. Patients with continued disease progression while receiving the additional
      courses of FOLFOX proceed to irinotecan-based chemotherapy off study.

      Arm II

        -  FOLFOX chemotherapy: Patients receive 6 courses of FOLFOX as in arm I. Patients with
           disease progression on FOLFOX receive 6 additional courses of FOLFOX. Patients with
           continued disease progression while receiving the additional courses of FOLFOX proceed
           to irinotecan-based chemotherapy off study.

      In both arms, patients with stable or responding disease may undergo surgical resection after
      completion of the initial 6 courses of FOLFOX.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 4 and 6, and then every 2-3 months
      thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients will be accrued for this study.
