  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Celecoxib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving celecoxib after
      radiation therapy and chemotherapy may kill any tumor cells that remain after radiation
      therapy and chemotherapy. Sometimes, after radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the tumor may
      not need additional treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be
      sufficient.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying celecoxib to see how well it works
      compared to observation in treating patients who have undergone radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy for stage II or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the time to progression in patients with stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with celecoxib vs observation after treatment with chemoradiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the 2-year survival rate of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare weight changes and objective response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), and total dose of radiotherapy (65
      Gy vs 60 Gy).

      All patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7.5 weeks. Patients also receive
      docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Three weeks after the
      completion of radiotherapy, patients receive docetaxel alone IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      22. Three weeks later, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are observed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1
           year.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for up to 2 years in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
