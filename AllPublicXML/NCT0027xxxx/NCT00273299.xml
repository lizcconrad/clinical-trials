  <brief_title>Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Combination in the Treatment of Severe Hypertension</brief_title>
  <official_title>A 6-Week Study to Evaluate the Combination of Valsartan/HCTZ (160/12.5mg With Forced Titration to Maximum Dose of 320/25mg) Compared to Valsartan Monotherapy (160mg With Forced Titration to 320mg) as Initial Therapy in Patients With Severe Hypertension</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of using valsartan/HCTZ as initial
      therapy in patients with severe hypertension compared to valsartan alone as initial therapy,
      and to determine whether a greater proportion of patients achieve blood pressure control with
      the combination compared to the monotherapy without producing an unacceptable adverse event
      profile.
