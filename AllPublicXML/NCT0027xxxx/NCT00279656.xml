  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a collaborative approach (geriatric
      care involving the collaboration with a clinical pharmacist) to optimize the prescription of
      medicines for elderly inpatients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Widespread evidence reveals frequent inadequate use of medicines in elderly patients. This
      includes inappropriate prescribing (overuse, underuse, misuse) that can lead to adverse drug
      events and drug-related admissions to hospital. In addition, when a patient is transferred
      from acute care settings to ambulatory care settings, discrepancies in medicines used often
      occur and can be hazardous.

      Despite this, only limited data exist on the effectiveness of optimization strategies
      targeted at frail elderly inpatients.

      Comparison: elderly inpatients receiving geriatric evaluation and management (GEM) care
      versus elderly inpatients receiving pharmaceutical care in addition to GEM care.
