  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous- injection of beta-1,3-glucan in human is known to induce T helper type 1
      response, while oral uptake did not. It was examined whether superfine dispersed
      beta-1,3-glucan (SDG) contrived to absorbed by intestinal mucosa would alleviate allergic
      symptoms by per-oral ingestion

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta-1,3-glucan made from Japanese mushroom is commercially available for healthy foodstuffs.
      Allergy patients were orally administrated either SDG (n=30) or non-dispersed beta-1,3-glucan
      (NDG, n=30) and allergic symptoms were assessed clinically, by the double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized study
