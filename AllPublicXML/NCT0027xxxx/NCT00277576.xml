  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated at sites where
      administrations are given and any effects it may have on subjects' wellbeing. The study will
      also test the ability of vaccine to reduce hepatitis B disease.

      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for the most common form of parenterally transmitted
      viral hepatitis. It is estimated that approximately 350 million people worldwide are
      persistent carriers of the virus and it is a major cause of acute and chronic infections of
      the liver, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Chronic infection occurs in
      98% of new-born children infected by vertical transmission from the mother and in 5% of
      individuals infected after 2 years of age. About 25% of these subjects will progress to
      cirrhosis and 20% of this subgroup will develop hepatocellular carcinoma - one of the most
      common cancers world wide. HBV is a non-cytopathic virus and liver injury is mainly mediated
      by the host immune response against virus-infected liver cells and by the production of
      inflammatory cytokines. A vigorous, polyclonal and multispecific cytotoxic and helper T cell
      response to HBV is readily detectable in the peripheral blood of subjects with acute
      self-limited hepatitis B, but is weak, antigenically restricted (mono- or oligospecific) or
      undetectable in subjects with chronic infection. A vigorous T cell response is thus believed
      to be responsible for the elimination of the hepatitis B virus. The aim of a therapeutic
      vaccine would be to enhance natural responses by boosting the appropriate cellular immune
      response to HBV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile
      of the pPDPSC18 DNA vaccine as administered by Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED )
