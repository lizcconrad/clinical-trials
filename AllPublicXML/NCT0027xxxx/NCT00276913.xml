      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety, toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous
           STA-5312 when administered weekly (3 of 4 weeks) to subjects with advanced or metastatic
           solid tumors.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of STA-5312.

      Secondary Objective:

      • To assess antitumor activity of STA-5312 administration.

      This is a Phase I open-label, dose-escalation safety study in subjects with refractory non
      hematologic malignancies. STA-5312 will be administered intravenously. Administration is
      anticipated to take 1 hour, although infusion time may be extended when appropriate with
      large infusion volumes. A treatment cycle is 4 weeks with a weekly infusion of STA 5312 for
      the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. The planned treatment schedule is 2 cycles of
      STA-5312 treatment (8 weeks). Decisions regarding dose escalation and DLT determination will
      be made based on observations during the first cycle of therapy. Subjects who tolerate
      treatment may be eligible to continue receiving additional cycles of STA 5312 per the
      investigator's medical judgment. Evaluation of antitumor response will be performed after
      every 2 cycles of STA 5312 administration.

      The initial dose level of STA 5312 will be 6 mg/m2. The starting dose level was chosen based
      on preclinical animal studies that used alternate day dosing x 3/week on alternate weeks. The
      dose level of 6 mg/m2 represents less than 1/10 the weekly dose (3 mg/m2 x 3) that
      demonstrated severe toxicity. Subsequent dose escalations will follow an accelerated
      titration design once the 8 mg/m2 cohort is completed No fewer than 3 patients will be
      enrolled at each dose level. Once a DLT is observed the cohort will be expanded to at least
      six subjects. If one-third of at least 6 subjects treated at a dose level experience a DLT,
      dose escalation will terminate. The dose below this will be considered the MTD and will be
      expanded to at least 12 subjects to collect additional safety and pharmacokinetic data. No
      intrasubject dose escalations will occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects aged at least 18 years with histologically-confirmed non
             hematological malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which no standard
             therapy exists.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0-2.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy less than Grade 2 on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
             Criteria (NCI CTC) version 3 adverse event scale.

          -  Subjects must have acceptable organ and marrow function during the Screening Period as
             defined below. (Note: Subjects must meet these criteria at each pre-dose visit to
             receive additional doses of STA-5312).

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1500 cells/µL

               -  Platelets greater than 100,000/µL

               -  Total bilirubin must be &lt;1.5 times ULN

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤3 times ULN or less than 5 times the ULN in
                  subjects with liver metastases

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤3 times ULN or less than 5 times the ULN in subjects
                  with liver metastases

               -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt;2.0 mg/dL).

          -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) without evidence of clinically significant ventricular
             arrhythmias or active ischemia as determined by the investigator.
