      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irinotecan works in treating patients with
      newly diagnosed Ewing's sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the responsiveness of single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride in a patient
           population with newly diagnosed high-risk Ewing's sarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 2 courses. After completion of 2 courses of therapy, patients may receive additional
      treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
