  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to test the hypothesis that external counter pulsation
      therapy (ECPT) provides clinical benefit by improving the number and function of endothelial
      progenitor cells (EPCs) in peripheral blood of patients with angina pectoris.

      ECPT is a non-invasive approach for increasing blood flow to the heart in patients with
      myocardial ischemia. ECPT produces beneficial effects in coronary artery disease (CAD)
      patients. However, the exact mechanisms of ECPT action are not defined yet. Evidence has now
      accumulated that bone marrow-derived cells with angiogenic capability, termed EPCs, circulate
      in the blood of adults. EPCs possess the ability to home to sites of ischemia and contribute
      to neoangiogenesis.

      We prospectively study CAD patients [Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina class
      II-IV], before and after ECPT , and compare them with age- and sex-matched controls.
      Peripheral blood CD34+ cells, EPCs (CD34/VEGFR2+ cells), EPC colony forming units (CFUs) and
      brachial artery endothelial function is assessed prior to and after ECPT. Percent improvement
      in endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (%FMD) is assessed using
      high-resolution ultrasound.
