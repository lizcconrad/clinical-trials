      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may help the body build an
      effective immune response.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating
      patients who are being considered for solid organ transplant who are at risk for
      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of photochemically-treated autologous Epstein-Barr virus
           (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell vaccine in generating an EBV-specific T-cell and
           antibody response in EBV-negative patients or in boosting the response in EBV-positive
           patients who are being considered for a solid organ transplant and are at high risk for
           post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

        -  Determine adverse events associated with this vaccine in these patients.

        -  Determine the ability of the vaccine to protect from EBV primary infection in
           EBV-seronegative patients during the time course of the study.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status (seropositive vs seronegative).

      Patients receive photochemically-treated autologous EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell
      vaccine intradermally once in weeks 0 and 4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
