    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging and important disease in Taiwan.
      However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics have not been studied well. The purpose
      of this study is to resolve the aforementioned problem.

      [Study Subjects] Obesity was defined as the BMI value &gt; 95 percentile by different age- and
      gender groups according to the standards of the Department of Health in Taiwan.

      [Data Collection] The following data were obtained for each subject: age, gender, BMI, waist
      and hip circumference. BMI was calculated as body weight (kg)/ height (m2).

      In fasting venous blood samples, we measured total serum bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase,
      aspartate aminotransferase, Î³-glutamyltransferase, fasting glucose, triglyceride, total
      cholesterol,high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, glucose, and adiponectin.

      [Liver Ultrasonography] All participants underwent an ultrasonographic study of the liver
      performed by one operator.

      NAFLD was defined as the presence of an ultrasonographic pattern consistent with the
      following criteria: liver-kidney echo discrepancy, attenuated echo penetration and visibility
      of diaphragm, and obscure hepatic vessel structures.
