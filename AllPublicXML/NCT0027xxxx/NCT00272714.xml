  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two doses of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen
      (4-OHT) compared with placebo on the intensity of cyclic mastalgia in pre-menopausal women
      with regular menstrual cycles who are not taking oral contraceptives.

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-dose, multicentre
      trial of 4-OHT gel in approximately 130 otherwise healthy pre-menopausal women with a history
      of cyclical mastalgia, peaking during the second half of the menstrual cycle and decreasing
      significantly with the onset of menstruation, during the four months prior to study entry.

      The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is change in change in average pain Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) scores for the seven worst pain scores within a cycle, from baseline to the
      fourth cycle after start of treatment.
