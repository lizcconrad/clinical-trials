  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The life skills intervention model is designed to help adolescents promote their physical and
      mental health through cognitive and behavioral techniques (e.g., problem solving, coping, and
      communication skills) designed to help them achieve social and personal competencies used to
      manage various life challenges.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the salient advantages of this intervention model is that it has been developed and
      implemented in several studies with adolescents. However, data concerning the effects of this
      model are much less extensive with adolescents perinatally infected with HIV. The proposed
      study is designed to address this gap in knowledge by conducting a pilot intervention
      tailoring the life skills intervention to the needs of young adolescents, perinatally
      infected with HIV, and to their primary caregivers. Given the emphasis on peer group
      interaction, the proposed intervention model also has the potential to reduce some of the
      social isolation imposed by the experiences related to HIV infection by creating
      opportunities for adolescents to interact with others who are managing comparable stressors
      and treatment regimens.
