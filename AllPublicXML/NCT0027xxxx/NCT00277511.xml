      Primary objective:

        -  To investigate the microbiological efficacy, assessed as eradication rate based on
           microbiologically evaluable patients 1 month post treatment with oral Levofloxacin 500
           mg in male adults with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP, category II)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To investigate the microbiological efficacy, assessed as eradication rate based on
           microbiologically evaluable patients 6 months post treatment with oral Levofloxacin 500
           mg in male adults with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP, category II).

        -  To assess the clinical response rate based on resolution of signs and symptoms after 2
           weeks of treatment; 5-12 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment with oral
           Levofloxacin 500 mg in male adults with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP, category
           II).

        -  To assess the safety of Levofloxacin 500 mg on the basis of adverse events, standard
           clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis and vital signs in male adults with chronic
           bacterial prostatitis (CBP, category II).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment into the
        study:

          -  A clinical diagnosis of chronic prostatitis as evidenced by the following criteria:

               -  clinical signs and symptoms of prostatitis and

               -  a history of chronic prostatitis as defined as: symptomatic prostatitis (a
                  clinical diagnosis of prostatitis having been made for at least one previous
                  episode which episode having lasted four weeks or two or more other episodes
                  during the previous twelve months) and leucocyturia greater/equal 10 WBC/HPF x
                  400

          -  Laboratory evidence of prostatitis

          -  Candidate is appropriate for oral therapy.

          -  OTC medications for chronic prostatitis (other than antibiotics), which the subject
             has been receiving must continue throughout the study at the same dose or be
             discontinued prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:

          -  Need for parenteral therapy for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP,
             Category II)

          -  Subjects with pathogen known or suspected to be resistant to the study drug

          -  Requirement for a second systemic antibacterial regimen

          -  Any condition which may interfere with the evaluation of the study drug including
             transurethral prostatectomy within 6 months of enrollment, the presence of a permanent
             transurethral catheter or a history of cystostomy or nephrostomy

          -  Taking medication that may effect bladder or prostate function (e.g. hormone therapy
             anticholinergics or alpha-blocker)

          -  Patients not receiving saw palmetto at the time of study entry should not start
             treatment with saw palmetto within 10 weeks of study entry
