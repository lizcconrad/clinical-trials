  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE) is a chronic, T-helper 2 cell (TH2) - type inflammatory
      disorder of the esophagus with a rapidly increasing prevalence. Studies analyzing the natural
      course of EE provide strong evidence, that the chronic inflammation leads to irreversible
      structural changes in the esophagus with a loss of the mucosal elasticity and a fibrosis of
      the sub-epithelial esophageal layers with a concomitant risk of impairment in function.

      Treatment strategies in chronic inflammations have, in general, two main goals: 1) Relief of
      symptoms and 2) Prevention of long-term damage of the affected organ. Until now, the
      treatment of EE is still controversial. Standard recommendations for therapy of this chronic
      eosinophilic inflammation include dilation, systemic or topical corticosteroids and
      leukotriene antagonists. Several of these reports demonstrate, that topical corticosteroids
      may be effective for symptom control as well as for down-regulating the local inflammation.
      Furthermore it has been demonstrated, that treatment with topical corticosteroids is as
      effective as oral prednisone. However, the majority of therapeutic recommendations are based
      on clinical observations, case reports or small case series.

      The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the efficacy and the safety of a monotherapy
      with a topical corticosteroid as short-term induction-treatment and as long-term,
      maintenance-treatment compared with placebo, in the treatment of adult patients with active
      EE.
