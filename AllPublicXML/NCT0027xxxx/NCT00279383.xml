      OSHES (= Observational Study on Hemostasis in Surgery) is a non interventional register
      settled in Italy with the purpose of collecting data on 800 patients intra-operatively
      treated with hemostatic supporting agents/techniques in addition to the standard surgical
      procedures in 40 surgical wards. The availability of these data will allow for a better
      understanding of the therapeutic needs in the area of hemostatic supporting
      agents/techniques.
