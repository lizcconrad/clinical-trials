  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the bronchodilator efficacy of ipratropium plus salbutamol (Combivent) with
      salbutamol alone given every 20 minutes for three doses in asthmatic children with severe
      acute exacerbation

      A Comparison of Ipratropium 500mcg and salbutamol 2.5mg (Combivent UDV) and salbutamol UDV
      alone (2.5mg) in a Double-blind, Efficacy and Safety Study in Asthmatic Children with Severe
      Acute Exacerbation

      Study Hypothesis:

      Several studies, including a study conducted in an emergency room setting, demonstrated that
      the addition of ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic drug, to standard salbutamol therapy
      significantly improves pulmonary function as compared to salbutamol alone.

      Comparison(s):

      Ipratropium bromide 500 mcg plus salbutamol 2.5mg (Combivent) vs salbutamol (2.5mg) alone
      given every 20 minutes for 3 doses
