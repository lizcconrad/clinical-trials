      The study is being done to compare the safety and effects (good and bad) of three different
      combinations of immunosuppression drugs used by kidney transplant recipients while also
      looking at their kidney function.

      This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multinational study. The study will be
      looking at the kidney function of kidney transplant recipients, while also comparing the
      safety and the effects (good and bad) of three different combinations of immunosuppression
      drugs in combination with prednisone, following treatment with Daclizumab (Zenapax). The
      three combinations are; (1) sirolimus and tacrolimus followed by the withdrawal of tacrolimus
      after three months; (2) sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); and (3) tacrolimus and
      MMF. The participants will be required to return to throughout the next 24 months following
      their transplant for physical exams, chest x-ray, blood, and urine tests. Participants will
      be put into one of three groups, and receive the study drugs starting on the day of
      transplant. Due to some drugs affecting the drug levels of sirolimus, participants need to
      agree not to take any new drugs during the study unless approved by the study doctor.
