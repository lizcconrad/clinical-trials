  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study is a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of
      modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) to (1) increase both short and long term adherence
      to HAART treatment, and (2) improve clinical outcomes associated with HAART therapy.

      Our hypothesis is that modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) during the initial 6 weeks
      of HAART, supervised primarily by HIV-positive lay activists, will improve adherence and
      clinical outcomes compared with those that do not have supervised mDOT. We also hypothesize
      that the benefits of mDOT will be achieved through a variety of mediators that will result
      from the social interactions the patients will have with the activists. These mediators
      include improved social support, improved knowledge about HAART, reduced stigma, and improved
      self-efficacy.

    <textblock>
      To test this hypothesis, we intend to randomize 350 ARV na√Øve patients starting HAART to
      either receive mDOT for the initial 6 weeks of treatment or standard adherence support. Both
      intervention and control groups will receive standard HIV care that includes HAART
      medications free of charge, clinical and laboratory follow-up, psychosocial adherence support
      by a trained social worker, and referral to community-based peer support groups. Patients in
      the intervention group will in addition to stand care, receive their morning weekday dose of
      a twice-daily HAART regimen under DOT in clinic for 6 weeks. Nighttime and weekend doses are
      self-administered. A group of HIV-positive DOT activists, who are trained and paid lay-clinic
      personnel, will be primarily responsible for the direct observation of treatment in the mDOT
      group. In addition to observing treatment, DOT activists will provide counseling, education,
      and emotional support to patients, and will also locate patients not presenting for DOT on
      the same day. Although the HIV activists may also provide psychosocial and adherence support
      to specific patients in the control group, this support will only be a daily and formalized
      part of care in the group randomized to mDOT.

    <description>Peers individually administered the 6-week mDOT intervention at the Beira Day Clinic to mDOT participants during their morning weekday dose. Evening and weekend doses were not observed. Nighttime and weekend doses were self-administered. As part of the daily interaction with participants, peers provided social support, information about the benefits and side effects of HAART, how to address stigma's effect on adherence, and encouragement to participate in community support groups. The peers also provided an important link between the individual and other members of the HIV clinic team and the community.</description>
