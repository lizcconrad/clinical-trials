  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine whether increasing arterial distensibility by decreasing advanced glycation
      end-product (AGE) cross-link components of vascular stiffness improves (a)
      endothelial-mediated vasoreactivity at rest, as assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD),
      and (b) endothelial-mediated vasoreactivity after exercise, as assessed by pulse
      perfusion-mediated vasodilation (PPMV).

      -  Explore several independent variables as potential independent predictors of vascular
           stiffness and endothelial function. These parameters include patient age, body mass
           index, gender, renal disease, history of cardiovascular disease, serum cholesterol, and
           antihypertensive medication use.

        -  Provide insight into nitric oxide-dependent endothelial function in the setting of
           increased arterial stiffness by determination of substances in the nitric oxide
           signaling pathway (specifically, levels of serum cGMP; serum nitrate and nitrite; and
           serum asymmetric dimethylarginine [ADMA], an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide
           synthase).

        -  Provide insight into changes in AGE levels and collagen metabolism in response to
           alagebrium therapy [specifically, AGEs: pentosidine, carboxymethyllysine,
           carboxyethyllysine, furosine; Collagen markers: procollagen I carboxyterminal propeptide
           (PICP), procollagen type I N terminal propeptide (PINP), cross-linked carboxyterminal
           telopeptide of Type I collagen (ICTP), n-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen
           (PIIINP)].

        -  Provide insight into changes in markers of inflammation in response to alagebrium
           therapy [specifically, free and total serum matrix metalloproteinase-1(MMP-1), free
           tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1
           (ICAM), P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWf), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and
           high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs CRP)].

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 50 years of age or greater.

          2. Diagnosed with systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mm Hg and (less
             than or equal to) 200 mm Hg, and a diastolic blood pressure (less than or equal to) 95
             mm Hg) and elevated pulse pressure (systolic blood pressure [SBP] minus diastolic
             blood pressure [DBP] greater than 60 mm Hg).

          3. Normal left ventricular function (ejection fraction &gt;55%) at baseline (Visit 3).

          4. Able to perform bicycle exercise.

          5. Able to read, understand and sign the informed consent after the nature of the study
             has been explained.

          6. If sexually active, the patient agrees to use reliable contraception while
             participating in this study. If a woman, is surgically sterilized or post-menopausal,
             or has a negative serum pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Aortic stenosis, prior known coronary artery disease (including myocardial
             infarction), cerebrovascular accident, or peripheral vascular disease.

          2. Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP &gt; 200/ DBP &gt; 95 mm Hg).

          3. Atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, or chronic lung disease.

          4. Any additional condition(s) which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prohibit
             the patient from completing the study, or not be in the best interest of the patient.

          5. Treatment with nitrates, or a change in antihypertensive medications within the last 1
             month.

          6. Treatment with any investigational drug within 1 month prior to study drug
             administration.
