      This research plan proposes to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical
      trial in 36 adults with mild Huntington's disease (HD) to address the following research
      aims:

        1. To determine the effect of citalopram compared to placebo in patients with early HD on
           executive function and other outcome variables including functional measures
           (health-related quality of life, work productivity, and self-reported attention), motor
           performance, and psychiatric status,

        2. To study the relationship between executive function and functional status in patients
           with early HD after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, and

        3. To examine the effect of citalopram treatment on volumetric and metabolic (i.e,
           N-acetyl-aspartate concentration) measures in the neostriatum among patients with
           recently diagnosed Huntington's disease.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To examine the effects of sixteen weeks of treatment with the selective serotonin
           reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram compared to placebo on executive function in
           patients with early Huntington's disease (HD).

        2. To study the relationship between executive function and functional status in patients
           with early HD after SSRI treatment.

        3. To determine the effect of sixteen weeks of citalopram compared to placebo on other
           outcome variables including functional measures (health-related quality of life, work
           productivity, and self-reported attention), motor performance, and psychiatric status.

        4. To examine the effect of citalopram treatment on volumetric and metabolic (i.e,
           N-Acetyl-Aspartate concentration) measures in the neostriatum among patients with
           recently diagnosed Huntington's Disease.

      Main Hypotheses:

        1. At the end of the treatment protocol, patients receiving citalopram as compared with
           placebo will show a significantly greater improvement on tests of executive function.

        2. Performance on measures of executive function will be significantly associated with
           measures of functional status.

        3. At the end of the treatment protocol, patients receiving citalopram as compared with
           placebo will show a significantly greater improvement in functional status and
           psychiatric ratings; motor score is not expected to change as a result of citalopram
           therapy.

        4. Using structural MRI and occipital proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS),
           after treatment, patients with recently diagnosed Huntington's Disease will show greater
           changes from baseline on volumetric and metabolic (i.e., N-Acetyl-Aspartate
           concentration) neuroimaging measures in the neostriatum than those on placebo.

      <recruitment_details>Thirty-six individuals were screened and 33 participants were randomized between May 2007 and April 2011 Participants were recruited using advertisements, by speaking at HD events, through local clinics and through two HD registries: The University of Iowa HD registry and the National HD Research Roster (Indiana).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following the baseline visit, participants completed a study visit (i.e., Visit 01) after 2 weeks in order to wash-out practice effects on primary outcome measures. To further control for practice effects, participants received placebo for 14 days prior to randomization (i.e., using a placebo run-in design).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Executive Function Composite Score Comparing Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visits 5 (Week 12) &amp; 6 (Week 15) for the Citalopram Cohort Versus Placebo Cohort.</title>
        <description>Full Scale Name: The Executive Composite Score (ECS). Definition: Subscales were averaged to compute this composite total score. The ECS is the weighted average of performance on 6 subtests of executive function, including (1) the Controlled Oral Word Association Test, (2) Symbol Digit Modalities test; (3) Stroop Color Word Test (Interference Trial), (4) Trail Making test (Part B), (5) Letter-Number Sequencing, and (6) Animal Naming. Construct Measured: Thinking tasks involving planning, working memory, attention, problem solving, verbal reasoning, inhibition, mental flexibility, and task switching. ECS Scale Range: The ECS score ranges from -5 to +5 on a standardized (Z) score scale, where lower scores indicate poorer performance on executive functioning tasks. Change Calculation Details: Compares change in executive functioning performance from visit 2 (week 0) to the weighted average of visits 5 (week 12) &amp; 6 (week 15) for the citalopram versus placebo cohort.</description>

        <title>Semantic Fluency Score Comparing Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visits 5 (Week 12) &amp; 6 (Week 15) for the Citalopram Cohort Versus Placebo Cohort</title>
        <description>Semantic Fluency Score. Definition: The Semantic Fluency Score is the number of words a person can produce given a category, including naming (1) Animal names, (2) Fruit names, (3) Boy names, (4) Girl names, and (5) Vegetable names. Construct Measured: Working memory and verbal initiation. Scale Range: The Semantic Fluency Score ranges from -5 to +5 on a standardized (Z) score scale, where lower scores indicate poorer performance on working memory tasks. Change Calculation Details: Compares change in working memory performance from visit 2 (week 0) where patients named fruit names to the weighted average of visits 5 (week 12) &amp; 6 (week 15) where patients named girl names and vegetable names respectively for the citalopram versus placebo cohort.</description>

        <title>Trails B Score Comparing Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visits 5 (Week 12) &amp; 6 (Week 15) for the Citalopram Cohort Versus Placebo Cohort</title>
        <description>Full Scale Name: Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B). Definition: The TMT-B test requires participants to “connect-the-dots” of 25 consecutive targets on a sheet of paper where the subject alternates between numbers and letters, going in both numerical and alphabetical order. Constructs Measured: Attention, set shifting, and processing speed. Scale range: The TMT-B score ranges from -5 to +5 on a standardized (Z) score scale, where lower scores indicate poorer performance. Change Calculation Details: Compares change in attention and processing speed performance from visit 2 (week 0) to the weighted average of visits 5 (week 12) and 6 (week 15) for the citalopram versus placebo cohort.</description>
