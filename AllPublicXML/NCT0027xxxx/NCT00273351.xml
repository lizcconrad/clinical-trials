  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
      rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, and tremor. Clinical decline reflects ongoing
      degeneration of dopamine-containing neurons. A critical unmet need for clinical research is
      to improve early detection of these diseases by developing tools to assist with earlier
      diagnosis. Biomarkers are broadly defined as characteristics that are objectively measured
      and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or
      pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention (Biomarkers Defintions Working Group
      2001). Development of reliable biomarkers for PD would dramatically accelerate research on PD
      etiology, pathophysiology, disease progression and therapeutics. Specific biomarkers may be
      useful at the onset of neurodegeneration, the onset of disease, and/or to mark disease
      progression. The biomarkers in this study include brain imaging with a radioactively labelled
      drug (Beta-CIT), computerized testing of memory, attention, motor speed, judgment and
      handwriting, and assessments of speech and smell. Subjects may also be asked to provide a
      blood sample for genetic and biochemical testing.

      Individuals who agree to participate in this trial will have a complete screening exam by a
      neurologist at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) in New Haven, CT. The exam
      may include blood tests, urine tests and an electrocardiogram (ECG -tracing of the electrical
      activity of the heart) to determine eligibility for the trial.

      Research subjects will participate in a variety of biomarker assessments including brain
      imaging, which will take place over a period of two days.

      On the first day subjects report to IND after a brief exam subjects will receive a standard
      dose of Lugol's solution (potassium iodide) by mouth to decrease uptake of the radioactive
      drug into the thyroid gland. Subjects will be given a standard dose of potassium perchlorate
      if allergic to iodine.

      Next subjects will receive the intravenous (IV - into a vein) injection of the Beta-CIT, a
      radioactive material that localizes in the brain.

      On the second day, about 24 hours after the injection, subjects will return to IND for a
      SPECT scan. The SPECT camera takes a &quot;picture&quot; of the radiation emitted by the Beta-CIT. This
      procedure will take approximately 30 minutes.

      Subjects will be contacted by phone one week following the injection to monitor adverse (bad
      or harmful) events possibly related to the imaging procedure.

      This two-day imaging procedure, comprehensive neurological testing, and blood collection for
      genetics and biochemical testing may be repeated every 12 to 18 months during the next five
      years.
