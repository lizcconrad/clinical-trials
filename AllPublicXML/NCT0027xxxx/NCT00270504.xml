  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the placement of a temporary urethral stent for
      up to 12 months, following dilation or internal urethrotomy (cutting open), results in a
      higher rate of urethral patency during the first year of follow-up when compared to the
      control group that does not receive a stent.

    <textblock>
      Patients with bulbar urethral stricture are 2:1 randomised for either urethral dilation or
      internal urethrotomy with (treatment group) or without (control group) subsequent stenting.
      All patients are followed for up to one year at 4-6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months with visual
      assessment (urethroscopy) of urethral patency at the treated segment of the urethra. The
      stent is removed at one year. In case of premature stent removal the patient is also followed
      for up to one year unless further intervention is decided.

      Control patients are offered the stent treatment option if the stricture recurs within the
      observation period but this group is separately analysed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Strictures:
