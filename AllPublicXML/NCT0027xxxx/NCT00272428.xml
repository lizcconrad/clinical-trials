  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that a low dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins and minerals
      increases the incidence rate of cardiovascular disease and cancer. To date, however, the
      published results of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of supplements containing
      antioxidant nutrients have not provided clear evidence of a beneficial effect. We tested the
      efficacy of nutritional doses of supplementation with a combination of antioxidant vitamins
      and minerals in reducing the incidence of cancer and ischemic cardiovascular disease in the
      general population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From experimental studies it is known that free radicals may induce numerous pathological
      processes, and it has been suggested that, because of their antioxidant capacity, nutrients
      such as beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium and zinc may prevent such harmful
      effects. Epidemiological data from cross-sectional, case-control, and prospective studies
      have indeed shown a strong relationship between the intake of antioxidant vitamins and
      minerals, or foods rich in these nutrients, and the risk of cancer and ischaemic
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, randomised placebo-controlled primary prevention
      trials, in which antioxidant micronutrients alone or in pairs were given at high doses over
      long periods, have not been able to prove this potential beneficial effect, and two of these
      even suggested harmful effects. The seemingly contradictory results between the observational
      studies and these randomised trials can be explained by the fact that the doses used in
      clinical trials were much higher than the highest levels reachable by usual dietary intake
      which have been found to be associated in observational studies with the lowest risk of
      cancer and CVD. In fact, the only trial which did observe a beneficial effect on total
      mortality and cancer incidence used nutritional doses of a combination of several vitamins
      and minerals and was performed on Chinese population with very low baseline micronutrient
      status, due to poor life conditions in this region (9).

      The objective of the &quot;SUpplementation en VItamines et Minéraux AntioXydants&quot; (SU.VI.MAX)
      study, was to test in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial, if an adequate and well
      balanced intake of antioxidant nutrients reduces the incidence of cancers and ischaemic
      cardiovascular diseases in a middle-age general population.
