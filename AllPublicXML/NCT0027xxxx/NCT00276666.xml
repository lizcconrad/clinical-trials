  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as lomustine, vincristine, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving radiation therapy together with combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any
      tumor cells that remain.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving radiation therapy together with combination
      chemotherapy to see how well it works in treating young patients with metastatic
      medulloblastoma who have undergone surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity of hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) in young
           patients with metastatic medulloblastoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of chemotherapy (vincristine during radiotherapy and 8 courses of
           lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine after radiotherapy) in association with HART in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Radiotherapy and vincristine: Beginning 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo
           hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) twice a day, 5 days a week, for 5
           weeks. Patients also receive vincristine IV once weekly for 8 weeks beginning in week
           1*. Approximately 6-8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients proceed to
           maintenance chemotherapy.

      NOTE: *The first 7 patients undergo radiotherapy without receiving vincristine

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Patients receive oral lomustine once on day 1 and cisplatin IV
           over 6 hours on day 1 and vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 6
           weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.

                    -  Nodular/desmoplastic medulloblastoma

                    -  Medullomyoblastoma

                    -  Melanotic medulloblastoma

          -  Metastatic disease, meeting at least 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Unequivocal evidence on pre- or post-operative MR scan of supratentorial (stage
                  M2) metastases and/or spinal metastases (stage M3)

               -  Tumor cells seen on cytospin analysis of lumbar cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
                  (stage M1) performed between 15 days and 21 days after surgery

                    -  Involvement of CSF pathways by tumor is defined as the unequivocal
                       identification of primitive neuroectodermal cells, either on cytological
                       grounds or with a combination of cytological and immunocytological features
                       (e.g., reactivity for GFAP or a neuronal marker, such as synaptophysin)
