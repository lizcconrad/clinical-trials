    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Modified Rankin Score of Less Than 3 at the End of Study Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of disability and dependence in daily activities was assessed using the modified Rankin scale. The modified Rankin scale is a 6-point numerical scale (0=no symptoms at all, 1=no significant disability, 2=slight disability, 3=moderate disability, 4=moderately severe disability, 5=severe disability) which measures the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168. The percentage of subjects having a modified Rankin Score&lt;3 at the end of the study (Day 168) are reported.</description>

    <description>The degree of disability and dependence in daily activities was assessed using the modified Rankin scale.The modified Rankin scale is a 6-point numerical scale (0=no symptoms at all, 1=no significant disability, 2=slight disability,3=moderate disability, 4=moderately severe disability, 5=severe disability) which measures the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168. The distribution of subjects according to disability severity scores was assessed and the percentage of subjects at each point on the modified Rankin scale are reported for each time point.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Sandoz Clinical Assessment-Geriatric (SCAG) Scores at Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The SCAG scale was to be used to evaluate the psychopathological state of the subject. It is composed of 18 symptom areas and an overall global assessment, all rated on a 7-point format from 1=not present to 7=severe. The total score range is from 19 to 133 (best to worst), with a negative mean change from baseline indicating an improvement in symptoms. Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168 and the mean change from baseline at each time point is reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Barthel Index Scores at Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The performance in activities of daily living was assessed by using the Barthel scale. The Barthel scale is an ordinal scale which measures 10 performance items describing activities of daily living. Each item is rated with a given number of points from 0 indicating total dependence up to a maximum of 10 or 15 (depending on performance item) indicating complete independence. The total score range is from 0 to 100 (worst to best), with a positive mean change indicating an improvement in independence.
Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168 and the mean change from baseline at each time point is reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Mini Mental State (MMS) Test Scores at Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The MMS test was used to evaluate the cognitive function of the subject. It includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual spatial skills, which are rated with a given number of points assigned to each level or ranking. The lower the score, the more important the mental deficit. The total score range is from 0 to 30 (worst to best), with a positive mean change indicating an improvement (i.e. less mental deficit). Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168 and the mean change from baseline at each time point is reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Subscore for Questions 1a,1b and 1c at Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHSS was to be used to objectively quantify the impairment caused by the stroke.The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which score a specific ability between 0 (normal function) and 4 (high level of impairment).The minimum total score is 0 and maximum is 42. Only 8 of the NIHSS subscores were calculated for this study.
Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168. Mean NIHSS subscores for questions 1a (level of consciousness),1b (asking patient the month and their age), and 1c (asking to open and close eyes) were analysed using descriptive quantitative statistics at each visit and the mean change from baseline at each time point is reported. The range for the subscore for items 1a is 0 - 3, for 1b is 0 - 2 and for 1c is 0 - 2 (best to worst), with a negative mean change from baseline indicating an improvement.</description>

        <description>The degree of disability and dependence in daily activities was assessed using the modified Rankin scale. The modified Rankin scale is a 6-point numerical scale (0=no symptoms at all, 1=no significant disability, 2=slight disability, 3=moderate disability, 4=moderately severe disability, 5=severe disability) which measures the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168. The percentage of subjects having a modified Rankin Score&lt;3 at the end of the study (Day 168) are reported.</description>

        <description>The SCAG scale was to be used to evaluate the psychopathological state of the subject. It is composed of 18 symptom areas and an overall global assessment, all rated on a 7-point format from 1=not present to 7=severe. The total score range is from 19 to 133 (best to worst), with a negative mean change from baseline indicating an improvement in symptoms. Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168 and the mean change from baseline at each time point is reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Barthel Index Scores at Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168.</title>
        <description>The performance in activities of daily living was assessed by using the Barthel scale. The Barthel scale is an ordinal scale which measures 10 performance items describing activities of daily living. Each item is rated with a given number of points from 0 indicating total dependence up to a maximum of 10 or 15 (depending on performance item) indicating complete independence. The total score range is from 0 to 100 (worst to best), with a positive mean change indicating an improvement in independence.
Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168 and the mean change from baseline at each time point is reported.</description>

        <description>The MMS test was used to evaluate the cognitive function of the subject. It includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual spatial skills, which are rated with a given number of points assigned to each level or ranking. The lower the score, the more important the mental deficit. The total score range is from 0 to 30 (worst to best), with a positive mean change indicating an improvement (i.e. less mental deficit). Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168 and the mean change from baseline at each time point is reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Subscore for Questions 1a,1b and 1c at Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168.</title>
        <description>The NIHSS was to be used to objectively quantify the impairment caused by the stroke.The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which score a specific ability between 0 (normal function) and 4 (high level of impairment).The minimum total score is 0 and maximum is 42. Only 8 of the NIHSS subscores were calculated for this study.
Assessments were made at baseline (Day 0) and at each follow-up visit on Day 28, Day 84 and Day 168. Mean NIHSS subscores for questions 1a (level of consciousness),1b (asking patient the month and their age), and 1c (asking to open and close eyes) were analysed using descriptive quantitative statistics at each visit and the mean change from baseline at each time point is reported. The range for the subscore for items 1a is 0 - 3, for 1b is 0 - 2 and for 1c is 0 - 2 (best to worst), with a negative mean change from baseline indicating an improvement.</description>
