    <textblock>
      Doctors at Mayo Clinic are doing this study to learn if pyridostigmine, a drug, affects the
      speed at which food travels through the stomach, intestines and colon, and if pyridostigmine
      improves constipation symptoms in patients with diabetes. Pyridostigmine has been approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use, however, its use as proposed
      in this study is considered investigational.

    <textblock>
      Chronic constipation in diabetes mellitus is associated with colonic motor dysfunction and is
      managed with laxatives. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase colonic motility. The study
      evaluated the effects of a cholinesterase inhibitor (pyridostigmine vs. placebo) on
      gastrointestinal and colonic transit and bowel function in diabetic patients with
      constipation.

      After a 9-day baseline period, patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic constipation
      without defecatory disorder will be randomized to oral placebo or pyridostigmine, starting
      with 60 mg three times a day, increasing by 60 mg every third day up to the maximum tolerated
      dose of 120 mg three times a day; this dose will be maintained for 7 days. Gastrointestinal
      and colonic transit (assessed by scintigraphy) and bowel function will be evaluated at
      baseline and the final 3 and 7 days of treatment, respectively.

    <measure>Colonic Geometric Center at 24 Hours (GC24) Measured by Scintigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline period (days 7-9 ), Treatment period (days 14-17)</time_frame>
    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images of the abdomen are taken hourly for the first 6 hours after the radio-labeled meal, then at 8, 24 and 48 hours. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool. GC24 is the measurement taken at 24 hours after the radio-labeled meal.</description>

    <time_frame>Daily during baseline period (9 days), Treatment period (7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>During 9 days of the baseline period and during 17 days of the treatment period, subjects used a daily diary to record a description of stool consistency according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale (ranging from 1 (hard lumps) to 7 (watery)). The Bristol Stool Scale is a medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories or types. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation with 3 and 4 being the &quot;ideal stools&quot; especially the latter, as they are the easiest to defecate, and 5-7 tending towards diarrhea.</description>

          <title>Body Mass Index</title>
          <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a health index for comparing weight to height. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared. The body mass index is an indication if a person is at a suitable weight for his height on an approximation of body fat. A body mass index of under 20 is considered to be underweight, while a body mass index between 20 to 25 is considered healthy. A body mass index in the range of 25 to 30 is regarded as overweight. A body mass index over 30 is regarded as obese.</description>

          <title>Geometric Center (GC) of Colonic transit</title>
          <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure movement of large intestine contents. A radio-labeled isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule taken by mouth with a meal. Abdominal anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>

        <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images of the abdomen are taken hourly for the first 6 hours after the radio-labeled meal, then at 8, 24 and 48 hours. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool. GC24 is the measurement taken at 24 hours after the radio-labeled meal.</description>

        <title>Colonic Geometric Center at 48 Hours (GC48) as Measured by Scintigraphy</title>
        <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly for the first 6 hours after the radio-labeled meal, then at 8, 24 and 48 hours. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool. GC48 is the measurement taken at 48 hours after the radio-labeled meal.</description>

        <description>During 9 days of the baseline period and during 17 days of the treatment period, subjects used a daily diary to record a description of stool consistency according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale (ranging from 1 (hard lumps) to 7 (watery)). The Bristol Stool Scale is a medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories or types. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation with 3 and 4 being the &quot;ideal stools&quot; especially the latter, as they are the easiest to defecate, and 5-7 tending towards diarrhea.</description>

            <groups_desc>Bowel diaries were analyzed by computing the mean scores for the 9-day baseline period and separately for the last 7 days of the treatment period (i.e., when the pyridostigmine dose was stable in each subject.) Individual subject treatment period mean bowel function scores were then compared using a similar ANCOVA model, with the corresponding individual subject baseline mean bowel function score and gender as covariates.</groups_desc>
