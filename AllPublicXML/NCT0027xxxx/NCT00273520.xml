      Primary Objective:

        -  The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of telithromycin versus
           placebo as a supplement to the usual standard of care during an acute exacerbation of
           asthma. Efficacy will be assessed by:

             -  Changes in the diary card summary symptom score assessed daily for 6 weeks, and

             -  Changes in the domiciliary morning Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) following oral
                telithromycin treatment

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the microbial activity of telithromycin during an exacerbation of asthma by:

             -  Assessment of the patient's clinical improvement relative to initial C. pneumoniae
                or M. pneumoniae status, and

             -  Analysis of the quantitative changes from baseline in C. pneumonia or M. pneumoniae
                by culture and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).

        -  To evaluate the safety of 10 days of oral telithromycin as a supplement to the standard
           of care for patients with acute exacerbations of asthma

        -  To assess additional efficacy endpoints and health outcome evaluations following 10 days
           of treatment with either oral telithromycin or placebo, with either treatment used as a
           supplement to the standard of care for patients with acute exacerbations of asthma:

             -  Changes and daily variability in the PEFR during the 6 weeks of study treatment,

             -  Health status at follow-up (6 weeks)

             -  Pulmonary function tests:

                  -  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)

                  -  Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)

                  -  Forced Expiratory Flow Rate (FEF25-75%)

             -  Need for additional medications (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids, oral
                corticosteroids, bronchodilator use),

             -  Time to next acute exacerbation of asthma.

             the following signs and symptoms of an acute deterioration in asthma control: (reduced
             PEFR, increased wheeze, and dyspnea, with or without cough).

          -  A PEFR less than 80% of predicted normal
