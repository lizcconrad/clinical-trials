      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), (done before, during, and after treatment) may help
      doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well MRI and MRSI evaluate patients who are
      undergoing treatment for gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) characteristics of
           patients who are undergoing treatment for supratentorial glioma.

        -  Determine the survival of patients who undergo magnetic resonance imaging and MRSI.

        -  Determine the clinical outcome of patients who undergo these imaging procedures.

        -  Correlate measures of metabolic tumor burden (i.e., CNI, CCCrI, CrNI, and LLI) with
           survival and clinical outcome in patients who undergo these imaging procedures.

        -  Determine the time to clinical progression in patients who undergo these imaging
           procedures.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on grade of disease.

        -  Group 1 (patients with grade II glioma): Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging
           (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Patients then receive
           chemotherapy. Patients undergo repeat MRI/MRSI after courses 2 and 4 of chemotherapy.

        -  Group 2 (patients with grade III-IV glioma): Patients undergo MRI/MRSI and then undergo
           surgical resection of the tumor. Patients then receive chemoradiotherapy. Patients
           undergo repeat MRI/MRSI within 2 weeks and at 2 months after completion of radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed for recurrence, disease progression, and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be accrued for this study.
