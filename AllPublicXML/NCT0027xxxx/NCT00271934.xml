    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem, inflammatory disorder characterized by the
      production of antibodies that react with many different self-antigens. Defects in immune
      regulation underlie the breakdown in self-tolerance.(1) The clinical course of lupus is
      variable. Aggressive intervention is reserved for disease with characteristic high risk
      features including diffuse, proliferative glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage,
      cerebritis and other life-threatening manifestations of vasculitis. In patients with SLE and
      high risk features, we propose extension of current immunosuppressive therapy to the point of
      complete immune ablation and hematopoietic stem cell recovery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than age of 60 year at the time of pretransplant evaluation.

          2. An established clinical diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with one of the
             following features:

               1. Lupus nephritis-WHO class III or IV (or V when coexistent III or IV) lupus
                  nephritis, failing NIH short course cyclophosphamide therapy (10mg/kg q month for
                  6 months). Failure will be defined as failure of creatinine to return to normal
                  or pre-exacerbation level.

               2. Vasculitis/Immune complex deposition- causing end organ signs or symptoms e.g.
                  cerebritis, transverse myelitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, cardiac failure, renal
                  failure.

               3. Cytopenias that are immune-mediated and not controlled by conservative measures
                  including danzole, prednisone, and alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide or
                  vincristine); and any one of the following: transfusion dependant anemia with
                  untransfused hemoglobin less than 8 grams/dl, or platelets less than 40,000/ul
                  without transfusions,or granulocytes less than 1000/ul.

               4. Catastrophic Anti-phospholipid Syndrome

        4. Ability and willingness to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive status.

          2. History of unstable angina.

          3. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or any other illness that in the opinion of the
             investigators would jeopardize the ability of the patient to tolerate aggressive
             chemoradiotherapy.

          4. Prior history of malignancy except for localized basal cell or squamous skin cancer.
             Other malignancies for which the patient is judged to be cured by local surgical
             therapy, such as head and neck cancer, or stage I breast cancer will be considered on
             an individual basis.

          5. Positive serum pregnancy test, inability or unwillingness to pursue effective means of
             birth control or failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a
             side effect of therapy.

          6. Psychiatric illness or mental deficiency not due to active lupus cerebritis making
             compliance with treatment or informed consent impossible.

          7. FEV1/FVC&lt;50% of predicted, DLCO &lt;50%of predicted.

          8. Resting left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF)&lt;35% or lupus induced myocarditis.

          9. Known hypersensitivity to Escherichia coli.
