  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD) is the most common cause of painful and
      debilitating acquired flatfoot deformity in adults. The dysfunction is often progressive and
      may result in attenuation of the PTT and eventually collapse of the plantar arch or even
      rupture of the tendon. Current therapeutic management of PTTD is multipronged and includes
      management with foot orthoses, stretching, and strengthening exercises. Evidence drawn from
      research related to the management of painful chronic Achilles tendinosis suggests that
      eccentric strengthening of the posterior tibialis may lead to superior results compared to
      concentric. The purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of treatment
      interventions used in the management of PTTD.

      All study participants receive a pair of custom made orthoses and perform daily
      calf-stretches. In addition to the orthoses two groups will perform tibialis posterior
      specific exercises; one as concentric and the second as eccentric activation. Intervention
      will last 12 weeks.
