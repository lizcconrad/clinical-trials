  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of binding between tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and its receptors using Remicade (infliximab, chimeric
      mouse/human IgG1K monoclonal antibody directed against human TNF-alpha, Centocor, Malvern,PA)
      is clinically useful for patients with uveitis that is refractory to other forms of systemic
      immunosuppressive therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The study group will include patients suffering from treatment-resistant
             vision-threatening uveitis who attend the Uveitis Clinic at Casey Eye Institute.

          2. We plan to enroll 32 patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with ocular or systemic infection.

          2. Patients with the subtype of uveitis termed pars planitis who have MRI scan evidence
             of demyelination. There is a theoretical risk of adverse outcome of TNF-alpha
             inhibition on the clinical course of multiple sclerosis. Patients who suffer from pars
             planitis are at increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis.

          3. Children under the age of 9.

          4. Patients with known sensitivity to mouse proteins. Remicade is a chimeric protein with
             human and murine components.

          5. Patients with history of cancer (exception- skin cancers which are curatively
             resected), organ transplantation (exception- cornea), recent drug or alcohol
             addiction, or inability to keep appointments.

          6. Patients with other serious systemic diseases that could interfere with participation
             in the study.

          7. It is specifically noted that pregnant women and nursing mothers will be excluded from
             this study.
