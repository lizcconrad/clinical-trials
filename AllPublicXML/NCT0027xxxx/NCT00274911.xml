  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving radiation therapy followed by combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any
      remaining tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy followed by
      combination chemotherapy works in treating young patients with supratentorial primitive
      neuroectodermal tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity of hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) in pediatric
           patients with nonpineal supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall and relapse-free survival of patients treated with HART followed by
           adjuvant combination chemotherapy comprising lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) twice a
           day, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks.

        -  Adjuvant combination chemotherapy: Six weeks after the last radiotherapy dose, patients
           receive oral lomustine once and cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1 and vincristine IV on
           days 1, 8, and 15 . Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
