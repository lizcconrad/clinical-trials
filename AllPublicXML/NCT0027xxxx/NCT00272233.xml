  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work requirements for medical trainees result in substantial sleep loss. Sleep loss has been
      associated with increased levels of certain inflammatory hormones that could have negative
      impact on blood vessel function. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of
      sleep loss on blood hormone levels and blood vessel function in medical trainees.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context: Sleep loss is associated with increased blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
      C-reactive protein (CRP). Medical residents are often deprived of normal sleep during
      extended work shifts, but the effects of work-related sleep loss on biomarkers of vascular
      inflammation and function are unknown.

      Objective: We sought to test the hypothesis that sleep loss during extended work shifts
      during medical training is associated with increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory
      biomarkers and evidence of vascular dysfunction.

      Design: Outcome measures were assessed after extended 30-hour work shifts and non-extended
      6-hour work shifts in a single-blind, randomized crossover design.

      Setting: University hospital medical intensive care unit

      Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-two healthy medical residents were studied during a
      medical intensive care unit rotation.

      Main Outcome Measure(s): Sleep related cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor),
      serum markers of vascular inflammation (C-reactive protein), and flow-mediated dilation in
      the brachial artery.
