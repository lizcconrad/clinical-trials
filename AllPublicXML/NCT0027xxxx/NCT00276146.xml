  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits as well as side effects of giving
      drugs called dipyridamole and magnesium to patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaso-occlusive episodes are the most common problem experienced by patients with SCA and the
      most frequent reason for hospital admissions as well as visits to the clinic and emergency
      department. Many cellular, humoral, and vascular factors influence the initiation and
      propagation of vaso-occlusion by sickle cells. Among these is the tendency of sickle cells
      (SS RBC) to become dehydrated with accompanying increase in the hemoglobin (Hb)
      concentration. Since sickle hemoglobin (Hb S) concentration controls the rate of
      polymerization, cellular dehydration plays a key role in sickle cell pathology.

      Two separate but interdependent cation transport mechanisms affect sickle cell hydration, the
      first involving abnormal KCl cotransport (KCC), and the second a sickle-induced (SI) passive
      leak which permits the influx of calcium ions (Ca++) that activates the Gardos pathway, a
      Ca++-dependent K channel. Early investigations aimed at inhibiting KCC with magnesium (Mg)
      and the Gardos pathway with clotrimazole met with partial success. We have recently shown in
      vitro that dipyridamole also inhibits the SI pathway. Strategies designed to block the
      formation of these dense, dehydrated cells would offer important therapeutic options that
      might decrease the number and severity of the vaso-occlusive episodes in patients. Drawing on
      the information gained from two decades of research on cation transport in SS RBC, including
      the unique discovery made at this Center that dipyridamole inhibits the SI cation leak, we
      now propose a study of combined therapy using two transport inhibitors aimed at reducing SS
      RBC dehydration.
