  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the protocol is to demonstrate that the new regimen (insulin
      glargine+regular insulin ) is no worse than the reference regimen (insulin glargine+lys-pro
      insulin ) in reducing the incidence of severe nocturnal hypoglycemia at the end point; the
      secondary purpose is to compare the two study regimens as far as the glycemic control
      (measured by HbA1c), the daily Mean Blood Glucose (MBG) and the mean amplitude of glycemic
      excursion (MAGE index), calculated on the basis of Self Monitoring Blood Glugose (SMBG) data,
      are concerned and to verify the safety of basal insulinization with Lantus.

          -  Female subjects must be postmenopausal or under adequate contraception as judged by
             the investigator (it may be oral contraceptives, intra-uterine device or surgical
             treatment) and must have a negative serum pregnancy test

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Diabetes other than type 1 diabetic mellitus

          -  Type 1 diabetic patients with total insulin dose &gt;= 1 IU/kg/day

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl, or history of renal transplantation or current renal
             dialysis

          -  Congestive heart failure NYHA class II

          -  Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis

          -  Clinical evidence of active liver disease, or serum ALT/AST 2 times the upper limit of
             the normal range

          -  Hypoglycemia unawareness

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Concomitant use of Î²-blockers, thiazides or systemic corticosteroids

          -  More than one episode of severe hypoglycemia with seizure or coma during the past year

          -  Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with any anti-diabetic drug
             other than the study drugs

          -  Known adrenal insufficiency (interferes with hypoglycemia counter-regulation)

          -  Known hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia because it may interfere with Hb1Ac

             systemic disease other than type 1 diabetic mellitus making implementation of the
             protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult

          -  History of demonstrable micro- and macro-angiopathic complications

          -  Pre-planned surgery during the study

          -  Blood donation of more than 500 ml during the previous 3 months for males or 6 months
