  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The macula is the site of central vision within the retina. The retina is oxygenated by the
      underlying choroid. These tissues are less than 1 mm thick in total. While optical techniques
      can reveal much about the structure of the retina, ultrasound allows imaging of the choroid
      and deeper tissues. This study will investigate use of high frequency (20 MHz) ultrasound for
      imaging of the retina and choroid in patients with age-related macular degeneration, a prime
      cause of blindness. The investigation will involve use of novel post-processing methodologies
      to achieve maximum resolution of the fine tissue structures involved in this disease.

    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a condition affecting over 40% of individuals 70
      years or age or more, causes progressive loss of central vision. Photocoagulation has long
      been used to slow the progress of AMD, but new vision-preserving methods are currently under
      investigation. Because destroyed photoreceptors are permanently lost, early management is
      essential for preservation of vision. The aim of this project will be to study AMD using a
      suite of new high-resolution ultrasound imaging techniques that have been developed.
      Specifically, high-resolution ultrasound will be used to generate images of the retina and
      choroid, including perfusion measurements using slow-flow methods developed by our research
      group. Ultrasound studies will be performed in conjunction with optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) imaging in a series of patients and age-matched control subjects with the aim of
      determining if choroidal thickness and/or perfusion might be used as an early indicator of
      AMD and thus aid in patient management.

      We will study 20 subjects diagnosed with AMD. We will attempt to have an approximately equal
      number of subjects with wet and dry forms of AMD. A control group consisting of 20 non-AMD
      age-matched subjects will also be recruited. Ultrasound scan sequences will consist of B-mode
      images of the macula and surrounding tissues.
