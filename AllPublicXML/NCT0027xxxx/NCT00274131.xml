    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with pramipexole (BI Sifrol®) were evaluated
      in Parkinson disease patients in an open-label non-controlled design. The treatment was
      initiated at 0.125 mg bid (after breakfast and supper).

      The dose was increased stepwise with due caution regarding the symptoms and safety of each
      patient, up to 1.5 mg tid (after each meal). The treatment period was set at 56 weeks,
      followed by a stepwise dosedecreasing period (maximum 4 weeks).
