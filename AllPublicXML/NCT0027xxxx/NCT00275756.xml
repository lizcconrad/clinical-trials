  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background

      Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in
      perfusion pressure. The existence of an effective autoregulation in the optic nerve
      circulation has been shown in animals and humans. The exact mechanism behind this
      autoregulation is still unknown. The motive for the investigation of optic nerve head (ONH)
      blood flow autoregulation is to enhance the understanding of pathologic eye conditions
      associated with ocular vascular disorders. To clarify the regulatory mechanisms of ONH
      microcirculation is of critical importance to understand the pathophysiology of glaucoma,
      because there is evidence that glaucoma is associated with optic nerve head ischemia. Several
      studies indicate that a disturbed autoregulation might contribute to glaucomatous optic
      neuropathy. Currently, five classes of intraocular pressure (IOP) reducing drugs are
      available for topical therapy in patients with glaucoma or elevated intraocular pressure.
      These drugs have also vasoactive properties, which may influence both the resting ocular
      circulation and the autoregulatory mechanisms of blood flow during changes in ocular
      perfusion pressure.

      Study objective

      To investigate the influence of common topical glaucoma therapy on ONH blood flow regulation
      during changes in IOP and systemic arterial blood pressure.
