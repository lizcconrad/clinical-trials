  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effect on visual acuity of Macugen
      (pegaptanib sodium) in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary
      to the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (OHS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocular histoplasmosis is a leading cause of severe and irreversible central vision loss in
      middle-aged adults living in the central and eastern US. OHS has been associated with the
      fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic soil mold found in 18 to 20 states in the central
      and eastern US. Annually, approximately 100,000 people are thought to be at risk of vision
      loss caused by OHS.

      This study will include OHS patients with CNV lesions no larger than 5400 microns in greatest
      linear diameter with classic or occult CNV extending under the geometric center of the FAZ
      and best-corrected visual acuity letter score between 20/40-20/200. Twenty four patients will
      be enrolled and the study will have 2 treatment arms with 12 patients each. The first arm
      will consist of 12 patients who will receive 0.3 mg of Macugen intravitreally every 6 weeks
      for one year. The second arm will consist of 12 patients who will receive Photodynamic
      Therapy (PDT) with Visudyne every 3 months for one year.

             geometric center of the fovea,

          -  Greatest linear diameter of no greater than 5400 microns,

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity scores between 20/40-20/200,

             streaks associated with CNV in the study eye,

          -  Area of CNV that is less than 50% of the total lesion not including area of prior
             laser treatment, previous rip of retinal pigment epithelium,

          -  Vitelliform-like lesion,

          -  Telangiectasia,

          -  Central serous retinopathy,

          -  Serous pigment epithelial detachment without CNV,

             study eye, such as amblyopia, glaucoma, optic neuropathy, or diabetic retinopathy,

          -  Inability to obtain photographs to document CNV,

          -  Presence of atrophy/scar in the center of fovea,

          -  Presence of vitreo-retinal traction over the center of the fovea,

          -  History of treatment for CNV in the study eye other than non-foveal laser
             photocoagulation,within 12 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Participation in another clinical trial or use of another investigational new drug
             within 12 weeks of the full extent of the study treatment,

          -  Intraocular surgery within the last two months,

          -  Capsulectomy within the last month in the study eye
