  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our broad, long-term objective is to create a new non-resident (non-teaching) hospital
      service that uses patient-centered critical pathway care plans for treating patients in St.
      Marys Hospital. This innovative service, the Hospital Medicine (HOME) Team, will integrate
      three timely, high-priority concepts in healthcare: patient-centered quality care,
      evidence-based medicine, and principles that define high reliability organizations. The
      target populations for the new model of service are patients hospitalized with pre-defined
      admission diagnoses who are expected to require only a brief, focused hospital stay of four
      days or less. Specifically, we will 1) Design the prototypical approach to be used for
      developing all critical pathway care plans by integrating patient-centered quality care,
      evidence-based medicine, and principles that define high reliability organizations, 2)
      Systematically design the critical pathway care plans for two pre-defined admission diagnoses
      (community-acquired pneumonia and non-surgical low-back pain), and 3) Compare outcomes of
      this new service against respective historical patient cohorts for patients admitted with
      community-acquired pneumonia and non-surgical low-back pain. We anticipate that the
      prototypic methodology used to develop this patient-centered service will be replicated for
      other new hospital-service models. To our knowledge, there are currently no existing hospital
      services in the U.S. that have intentionally integrated principles of high reliability
      organizations into evidence-based critical pathways founded on patient-centered principles of
      uncompromising quality.
