      The purpose of this project is to study the pharmacokinetics of a once-daily antiretroviral
      medication used to treat adolescents and young adults with HIV infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once-daily antiretroviral therapy is being used to treat adolescents and young adults with
      HIV-1 infection. When new antiretrovirals (ARVs) are developed, information on kinetics is
      collected in adults, and then in children, but often the adolescent age group is
      under-represented in initial or even later pharmacokinetics studies, so specific data on
      appropriate drug doses to use in adolescents may be lacking; it is assumed that they should
      receive the adult dose. Furthermore, as newer drugs are used in combination regimens, more
      information becomes available on drug interactions that might not have been initially
      anticipated. This information is usually generated in studies of adults, with little or no
      specific information in children or adolescents. This is an open-label, 24-hour, single-dose
      pharmacokinetic study.

        Persons with HIV-1 infection between the ages of 18 years, 0 days and 24 years, 364 days
        currently on a stable combination antiretroviral regimen (&gt; 28 days) with FDA-approved
        antiretroviral combination regimens that include tenofovir plus atazanavir/ritonavir and at
        least one other active antiretroviral drug.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 year to &lt; 25 years.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of HIV-1 infection defined as one positive assay supported by
             documentation from the subject's medical record. The result may be any of the
             following:

          -  HIV-1 DNA PCR,

          -  HIV-1 RNA PCR (&gt; 5,000 copies/ml),

          -  Standard ELISA with confirmatory western blot performed after 18 months of age, or

          -  HIV culture.

          -  CD4 cell count: no restrictions.

          -  Viral load: no restrictions.

          -  Current treatment with stable antiretroviral combination therapy with at least 3
             active drugs for a minimum of 28 days. The treatment regimen will not be started or
             changed for the purposes of participation in this study. Rather, this study will
             measure kinetics of the drugs in patients who have been receiving therapy at the
             direction of their treating physician.

          -  Regimen must be prescribed at FDA-approved doses for age.

          -  Regimens allowed:

          -  Atazanavir 300 mg po once daily plus ritonavir 100 mg po once daily, and

          -  Tenofovir 300 mg po once daily, plus

          -  At least one other antiretroviral medication prescribed at FDA-approved dose for age,
             excluding other protease inhibitors and NNRTIs.

          -  Ability and willingness to be contacted by study personnel daily for the two days
             prior to the pharmacokinetics visit, to take antiretroviral medicines at the same time
             in the morning daily for at least 3 days (one of those days being the day of the PK
             study visit), and ability and willingness to return to the clinic the day after the
             observed administered dose for a follow-up measurement of plasma drug concentration.

          -  Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Active therapy for malignancy.

          -  Known presence of gastrointestinal disease that would interfere with drug
             administration or absorption.

          -  Grade 3 or higher ALT or AST.

          -  Grade 3 or higher Creatinine.

          -  Concurrent treatment with another protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside analogue
             reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

          -  No evidence of anemia greater than Grade 1 according to the ATN Toxicity Table for
             Grading Severity of Adolescent Adverse Experiences (see Chapter 11 of ATN MOGO).
