  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to conduct a unique, community-based intervention consisting of a
      randomized trial of a culturally-appropriate weight loss intervention for overweight Latino
      children in Milwaukee. The intervention promotes lifestyle changes through a low weight loss
      regimen, one or more physical activities ranging from soccer to hip-hop dance, and dietary
      counseling including cooking classes for parents. In addition to weight reduction for
      overweight Latino children, the project has the potential to reduce missed school days and
      improve self-esteem and quality of life.
