    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine whether treating patients with lupus with high dose
      cyclophosphamide together with rATG/rituximab (drugs which reduce the function of the immune
      system), followed by return of their previously collected stem cells will result in
      improvement in the disease. Stem cells are undeveloped cells that have the capacity to grow
      into mature blood cells, which normally circulate in the blood stream. The purpose of the
      intense chemotherapy is to destroy the cells in the immune system which may be causing this
      disease. The purpose of the stem cell infusion is to produce a normal immune system that will
      no longer attack body. The study purpose is to examine whether this treatment will result in
      improvement in the lupus disease.

      Mobilization Participants will be administered Cyclophosphamide at 2.0 g/m2 in 200 ml of
      normal saline (NS) over 1 hour. Hydration with 0.9 NS at approximately 100-250-ml/ hour will
      begin 4 hours prior to cyclophosphamide and continued for 24 hours after termination of
      cyclophosphamide. Urine output approximately greater than 100 ml/hour should be maintained.

      G-CSF will be administered subcutaneously at 5-10 mcg/kg/day and will be started 5 days after
      termination of cyclophosphamide administration.

      After the absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1000/ul or after hematological nadir,
      leukapheresis using a continuous flow blood cell separator will be initiated. A 10-15 liter
      apheresis will be performed unless stopped earlier for clinical judgment of toxicity (e.g.,
      numbness, tetany). The G-CSF will continue until apheresis is discontinued. If necessary,
      platelets will be transfused to greater than 60,000/ul prior to each apheresis.

      Conditioning Regimen Mesna: 50mg/kg/day x 4 days will be given intravenously over 24 hours.

      Cyclophosphamide: 50 mg/kg/day x 4 days (the lesser of ideal or actual weight) will be given
      intravenously over 1 hour in 250 cc of normal saline on days -5 through -2.

      Hydration: approximately 50-200cc/hour in adults should begin 6 hours before cyclophosphamide
      and continue until 24 hours after the last cyclophosphamide dose. Hydration rates need to be
      individually adjusted by daily weights to maintain dry weight count. BID weights will be
      obtained. Warning: Participants with renal insufficiency are prone to volume overload. Early
      institution of ultrafiltration or dialysis is recommended.

      Rabbit ATG 0.5mg/kg will be given IV on day -5, 1.0mg/kg will be given on day

      -4, 1.5mg/kg will be given IV on days -3, -2, -1 (no dose adjustment). It will be given over
      10 hours. Premedicate with Solumedrol 250mg IV, acetaminophen 650mg po qd and diphenhydramine
      25mg 30 minutes before infusion.

      Rituximab 500mg/day will be given IV on days -6 and +1. At the first dose (D-6), rituximab
      infusion will be started at 50mg/h and escalate the infusion rate by 50mg every 30minutes to
      a maximum of 400mg/h. Starting the second dose (days -4, -2 and +1). IV infusion will be
      started at 100mg/h and escalate the infusion rate 100mg every 30minutes to a maximum of
      400mg/h. Premedicate with Solumedrol 250mg IV, acetaminophen 650mg po qd and diphenhydramine
      25mg 30 minutes before infusion on days -6 and +1. Premedicate acetaminophen 650mg po qd and
      diphenhydramine 25mg 30 minutes before infusion on days -4 and -2.

      Stem Cell Reinfusion Previously collected stem cells will be reinfused on day 0 as noted in
      Table 4. The stem cells are infused over approximately 20 minutes through the central venous
      catheter (e.g., PICC line). Following stem cell reinfusion, routine daily labs will be
      obtained including CBC, chemistry panel, and liver function tests. Antibiotics and blood
      transfusions will be administered as required by clinical judgment.

                  cardiovascular/respiratory category A, vasculitis category A, or neurologic
                  category A and must fail at least 3 months of oral or IV cyclophosphamide and be
                  corticosteroid dependent. Steroid dependence being defined as at least 3 months
                  of steroid therapy and inability to wean corticosteroid to less than 20 mg/day of
                  prednisone or equivalent.

               3. For cytopenias that are immune mediated, participants must be BILAG hematologic
                  category A. Participants must fail corticosteroids (either oral prednisone &gt; 0.5
                  mg/kg/day for more than 6 months or pulse methylprednisolone for at least one
                  cycle of three days), and at least one of the following: azathioprine at 2

                  months, or splenectomy.

               4. For mucocutaneous disease, participants must meet BILAG mucocutaneous category A,
                  be unable to be weaned from prednisone to less than 0.5 mg/kg/day for more than 6
                  months and obvious cushingoid habitus, and have received at least one of the
                  following: azathioprine at 2 mg/kg/day for at least 3 months, methotrexate at
                  15mg/week for at least 3 months, cyclophosphamide intravenously or orally for at
                  least 3 months, or cyclosporine at least 3 mg/kg/day for at least 3 months.

               5. For arthritis/myositis, participants must meet BILAG musculoskeletal category A,
                  be unable to be weaned from prednisone to less than 0.5 mg/kg/day for more than 6
                  months and obvious cushingoid habitus, and have received at least one of the
                  following: azathioprine at 2 mg/kg/day for at least 3 months, methotrexate at
                  15mg/ week for at least 3 months, cyclophosphamide intravenously or orally for at
                  least 3 months, or cyclosporine at least 3 mg/kg/day for at least 3 months.

          -  Able to give informed consent.

          -  If indication for HSCT is nephritis, a renal biopsy must demonstrate the potential of
             a reversible (non-fibrotic) component indicating that if successful the participant
             would not be likely to be permanently dialysis-dependent after transplant.

          -  Since the BILAG is only one of multiple indices for SLE, patients may also be
             candidates if despite prior immune suppression therapy as described above, patients
             are still on active immune suppression (more than 10mg a day of prednisone).

          -  Patients with SLE whose major manifestation is Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) may be
             candidates without prior immune suppression therapy if they have had a visceral organ
             thrombotic or embolic event despite anticoagulation.

          -  Patients with SLE whose major manifestation is Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) may be
             candidates without prior immune suppression therapy if they have had a visceral organ
             thrombotic or embolic event despite anticoagulation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV positive

          -  Ongoing malignancy except localized basal cell or squamous skin cancer. Other
             malignancies for which the participant is judged to be cured by local surgical
             therapy, such as head and neck cancer, or stage I or II breast cancer will be
             considered on an individual basis by the investigators doing the final screening for
             participant qualification.

          -  Positive pregnancy test, inability or unwillingness to pursue effective means of birth
             control, failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a side
             effect of therapy.

          -  Psychiatric illness or mental deficiency making compliance with treatment or informed
             consent impossible.

          -  DLCO &lt; 45% of predicted unless attributed to active lupus.

          -  Resting LVEF &lt; 40% unless attributed to active lupus.
