  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for individuals electing to have GreenLight Photoselective Vaporization of the
      Prostate (PVP) to treat symptoms from an enlarged prostate gland. The purpose of this
      research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medication dutasteride as
      compared to placebo (an inactive substance) for improving surgical and long-term outcomes of
      PVP. Dutasteride is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of symptoms from an enlarged prostate gland. The use of dutasteride to improve the
      outcomes of PVP is investigational. The study will last for approximately 15 months and will
      involve 6 visits.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the effects of dutasteride on the outcomes and QoL of
      patients undergoing GreenLight Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate. PVP is a growing,
      outpatient surgical treatment for BPH. The addition of dutasteride may potentially improve
      both the short and long term outcomes. Use peri-operatively may improve visibility during
      surgery, shorten operative time, lessen bleeding both intra and post-operatively and hasten
      post-op recovery. Continued use long-term (12 months following the procedure) may improve
      overall symptomatic scores as combination therapy with PVP. The addition of dutasteride to
      PVP may decrease the occasional occurrence of continued post-op irritative symptoms and
      lessen the likelihood of the need for re-catheterization with overall improvement in quality
      of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Men aged ≥ 50 years old 2. Subjects with LUTS due to BPH with:

          1. AUA SI score ≥ 12 at baseline

          2. Qmax ≤ 15 mL/sec (on at least 125 mL)

          3. Symptoms for ≥ 3 months 3. Subjects with prostate volume ≥ 30 grams 4. Subjects who
             are appropriate surgical candidates for Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate
             (PVP) as determined by a study investigator 5. Subjects able to swallow and retain
             oral medication 6. Subjects able to comply with study protocol 7. Subjects able to
             read and write (to complete the self-administered AUA SI) 8. Subjects who sign the
             approved Informed Consent Form for the study

             Exclusion Criteria:

               1. Subjects who have previously undergone a surgical treatment for BPH including but
                  not limited to TURP, TUNA, TUIP, thermotherapy, prostatic stent, dilation
                  balloon, etc.

               2. Subjects with a history of prostate cancer

               3. Subjects with a history of bladder or testicular cancer in the past 5 years

                   Subjects who have been cancer-free for at least 5 years will be eligible

               4. Subjects who have received radiation to the pelvis or prostate or radical surgery
                  to the pelvic area
