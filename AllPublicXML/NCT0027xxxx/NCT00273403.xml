  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This outcome evaluation effort provides the opportunity to learn what programmatic approaches
      effectively address two of the most difficult hurdles in HIV health services delivery: (1)
      getting people who would benefit from health care to use it and (2) getting people who do use
      health care to do so more consistently and effectively. The New York HIV Planning Council
      (through MHRA) has funded 23 agencies to achieve these objectives for people of color with
      HIV disease.

      All clients are assessed upon entry into the program, have their service utilization tracked,
      and then are reassessed at three, six, and twelve months following program entry.

      The main client-level data elements collected during baseline and follow-up interviews are
      the following:

        -  Biological markers (including HIV status, viral load, t-cell count)

        -  Demographic characteristics

        -  Adherence to treatment

        -  Barriers to care

        -  Social support

        -  Substance use and treatment

        -  Functional health status

      Functional Health Status is used in this evaluation as the primary measure of final client
      “outcomes.” The Functional Health Status items we use are from the ACTG SF-21 (a modified
      version of the Medical Outcomes Study instrument).

      The overall evaluation objectives are to:

        -  Describe the change in functional health status for different populations and groups of
           clients.

        -  Identify services or constellations of services and intensity of services associated
           with change in functional health status.

        -  Assess whether programs meet intermediate objectives (decreased drug use, increased
           service use, improved housing stability).

        -  Identify barriers to access to and maintenance in care.
