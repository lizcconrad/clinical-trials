      Transbronchial cryobiopsy carries a higher chance of establishing pathological diagnosis in
      diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) than traditional transbronchial forceps guided
      biopsy. It is a novel technique capable of obtaining large, high-quality samples of lung
      tissue in a minimally invasive manner. This procedure may decrease the need for surgical lung
      biopsy in 75% of cases. However, there is an increased risk of pneumothorax and airway
      bleeding compared to traditional transbronchial forceps guided biopsy.

      Several strategies are used by practitioners of this technique to mitigate the risks of
      significant bleeding and pneumothorax. These include prophylactic placement of an
      endobronchial blocker, the use of fluoroscopy guidance, instillation of cold saline to
      promote vasoconstriction, and establishment of a secure airway with endotracheal tube
      placement or rigid bronchoscopy

      . Vanderbilt University Medical Center is one of the most active centers in terms of
      cryobiopsies performed as part of the diagnostic workup of DPLD. Currently all transbronchial
      cryobiopsies here are performed under fluoroscopic guidance, with endotracheal tube
      intubation and endobronchial blocker placement. Despite these precautions, post biopsy
      bleeding complications occur and can substantially lengthen the duration of the procedure and
      occasionally expose patients to procedural complications.

      Radial ultrasound has been well utilized to define anatomy of peripheral lung and
      localization of peripheral pulmonary nodules. We postulate that using radial ultrasound to
      identify peribronchial lung parenchyma with low vascularity will mitigate the risk of
      hemorrhage during peripheral lung cryobiopsy in patients with DPLD and hence improve patient
      safety.

    <textblock>
      Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases comprise a group of noninfectious, non-neoplastic lung
      diseases, each characterized by varying degrees of inflammation or fibrosis of the parenchyma
      of both lungs. The differentiation of these disorders may require biopsy material,
      particularly in patients with atypical clinical or radiological presentations. Cryobiopsies
      offer specialists the advantage of being able to collect much larger specimens than can be
      collected with forceps biopsy, while preserving the underlying lung architecture (no crush
      artifact). The biggest disadvantage of cryobiopsy is a higher risk of procedural bleeding
      and, to a lesser extent, pneumothorax than conventional transbronchial lung biopsies.

      Existing cryobiopsy literature is significantly limited by lack of procedure standardization,
      variable diagnostic endpoints and non-uniform grading of complications. Surgical lung biopsy,
      currently the gold standard for histological diagnosis of DPLD, is associated with
      significant morbidity and mortality. The rate of in-hospital mortality following SLB for DPLD
      was recently found to be 1.7% in a large dataset, with a complication rate of 30% (including
      post-operative pneumothorax, pneumonia, respiratory failure). Mortality was slightly lower at
      1.5% for elective operations but markedly higher at 16% for operations labeled
      &quot;non-elective,&quot; presumably performed in the setting of acute disease exacerbations. Clearly,
      less invasive strategies, such as cryobiopsy, are urgently needed.

      Recent studies demonstrate that there might be a trend toward more bleeding complications
      with transbronchial cryobiopsies. The increased risk of bleeding is due to the larger
      biopsies thus obtained, and the necessity to retrieve bronchoscope and cryoprobe en-bloc as
      biopsies are too large to be pulled through he working channel of the bronchoscope,
      preventing the proceduralist from keeping he bronchoscope wedged in the biopsied segment
      allowing bleeding tamponade. Accordingly, most proceduralists perform cryobiopsy with
      prophylactic placement of bronchial blocker positioned proximal to the selected lobe to
      occlude the segmental airway after biopsy. While this technique has essentially eliminated
      the risk of life-threatening bleeding after cryobiopsies, significant bleeding complications
      persist and can occasionally substantially lengthen the duration of the procedure, leading to
      premature termination and potentially quantitatively inadequate biopsy acquisition.

      Conceptually it seems that the ability to select a less vascular area for a somewhat larger
      cryobiopsy may result in decreased risk of hemorrhage and/or reduction in bleeding severity.
      Average peripheral cryobiopsy size varies significantly and may be dependent on freezing time
      and cryoprobe size. Increase in resource utilization due to the use of radial ultrasound
      could be offset by a decrease in complication rate, decreased procedural time and potentially
      decreased endobronchial blocker need. This use of radial probe ultrasound use has not been
      widely reported in literature except for a recent single center retrospective review of 10
      patients undergoing transbronchial cryobiopsies for ILD(Berim, 2017). Six of these patients
      underwent vascular localization with radial probe endobronchial localization with trends
      towards less bleeding.

      The purported benefit of radial ultrasound-guided transbronchial cryobiopsy is the avoidance
      of excessive bleeding, which has been associated with this procedure. With the systematic use
      of a prophylactic bronchial blocker, an ideal endpoint for this pilot study would be the time
      spent obtaining each biopsy. We propose to study in a prospective, double-blind, randomized
      controlled fashion, the efficacy of radial endobronchial ultrasound (in combination with
      fluoroscopy) guided transbronchial cryobiopsy as compared to conventional fluoroscopy guided
      cryobiopsy in reducing time needed to achieve hemostasis (primary endpoint) and need for
      additional modalities to control bleeding and size of biopsies obtained (secondary
      endpoints).

    <masking_description>Primary bronchoscopist will perform localization of biopsy spot, after biopsy is determined to be in the control or intervention group. He/she will then perform the cryobiopsy per protocol. A bedside assistant will assist in managing the endobronchial blocker at all times. Secondary bronchoscopist will be stationed outside the operating room during initial part of the procedure. He will be prompted to enter the room by research coordinator to take control of the bronchoscope and assess post cryobiopsy bleeding. He will hence be blinded to the use or non-use of radial probe ultrasound. Research coordinator will be present at all times and will coordinate the switching process between proceduralists. Reference image of the radial USG determining the biopsy location on fluoroscopy monitor will be erased before secondary bronchoscopist enters the room. Patient will be blinded as he/she will be sedated. Four biopsies will be planned per procedure, two each from control &amp; intervention arm.</masking_description>
