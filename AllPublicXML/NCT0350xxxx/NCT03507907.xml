      When the literature is examined, there is study investigating the effect of mulligan
      mobilization technique on older adults with neck pain. This study aims to investigate the
      effect of mulligan mobilization technique on pain, range of motion, functional level,
      kinesiophobia, fear of movement, depression and quality of life in older adults with neck
      pain.

    <textblock>
      Neck pain is common in older adults. There are a lot of approaches for treatment of neck pain
      such as soft tıssue mobilizations, electirical stimulations etc. Mulligan proposes
      mobilization with movement (MWM) technique for various musculoskeletal disorders. But there
      is no study related MWM for older adults with neck pain. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the effect of mulligan mobilization technique on pain, range of motion (ROM),
      functional level, kinesiophobia, depression and quality of life (QoL) in older adults with
      neck pain. The hypothesis of our study is MWM can be effective on ROM, kinesiophobia,
      depression and QoL in older adults with neck pain.

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of pain at rest and during activity was assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Participants were questioned about their average pain over the last 4 weeks. They were asked to mark the severity of their pain on a 10-cm-long line where 0 represented no pain, and 10 stood for vicious pain</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was used to evaluate how the participants' daily life was influenced by their neck pain. Total score of the scale ranges from 0 to 35 and higher scores indicate higher levels of disability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was used to assess the patients' fear of pain or re-injury due to movement. It consists of 17 items and assesses various factors of fear/avoidance and injury/re-injury in several activities. Total score of the scale varies between 17 and 68 and higher scores represent higher levels of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Universal goniometer</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>A universal goniometer was used to assess the range of motion (ROM) of the cervical vertebrae. Cervical flexion, extension, right and left lateral flexion and right and left rotation movements were measured 3 times in active manner while the patients were in a comfortable sitting position. The average value of the measurements was recorded as ROM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' level of depression was assessed using this scale that consists of 21 categories with 4 options in each. Each item has a score between 0 and 3 and total score varies from 0 to 63. Score ranges are interpreted as: 0-9 points = Minor depression, 10-16 points = Mild depression, 17-29 points = Moderate depression, and 30-63 points = Severe depression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>This form was used to assess the quality of life (QoL) of the participants. This questionnaire is consisted of 36 questions that are categorized into 8 groups as following: physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, bodily pain, energy, social role functioning, mental health, and general health perception. Each category is scored on a 0-100 range, and higher scores indicate better QoL</description>
