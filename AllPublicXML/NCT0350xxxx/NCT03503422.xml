  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back (CLBP) pain is an important public health and socioeconomic problem
      worldwide and, despite the volume of research in the area, it remains a difficult condition
      to treat. The Neuromatrix pain model and new findings on the pain chronification process
      point to a greater efficacy of treatments that address central and peripheral rather than
      only peripheral structures.

      Transcranial direct current (tDCS) stimulation is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique
      that has been presenting recent advances in the treatment of chronic pain. However, when
      applied alone the magnitude of its effect is small in chronic musculoskeletal conditions such
      as chronic non-specific back pain. One option that could optimize the analgesic effect of
      tDCS would be the combination with therapeutic exercises, which play a central role in spinal
      rehabilitation programs as well as higher levels of evidence. The combination of these
      treatments (tDCS and exercise) may present an analgesic effect superior to the isolated
      interventions.

      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of tDCS combined with therapeutic exercises in
      people CLBP for pain relief, affective aspect of pain, disability, kinesiophobia and global
      perception. Sixty patients will be randomized into two distinct groups to receive either tDCS
      (anodal) + therapeutic exercises or tDCS (sham) + therapeutic exercises for 12 sessions over
      a four-week period. The primary clinical outcome (pain relief) and secondary outcomes
      (disability, affective aspect of pain, kinesiophobia, and perception of overall effect) will
      be collected before treatment and four weeks, three months and six months post randomization.
      The data will be collected by a blind examiner to the treatment allocation.

    <description>Global perceived effect is an 11 point scale that ranges from 5 (vastly worse) through 0 (no change) to 5 (completely recovered). For all measures of global perceived effect (at baseline and all follow-ups), participants were asked compared to when this episode ﬁrst started, how would you describe your back these days. A higher score indicates higher recovery from the condition.</description>
