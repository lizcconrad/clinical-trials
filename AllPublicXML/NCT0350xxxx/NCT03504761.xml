      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of the ClariCore
      System in obtaining prostate biopsies with device feedback that provides real-time tissue
      classification.

      The purpose of this study is to collect information on prostate biopsies using the ClariCore
      System. The ClariCore System is designed to improve how the biopsies are being collected from
      the prostate by using light sensors (fiber optics) that can see changes in the prostate
      tissue. Researchers will study the information collected from the light sensors to study a
      method that has been developed to tell the difference between normal and suspicious (possibly
      cancerous) prostate tissue during the biopsy. This information will be given to the doctor in
      real-time. From this study, researchers hope to learn if this method can tell the difference
      between normal and suspicious prostate tissue, and if this can improve the evaluation of
      prostate tissue (biopsies).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males &gt; 22 years old

          -  Patient scheduled for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy based on standard of care urologic
             requirements to assess for tissue malignancy (abnormal Digital Rectum Examination,
             Prostate Specific Antigen kinetics, age, ethnicity, family history, etc.)

          -  Enrolling physician must have expectation that prostate dimensions will meet minimum
             prostate volume and height requirements that will be evaluated at start of biopsy
             procedure (i.e., Prostate volume &gt; 20cc and height at least 22mm)

          -  Patient signs an Institutional Review Board approved, Informed Consent form to
             participate in the study prior to any study mandated determinations or procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any anatomical or co-morbidity contraindications to TRUS prostate biopsy

          -  Acute painful perianal disorder (i.e. rectal abscess)

             monopolar, laser)], Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy (TUMT), High-Intensity
             Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), Cryo, Rezum, Urolift], not including previous prostate
             biopsy

          -  Current use of blood thinning agents for medical comorbidity which prohibits the
             cessation of use as typically required per standard of care (SOC) or history of a
             bleeding disorder (e.g. coagulopathy)

             cancer
