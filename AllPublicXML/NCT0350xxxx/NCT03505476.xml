  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research proposed in this study will develop a noninvasive prototype device that will
      capture intestinal sounds, process signals, and display predictive information in real-time
      at the point-of-care using algorithms already developed at this institution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following major abdominal surgery, up to 30% of patients develop a poorly understood
      condition known as ileus. When ileus occurs, the bowels shut down and patients often develop
      abdominal dissension, nausea, vomiting, and even more serious complications. Because this
      condition does not develop until many days after surgery has been completed, clinicians do
      not know if they should begin allowing patients to eat or withhold nutrition until they show
      signs of bowel function such as passing gas or having bowel movements. Clinicians have
      different approaches but none are ideal: 1) feed all patients early and the ones that develop
      an ileus will have their diets reverse, suction tube placed in their stomach, and hopefully
      don't get develop more serious complications, or 2) don't feed patients until they pass gas
      or have a bowel movement, which delays nutrition and prolongs hospital stays for the 70% of
      patients who will not develop an ileus

      Participants in this study will be asked to wear a 3-ounce device that adheres to the skin of
      the abdominal wall for 10 days. They will also be asked to answer questions each day of their
      hospital stay regarding how they have tolerated eating.

    <description>The signal processing algorithm will be modified iteratively to maximize the negative predictive value of the device while maintaining the highest PPV The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, AUC, and accuracy of the device for each 10-30 patients (dependent upon the incidence of GI impairment in each group) will be measured. The signal processing algorithm will be modified iteratively to maximize the negative predictive value of the device while maintaining the highest PPV possible. Our goal is for the AUC for the final algorithm to be greater than 0.8.</description>

    <description>Subjects will wear a 3-inch by 3-inch stethoscope device that adheres to the skin of the abdomen via FDA approved adhesive material. It will be applied either in the operating room at the completion of surgery or in the recovery room. The device will remain on the abdomen until discharge or for 10 days, whichever comes first.</description>
