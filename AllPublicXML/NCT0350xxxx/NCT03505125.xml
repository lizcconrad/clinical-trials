  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 165-901 study is designed to identify the appropriate tools for use in future
      interventional studies on the neurocognitive effects of pegvaliase on adults with PKU.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies have suggested that treatment with pegvaliase results in lowering of blood
      Phenylalanine levels in adults with Phenylketonuria (PKU). Because these individuals often
      exhibit inattention and mood difficulties, and blood Phe concentration affects cognition and
      mood, life-long blood Phe control with pegvaliase may improve cognitive abilities and
      emotional and mental health in patients with PKU. In order to adequately quantify potential
      pegvaliase treatment impact on cognition and mood, it is necessary to employ clinical outcome
      assessments (COAs) that are fit for purpose and that comprehensively address concepts
      important, relevant, and meaningful to PKU patients. This is an observational study to
      identify symptom, function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) concepts of interest
      (COIs) to patients with PKU and to seek additional patient, observer, and expert input on the
      appropriateness of concepts of BioMarin's proposed COAs for use in future efficacy trials in
      PKU.

          2. Clinically-confirmed diagnosis of Phenylketonuria (PKU);

          3. Blood Phe test completed within eight weeks prior to screening date or blood Phe test
             completed within eight weeks post screening date;

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria will not be included in the study:

          1. Currently pregnant;

          2. Current or previous exposure to pegvaliase treatment or participation in a pegvaliase
             clinical trial;
