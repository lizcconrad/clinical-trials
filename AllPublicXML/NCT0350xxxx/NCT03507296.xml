      This study will test the within and between day variability of spinal kinematics and trunk
      muscle activity in healthy subjects and chronic low back pain patients during various
      daily-life activities. Participants will come twice to the motion laboratory. During the
      first session, participants will first perform different functional activities (V1), such as
      sit-to-stand, gait, lifting tasks, stepping up. Their spinal kinematics will be measured with
      a camera-based system (VICON) using a multi-segment spinal model and trunk muscles activity
      will be recorded with surface electromyography. After a break, participants will have to
      perform all the functional activities a second time (V2). These two measures (V1 and V2) will
      be used to determine the within day variability of spinal kinematics. Finally, all
      participants will come one week later (V3) to repeat all the measurements to determine the
      between day variability.
