      The objective of the Clinical Experience Investigation (CEI) is to collect following data to
      characterise safety and efficacy of LYMPARZA Tablets 100mg and 150mg (LYMPARZA) in usual
      post-marketing use.

        1. Development of adverse drug reactions (ADRs)

        2. Factors which may affect safety and efficacy of LYMPARZA

        3. Development of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) unexpected from &quot;Precautions for Use&quot; of
           the LYMPARZA JPI
