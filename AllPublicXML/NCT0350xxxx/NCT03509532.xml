      Study Title A post market registry of Abluminus® sirolimus eluting coronary stent system for
      percutaneous intervention in patients with diabetes mellitus Purpose The purpose of this
      registry is to prospectively capture clinical data of ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent in
      patients with Diabetes Mellitus.

      Investigational Device ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent consists of four components; a bare
      metal stent (BMS), a delivery system, the bio absorbable polymer delivery matrix and
      Abluminal surface coating on stent and parts of balloon in Pre-crimped condition the
      anti-proliferative drug, Sirolimus.

        1. BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION

           Era of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) started with plain old balloon
           angioplasty (POBA) and progressed to bare metal stent (BMS) and then to drug-eluting
           stent (DES). In DES, polymer was used in addition to the drug, so that it could hold the
           drug on the stent platform and could facilitate controlled drug release. Thus, drug and
           polymer became hallmark of DES [1].

           Current DES consist of a metal stent platform and a therapeutic agent, which is either
           directly immobilized on the stent surface or released from a polymer matrix. While
           drug-eluting stents without surface polymer are available, the reduction in angiographic
           and clinical restenosis is less potent and appears therefore less promising for clinical
           utilization. In contrast, polymer-based, drug-eluting stents allow for controlled
           release of therapeutic agents at the site of injury [2].

           The most effective drugs utilized with drug-eluting stents for prevention of restenosis
           up to this point in time have been Sirolimus and Paclitaxel. Both drugs are highly
           lipophilic and show rapid and strong uptake in arterial wall tissue. In addition,
           Sirolimus and paclitaxel have been shown to reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and
           neo-intimal hyperplasia, the principal cause of restenosis after coronary stenting in
           experimental models. Sirolimus and Paclitaxel have the same effect on cells
           proliferation, but with a different mode of action.A recent meta-analysis of
           drug-eluting stent trials confirmed the reduction in restenosis and repeat
           revascularization procedures for polymer-based, drug-eluting stents. Moreover, the rates
           of death and myocardial infarction were comparable to those with bare-metal stents,
           attesting to the safety of these devices, which have been approved by the US Food and
           Drug Administration.

           Patients with diabetes mellitus referred for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
           represent one of the greatest challenges for the interventional cardiologist. Restenosis
           continues to be the major limitation of PCI, particularly in patients with diabetes [2].
           Restenosis rates after balloon angioplasty in diabetic patients can be very high (up to
           63%), and although stenting has been shown to decrease these rates, diabetic patients
           continue to have significantly higher restenosis rates and clinical events following
           PCI. Slight elevations in fasting blood glucose levels, the need for insulin, and
           suboptimal blood glucose control may have a significant impact on the prognosis.
           Drug-eluting stents (DES) have been shown to have a considerably lower risk of
           restenosis and as a result, there is growing interest in using such stents to treat
           coronary lesions in complex scenarios. Sub studies carried out in diabetic patients from
           large clinical trials conducted with DES have found considerable decreases in the risk
           of restenosis and new revascularizations. [3,4] Nevertheless, despite the availability
           use of DES, diabetic patients show a higher risk than non-diabetics.Hyperinsulinemia and
           insulin resistance are implicated in a variety of molecular mechanisms that could
           predispose diabetics to a higher incidence of restenosis.

           The purpose of this registry is to capture clinical data of ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting
           stent in in real world, all come patients with Diabetes Mellitus.

           1.1 Device Description

           The device ABLUMINUS® Sirolimus eluting coronary stent integrates well known and
           accepted Sirolimus drug on the proven CYGNUS Cobalt chromium platform with biodegradable
           polymer matrix.

           The device ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system has a combination of inactive and
           active component. The active component is Sirolimus drug. The inactive component is PLLA
           polymer (biodegradable polymer). The polymer-drug combination is applied solely to a
           unique abluminal coating technology known as &quot;ënvisõlution™ Technology&quot; which is a
           highly effective drug delivery technology with target specific coating in abluminal
           configuration on stent and parts of balloon. It also uses biodegradable polymer to
           achieve longer drug release.

           The stent platform is a thin strut (73 microns) of L605cobalt chromium stent with open
           and closed cell (hybrid) design, which provides good radial strength and side branch
           accessibility. The thin struts enhance the trackability and gives lower crossing profile
           to the device for navigating through difficult and tortuous lesions. The delivery system
           is a Rapid exchange (Rx) System.

           It is expected that ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system will significantly reduce
           delay in healing and thrombosis events, while providing comparable results, regarding
           restenosis, to other DES systems on the market.

           1.2 Therapeutic Agent-Sirolimus Drug

           Sirolimus is a cytostatic drug used for treatment of various disease in Humans. The drug
           works on FKBP-12 protein and inhibits growth factor-simulated cell proliferation.
           Sirolimus forms a complex with FKBP Protein that inhibits the cell cycle between G0 and
           G1 phase. This results in interruption of the cascade governing cell growth, metabolism
           and proliferation.

           1.3 STENT PLATFORM ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system is a combination product
           comprised of two key components: the Stent (which includes the active pharmaceutical
           ingredient (API) Sirolimus drug incorporated into a bio-degradable polymer coating), and
           delivery catheter. A balloon expandable L605 chromium cobalt stent with bio-degradable
           polymer coating containing Sirolimus drug is pre-mounted onto a highly deliverable
           semi-compliant rapid exchange delivery system. The delivery catheter has two radiopaque
           markers, which mark the ends of the stent to facilitate proper positioning and
           placement. The catheter has hydrophilic coating facilitating easy delivery of the
           system.

           The Stent has a biodegradable polymer matrix consisting of Poly L Lactic acid (PLLA)
           which has been wide spread application in medical devices. The Poly lactic acid, its
           co-polymers and mixtures have been evaluated in pre-clinical studies and clinical
           studies around the world, revealing favourable bio-compatibility profile. The
           bio-degradable polymer has been demonstrated to be safe when used as an implant or drug
           release-control polymer for both animal and humans.

        2. RISK ANALYSIS

           investigators in this registry. All clinicians will have experience with the treatment
           and control procedures and have been trained on the use / implantation of a Drug Eluting
           stent system.

        3. AIM OF THE REGISTRY

           The purpose of this registry is to capture clinical data of ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting
           stent in real world, all comer patients with Diabetes Mellitus.

        4. REGISTRY DESIGN

           Prospective, Observational, Multi‐center clinical registry to be conducted in Italy at
           15 Interventional cardiology centers. 1000 patients will be enrolled and evaluated. All
           the patients will be followed up for up to 5 years.

           4.1 Treatment Strategy

           The investigator will determine the treatment strategy. It is recommended that each
           enrolling investigator review the most recent IFU to assess contraindications, warnings,
           and precautions for treating potential patients.

        5. ENDPOINT

           5.1 Primary endpoints

           Target Lesion Failure, which is composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial
           infarction, and clinically indicated target lesion revascularisation within 12 months.

           Components of the primary end point are defined as follows:

             -  Cardiac Death: any death due to immediate cardiac cause, deaths related to the
                procedure, unwitnessed death, and death of unknown cause.

             -  Target Vessel Myocardial infarction: categorized according to the Minnesota
                electrocardiographic criteria (Q-wave and non-Q-wave). Spontaneous myocardial
                infarction was defined as a typical rise and fall of creatinine kinase-MB fraction
                or troponin in the presence of at least one of several conditions: ischemic
                symptoms, new pathological Q waves, ischemic electrocardiographic changes, or
                pathological evidence of acute myocardial infarction. Peri-procedural myocardial
                infarction was defined as an increase in creatinine kinase to more than twice the
                normal value with increased values of confirmatory biomarkers (creatinine kinase-MB
                fraction or troponin higher than usual). Target-vessel-related myocardial
                infarction was one related to the target vessel or that could not be clearly
                related to another vessel.

             -  Clinically indicated target lesion revascularisation: any repeat percutaneous or
                surgical intervention due to a stenosis or occlusion within the device of the index
                procedure 5.2 Secondary endpoints

             -  Stent thrombosis [Time Frame: 1 month, 12 months, yearly]: Definite and probable
                stent thrombosis according to ARC definitions.

             -  Cardiac death [Time Frame: 1 month, 12 months, yearly]

             -  Target Vessel Myocardial infarction [Time Frame: 1 month, 12 months, yearly]

             -  Target Lesion Revascularisation [Time Frame: 1 month, 12 months, yearly]

             -  Device Success at 24 hours

             -  Lesion Success at 24 hours

             -  Procedural Success at 24 hours

        6. REGISTRY POPULATION

      6.1 Number of patients 1000 patients will be enrolled at 15 interventional cardiology sites
      in Italy. Duration of enrollment will be 12 months.

      6.2 Type of Patient Patients eligible for PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) with

                study, which have not completed the primary endpoint follow-up period.

             6. Previous coronary intervention on target vessel;

             7. Non-cardiac co-morbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that
                may result in protocol non-compliance (per site investigator's medical judgment);

             8. Lesions not allowing a complete balloon inflation or stent deployment.

           7. REGISTRY PROCEDURES

           7.1 Patient Information

           Eligible patients will be informed about the registry and have to sign informed consent
           before or after the procedure (see Appendix I: informed consent form).

           7.2 Baseline Evaluation

           At inclusion into registry, the following routine examination, if performed, will be
           captured:

             1. Physical examination and relevant medical history;

             2. Angina status;

             3. Routine laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry,
                blood sugar and lipids, CK and/or CK-MB prior to the procedure. In case of acute
                myocardial infarction or infarct extension we suggest CK and/or CK-MB immediately
                prior to the procedure and serial measurements every 8 hours after the procedure
                until the peak CK level has been defined

             4. 12-lead electrocardiogram before the procedure.

           7.3 Stent Implantation

           During the index procedure, only ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system will be
           implanted. Using the instruction for use (IFU), provided with the device, the
           investigator will choose the appropriate length and diameter of the stents to be
           implanted by visual estimation.

           The choice of the length of the stent should ensure complete coverage of the lesion. If
           more than one stent is implanted, at least 2 mm overlap should be achieved. In case of
           insufficient stent expansion, the stent will be post-dilated with an appropriately sized
           balloon.

           Treatment of multiple target vessels (within the same procedure) and staged procedures
           which occur within 90 days of the initial implant procedure are allowed. ABLUMINUS®
           sirolimus eluting stent system implanted in non-target vessels after &gt; 90 days after the
           initial implant procedure will not be followed under the ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting
           stent system registry protocol.

           As such, any subsequent treatment of the lesion already present at the time of baseline
           procedure will be considered as a staged procedure, instead of a repeat PCI. In the CRF
           (Case Report Form), the investigator will complete a 'staged procedure' module
           indicating that this lesion was present at the time of first procedure. The lesions
           diagnosed and treated at the later stages will not be considered as &quot;repeat&quot;
           revascularization.

           For each individual lesion treated, a separate lesion form in the CRF needs to be
           completed. Every vessel in which anABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system is
           implanted (or in which an attempt to implant anABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system
           is made) within 90 days of the initial implant procedure is considered a target vessel.

           For patient undergoing a staged procedure, the follow up schedule will be calculated
           from the date of initial ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system implant procedure.

           8. ANTITHROMBOTIC TREATMENT

           Pre- procedure*: Aspirin 75mg minimum;

           Patients without any therapy: clopidogrel bisulphate: loading dose of 300-600mg per os
           before or during the procedure;

           Patient on clopidogrel therapy (within 7 days prior) no loading dose required.

           Ticagrelor or Prasugrel in the case of Acute Coronary Syndromes

           During Procedure*: At least 5000IE or 70-100IE/Kg unfractioned heparin to maintain an
           ACT &gt; 250 seconds during the procedure.**

           Post-procedure*: DAPT Therapy for at least 6 months (IFU), or longer according to
           current Guidelines Aspirin 75mg per os life long.

           *Or according to standard clinical practice. / **The use of GP IIB/ IIIA inhibitors is
           left to the discretion of the operator.

           9. FOLLOW-UP PERIOD

           Patients will be followed after hospital discharge up to 5 years after the index
           procedure. This includes telephone contacts to obtain information regarding medical
           history, cardiovascular drug use, hospitalizations, and adverse events at 1 month, 6
           months 12 months, and then yearly post procedure. Apart from clinical follow -ups there
           is angiographic follow-up which is clinically driven (symptom driven).

           10. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING

           10.1 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

           An adverse event (AE) is report as serious which lead to:

           • Death

             -  Life-threatening illness or injury, or

             -  Permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or

             -  In-patient or prolonged hospitalization (see note below), or

             -  Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or
                permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.

           Note: For the purposes of this study, in-patient hospitalization is defined as the
           subject being admitted to the hospital, with the exception of any planned
           hospitalization for a pre-existing condition or a procedure required by the local
           standard of care, which do not have to be reported as an SAE.

           All serious adverse events must be reported to the Principal Investigator within 24
           hours of discovery or notification of the event and to the local EC, as per local
           requirements.

           The Principal Investigator is responsible for reporting adequate information on SAEs
           that may be related to the study device to the regulatory authorities per country's
           applicable reporting requirements.

           10.2 Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (USADE)

           Any serious adverse effect on the health or safety or any life-threatening problem or
           death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not
           previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational
           plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other
           unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights,
           safety, or welfare of subjects.

           Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects must be reported to the manufacturer as soon as
           possible following the standard vigilance route. Reporting the event ONLY in the CRF is
           not an option.

           11. MACE ADJUDICATION

           All registry devices related Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) will be reviewed &amp;
           classified by the treating physician. In case of a stent thrombosis or severe stent
           restenosis, these events will verify the stent thrombosis &amp; determine the % Diameter
           Stenosis (DS) by QCA.

           12. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

           12.1 Analysis Population All patients who are successfully registered will be included
           in the analysis.

           12.2 Sample Size Calculations and Assumptions Being this an observational registry
           aiming at quantifying effect estimates without direct comparisons to literature
           benchmarks, we proceeded without a formal power analysis. As the main analysis is a
           pooled analysis of all included patients, an overall and comprehensive analysis is
           planned as the primary analytical approach to reflect real-world patients and practice.

           12.3 Statistical Analyses Continuous endpoints will be summarized by presenting the
           total number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.
           Tabulation of categorical parameters will include counts and percentages. Survival
           analysis will be performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical inference will be
           based on the computation of 95% confidence intervals using the adjusted Wald method.
           Additional analyses will involve key subgroups defined according to baseline and
           procedural features, with statistical significance set at the 5% 2-tailed level.
           Specifically, Student t, Fisher exact, and log-rank tests will be used for such
           bivariate analyses, whereas multivariable linear regression, logistic regression, and
           Cox proportional hazard analyses will be used to adjust for confounders.

           13. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE

           13.1 Quality Assurance The Principal Investigator of the Centre is responsible for the
           overall clinical management of patients admitted to his center, and assumes global
           responsibilities for him and his staff and the data obtained from study participants; he
           ensures compliance with the protocol, laws and regulations, ensures informed consent to
           be signed and that the CRF is accurate and complete.

           In accordance with Italian law and the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigators and the
           institution will allow representatives of regulatory agencies and Ethics Committee
           direct access for review of the original documentation of patients, to verify compliance
           with the procedures and the veracity of the data.

           13.2 Source Data The investigator assures that medical files are appropriately stored
           and completed. Each follow up contact will be reported in the source data &amp; should at
           least contain the information collected by the registry. The investigator assures that
           medical files and case record forms are accessible for inspection by Competent
           Authorities.

           13.3 Monitoring The study will be performed according to &quot;good clinical practice &quot;. The
           collection of personal, procedural and clinical data of patients must take place into
           the electronic CRF, to which will only have access the individual investigators and the
           study principal investigator (Dr Luca Testa) as &quot;administrator &quot;.

           13.4 Publication policy All study investigators are committed to publishing the results
           at both conferences and international journals. The P.I. of the study will have the
           right to present the main results before other investigators and will be the owner of
           the data. After obtaining the consent of the P.I., the other experimenters will publish
           and present the full or partial results of the study.

           All investigators undertake to publish the study results, whether they are positive,
           negative, or unexpected.

           14 ETHICAL CONSIDERATION
