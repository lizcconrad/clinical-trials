  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of surgical site infections (SSI) in clean-contaminated surgery is regarded
      as being preventable. Known to be effective in the prevention of surgical site infection are
      the adequate sterilization of the surgical instruments, asepsis during operation, antibiotic
      prophylaxis where indicated, and certainly the preparation of the skin at the incision site.
      During the last decades the use of alcoholic chlorhexidine has replaced povidone iodine for
      preoperative skin preparation. In order to improve the way alcoholic chlorhexidine is
      applied, pharmaceutical industry has developed new applicators.

      This randomized study was conducted to know the surgeons' satisfaction within the use of two
      tinted applicators: Chloraprep速 and Nex Clorex 2%

Satisfaction with the comfort of product use
Satisfaction with the surface covered by an applicator
