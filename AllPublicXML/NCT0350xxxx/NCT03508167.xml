      National clinical trial, phase III, monocentric, randomized, double-blind, controlled,
      parallel, study of superiority, in which two hundred and thirty four (234) participants of
      both sexes, aged equal or more than 18 years and equal or less than 54 years, will be
      randomly allocated in one of two treatment groups. The first group will use Dorilax® plus
      thermal band and the second group will use thermal band plus placebo. The results will show
      the efficacy and security of Dorilax® and compare the efficiency of Dorilax® and thermal
      band.

    <description>The relief of the pain will be evaluated using a 6 points scale.
0 = no relief; 1 = little relief; 2 = less than half of relief; 3 = more than half of relief; 4 = a lot of relief; 5 = complete relief;
The first 2 hours will be evaluated at the center and the other 6 hours the subject will need to provide a diary completed hourly with the pain evaluation.</description>
