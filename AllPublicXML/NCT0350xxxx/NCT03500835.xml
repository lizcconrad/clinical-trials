  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New and creative approaches are needed to address childhood obesity. Current strategies
      result in suboptimal outcomes and are intensive and costly. It has been theorized that
      overeating, may have addictive qualities, although few weight management interventions have
      tested therapeutic techniques founded on addiction medicine principles, such as, withdrawal,
      tolerance and craving control1, 2. A pilot study utilizing an addiction model based mobile
      health (mHealth) weight-loss intervention in adolescents showed that the app intervention
      reduced BMI Z-score (zBMI) to a greater extent than youth participating in an in-clinic
      multidisciplinary weight management intervention, and appeared to be a cost-effective, labor
      efficient method for adolescent weight management.

      The proposed multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness of an
      addiction-based weight loss intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone
      coaching and second as an identical approach phone-coaching alone intervention compared to
      age matched controls participating in an in-clinic weight management interventions in a
      larger sample of economically, racially and ethnically diverse adolescents (ages 14-18).

      One hundred and fifty adolescents will be recruited from pediatric interdisciplinary weight
      management clinics operating out of five different hospital systems in Southern California.
      The adolescents will be randomized 1:1 via stratified block randomization to either receive
      1) six-month interactive addiction model based mobile health (mHealth) weight-loss
      intervention with personalized phone-coaching, 2) six-month addiction-based phone coaching
      weight loss intervention alone or 3) six-month addiction model based mHealth weight loss
      intervention alone. Assessment of the intervention's effect on zBMI and percent over the 95th
      percentile (%BMIp95), fasting metabolic parameters, addictive eating habits, executive
      function, and motivation for change will be obtained at enrollment, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months (1
      year post intervention follow up). In addition, a real-life economic analysis (cost,
      cost-saving and non-monetary benefits) analysis will be completed. We will further explore
      whether primary and secondary outcomes differ by race and whether race moderates the
      relationship between initial intervention efficacy and prolonged weight maintenance.

      Specific Aim:

      Aim 1 (Primary Outcomes): To test the effectiveness of an addiction-based weight loss
      intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone coaching compared to (1)
      addiction model based weight-loss coaching alone, (2) smartphone app intervention alone, and
      on weight outcomes of overweight and obese adolescents at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post
      enrollment.

      Aim 2 (Secondary Outcomes): To compare the effects of an addiction-based weight loss mHealth
      intervention with personalized coaching on addictive eating behaviors, motivation and
      self-regulatory behaviors at completion of the intervention and 6 and 12 months post
      intervention.

      Aim 3 (Mediators): To test whether baseline traits and behaviors mediate the effect an
      addiction-based mHealth weight loss intervention with personalized phone coaching compared to
      addiction-based phone-coaching alone or addiction-based app alone intervention.

      Aim 4: To conduct a real-life economic analysis (costs, cost-savings and non-monetary
      benefits) of delivering an addiction-based weight loss mHealth intervention with personalized
      coaching compared to the delivery on an in-person multidisciplinary weight loss intervention,
      weight-loss coaching alone and the app intervention alone.

      Research Design Methods:

      Study Design:

      The proposed multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness of an
      addiction-based weight loss intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone
      coaching compared to (1) addiction-based weight-loss coaching alone and (2) addiction-based
      weight loss app intervention alone in a larger sample of economically, racially and
      ethnically diverse adolescents (ages 14-18)7.

      Recruitment and Eligibility:

      Study procedures will be approved by the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), the Los
      Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Alta Med, UCLA, and
      Cedars Sinai Institutional Review Boards. Participants will be recruited for the intervention
      arms from newly referred patients of 5 interdisciplinary weight management clinics (CHLA,
      Alta Med, Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA (LA Biomed), UCLA, and
      Cedars Sinai).

      Pre-Screening:

      Newly referred patients to the interdisciplinary clinics will be pre-screened for eligibility
      prior to their first clinic visit by an on-site clinical research coordinator (CRC). Those
      participants who meet eligibility criteria will be contacted via phone by the on-site CRC.
      The CRC will briefly introduce the study aims and intervention and request the youth and
      family to consider participation to be fully discussed at the first visit. The CRC will
      obtain the eligible participants' email address and send them a recruitment email.

      Initial Visit:

        1. On-site CRC will meet with eligible participants and provide details about the study
           procedures, obtain written consent from one parent/guardian and assent from each
           participant and answer any questions the participants and there parent may have.

             1. In order to standardize the study description, the CRC will first play an
                introductory video clip describing the study, the participant responsibilities and
                follow-up requirements.

             2. Upon obtaining verbal and written consent from one parent or guardian and verbal
                and written assent from each youth to participate in the study participants will be
                randomized to one of 3 intervention arms (App group + coaching = AC vs. Coaching
                Alone = CA vs. App alone = AA).

        2. All consenting participants will complete a battery of surveys (Refer to Measurements
           section).

           Covariates/Moderators:

             1. Yale Food Addiction Scale

             2. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale

             3. The Perceived Stress Scale

             4. Weight Management and Technology

             5. Demographic Questionnaire

             6. Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive function

           Outcomes:

             1. Intervention Satisfaction Survey

             2. The Adolescent Self-Regulatory Inventory (ASRI)

             3. Food Cravings Questionnaire

        3. All consenting participants will receive an iPhone if needed and a wireless food and
           body scale.

        4. Post Study Follow-up Options:

             1. After completion of the 6-month interventions participants will be offered the
                following choices for continued care: continued use of the app, return to the
                inter-disciplinary weight management clinic they were initially referred, no
                further follow up.

             2. All participants will receive a call from the coaches monthly for 4 months
                following the intervention completion.

             3. All Participants will return to their initial referral site at 6 months and 12
                months post intervention completion for repeat weigh in and survey completion.
