      HYPOTHESIS:

      Pregnenolone administration will be associated with greater reduction in depressive symptom
      severity than placebo in women with current mMDD.

      STUDY AIMS:

      Primary Aim: Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater reduction in depressive
      symptom severity than placebo in women with mMDD, as measured by MADRS.

      Secondary Aims:

        1. Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater reduction in anxiety symptom
           severity than placebo in women with mMDD.

        2. Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater improvement in cognition than
           placebo in women with mMDD.

        3. Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater improvement in quality of life than
           placebo in women with mMDD.

        4. Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater improvement in vasomotor symptoms
           of menopause than placebo.

      Mechanistic Aims:

        1. Determine whether changes in neurosteroid levels with pregnenolone mediate clinical
           response.

        2. Determine if baseline neurosteroid levels predict pregnenolone response.

        3. Determine whether depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep or vasomotor symptoms improve
           first. A crossed-lagged panel model will explore serial correlations between changes in
           outcome measures.

      Despite the introduction of new antidepressants, major depressive disorder (MDD) remains
      challenging to treat. Antidepressant effectiveness trials conducted suggest depression
      remission rates of only 15%-35%. Therefore, new antidepressants with mechanisms that move
      beyond norepinephrine and serotonin targets are greatly needed. Importantly, comorbid
      symptoms including anxiety, cognitive complaints and somatic symptoms often co-occur with
      depression and further impact functioning and quality of life.

      The lifetime prevalence of MDD in women at &gt; 20%, is approximately twice of that of men, with
      increased risk during the menopausal transition (perimenopause and early postmenopause). Hot
      flashes and other menopausal symptoms, such as cognitive symptoms and sleep dysregulation,
      affect up to 80% of women after perimenopause onset. Two large NIH-funded prospective
      epidemiological studies demonstrated an increased risk of onset of MDD during perimenopause
      (mMDD), with hormonal variability serving as a biomarker of risk of MDD. Short-term studies
      have demonstrated an augmentation benefit of estrogen and serotonin reuptake inhibitors can
      be used to target both mMDD and hot flashes. However, limited data from controlled trials
      suggest modest benefit for mMDD with standard antidepressants. Furthermore, due to safety
      concerns, many women prefer options other than estrogen replacement. Therefore, new and more
      effective treatments are needed for mMDD. Despite the fact that midlife women are the most
      frequent consumers of complementary and alternative therapies, trials of these approaches for
      mMDD are lacking. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring neurosteroid made from cholesterol in
      the adrenal glands and brain, sold as an over-the-counter supplement, and the use of which at
      this time is common, unregulated and unstudied in women around the menopausal transition.
      Pregnenolone is a precursor of hormones known to fluctuate during the menopausal transition,
      and may decrease this hormonal variability known to increase the risk of MDD.

      Preclinical research suggests that pregnenolone has antidepressant and neuroprotective
      effects, and improves cognition. Lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of pregnenolone are
      reported in people with bipolar disorder (BPD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) than
      controls. We conducted two pilot studies of pregnenolone in depressed patients. The first
      study included patients with bipolar as well as unipolar depression (i.e. MDD). Pregnenolone
      (100 mg/d) was superior to placebo in improving depressive symptom severity. The second study
      found that 500 mg/d of pregnenolone was superior to placebo for bipolar depression. Baseline
      anxiety, fatigue, anhedonia and physical symptoms predicted a favorable depressive symptom
      response to pregnenolone compared to placebo. Improvement in cognition (e.g. declarative and
      working memory) was also observed in women given pregnenolone. Additionally, in women,
      changes in depressive symptoms showed strong inverse correlations with changes in
      pregnenolone (r=-0.83), and other neurosteroid levels. Furthermore, in both studies women
      responded better to pregnenolone relative to placebo for depression than men. Therefore,
      pregnenolone appears to have sex-specific antidepressant effects, or at least demonstrates a
      substantial sex difference in response. Women over age 40 showed a more robust response than
      younger women. Pregnenolone was very well tolerated in both studies. Based on these data, a
      larger, longer and more definitive trial of pregnenolone is now proposed. Unlike the prior
      pilot studies, this trial will be larger and focus on unipolar rather than bipolar
      depression, and will be limited to women with mMDD.

      Given the widespread availability of pregnenolone, as well as promising preclinical and
      clinical data, and the extensive use of integrative treatments among midlife women, we
      propose to examine its efficacy as an antidepressant in mMDD. Pregnenolone has the potential
      to provide women with an efficacious and appealing treatment option. To achieve this
      objective, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pregnenolone is proposed in 144 women
      with mMDD. A novel clinical trial design that enhances power to detect between-group
      differences and that allows for a longer observation period (16 weeks) will be used.
      Depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, cognition and vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot
      flashes) will be assessed. Blood levels of pregnenolone, and other neurosteroids (e.g.
      allopregnanolone, progesterone) will be obtained, and safety and tolerability data collected.
      A multiple PI team with extensive experience in mood disorders clinical trials, women's
      mental health and neurosteroids will conduct the study.
