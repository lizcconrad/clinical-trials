  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective data collection of men who are electing to undergo prostate hemi-gland
      cryoablation.

      The purpose of this observational research study is to investigate the localized treatment of
      prostate cancer using hemi-gland cryoablation.

      UCLA patients undergoing hemi-gland cryoablation are a unique cohort compared to prior
      research because all patients at UCLA have had a pre-treatment multi-parametric MRI and
      Ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy; they will be followed in a similar fashion. This results
      in more precise assessment of a target region of cancer for ablation which may, in turn,
      result in improved clinical outcomes.

        Patients who are candidates for hemi-gland cryoablation, and elect this treatment option as
        a standard of care procedure, will be considered for our clinical study and analysis of
        their outcomes. Subjects will provide informed consent to participate in this study during
        standard of care clinical visits at the Clark Urology Center at UCLA. Subjects will provide
        informed consent to allow study staff to abstract data from their medical records.
