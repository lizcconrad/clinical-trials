  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrathecal chemotherapy is one of the most important treatment modalities for leptomeningeal
      metastasis of solid tumors. In the previous retrospective study, it has been proved that
      concurrent radiotherapy and intrathecal methotrexate for leptomeningeal metastasis from solid
      tumors with adverse prognostic factors showed great effectiveness and safety. The preliminary
      results of investigators' current prospective clinical study (Involved-field Radiotherapy
      Combined With Concurrent Intrathecal-methotrexate Versus Intrathecal-Ara-C for Leptomeningeal
      Metastases From Solid Tumor: A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial. ClinicalTrials.gov
      identification number: NCT03082144) also showed that the regimen of concurrent intrathecal
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy may serve as an optimal therapeutic option for treatment of
      leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors. Pemetrexed is a newer multitargeted antifolate
      which has shown activity in various tumors. In investigators' current study (Intrathecal
      Pemetrexed for Recurrent Leptomeningeal Metastasis From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A
      Prospective Pilot Clinical Trial. ClinicalTrials.gov identification number: NCT03101579), the
      regimen of intrathecal pemetrexed with folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation may provide
      higher effectiveness and safety for recurrent leptomeningeal metastasis from non-small cell
      lung cancer. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety and
      effectiveness of intrathecal pemetrexed combined with involved-field radiotherapy as the
      first line treatment in patients with leptomeningeal metastases from malignant solid tumors.

      This study is a single arm, open clinical trial. Consecutive patients with leptomeningeal
      metastases from malignant solid tumors are enrolled into this study. Concomitant regimen
      consisted of intrathecal chemotherapy (via lumbar puncture, pemetrexed 10 mg, plus
      dexamethasone 5 mg, once per week, 5 to 8 times, 4 to 7 weeks in total) and radiotherapy.
      Radiotherapy consisted of fractionated, conformal radiation given at a daily dose of 2 Gy.
      The planning volume consisted of sites of symptomatic disease, bulky disease observed on
      magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), including the whole brain and basis cranii received 40 Gy in
      20 fractions, 4 weeks in total, and/or segment of spinal canal received 40-50 Gy. In
      investigators' previous study, criteria of evaluation for clinical response has been
      established based on improvement of neurologic symptoms/signs and changes of Karnofsky
      Performance Status(KPS). The criteria were proved as effective method for the evaluation of
      prognosis. The method was used to assess the clinical response in this study.

    <description>The incidence of treatment-related adverse events were measured for determing tolerability and safety. Adverse events (AEs) are evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 3.0). Events of grade 3-5 are defined as moderate and severe adverse events.</description>

    <description>The clinical response rate will be determined based on the evaluation criteria which have been established and published on the previous paper by the investigators (Pan Z, et al. Int J Cancer. 2016;139:1864-72). This evaluation criteria were mainly based on two factors, including improvement of neurologic symptoms/signs and changes of Karnofsky Performance Status.</description>

    <description>The neurological progression-free survival is defined as the time elapsed between treatment initiation and neurological progression. The neurological progression was determined based on the evaluation criteria which have been established and published on the previous paper by the investigators (Pan Z, et al.
