  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of adding a team competition comprised of
      members of existing social networks to a technology-delivered program for enhancing physical
      activity among insufficiently active adults.

      This 3-month randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and
      feasibility of a novel, technology-oriented physical activity intervention characterized by
      existing social networks and a team competition. Participants will be recruited via emails,
      fliers, and word of mouth. They will be randomized to a technology-mediated physical activity
      treatment (TECH) or a treatment which receives an identical intervention as TECH plus a study
      designed team competition for physical activity promotion (TECH+COMP).

    <description>Participants will receive a theory-based physical activity program. They will enroll in the study as part of a self-selected group of 3-8 individuals. They will be provided with a personal step goal and Fitbit Alta HR for self-monitoring physical activity. They will also have access to a study website that will be accessible across conventional and mobile platforms. They will be asked to visit the website each week to receive behavior change information and guidance.</description>
