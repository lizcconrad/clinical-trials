    <textblock>
      A single institution study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination
      treatment of nivolumab, ipilimumab, CMP-001 and radiosurgery in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer with liver metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with radiosurgery to liver metastases (completed by day 1), followed
      by a priming dose of subcutaneous CMP-001 (day 1 ± 4 days), intratumoral injections of
      CMP-001 on days 13, 36 and 55, combined with nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks (start day 15)
      and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (start day 15). From day 71 biweekly subcutaneous
      injections of CMP-001 will commence. Nivolumab, ipilimumab and subcutaneous injections of
      CMP-001 will be continued until disease progression or up to 24 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two research biopsies will be taken from a
      liver metastasis. The first biopsy will be taken during the screening period (pretreatment)
      and the second one 5 weeks post-radiosurgery (which is 3 weeks post-initiation of nivolumab /
      ipilimumab). As a safety run-in, the initial cohort of 3-6 patients will not receive
      radiosurgery. The next cohort will not commence until the last patient from the initial
      cohort has been followed up for at least 8 weeks post first intratumoral injection. Efficacy
      endpoints will be based upon a non-irradiated lesion.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
