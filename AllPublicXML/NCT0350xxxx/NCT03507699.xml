  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single institution study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination
      treatment of nivolumab, ipilimumab, CMP-001 and radiosurgery in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer with liver metastases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with radiosurgery to liver metastases (completed by day 1), followed
      by a priming dose of subcutaneous CMP-001 (day 1 Â± 4 days), intratumoral injections of
      CMP-001 on days 13, 36 and 55, combined with nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks (start day 15)
      and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (start day 15). From day 71 biweekly subcutaneous
      injections of CMP-001 will commence. Nivolumab, ipilimumab and subcutaneous injections of
      CMP-001 will be continued until disease progression or up to 24 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two research biopsies will be taken from a
      liver metastasis. The first biopsy will be taken during the screening period (pretreatment)
      and the second one 5 weeks post-radiosurgery (which is 3 weeks post-initiation of nivolumab /
      ipilimumab). As a safety run-in, the initial cohort of 3-6 patients will not receive
      radiosurgery. The next cohort will not commence until the last patient from the initial
      cohort has been followed up for at least 8 weeks post first intratumoral injection. Efficacy
      endpoints will be based upon a non-irradiated lesion.

             survival and for which they would be considered eligible, whether in adjuvant or
             metastatic setting. Such therapies should include regimens containing oxaliplatin and
             irinotecan in combination with a fluoropyrimidine, if appropriate (e.g., FOLFOX and
             FOLFIRI, or their variants). Subjects that are unable to receive oxaliplatin and/or
             irinotecan due to allergy or hypersensitivity, or due to concerns regarding the side
             effects of oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan, will be allowed to receive less than two
             lines of standard therapies prior to enrollment to this study.

             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also

             care.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,

          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not
             recovered (i.e., â¤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy within 2 weeks prior to
             study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., â¤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse
             events due to a previously administered agent.Â° Note: Subjects with â¤ Grade 2
             neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.

             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

        Comorbidities, medications and immune modulation agents

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months
             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that

             mellitus, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external
             trigger are permitted to enroll. Subjects that require intermittent use of
             bronchodilators or local steroids, e.g., inhaled or topical steroids, at a dose of
             less than the equivalent of 10mg prednisone daily, would not be excluded from the
             study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjorgen's
             syndrome will not be excluded from the study.

          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any

             interpretation of safety results.

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to any study drug components, to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection requiring systemic therapy, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Previous stem cell transplant.

          -  Significant bleeding event within the last 12 months that places the patient at risk
             for intrahepatic IT injection procedure based on Investigator assessment.

                  injection.

                  prior to CMP-001 intratumoral injection.

               -  NOTE: LMWH or UFH may be used to transition patients on and off of the above
                  anti-coagulants (if deemed appropriate by the treating physician) prior to
                  CMP-001 intratumoral injection as long as the last dose of LMWH is administered
                  &gt;24 hours prior to treatments and last dose of UFH is administered &gt;4 hours prior
