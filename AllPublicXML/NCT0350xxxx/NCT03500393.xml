      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating
      the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a remotely supervised exercise program (REM)
      in promoting adherence to an exercise prescription before and during chemoradiation.

      The research team adopts an overtly pragmatic approach where our design choices are made to
      enhance external validity and create a parsimonious intervention that can be integrated into
      busy clinical practices. This is a pilot study and is not designed to definitively provide
      evidence for a treatment effect, but rather to establish feasibility and to optimize the
      intervention and study procedures in preparation for a larger trial. We will conduct a pilot
      RCT comparing a remotely supervised exercise program (REM) to an unsupervised exercise
      program (UNSUP). Data will be collected upon enrollment (T0; at least 2 weeks prior to
      beginning chemoradiation), immediately prior to chemoradiation (T1), immediately
      post-chemoradiation (T2) and 1-month post-chemoradiation (T3).

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 3, One month after completing chemoradiation</time_frame>
    <description>From the actigraphy data from the Garmin fitness device, we can calculate sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE). It is expected that increased exercise in cancer patients will follow by decreased SOL and WASO, increased TST and SE, and improvements in subjective sleep quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used measure of sleep quality, in the time frame of 2 weeks prior to the assessment. PSQI assesses a range of sleep disturbances, including symptoms of insomnia, symptoms of sleep-related breathing disorders, use of sleep medications, etc. PSQI score over 5 is indicative of significant sleep disturbances. We would expect that PSQI score would decrease following increased exercise in cancer patients.</description>

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment- Fatigue (FACT-F) instrument will be used to measure quality of life and, specifically, effects of cancer-related fatigue upon quality of life .37 The FACT-F is a 40-item self-report measure of health-related quality of life specifically designed for cancer patients. The first 27 items of the tool represent the general version of the FACT (FACT-G) which assesses perceived well-being in physical, social, emotional, and functional domains. The remainder of the tool addresses concerns directly relevant to fatigue. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Time 3, one month after completing chemoradiation</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength has been found to effectively identify people with clinically significant weakness that correlates with disability.60 Using a JAMAR Handheld Dynamometer, the subject will hold the device in their dominant hand, with the arm at right angles and the elbow by the side of the body. No other body movement is allowed. The subject squeezes the dynamometer with maximum isometric effort and maintained for about 5 seconds. The subject should be strongly encouraged to give maximum effort. The best result from several trials for each hand is recorded with at least 15 seconds recovery between each effort.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Acceptance Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 2, Assessment immediately after completing chemoradiation</time_frame>
    <description>To explore the hypothesized mechanism underlying the effect of the intervention on exercise adherence we will measure psychological flexibility. The Physical Activity Acceptance Questionnaire (PAAQ)61 is a 10-item scale used to measure a person's ability to accept physical and psychological discomfort in the context of exercise. All items on the PAAQ are rated on a 7-point Likert scale scored, 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. Psychological flexibility is a stance of openness to the present experience (i.e., one's thoughts and feelings) without attempts to modify, suppress, or terminate that experience in any way. Responses to these items were summed to yield PAAQ total scores (at each time point) ranging from 10 - 70 where higher scores represent stronger experiential acceptance.</description>

    <description>REM is designed to follow in the tradition of stepped care behavioral interventions. As such, participants who are successfully engaging in the prescribed exercise are provided minimal and automated encouragement and praise. Participants who demonstrate less adherence are given interventions that are tailored in content and intensity, depending on the level of success and the nature of the barriers to success</description>
