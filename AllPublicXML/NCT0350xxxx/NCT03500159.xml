  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group study, enrolling
      approximately 100 male subjects diagnosed with CP/CPPS to evaluate the effect of 12-week
      treatment with AQX-1125 (active drug) compared to placebo.

      The subjects will be randomized to receive orally once-daily either AQX-1125 (200 mg) or
      placebo in a 1:1 ratio across approximately 30 centers in North America (United States and
      Canada). The study will consist of a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a 12-week treatment
      period followed by a 4-week off drug safety follow-up period, and an ophthalmic safety
      follow-up call at 3 months and visit at 6 months post last dose, for a total study duration
      of about 41 weeks.
