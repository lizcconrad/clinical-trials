  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in whether or not the use of a mobile health (mHealth)
      application increases the rate of immunosuppression medication adherence among adolescent
      kidney transplant recipients. The investigators aim to test this by randomly assigning
      transplant recipients to the intervention (use of an mHealth app to manage and track their
      immunosuppression regimen) or control arm (standard of care) upon discharge from their
      initial transplant hospitalization, and tracking medication adherence over time. The study
      population will be approximately 50 adolescent kidney transplant recipients at the Johns
      Hopkins Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In kidney transplant recipients, non-adherence to immunosuppressant medications
      post-transplant has been associated with a range of negative implications, including
      increased healthcare utilization, rejection of the graft, kidney loss, and death.
      Specifically, adolescents and young adults are the most at risk populations for experiencing
      death-censored graft loss and medication non-adherence. Previous studies have reported rates
      of non-adherence in this population ranging from 50-70%, and even minor deviations in
      immunosuppressant medication adherence have been shown to have negative effects. The use of
      mobile health (mHealth) technology could prove useful in aiding transplant recipients to stay
      adherent to their medical regimen.

      emocha Mobile Health Inc. has developed an application that enables users to track
      dose-by-dose medication adherence through asynchronous, video directly observed therapy
      (VDOT). This helps patients take their medication as prescribed and gives providers the
      assurance that their patients are supported and successful in treatment. DOT is the practice
      of watching a patient take every dose of medicine in-person, and has typically only been done
      in extreme cases because it can be both costly and burdensome: DOT is the standard of care
      for Tuberculosis treatment and has proven high-adherence rates. Through mHealth technology,
      VDOT can be used more broadly and without added burden; emocha's technology allows this
      through enabling patients to use their mobile application to view their regimen, record
      themselves taking every dose of their medication, report side effects or symptoms, visualize
      their treatment progress, access educational content, and track appointments. This
      information is encrypted and transmitted to a HIPAA-secure web portal for providers to
      review. The aim of this study is to perform a pilot randomized control trial comparing the
      rates of medication adherence in adolescent kidney transplant recipients who use a novel
      mHealth system, Kidney VDOT, versus controls who do not use the application.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single center, prospective, randomized control trial with two arms. Participants in the intervention arm will use the mHealth app to manage and track their immunosuppression medical regimen post-transplant, and participants in the control arm will receive the current standard of follow-up care post-transplant.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be aware of which arm they are randomized to; thus, the study will not be blinded to practitioners or patients. However, study personnel performing data analysis will receive de-identified data that does not explicitly describe which group is intervention and which is control, but simply the code without a key. Only the PI and necessary personnel performing data extraction will have the key for the code to minimize bias in data analysis.</masking_description>
