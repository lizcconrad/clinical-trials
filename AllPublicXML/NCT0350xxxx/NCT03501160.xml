    <textblock>
      Social impairment is one of the core symptoms in first episode psychosis and a part of its
      diagnostic criteria. Social impairment not only affects families and working performance but
      also creates distress and disharmony in social interactions and relationships. Despite of
      negative symptoms and social cognitive impairment found in patient suffering from first
      episode psychosis, clinicians occasionally identified socially inappropriate affectionate
      behavior after onset of psychotic disorder. Socially inappropriate affectionate behaviors
      mainly observed in form of childish behavior or regressive behavior. It was found limited
      research focus on schizophrenic regression and social inappropriate behaviors in patient with
      first episode psychosis recently. It was worth to investigate this above observed phenomenon
      and gain more understanding in comorbidity symptoms in first episode psychosis. This study
      was expected to explore the social impairment and socially inappropriate behavior in patients
      with first episode psychosis and provide a descriptive summary and further understanding on
      the above phenomenon. It was expected the sharing from caregivers would offer a good
      opportunity to explore the clinical presentation of socially inappropriate affectionate
      behavior and their perceived burdens and caregiving distress.

      Study Design

      This study will be conducted in descriptive qualitative design - case series. Descriptive
      qualitative design is an eclectic and pragmatic approach. It presents comprehensive summaries
      of a phenomenon or events in everyday language. It studies a phenomenon to discover patterns
      and themes about life events intensely. Meanings of the data provided by informants should be
      kept as much as possible in any interpretation of the researcher. It helps to in-depth
      understand the experiences of caring individuals with first episode psychosis in Hong Kong.
      It also allowed them to express their observed social inappropriate behaviors and perceived
      burdens and coping strategies in their own words. Case series is a report on a series of
      patients with an aggregation of several similar cases and similar outcome of interest. It
      also regards as a collection of patients with common characteristics used to describe related
      clinical, pathophysiological or operational aspects of a disease, treatment or diagnostic
      procedures. It was used to describe a clinical event of one or several group of patients in a
      narrative form.

      Sampling

      Purposive sampling will be employed in this study. Purposive sampling allows rich and
      in-depth data collection as researcher purposely selecting subjects who are judged to be
      suitable in the population or particularly knowledgeable about the issues under study. It is
      particular well suited to this study as it provides a systematic way of exploring the full
      picture of the observed phenomenon. Using homogeneous purposive sampling can ensure selecting
      samples for having a shared characteristic or set of characteristics and focusing on one
      specific subgroup in which all the sample members are similar in a particular level or
      hierarchy.

      Recent literature suggested the sample size of case series study should be at least five
      cases. The subjects will be recruited from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH) and
      North District Hospital (NDH) psychiatric specialist out-patient clinic. The psychiatrists
      working in Early Assessment Services for Young People with psychosis (EASY) team will refer
      the suitable Chinese cases after granted the agreement from potential subjects. The Inclusion
      criteria framed all target subjects were Hong Kong primary caregivers whose offspring was
      primary diagnosed of schizophrenic spectrum disorder with social inappropriate behavior after
      onset of illness. The patient should be under active care by EASY team. The cases of bipolar
      affective disorder and drug induced psychosis should be excluded from the study. In addition,
      the cases of active substance abuse and presenting active psychotic symptoms were also not
      suitable for the study.

      Study Population Description

      Socially inappropriate affectionate behavior was occasionally identified by clinicians in
      patient with first episode psychosis. Socially inappropriate behavior was mainly observed as
      social inappropriate affectionate behavior, childish behavior and regressive behavior.
      Clinicians observed some patient became excessively dependent on family members and displayed
      intimate physical contact towards family members. Such socially inappropriate behaviors may
      explain by schizophrenic thinking or schizophrenic regression.

      The concept of schizophrenic regression is commonly associated with the work of Sigmund
      Freud. Freud's view of regression did not assume demonstrable nervous system damage but
      assume that regression could be spontaneous and influenced by environmental factors. It could
      permit the removal of psychological barriers that were inhibiting mature mental processes
      when regression occurred. According to Sigmund Freud, regression is an unconscious defense
      mechanism which causes the temporary or long-term reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of
      development. The term &quot;regression&quot; refers to events in which an individual change from
      present level of maturity and regains mental and behavioral characteristics shown at an
      earlier point in development. Proponents of classical psychoanalytic theory considered
      psychosis makes patient return to the period prior to the structuring of the ego. It causes a
      loss or destruction of the characteristics of normal adult thought processes accompanied by a
      reversion to the more concrete forms of thought characteristic of the young child. It was
      regarded as the one of defense mechanism which allows individual to have self-protection
      against difficult circumstances. Regression used to describe an organism's reversion to
      functioning in ways characteristic of an earlier period of life. Regression in adults can
      arise at any age and it entails retreating to an earlier developmental stage in forms of
      emotional, social or behavioral. It also viewed as the &quot;backward&quot; movement of the libido from
      a frustrated present-day object to an object that had been satisfactory at an earlier point
      in development. The earlier stage was a period of fixation which making it attractive to the
      libido when reality became frustrating and symptoms were associated with characteristics of
      the early period. This is regarded as a movement back in psychological time which behaviors
      became more childish or primitive when an individual facing trouble, frightened and
      distressed situation. The source of regressive behavior is broad and includes both medical
      and psychiatric conditions. Regressive behavior can be a manifestation of inadequate or
      maladaptive coping as patients employ immature defense mechanisms to manage their stress.
      Patient who is overwhelmed by stress or frustration might automatically exhibit regressive
      behaviors. In addition, regressive behavior usually regards as attention seeking behavior as
      well as a mean to communicating individual's distress and provoke others to provide more
      attention and care.

      Data Collection

      Face-to face semi-structured in-depth interview will be arranged in order to explore the
      inappropriate social behavior and caregiver stress from caregivers. The interview will be
      guided by a semi-structured interview guide which specially designed for exploring clinical
      picture of inappropriate social and affectionate behavior and caregiving distress. The
      interview guide mainly consisted of specific questions and open-ended questions that
      encourage the subjects to talk freely in relevant topics during interview. Demographic data
      was also collected in the beginning of interview. Each interview will be conducted around 60
      minutes until data saturated. The interview will be audio-taped with informed consent from
      subjects. The interview will be audio-taped and being transcribed into verbatim in text
      material for data analysis. The richness of the data could be enhanced with referencing the
      field notes taken in the interview.

      Data analysis

      Content analysis will be used for analyzing the content's meaning of the text data. It is
      used for finding numerous textual contents to determine trends and relationship of reality by
      systematic coding and categorizing approach. Phases and key words within the text in verbatim
      which shared the common ground and meaning were interpreted and divided into related themes.

      Ethical Consideration

      The study was governed and monitored by NTEC-CUHK Joint CREC. Potential subjects were invited
      purposively to attend the interview with full disclosure of the study. Written informed
      consent must be obtained from the subjects before the interview. The consent form clearly
      stated the essential information of study and the rights of being a research subject in
      Chinese. Subjects had freedom to refuse joining the study and answering questions from
      researchers. Subjects had the right to withdraw from the study at any time. All data and
      information collected was regarded as confidential and strictly accessible by responding
      researchers only. All data collected will be encrypted with password (electronic documents)
      and placed in safety place with double lock (written documents). All data and information
      collected in the study including audio-tape recordings and the verbatim materials will be
      destroyed after the completion of the study. This study do not involve any treatment or
      procedure differ from current treatment practice to subjects.
