  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absorption of apixaban (BMS-562247) into the
      bloodstream of healthy volunteers, when administered as sprinkle capsules compared to
      tablets. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences and
      will receive a single oral dose of apixaban twice during the course of the study.

             taking hormonal contraception).

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (e.g. cigarettes, pipes, cigars,
             chewing tobacco, nicotine patches, nicotine lozenges, nicotine gum) within 6 months
             prior to study drug administration.

          -  Donation of blood to a blood bank or in a clinical study (except screening or
             follow-up visit) within 4 weeks of study drug administration (within 2 weeks for
             plasma only).

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply.
