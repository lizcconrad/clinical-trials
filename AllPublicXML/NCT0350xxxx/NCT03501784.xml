      The study purpose is to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of Nobio particles incorporated
      within Novidia Dental Bonding and Flowable Composite versus standard of care within a split
      mouth model.The study population will include 35 subjects considered to be at high risk for
      cervical caries and affected by uncontrolled plaque accumulation

      An exploratory, comparative, self-controlled single blinded interventional study. Intended to
      evaluate the antimicrobial effect of Nobio particles incorporated within Novidia Dental
      Bonding and Flowable composite versus Filtek bond and flow composite within a split mouth
      model.The study population (N=35) will be high risk population for cervical caries (with at
      least 2 carious cavities in the mouth) affected by uncontrolled plaque accumulation.Each
      subject will serve in this model as his own control.On one side the Novidia intervention will
      be made and on the contralateral side the Filtek intervention.
