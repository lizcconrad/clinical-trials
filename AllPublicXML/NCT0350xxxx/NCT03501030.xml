      to test the hypothesis that activity restriction in women with singleton gestations and with
      arrested PTL would reduce the rate of PTB.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Worldwide, about
      15 million babies are born too soon every year, causing 1.1 million deaths, as well as short-
      and long-term disability in countless survivors.

      Preterm labor (PTL) is the final pathway for about 50% of all PTB. Tocolytic agents are drugs
      that can slow or stop labor contractions in the attempt to delay births preceded by PTL.
      Primary tocolysis is defined as tocolysis given on initial presentation of women with PTL. In
      most of these women, PTL stops, but as their risk of PTB remains high, some have advocated
      use of maintenance tocolysis, i.e. tocolysis after arrested PTL. So far, no maintenance
      tocolytic agent has been shown to be beneficial in preventing PTB.

      Some authors have also advocated the use of activity restriction in women with arrested PTL
      to reduce the risk of PTB. Activity restriction is defined as the following forms of activity
      restriction: pelvic rest and prohibition of sexual activity, reduction of work and/or non
      work activity. So far, the benefit of activity restriction in women with arrested PTL is
      still subject of debate and no Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) has been undertaken.

      Thus, the aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that activity restriction in women with
      singleton gestations and with arrested PTL would reduce the rate of PTB.
