    <textblock>
      monocentric randomized controlled trial starting from Mars 2017, recruitment is still
      ongoing. Patients aged between 0-45 days needing mechanical ventilation (MV) with tracheal
      intubation were included random assignation in two groups for post-extubation management:
      Group Optiflow (GO) for patients receiving High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy HNFC and
      Control Group (CG) for conventional treatment.

      Patients were evaluated during the first 72h following extubation. Primary endpoint was the
      incidence of reintubation. Secondary endpoints were incidence of post-extubation respiratory
      failure, time to reintubate and weaning time from oxygen. Respiratory and hemodynamic
      parameters were assessed and compared between the two groups upon extubation, after 2 hours
      (H2), at H6, H12, H24, H36, H48 and H72. Length of stay (LOS) and mortality were also
      estimated.

      We conducted a monocentric randomized controlled trial starting from Mars 2017, recruitment
      is still ongoing. Patients aged between 0-45 days needing mechanical ventilation (MV) with
      tracheal intubation were included regardless type of admission, severity of disease and
      randomly assigned in two groups for post-extubation management: Group Optiflow (GO) for
      patients receiving HNFC oxygen therapy and Control Group (CG) for conventional treatment.
      Before programmed extubation, newborns and young infants received 0.15 mg/kg of
      Dexamethasone. Patients were evaluated during the first 72h following extubation. Primary
      endpoint was the incidence of reintubation. Secondary endpoints were incidence of
      post-extubation respiratory failure, time to reintubate and weaning time from oxygen.
      Respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were assessed and compared between the two groups upon
      extubation, after 2 hours (H2), at H6, H12, H24, H36, H48 and H72. Length of stay (LOS) and
      mortality were also estimated.
