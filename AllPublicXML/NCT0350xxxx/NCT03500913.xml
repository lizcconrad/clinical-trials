      This study will examine adipose tissue inflammation and adipokine expression and serum
      markers of inflammation and adipokine levels in patients with growth hormone (GH) deficiency
      before and after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GH axis has important influences on adipose tissue. Preliminary data from the
      investigators' study in acromegaly, a state of GH excess, suggests that GH reduces adipose
      tissue (AT) mass and serum inflammation. However, GH seems to reduce macrophage markers in
      adipose tissue yet increase adipocyte inflammation. This novel dissociation of macrophage and
      adipocyte inflammation is hypothesized to be due to GH. In order to examine this hypothesis
      further this study will examine adipose tissue and serum inflammation in patients with GH
      deficiency before and after GH therapy. The investigators will obtain subcutaneous adipose
      tissue by biopsy in patients with active GH deficiency planning to undergo therapy for GH
      deficiency. Concurrently serum samples will be taken for analysis of levels of inflammatory
      markers and adipokines. After treatment for 12 months with a normal levels of IGF-I (marker
      of GH deficiency) patients will have a repeat adipose tissue biopsy. Adipose tissue
      parameters will be analyzed in each specimen and then compared to each patient over time as
      well as to body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects.

        GH deficiency or who are followed in our unit and have GH deficiency and are planning to
        initiate a therapy. Subjects will be those with central adiposity. We expect are study
        group to be approximately half women and reflect the ethnic mix of our study populations of
        our other pituitary tumor studies, which is primarily drawn from the New York Metropolitan
        area.
