        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age

          2. Primary diagnosis of PNH confirmed by high-sensitivity flow cytometry

          3. On treatment with eculizumab. Dose of eculizumab must have been stable for at least 3
             months prior to the Screening Visit

          4. Hb &lt;10.5 g/dL at the Screening Visit

          5. Absolute reticulocyte count &gt; 1.5x ULN at the Screening Visit

          6. Platelet count of &gt;50,000/mm3 at the Screening Visit

          7. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;500/mm3 at the Screening Visit

          8. Vaccination against Neisseria meningitides types A, C, W, Y and B, Streptococcus
             pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae Type B (Hib) either within 2 years prior to Day
             1 dosing, or within 14 days after starting treatment with APL-2. Unless documented
             evidence exists that subjects are non-responders to vaccination as evidenced by titers
             or display titer levels within acceptable local limits

          9. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at the
             Screening and Day -28 Visit (Run-in Period) and must agree to use protocol defined
             methods of contraception for the duration of the study and 60 days after their last
             dose of study drug

         10. Males must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception and agree to refrain
             from donating sperm for the duration of the study and 60 days after their last dose of
             study drug

         11. Willing and able to give informed consent

         12. Willing and able to self-administer APL-2 (administration by caregiver will be
             allowed)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active bacterial infection within 4 weeks prior to Day -28 (Run-in Period)

          2. Receiving iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and EPO, unless the dose is stable, in the 4
             weeks prior to Screening

          3. Hereditary complement deficiency

          4. History of bone marrow transplantation

          5. History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to compounds related
             to the investigational product or SC administration

          6. Participation in any other investigational drug trial or exposure to other
             investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)

          7. Currently breast-feeding women

          8. Inability to cooperate or any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             could increase the subject's risk of participating in the study or confound the
             outcome of the study

          9. History or family history of Long QT Syndrome or torsade de pointes, unexplained
             syncope, syncope from an uncorrected cardiac etiology, or family history of sudden
             death

         10. Myocardial infarction, CABG, coronary or cerebral artery stenting and /or angioplasty,
             stroke, cardiac surgery, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure within 3
             months or greater than Class 2 Angina Pectoris or NYHA Heart Failure Class &gt;2

         11. QTcF &gt; 470 ms, PR &gt; 280 ms

         12. Mobitz II 2nd degree AV Block, 2:1 AV Block, High Grade AV Block, or Complete Heart
             Block unless the patient has an implanted pacemaker or implantable cardiac
             defibrillator (ICD) with backup pacing capabilities

         13. Receiving Class 1 or Class 3 antiarrhythmic agents, or arsenic, methadone, ondansetron
             or pentamidine at screening

         14. Receiving any other QTc-prolonging drugs (see Appendix 4 in Section 18.4), at a stable
             dose for less than 3 weeks prior to dosing

         15. Receiving prophylactic ciprofloxacin, erythromycin or azithromycin for less than one
             week prior to the first dose of study medication (must have a repeat screening ECG
             after one week of prophylactic antibiotics with QTcF &lt; 470 ms)
