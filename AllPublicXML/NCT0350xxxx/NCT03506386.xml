  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to present a descriptive analysis of demographic and clinical
      characteristics of the participants, as well as of the treatment patterns for MM in Brazil.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with a diagnosis of MM will be observed in this retrospective study. Data
      collected for the study will include identification, demographic, baseline data on MM,
      additional baseline laboratory, initial treatment for MM, subsequent treatment for MM, and
      outcome.

      The study will enroll approximately 1000 participants.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in five geographic regions of Brazil. For each
      participant, data collection will comprise the longest possible period of time since the
      diagnosis of MM (within the eligibility window of time, between January 1, 2008 and December
      31, 2016) and the cut-off date for data collection (December 31, 2016), unless a participant
      has died or been lost to follow-up before that. The study is planned to last for
      approximately 24 months since its initiation (initiation defined as the initiation visit for
      the first site).

    <description>Participants diagnosed with MM and have initiated treatment will be observed since the diagnosis of MM (within the eligibility window of time, between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2016) and the cut-off date for data collection (December 31, 2016), unless a participant has died or been lost to follow-up before that.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Each participant should be included in the study only once. For study sites with a system
        that allows identification of participants with MM electronically, for example using
        International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), this will be the
        preferred method of participant screening for eligibility. For study sites without such
        capabilities, participant screening will rely on manual selection of institutional charts
        or other means. In these cases, every effort should be made to identify every possible
        eligible participant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of written informed consent, for participants who are alive and not lost to
             follow-up (for participants already deceased or lost follow up, informed consent
             should have been waived by the corresponding ethics review board [ERB]).

          2. Documented diagnosis of MM by the responsible physician between January 1, 2008, and
             December 31, 2016.

          3. Absence of any plasma-cell disorder other than MM.

          4. Absence of any immunoglobulin-related disorder other than MM.
