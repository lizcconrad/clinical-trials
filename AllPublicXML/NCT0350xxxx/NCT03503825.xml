  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of T-087. The study
      will enroll 6 healthy volunteers (HVs) and 6-18 subjects with KOA. All eligible subjects will
      receive an intravenous injection of the radioactive investigational product (T-087), followed
      by SPECT/CT imaging of the knees and blood tests and clinical assessments for safety
      monitoring. Healthy volunteers will also have their whole body imaged and have extra blood
      drawn to determine where T-087 goes in the body. These additional procedures will be done on
      the same day as the ip administration, and repeated the following day. All subjects will have
      a final follow-up phone call within 2- 3 business days following the ip administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open label, single centre clinical trial. 6 healthy
      volunteers (3 male and 3 female,4 study visits) and 6-18 subjects with Osteoarthritis of the
      knee (3 study visits) will be enrolled. At visit 2, all subjects will have knee pain
      assessed, using a visual analogue scale, prior to receiving a single, 925 MBq (25 mCi)+/-10%
      dose of[Tc-99m)-RPT-T-087 injection. Knees will be imaged with a SPECT/CT camera at specified
      time-points post injection. Safety monitoring will include vital signs, ECG, clinical
      laboratory tests (serum biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis) and adverse event monitoring.

      Additionally, HVs will have whole body planar imaging and blood sampling conducted at Visit 2
      and 3 to evaluate bio-distribution, estimate dosimetry and measure clearance of total
      activity over time in blood samples. A final follow-up visit will be conducted by phone
      interview.

      Once 6 HVs and 6 KOA participants have completed the study, a blinded assessment of the image
      data will be conducted to determine whether any more KOA subjects should be imaged.

    <description>The incidence of adverse events, including injection site reactions, clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory parameters (blood and urine), ECG's and vital signs, will be summarized over time to assess safety and tolerability.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4.5 hours post administration of the investigational product</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative standard uptake values (SUV) for T-087 will be determined for the knees of subjects with KOA and HVs, and comparing uptake in the target knee of OA subjects with the uptake in the knees of the HVs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Image quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4.5 hours post administration of the investigational product</time_frame>
    <description>A visual assessment using a scoring system will be used to assess the SPECT/CT images quality in subjects with KOA. Image quality scales of 1 to 3, with 1 as unacceptable (non-interpretable quality), 2 as adequate quality for interpretation and 3 as excellent quality (no issues) of the target knee will be descriptively summarized by time point and subject group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dosimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 day post administration of the investigational product.</time_frame>
    <description>Whole body planar imaging of healthy volunteers will be used to evaluate the biodistribution of [Tc-99m]-RPI-T-087 Injection to estimate dosimetry. Whole body scintigraphic images will be quantified as to fractional activity (IA) in various visceral organs (e.g., liver, lungs, heart) as well as routes of excretion, total body and knees. The data describing the uptake, retention and clearance in these tissues will characterize the biodistribution and biokinetics of the IP. These data also serve as the foundation for radiation dose estimates for the IP.</description>
