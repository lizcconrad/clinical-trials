    <textblock>
      Rationale. The Otteroo is a floatie which supports an infant or young child with their head
      above and their body in water. Researchers are proposing that the Otteroo may be a good
      &quot;tool&quot; to facilitate exploring the ability to move and control one's body before locomotion
      develops. Intervention. Otteroo will be used as an adjunct to standard care for 4 weeks.

      Objectives or purpose. The purpose of this project is to measure overall developmental status
      before, during, and after Otteroo experience. Study population or sample characteristics.
      Participants will be 4 pre-locomotor infants or young children for whom a healthcare provider
      or caregiver has identified concerns about potential developmental delay. Study methodology.
      A single-subject research design will be used: measures of infant development will be
      collected across a 4-week baseline period (standard care), 4 weeks of intervention (standard
      care and Otteroo use), and a 4 weeks of reversal/retention period (standard care). Study
      endpoints or outcomes. The end of the study is the final assessment at 12 weeks. Follow-up.
      None. Statistics and plans for analysis. Researchers will calculate descriptive statistics
      (mean, range, coefficient of variation) for all measures and describe changes over time,
      relating the participant's performance at each time point to norm-referenced results for
      their age.

    <description>A single-subject research design will be used: measures of infant development will be collected across a 4-week baseline period (standard care), 4 weeks of intervention (standard care and Otteroo use), and a 4 weeks of reversal/retention period (standard care). There is only one arm due to the study design. It is a within-subjects comparison, not a between-subjects comparison of different study arms.</description>
