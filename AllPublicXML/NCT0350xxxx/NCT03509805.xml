  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excess weight or obesity is associated with an increased risk of health disorders: high blood
      pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular risks, dyslipidemia and sleep apneas. During pregnancy in
      obese women, the risk of preeclampsia increases by three and the risk of fetal death in utero
      by five. Snoring and Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be associated with increased risk of
      adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal cardio pulmonary status, fetal heart rate and
      fetal acidosis-basis status by recurrent upper-airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and
      intermittent nocturnal hypoxia. Reports in pregnancy have identified in association with OSA
      and preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and stillbirth.

      The prevalence of OSA among women is estimated to be 2-5%, but it remains underdiagnosed
      during pregnancy. In sleep apnea syndrome, a few data have shown better pregnancy and fetal
      outcome with the use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

      the hypothesis is in obese pregnant women that there could be a significant association
      between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertensive disorders, preeclampsia and adverse fetal
      outcomes This is a prospective study of Women with a body mass index of 35 kg.m2 or greater.
      The aim of this study is to determinate the prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome in obese
      pregnant women and the benefit of CPAP on the maternal and fetal outcome.
