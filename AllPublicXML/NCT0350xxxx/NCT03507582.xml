  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with hemophilia are exposed to intravenous (IV) procedures that cause pain/anxiety
      and distraction methods can be employed to improve the patient experience. Three-dimensional
      virtual reality (VR) environments can reduce distress related to procedures. To be utilized
      in a clinical setting, however, these devices must address infection control concerns and fit
      pediatric patients. Additionally, for use in hemophilia care, environments should encourage a
      subject to keep their hands/arms still to facilitate procedures. Nursing orchestration of the
      VR environment via an iPad dashboard has the potential to increase feasibility and acceptance
      by patients, families and providers of the VR experience without disrupting routine clinical
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hemophilia A and B (HA/HB) are frequently treated with IV infusions of clotting
      factor concentrates to treat and prevent bleeding. Additionally they typically have at least
      yearly IV laboratory assessments. Pain and anxiety with needle related procedures
      particularly in children with hemophilia can lead to development of needle phobia, treatment
      avoidance and poor adherence to treatment regimens. Conventional virtual reality (VR)
      environments have been shown to reduce pain/anxiety in pediatric populations however in a
      clinical setting children with hemophilia have specific VR design needs that have not been
      addressed. Certain issues related to VR environments are related to the pediatric age range.
      These include the size and weight of VR headsets, the ease of donning and doffing headsets,
      and degree of engagement with VR environments. Hemophilia specific issues include the need
      for the VR experience to limit movement of the hands/arms to facilitate IV procedures,
      customization to prevent boredom/disengagement from repeated use and ability of clinical
      staff to trigger events via an orchestration dashboard that occur for the patients benefit at
      key times during IV procedures. Lastly, there are issues related to integration into a
      clinical setting. These include ability to integrate into clinical care without adversely
      affecting clinic flow, and infection control issues related to headset design.

    <description>The primary outcome of feasibility was assessed using a surrogate marker of feasibility which was duration of the IV procedure measured in minutes in both study arms. Procedure time was the length of time from the moment a patient was positioned for the procedure to the completion of the procedure. The study timer was incorporated in the study IPAD and timing was performed by the nurse orchestrator.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of the distraction technique</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve months</time_frame>
    <description>Both patient groups assessed the effectiveness of their distraction techniques following the procedure by using a Visual analogue/FACES scale answering 3 anchored questions. 1) &quot;Did the distraction technique keep you/your child /your patient engaged?&quot; The anchors were 0=It really kept them engaged and 100=It really did not keep them engaged. 2) &quot;Do you think the distraction technique/s changed you/your child/your patient's nervousness/anxiety level during the IV procedure?&quot; The anchor of 0=it decreased nervousness/anxiety a lot, 100=it increased nervousness/anxiety a lot. 3) &quot;How did the distraction technique/s affect pain during your/your child/your patient's IV procedure?&quot; With 0=it made pain a lot better, 100=it made pain a lot worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability and Likeability</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients randomized to the VR arm, data on the use of the VR equipment was recorded by the nurse orchestrator at the end of each procedure. Data was categorized if the participant wore the VR equipment: 1) during the entire procedure, 2) part of the procedure or 3) only prior to the procedure. Participants were also asked to rate usability of the VR equipment, by using the VAS/FACES scale to answer &quot;How easy was it for you/your child/your patient to use the VR equipment?&quot; A score of 0 represented really easy to use and a score of 100 correlated with really hard to use. Lastly, participants were asked to use the VAS?FACES scale to answer a likeability question by &quot;How much would you/your child/your patient like to use VR for future IV procedures?&quot; A score of 0 equated to they would really like to use VR again and 100 meant they would really not like to use it again.</description>

    <description>This intervention consists of a disposable virtual reality headset which will enable the use of virtual reality in clinic through the commodity hardware iPod Touch. An additional piece of software on an iPad will allow clinical staff to act as an orchestrator and trigger events that occur for the patient's benefit in the virtual reality environment. The mechanism for the dashboard will be dashboard software running on an iPad tablet that will wirelessly communicate to the iPod Touch the patient is wearing. A study timer will be incorporated into the orchestration dashboard. The VAS/FACES scale will be incorporated into the iPad used for orchestration.</description>
