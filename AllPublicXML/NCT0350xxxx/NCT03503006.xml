  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, there is no agreement on the effect of vitamin D level in serum and follicular
      fluid on the outcome of IVF-ET pregnancy. Most of these studies were based on the research of
      total 25 (OH) D, which have ignored that the biological activity of vitamin D molecule is not
      total 25 (OH) D, but free vitamin D or vitamin D bioavailable, and have flaws in methodology.
      This project intends to make a prospective cohort study with large sample, based on a
      complete methodology of total vitamin D and free vitamin D to measure maternal vitamin D
      levels in blood,to systematically study the effect of maternal vitamin D status on IVF - ET
      pregnancy outcome. This study is also the first to study the relationship between maternal
      vitamin D status and the outcome of IVF-ET pregnancy using a complete methodology.
