    <textblock>
      This study proposes to develop an MRI technique named Coronary Atherosclerosis T1-weighed
      Characterization (CATCH) that will improve the quality and reliability of coronary
      atherosclerosis evaluation, as well as simplify the scanning process and significantly
      shorten imaging time compared with conventional imaging methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 100 healthy male/female adult &quot;normals&quot; or &quot;controls&quot; and 40 male/female adult
      outpatients who are suspected of having or have been diagnosed with coronary artery disease
      will be recruited. All subjects will be asked to undergo either a non-contrast MRI or a
      contrast-enhanced MRI of the coronary artery depending upon the focus of development at the
      time of their participation

      It is anticipated that healthy volunteers will undergo non-contrast or contrast-enhanced MRI
      for evaluating the image quality associated with each acquisition module of the developed
      technique and motion artifact associated with motion compensation strategy. For subjects
      receiving contrast, a total dose of up to 0.2 mmol/kg of a gadolinium based contrast agent
      will be injected intravenously provided all the safety requirements are met.

      Subjects undergoing a contrast-enhanced MRI will be screened using the standard clinical
      protocol to determine whether it is safe to administer contrast. If subjects do not qualify
      for contrast administration, they may be asked to have a research scan without contrast.

      Research MRI results will be compared with clinical diagnostic CT and/or invasive imaging
      studies for patients who have been evaluated with these exams at Cedars-Sinai Medical
      Center..

    <description>PMR is defined as the ratio between the maximal signal intensity from a vessel wall region and the average signal from an adjacent myocardial area. Such metric is used to classify hyper-intense plaques, also known as &quot;hot spots&quot;, which has PMR over 1.0.</description>

    <measure>Stenosis level (patient group only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Stenosis level will be evaluated at the vascular segments with visible lumen narrowing in each patient. The extent of a stenosis will be measured and recorded as a percentage, ranging from 0% to 100%, with 100% representing a complete occlusion.</description>

    <description>Based upon the focus of the study at the time of the scan, a beta- blocker (metoprolol), in pill form based upon blood pressure and heart rate, may be administered to some subjects to improve the heart's ability to relax and slow the heart rate. The slower heart rate may improve image quality and lessen motion artifact.</description>
