  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab with or without
      ipilimumab in treating participants with female reproductive cancer that has come back or is
      high grade and has spread extensively throughout the peritoneal cavity. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of intraperitoneal (i.p.) nivolumab in
      combination with ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicities, and immune-related adverse events
      associated with i.p. checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

      II. To estimate the clinical benefit rate (rate of partial response (PR), complete response
      (CR), and stable disease (SD) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      version 1.1 modified to include immune-related response criteria) for the expansion cohort.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine blood based transcriptional changes associated with pharmacokinetics (PK)
      time points and determine their correlation with serum drug concentrations, clinical
      response, and immune related adverse events.

      II. To determine baseline and on-treatment molecular alteration (ribonucleic acid [RNA] and
      protein) associated with i.p. and nivolumab (Nivo) (for the expansion cohort).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive nivolumab i.p. over 90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. Courses
      repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Participants receive nivolumab as in group I and ipilimumab i.p. on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 weeks for at
      least 100 days.
