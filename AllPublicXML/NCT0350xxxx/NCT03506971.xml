  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PERL project is a research in prevention in perinatality. The objective of this research
      is to offer preventive and regular care at familie's home in the Lunévillois area, while
      integrating it into the existing practices of the maternal and child protection, in the
      framework of a partnership between the PMI (Protection Maternal Infantile) and the child
      psychiatry.

      An innovative prevention device to support the interactions and development of the child will
      be proposed to about sixty families, randomly recruited into the general population.

      If the family agrees to participate, their will benefit from regular home visits by a
      pediatric nurse, accompanied on certain times by a psychologist, for a period of 4 years from
      the birth of the child.

      This home-visits accompaniment, centered on listening and observation, focuses on three
      areas: baby's development, parenthood and parent-child's interactions.

      A longitudinal and comparative evaluation will be carried out with a &quot;control&quot; group
      recruited according to the same conditions and at the same time as the &quot;participants&quot; group.

      A parallel research on the processes and mechanism will be carried out in partnership with
      the School of Public Health in order to define and validate the intervention theory (what are
      the mobilized levers produced and how, what are the mechanisms linking the intervention to
      its results), to describe the implementation and the processes involved, and to analyze the
      effects of context, especially social, on processes and results.

    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a set of 10 screening questions that can indicate whether a parent has symptoms that are common in women with depression and anxiety during pregnancy and in the year following the birth of a child.
To complete this set of questions, the parent should select the number next to the response that comes closest to how they have felt in the past seven days.
The total score is calculated by adding the numbers selected for each of the 10 items. If the parent's score is 10 points or above, they should speak to a health professional about those symptoms.</description>
