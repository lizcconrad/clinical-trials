    <textblock>
      The objectives of this prospective observational study is to explore 1-year clinical response
      via both Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Ankylosing
      Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) after initiation of adalimumab therapy in AS
      patients from routine clinical practices in Taiwan.
