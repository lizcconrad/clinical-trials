    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria (Normal Group):

          -  Subjects with normal eye examinations (without pathology other than cataract) in one
             or both eyes on the date of the study visit;

          -  Subjects with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤ 21 mmHg in the normal eye(s) on the date of
             the study visit; and

          -  Subjects with current best-spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of 20/40 or
             better in the normal eye(s) on the date the study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria (Normal Group):

          -  Subjects unable to tolerate ophthalmic imaging;

          -  Subjects with ocular media not sufficiently clear to obtain acceptable OCT images;

          -  Subjects with any current ocular pathology other than cataract in the normal eye(s),
             as determined by self-report and/or investigator assessment at the study visit;

          -  Subjects with current narrow anterior chamber drainage angle in the normal eye(s), as
             determined by self-report and/or investigator assessment at the study visit; and

          -  Subjects with a history of leukemia, dementia or multiple sclerosis.

        Inclusion Criteria (Glaucoma Group):

          -  Subjects who have been diagnosed with glaucoma in the glaucoma study eye(s), with
             optic nerve damage as evidenced by either of the following optic disc or retinal nerve
             fiber layer structural abnormalities observed via fundus exam during the study visit:

               1. Diffuse thinning, focal narrowing, or notching of the optic disc rim, especially
                  at the inferior or superior poles with or without disc hemorrhage; or

               2. Optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the two eyes consistent with loss of neural
                  tissue;

          -  Subjects with a current BSCVA of 20/40 or better in the glaucoma study eye(s) on the
             date of the visit; and

          -  History of visual field defects within the previous two (2) months from the study
             visit or measured on the day of the study visit that is consistent with glaucomatous
             optic nerve damage based on at least one of the following findings:

               1. On pattern deviation (PD), there exists a cluster of 3 or more points in an
                  expected location of the visual field depressed below the 5% level, at least 1 of
                  which is depressed below the 1% level; and

               2. Glaucoma hemi-field test &quot;outside normal limits.&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria (Glaucoma Group):

          -  Subjects unable to tolerate ophthalmic imaging;

          -  Subjects with ocular media not sufficiently clear to obtain acceptable OCT images;

          -  Subjects with at least one Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) visual field (24-2 SITA
             Standard, white on white) measured on the day of the study visit, or within the
             previous two (2) months from the study visit with unreliable results, defined as
             fixation losses &gt; 20%, or false positives &gt; 33%, or false negatives &gt; 33% in the
             glaucoma study eye(s);

          -  Subjects with any current ocular pathology except glaucoma in the glaucoma study
             eye(s), as determined by self-report and/or investigator assessment on the day of the
             study visit; and

          -  Subjects with a history of leukemia, dementia or multiple sclerosis.

        Inclusion Criteria (Retinal Disease Group):

          -  Subjects with current IOP ≤ 21 mmHg in the retinal disease study eye(s) on the day of
             the study visit;

          -  Subjects with a current BSCVA of 20/400 or better in the retinal disease study eye(s)
             at the study visit; and

          -  Subjects diagnosed with retinal pathology including but not limited to: Macular
             Degeneration, Diabetic Macular Edema, Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole, Epiretinal
             Membrane, Cystoid Macular Edema, and others in the retinal disease study eye(s) as
             confirmed within the past six (6) months.

        Exclusion Criteria (Retinal Disease Group):

          -  Subjects unable to tolerate ophthalmic imaging;

          -  Subjects with ocular media not sufficiently clear to obtain acceptable OCT images;

          -  Subjects with glaucoma or any ocular pathology other than retinal pathology (e.g.
             cornea pathology) in the retinal disease study eye(s), as determined by self-report
             and/or investigator assessment at the study visit;

          -  Subjects with current narrow anterior chamber drainage angle in the retinal disease
             study eye(s), as determined by self-report and/or investigator assessment at the study
             visit; and

          -  Subjects with a history of leukemia, dementia or multiple sclerosis.
