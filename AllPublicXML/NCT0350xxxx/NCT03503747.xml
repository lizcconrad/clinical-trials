  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the percentage of children with genetic markers
      putting them at increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes, and to offer the opportunity
      for these children to be enrolled into a phase II b primary prevention trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a population screening study to undertake (with prospective consent) additional
      testing of the newborn screening blood to identify children at increased genetic risk of type
      1 diabetes. This study will enrol newborn babies whose mothers have given consent to
      additional testing for the newborn blood screening (routinely performed when the baby is
      approximately 5 days old).

      Women will be approached by research staff in the second or third trimester of pregnancy (â‰¥18
      weeks gestation) when attending for antenatal care. At this point, the study will be
      discussed with the woman and if interested a patient information sheet will be provided as
      well as the opportunity to ask questions. If they agree to participate, a qualified member of
      the research team will take written informed consent. This consent will allow a) completion
      of a questionnaire and b) prospective consent to use the surplus neonatal screening blood
      sample for genetic testing.

      The punch from the blood sample will analysed for the child's risk of type 1 diabetes. If
      found to be at high risk (&gt;10%) they will be contacted by a member of the clinical study team
      to discuss the results and invite them to participate in a phase II prevention trial.

    <description>The number of children with a greater than 10% (high) risk of developing type 1 diabetes will be quantified, based on risk scores derived from SNPs that show the presence of HLA DR3, HLA DR4, and HLA DQ8 alleles as well as SNPs from HLA class I and non-HLA type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes, and from HLA class II protective alleles.</description>
