  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized
      by persistent airflow limitation. The patients are suffering dyspnea year by year, resulting
      in the decreased exercise tolerance and quality of life. Patients with COPD often have both
      inspiratory muscles and expiratory muscle dysfunction. Respiratory muscle training was one of
      the widely used pulmonary rehabilitation method in COPD patients. Respiratory muscle training
      include inspiratory training ,expiratory training and concurrent inspiratory and expiratory
      muscle training . Both of the training methods are effective. However, the effects of these
      different types of respiratory muscle training method on the respiratory physiology and
      neural respiratory drive of COPD are still unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
      to investigate the different effects of these respiratory muscle training methods on
      respiratory mechanics and central drive in COPD patients. Besides,the effect of the different
      respiratory muscle training methods was compared between patients with and without
      respiratory muscle weakness.

      The patients with COPD will participate in a rehabilitation program including inspiratory
      muscle training, expiratory muscle training and concurrent inspiratory and expiratory muscle
      training.

      The outcome measures are the classic respiratory mechanics indicators and respiratory center
      drive.
