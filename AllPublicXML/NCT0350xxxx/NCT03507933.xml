  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Villo-nodular synovitis can affect the joints, bursae or tendon sheaths. This condition is
      rare, with 1.8 cases per million inhabitants. The hip is affected in 3.6 to 18.1% of cases.
      The age of predilection is between 30 and 50 years old and this condition is rarely described
      in children.

      Two articles report a case of villous-nodular synovitis of the child's hip. Surgical
      treatment by resection seems to be consensus but various adjuvant treatments are also
      proposed. A case of villous-nodular synovitis of the hip in children was treated without
      surgical intervention. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
      surgical treatment of villous nodular synovitis of the hip in children.
