    <textblock>
      This is to evaluate the satisfaction of patient and physician about short-distance,
      medium-distance, long-distance postoperative vision and eyeglass dependence, glare, and
      visual acuity after insertion of the TECNIS® Symfony or TECNIS® Symfony Toric intraocular
      lens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients underwent uneventful phacoemulsification and implantation of TecnisSymfony®.
      Mean absolute error (MAE) at 1 month was compared in SRK/T, Holladay2, Haigis, Hoffer Q,
      Barrett Universal II, and Hill-RBF formula. At postoperative 1, 4, and 12 weeks, logMAR
      visual acuity (logMARVA) at the distance (5m), intermediate (66cm), and near (40cm), and
      spherical equivalent (SE) in manifested refraction (MR) and automated refraction (AR) were
      measured. Wavefront aberration, contrast sensitivity test, and glare test were done at 12
      weeks. The questionnaire was used to investigate glare, glasses dependency, and patient
      satisfaction at 12 weeks.
