      The overall aim of the study is to assess the effect of Cerebrolysin on physical and mental
      development of preterm infants by Denver Scale II at different ages of 5, 7 and 12 months

      There is an inverse relationship between birth weight or gestational age and risk for
      developmental impairment, with increasing incidence as birth weight or gestational age
      decreases.

      Serious impairment, defined as problems in body function or structure which may be temporary
      or permanent, is generally a more stable condition and typically leads to a disability
      requiring rehabilitation. Mild impairment is a more reversible condition amenable to early
      intervention. Studies that have followed extremely preterm and extremely low birth weight
      infants into school age and early adulthood have shown higher rates of motor, cognitive or
      behavioral impairments as compared with infants born at term. The neurologic consequences of
      extreme prematurity range from mild behavioral and cognitive defects to severe disability.
      Perinatal neuroprotection aims to reduce these outcomes.

      Cerebrolysin is a porcine brain-derived peptide preparation that acts like endogenous
      neurotrophic factors. It is produced by a standardized enzymatic breakdown of lipid-free
      brain protein powder and consists of low molecular weight peptides and free amino acids.

      The pharmacodynamic effects of Cerebrolysin can be categorized in terms of neuronal survival
      (e.g. trophic and survival promoting actions), neuroprotection (e.g. limiting neuronal
      dysfunction, especially in adverse conditions), neuroplasticity (e.g. adaptive responses to
      changing conditions) and neurogenesis (e.g. promoting differentiation of progenitor cells).
      We aim to assess the effect of Cerebrolysin on physical and mental development of preterm
      infants at different ages of life at 5, 7 and 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  High risk preterm infants born with gestational age less than 32 weeks and have a
             corrected postnatal age of 5 months at time of enrollment. Included preterm infants
             should have one or more of the following risk factors which may affect their
             neurodevelopmental outcome.

               1. Infants diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia requiring oxygen therapy more
                  than 30% FIO2 at 36 weeks corrected gestational age.

               2. Infants with culture proven early or late onset neonatal sepsis with or without
                  neonatal meningitis.

               3. Infants diagnosed to have peri- ventricular leukomalacia diagnosed by brain
                  imaging.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with persistent uncontrolled fits (all possible reasons for these uncontrolled
             seizures, including non-epileptic seizures, pseudo intractability, and medically
             refractory epilepsy.

          2. Patient with brain malformation.
