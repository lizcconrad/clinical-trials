  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential improvement in colonoscopy procedure's
      outcomes when using the Pure-Vu System in hospitalized patients who are indicated for
      colonoscopy procedure.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, prospective, single arm study will include up to 100 patients (20-40
      patients per site), aimed at evaluating the performance of the Pure-Vu System in cleansing
      hospitalized patients' colon who are indicated for standard colonoscopy procedure.

      Subjects will be enrolled at up to 4 clinical sites in the United States and Europe. Subjects
      who meet the eligibility criteria will be prescribed a standard bowel preparation bowel
      preparation regimen including diet restrictions and 4 liters of Golytly in spilt dose.

      Following the bowel preparation, the patient will undergo colonoscopy with the Pure-Vu
      system.

      In case of inadequate bowel preparation, as per the nurse report and / or BBPS &lt; 2, in at
      least one of the colon segments, prior Pure-Vu use, the physician will complete a
      questionnaire on the patient's management standard of care assuming the absence of Pure-Vu.

      Follow-up will be conducted at 48 hours (± 48 hours) post procedure.

    <time_frame>up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of adequate cleansing level in each colon segment before and after use of Pure-Vu will be evaluated using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Segment score of 0-3 given to each of the 3 segments of the colon (Left side, Transverse and right side).
BBPS* scores will be rated by the colonoscopies, on the basis of three segment scores summed for maximum score of 9, where:
0 = unprepared 9 = completely clean (in completed to Cecum procedures) An adequate cleansing procedure will be considered when all the colon segments will be graded as 2 or above.</description>

    <description>The Pure-Vu System is FDA cleared device and CE marking received in February 2018, intended to connect to standard colonoscopes to help facilitate intra-procedural cleaning of a poorly prepared colon by irrigating or cleaning the colon and evacuating the irrigation fluid (water), feces and other bodily fluids and matter, e.g. blood.</description>
