      This is a phase 1, First-In-Human, open label study, trialing a new PARP inhibitor medication
      IMP4297 in participants with advanced solid tumour.

      Six different dosage cohorts 2mg, 6mg, 10mg, 20mg, 30mg and 40mg will be used to establish
      the maximum tolerated dosage. First participant in each dosing cohort will be administered
      one dose of IMP4297 capsule, followed by a wash out period of at least 5 half-lives or 7
      days. Safety information such as pathology result or adverse events experienced will be
      collected following first dosing. This will be reviewed by the a safety review committee that
      is made up of the Principal Investigator, Medical Monitor, the study Sponsor and a
      representative from the Clinical Research Organisation, which will collectively determine if
      it is safe to proceed to continue with the next scheduled dosing cohort. Participant will
      proceed with repeat once daily dose at the same dose level for 3 weeks. Each repeat dose
      treatment cycle will be composed of 3 weeks (Day 1 to Day 21). IMP4297 will be administered
      by participants at home. Participants will be instructed to bring unused IMP4297 capsules
      with them to each visit for trial staff to review and confirm amount of IMP4297capsules taken
      since the last visit. The administration of the IMP4297 capsules will be recorded. Study drug
      compliance will be assessed using these records in conjunction with a count of unused IMP4297
      capsules. Participants who are benefiting from IMP4297 may have the possibility of treatment
      beyond 1 year at the investigator's discretion. Participants who experience disease
      progression or unacceptable side effects, are not compliant with study protocol or in the
      opinion of the investigator will have IMP4297 administration discontinued and study
      participation will be terminated.
