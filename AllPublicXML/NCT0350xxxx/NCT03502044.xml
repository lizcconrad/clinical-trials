    <textblock>
      Placebo controlled trial study of efficacy of Kinetic Oscillation Stimulation (KOS) in nasal
      cavity will be conducted in patients with myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
      (ME/CFS). The outcome of the treatment will be assessed with clinical evaluation of patients,
      cognitive tests, structural and functional MRI of the brain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a neurologic disease that is
      characterized by extreme physical and mental fatigue. Although some signs of inflammation
      have been reported previously in ME/CFS patients, the data have been quite limited and
      controversial. A recent study based on multiplex array of a Luminex system has demonstrated
      an immune signature of serum cytokines that is correlated with the disease severity and
      fatigue duration. Results from resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) studies have also
      demonstrated that there is a significant correlation between the degree of chronic fatigue
      and reduction of functional network connectivity in the brain.

      The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the regulation of systemic
      inflammation. The nasal cavity has a rich innervation of cranial nerves. We have recently
      developed a non-invasive ANS stimulation technique, called Kinetic Oscillation Stimulation
      (KOS) in the nasal cavity. KOS treatment is expected to have a positive impact on systemic
      inflammation via the restoration of ANS homeostasis.

      With this double blinded, placebo controlled, clinical trial, the efficacy of KOS treatment
      on ME/CFS will be assessed by clinical evaluation, multiplex immunoassay of peripheral blood
      samples, performance of psychomotor vigilance task, structural and functional MRI of the
      brains at the baseline point before KOS treatment and after the completion of KOS treatment
      period.
