  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower respiratory infections, or pneumonia, remain the third leading cause of death
      worldwide, despite progress in vaccinating at-risk populations and improved resuscitation
      techniques.

      Research shows that immune defences are weakened during severe infections. This immune
      weakening could alter resistance to bacterial infection and facilitate death, but also
      facilitate the onset of secondary infections.

      Through this study, investigators wish to evaluate a biomedical test (derived from a blood
      sample - Quantiferon Monitor test), aimed at measuring the immune response of certain immune
      cells (lymphocytes).

      The objective of the study is to determine whether this test can predict the occurrence of
      death during pneumonia.

      If this hypothesis is verified, it would make it possible to use this test as a marker to
      identify patients at risk of death, and would open up new therapeutic prospects in order to
      provide patients with severe pneumonia with a treatment that stimulates their immune
      defences.
