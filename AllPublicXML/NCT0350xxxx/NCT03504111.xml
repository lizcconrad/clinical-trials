  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic tendinopathy is often very difficult to treat and causes many patients who suffer
      from it to have significant pain and loss of function leading to disability. Ultrasound has
      been shown to be very effective in aiding in the diagnosis of soft tissue disorders including
      tendinopathy and can help to rule in or out other potential causes that may be confounders.
      Numerous methods have been tried to treat tendinopathy including rest, NSAIDs, bracing,
      physical therapy, extracorporal shock wave therapy, anesthetic injections, steroid
      injections, prolotherapy, nitro patches, surgery and more recently platelet rich plasma, all
      of which have had conflicting results in the literature. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is an
      autologous blood product that contains a high concentration of platelet-derived growth
      factors that have the potential to enhance healing. In a study by Mishra et al, common
      extensor tenindosis showed improved pain symptoms (71% vs 55% at 24 weeks) with tenontomy
      combined with PRP compared to percutaneous needle tenontomy alone. Current studies show
      conflicting results as to whether PRP improves chronic tendinopathy when compared to steroid
      injections, and many do not have any control group or comparison group. Percutaneous needle
      tenotomy is the use of a large gauge needle (18 gauge), which may be performed under
      ultrasound guidance, to fenestrate repeatedly the area of tendinopathy within a tendon in
      order to disrupt tendinopathic tissue and to induce bleeding and clot formation with release
      of growth factors. To date there are no published studies comparing percutaneous needle
      tenotomy (PNT) alone vs. PRP without concomitant tenotomy. Current literature suggests that
      needle tenotomy may be superior but no head to head studies are currently found in the
      literature. Most of the published literature of non-operative treatment of tendinosis does
      not yield clearly designed trials with clear selection criteria. Current literature also
      lacks studies with significant number of patients that meet both clinical and ultrasound
      criteria thus previous studies lack sufficient power. The PRINT TRIAL: may enhance the
      understanding of a superior treatment if it exists.

      Hypothesis: In active adults with chronic tendinopathy who have failed to respond to standard
      of care treatment, the use of ultrasound guided percutaneous needle tenotomy (PNT) alone is
      superior to PRP without concomitant tenotomy.

      The objective of our study is to determine if percutaneous needle tenontomy is superior to
      platelet rich plasma for the treatment of chronic tendinosis. Diagnosis of tendinosis will be
      confirmed utilizing ultrasound diagnostic criteria similar to past published studies. The
      study will be a prospective single blinded study utilizing sham phlebotomy, which currently
      is not found in the published literature. All interventions will be done ultrasound-guided
      which no studies in the published literature have done prospectively. The main variables of
      interest include patient outcomes such as improved function, objective clinical improvement
      as seen on serial ultrasound surveillance and patient reported utility. Secondary outcomes
      include: determine patient's ability to return to sport or activity and level of activity
      able to achieve using validated questionnaires. Lastly, compliance with survival curve data
      will also be evaluated.

Ultrasound guided PNT with approximately 25 passes through the tendon and enthesis with approximately an 18 gauge needle with adequate amount of anesthetic (lidocaine) for effective anesthesia. Investigators will keep track of the number of passes through the tendon. Investigators will keep track of the amount and type of anesthetic used</description>

    <description>1 group will be assigned to the PRP arm. Investigators will have a trained provider draw the blood, and prepare the PRP according to manufacturer and departmental (KP) protocol. Ultrasound guided injection of this PRP using approximately an 18 gauge needle with a single pass through the tendon into affected area as demonstrated on ultrasound. Adequate amount of anesthetic will be given in a separate syringe with adequate amount of anesthetic (lidocaine) for effective anesthesia. Investigators will keep track of amount and type of anesthetic used. The amount of anesthesia will be the same in both arms of the study</description>
