  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common chronic autoimmune disease associated with cell-mediated
      immunological dysfunction. Symptomatic OLP is painful and complete healing is rare. Current
      treatments for lichen planus and lichenoid mucositis are usually directed towards reducing
      the symptoms.

      This double-blinded cross-over placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to measure the
      effectiveness of NSAID on reducing pain associated with Oral Lichen Planus and Oral Lichenoid
      Lesions.

      Potential subjects will be screened through the Oral Medicine clinic registry at the
      University of Washington. The topical suspension of topical NSAID 100 mg per 5 ml
      concentration ibuprofen with the same ingredients of over the counter children's ibuprofen
      will be compound will be compounded by a drug service. Another placebo suspension will also
      be compounded with the same taste but without the active ingredient. After obtaining written
      consent from the patients regarding their participation in the research, subjects will
      receive a research packet with relevant data forms, the consent form two bottles; each bottle
      with an individual code number. One will have the active ingredient and the other will be the
      placebo. The coding list will be with one of the committee members.

      Subjects will be asked to record their baseline of spontaneous pain on a horizontal 10 cm,
      visual analog scale (VAS) before commencing using use of the provided rinses. If subjects
      were already on an active treatment at the time of enrollment, they will be asked to
      discontinue for 7 days for a washout period before starting the research study.

      All subjects will be instructed to use the first suspension 4 times a day for 7 days. After
      every application of the rinse, they will be asked to check a box to record the use of the
      rinse. Instructions will include to rinse with 5ml of the suspension for 1 minute without
      swallowing, then expectorate. Patients will be instructed to not to eat or drink for the
      following 20 minutes after the application of the drug. At the end of day 4 and day 7,
      subjects will be asked to record their spontaneous pain level on a 0-10 VAS. After the first
      week, the subject will discontinue any treatment for 7 days (wash-out) before starting the
      second suspension.

      All participants will be instructed to use the second suspension 4 times a day for 7 days.
      After every application of the rinse, they will be asked to check a box to record the use of
      the rinse. Instructions will include to rinse with 5ml of the suspension for 1 minute without
      swallowing, then expectorate. Patients will be instructed to not to eat or drink for the
      following 20 minutes after the application of the drug. Before using the second rinse and at
      the end of day 4 and day 7 of the third week, subjects will be asked to record their
      spontaneous pain level on a 0-10 VAS.

      Participants will be contacted initially after the first day of the intervention to discuss
      any concerns or questions. Every week, reminder phone calls will be made to the subjects to
      fill out the forms from the investigator and to check for any side effects from the
      intervention.

      Both the patient and the investigator will be blinded for the content of each bottle.
