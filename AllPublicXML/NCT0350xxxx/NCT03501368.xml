  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the benefit of a drug named ceritinib
      (ZYKADIA) in patients who have progressed on prior melanoma therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ceritinib is a pill that has been approved for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While ceritinib is not currently
      FDA-approved specifically in melanoma, researchers believe ceritinib may also help keep
      melanoma cancer cells from growing and therefore potentially help patients with melanoma as
      well. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine how effective ceritinib is in patients
      with advanced melanoma.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be defined by proportion of patients who have achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined from the time of on-treatment to time of progression, censoring at last clinical follow up or if no longer followed at Moffitt, then based on date of last medical documentation of no progression. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as from the time of on-treatment to the time of death, censoring at last date known alive.</description>

    <description>Study treatment will be given in cycles. Each cycle will be 4 weeks (28 days). Post-Treatment (follow-up) Period: Participants will return to the study site between 30-40 days after the last dose of ceritinib for an end-of-treatment assessment. Additional follow-up will occur for related Adverse Events (AEs) that are not resolved by this time and related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur after the time of this visit. Participants will be followed for survival every 3 months for the first year following end of treatment, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years after end of treatment.</description>

             (RECIST) 1.1

          -  Must have at least one tumor site accessible for a biopsy

          -  Documented disease refractory to at least one PD1/PD-L1 (+/- CTLA-4) inhibitor
             treatment, or intolerance to these drugs

          -  If BRAFV600-mutant, refractory disease to at least one BRAF inhibitor and a MEK
             inhibitor (defined as progression while on treatment), or intolerance to these drugs

          -  Prior treatment-related toxicity resolved to ≤ Grade 2 or baseline

          -  Prior radiation allowed

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation and for 90 days after completion of ceritinib
             administration.
