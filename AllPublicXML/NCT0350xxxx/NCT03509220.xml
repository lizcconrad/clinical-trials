  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy, safety and tolerability of PBK-1701TC for bowel cleansing
      before colonoscopy. Half the participants will receive PBK-1701TC and while the other will
      receive standard oral preparation.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, parallel, 2-treatment, multi-center
      clinical trial. A total of 224 subjects will participate to this study and be assigned to the
      test group or the control group. The subject will administer the first dose of assigned
      investigational product in the evening prior to the scheduled colonoscopy. Subject will take
      the second dose early in the morning of the colonoscopy.
