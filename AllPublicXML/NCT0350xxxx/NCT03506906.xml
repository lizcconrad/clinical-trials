  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering chronic hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency (e.g. in chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome) benefit from home mechanical
      ventilation. These patients are complex; and the ventilator´s parameters should be set-up
      according to the underlying disease and particular characteristics. Now, given that the
      non-invasive ventilation therapy is mostly titrated while the patient is awake, problems
      arising while sleeping on the ventilator therapy would remain undetected.

      The sleep studies, such as polysomnography or polygraphy and transcutaneous carbon dioxide
      monitoring could be valuable tools to fine-tune the ventilator's settings. This could foster
      the ventilator´s effectivity and patient satisfaction, thus therapy's adherence. Nevertheless
      the sleep studies are expensive, time-consuming and not widely available.

      The aim of this study is to learn the findings of sleep studies when they are performed on
      stable patients on home mechanical ventilation as part of their routine check-ups. In this
      context, it will be assessed whether the sleep studies' findings lead to a change
      (adjustment) of the ventilator´s therapy. Moreover, this study aims to investigate whether
      the absence of sleep studies would result in missing important events that require an
      adjustment of therapy. The results of this study could provide information that lead to a
      more standardized protocol of follow-up checks of patients on home mechanical ventilation in
      a cost-effective manner.

    <description>Each case will be evaluated separately by 2 investigators. One of them will be provided with the diurnal evaluations only (as routinely); the second investigator will additionally have access to the sleep studies. Each investigator will classify the case as one of the following labels (primary outcome):
Non-invasive ventilation therapy optimization is not required (all ventilator's parameters should stay unchanged)
Optimization of non-invasive ventilation therapy is required (one or more of the ventilator's parameters should be re-set, irrespective of the magnitude)</description>
