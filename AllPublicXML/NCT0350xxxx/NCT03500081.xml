  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of MRI imaging and image fusion in radiation therapy has dramatically increased
      during the past decade. However, the existing MRI-imaging protocols, imaging software and
      pulse sequences are all optimized for diagnostic purposes. With the introduction of the
      MR-linac, there is a critical and imminent need to develop imaging protocols that build and
      adapt the existing imaging parameters within the scope of the FDA-approved software to
      acquire MRI images that have less geometric distortion and better spatial resolution.

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To evaluate and optimize advanced magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging pulse sequences for
           patients undergoing radiation treatment;

        2. To investigate the feasibility of using weekly MRI to assess anatomic and functional
           treatment responses of tumors and critical organs during radiation therapy (RT), thus
           enabling adaptive radiation therapy;

        3. To obtain imaging data and clinical data from participants, for additional research
           focused on MRI use for radiation therapy, hypothesis‐driven research protocols may
           access;

        4. To obtain MRI scans from healthy volunteers from the Department of Radiation Oncology.
           These scans will be used to optimize scanning parameters for various body sites and to
           identify appropriate positioning methods for future patient treatments.
