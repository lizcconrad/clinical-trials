    <textblock>
      MYDA-MUSIC study is a randomized, double blind (operator and analyst) study performed in San
      Filippo Neri Hospital, Roma, Italy and in Di Venere Hospital, Bari, Italy. The planned study
      duration is 12 months. The objectives are to assess the effects of heart-rate-variability
      based music on the incidence and magnitude of peri-procedural myocardial damage caused by
      coronary angioplasty in stable patients. 443 patients with chronic stable angina scheduled
      for a coronary angiography and possible ad hoc angioplasty will be randomized to receive
      music or dumb earphones.

    <intervention_name>HRV-BASED MUSIC</intervention_name>
    <description>Music is produced by Sound-of-Soul technology that translates HRV power frequency spectrum real-time into music. The intervals between the heartbeats are detected in milliseconds and then transferred into a frequency spectrum. Sound of Soul system gets wired into different band pass filters which are linked to the frequencies of the heart (i.e. low frequency and high frequency). Once the signal is detected and computed, the Sound of Soul system links it through a musical instrument digital interface (MIDI). This interface transforms ECG data into music and sounds. The audio production is performed using a virtual instrumentation technology with different music libraries. For the puropose of this study, all patients will ear the same instrument (arp). Once the instrument have been selected, the ECG gets recorded and in real-time the patient can hear a music obtained from his/her own HRV. The investigator will control the volume and the different settings of the music.</description>
