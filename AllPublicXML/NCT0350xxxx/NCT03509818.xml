    <description>For this Variable All people Will perform a exercise test on treadmill (Tecnhogym run race 1400HC; Gambettola, Italy), in this way we determinate the VO2max. Through the modifies Balke protocol. The gas Exchange data Will measured breath by breath using open circuit spirometry and specific face mask for Fitmate, Cosmed; Vmax 29C, Sensormedics machine.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cardiorespiratory Fitness Ventilatory Threshold (VT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and twelve week</time_frame>
    <description>In relation with VT Will be determine using the criteria of fan increase in both the ventilatory equivalent of oxygen (Ve/VO2) and end-tidal preassure of oxygen with no increase in the ventilatory equivalent of carbon dioxide with Tecnhogym run race 1400HC; Gambettola, Italy treadmil using the modifies Balke protocol with and specific face mask for Fitmate, Cosmed; Vmax 29C, Sensormedics machine.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and twelve week</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will measure all of the sample with Dynamic upper and lower body muscle strength endurance using the bench press and leg press machines that were using for training (Thecnogym. Italy). The 8RM value Will be measure in kilograms ans is define as the maximum strength capacity to perform eight repetitions until momentary muscular exhaustion. The protocol consist in 5 warm-up sets at 50%, 70%, and 90% of the perceived 8RM by 1 min rest period. A 2 min rest period follow the last warm-up set after which a 8RM attempt Will make at 100% - 105% of perceived 8RM. This last period is the value for maximum muscle strength.</description>
