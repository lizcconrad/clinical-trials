  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is associated with high rates of cigarette smoking and associated morbidity and
      mortality. In this study, smokers with schizophrenia will complete a baseline session and
      then randomized to varenicline (VAR) or placebo (PLA). After 1 week on medication,
      participants will complete a cigarette rating task session. Participants will then undergo a
      72-hr abstinence period in which they will come to the laboratory twice per day and receive
      high-value cash reinforcement contingent upon meeting a strict breath CO abstinence
      criterion. At each visit, they will rate withdrawal symptoms, mood and craving. At the end of
      the abstinence period, they will repeat the cigarette rating task. Participants will return
      to the lab to provide a CO sample 24 hours later, and will text the lab with videos of their
      CO samples for one week. Date and time of smoking relapse will be measured from these
      samples.
