    <description>The primary objective is to assess the overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months with lenalidomide-venetoclax and rituximab, in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, by use of an MRD driven strategy. ORR includes complete (CR) and partial remissions (PR).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;18 years

          2. Histologically confirmed (according to the WHO 2016 classification) mantle cell
             lymphoma stage I-IV

        a. Who have received at least 1 prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen, with
        documented relapse or disease progression following the last anti-MCL treatment OR b. Are
        not considered to be candidates for chemotherapy due to frailty or comorbidity 4. At least
        1 measurable site of disease (&gt;1.5 cm long axis) 5. WHO performance status 0 - 3 6. Written
        informed consent. 7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must:

          1. Understand that the study medication is expected to be teratogenic

          2. Agree to use, and be able to comply with, highly effective contraception without
             interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy
             (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug therapy,
             even if she has amenorrhoea.

          3. Highly effective contraception include:

          4. Combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation:

        i. oral ii. Intravaginal iii. Transdermal b. Progesterone-only hormonal contraception
        associated with inhibition of ovulation: i. oral ii. Injectable iii. Implantable c.
        Intrauterine device (IUD) d. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) e. Bilateral tubal
        occlusion f. Vasectomized partner g. Sexual abstinence (if refraining from heterosexual
        intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The
        reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the preferred and
        usual lifestyle of the subject).

        8. Male subjects must

        a. Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption and for
        one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of childbearing potential and
        has no contraception.

        b. Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of study
        drug therapy.

        9. All subjects must

          1. Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one week
             following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

          2. Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused study
             drug to the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1.

          1. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks

          2. Therapeutic antibodies or BTK inhibitors within 4 weeks

          3. Radioimmunotherapy within 10 weeks

          4. Major surgery within 4 weeks of inclusion in this trial. 2. Previous treatment with
             venetoclax 3. Impaired liver function: AST and ALT &gt;3.0 × the upper normal limit (ULN)
             of institution's normal range; Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN. Subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome
             may have a bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN, per discussion between the investigator and medical
             monitor. Elevated Bilirubin due to haemolytic anemia or caused by lymphoma, is not an
             exclusion criterion.

             4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1.0x 109, unless caused by bone marrow
             infiltration by lymphoma.

             5. Platelet count &lt;60 x 109, unless caused by bone marrow infiltration by lymphoma.

             6. Creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault) 7. Known CNS lymphoma. 8.
             Other active malignancy. 9. Psychiatric illness or condition which could interfere
             with the subjects' ability to understand the requirements of the study.

             10. Requirement of corticosteroid therapy at a dose &gt;10 mg prednisolone/day. 11.
             Hypersensitivity to venetoclax, lenalidomide or rituximab, or HACA against rituximab.
