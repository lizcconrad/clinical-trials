    <textblock>
      Boston Children's Hospital resources include SimulConsult which is a decision support tool
      available for use of BCH provider through the library portal. It is offered along other
      resources on that webpage (UpToDate, Micromedex, and VisualDx). See addendum 1.

      Recently, a pediatric rheumatology arm was added to the expertise of SimulConsult, guided by
      our co-PI, Dr. Robert Sundel. As this tool is being offered and used, the investigators would
      like to assess metric of performance of this tool in enhancing participant trainees knowledge
      about the work up of patients with a potential rheumatologic disorder. See also
      www.ncbi.nlm.gov/pubmed/27964737 The investigators are conducting a clinical research to
      assess improvement in the clinical performance of study participants evaluating patients with
      a potential rheumatologic disorder. The intervention involved in using a computerized
      decision support tool already available in the Boston Children's Hospital domain. The outcome
      will be comparing this performance to that of an attending physician as the gold standard. We
      will assess the study participants performance across two locations: Emergency Department and
      Rheumatology clinic. Care to patients remains unchanged, as the workup plan and care is
      provided by an attending across both domains.

      The investigators main hypothesis is that using a decision support tool will result in a
      higher agreement rate between study participants' differential diagnosis and work up plan
      compared with the gold standard (attending differential diagnosis and research plan).
