    <textblock>
      Participants had randomly divided into two equal groups. Group (A) had received a program of
      high intensity interval training 30-40 minutes three times per week for one month. The
      participant will start cycling slowly for five minute without resistance at the beginning of
      the exercise as warming up, then the active phase will last 20-30 minutes, then decrease the
      speed with no resistance at the end of the exercise as cooling down. Group (B) will receive a
      program of inspiratory muscle training by using the threshold based inspiratory muscle
      trainer for 10-15 minute daily with frequency three times per week for four weeks.

      Training Procedure for group (A):

        1. Each participant had signed a consent form after receiving a detailed explanation about
           the procedure.

        2. BMI had been measured body weight(Kg) and height (m2)

           a. BMI= body weight (Kg)/ height (m2).

        3. Resting pulse rate had been measured to the participant three successive times then the
           mean had to be taken.

        4. A blood sample had been taken by a nurse in a heparinized tube and delivered to lab
           within six hours.

        5. The participant had been asked to walk as quickly as he could in a 30-meter pre-measured
           flat walking area with interval markings every three meters for six minutes. Cones or
           brightly colored tape to mark boundaries of the walkway with cones placed at the
           beginning and end of the 30-meter boundary to indicate turns. (Actual distance). (BALKE
           1963)

        6. Teaching the participant had been reached how to perform high interval training
           exercise.

        7. The load had been determined according to maximum heart rate obtained from
           cardiopulmonary exercise testing performed by cardiologist.

        8. high intensity (85% - 95% MHR) and the interval period (60% - 75% MHR) .(Gibala et al.
           2006)

        9. The participant's started by five minutes warming up on the bicycle ergometer with no
           resistance as shown in fig (8).

       10. Then one minute of high intensity training followed by one and half minute of low
           intensity training for 20 to 30 minutes.

       11. Finally, a five minutes of cooling down with no resistance had performed.

       12. Post treatment evaluation had been done using step three, four and step five.

      Training Procedure for group (B):

        1. Each participant had signed a consent form after receiving a detailed explanation about
           the procedure.

        2. BMI had been measured body weight(Kg) and height (m2)

           a. BMI= body weight (Kg)/ height (m2).

        3. Resting pulse rate had been measured to the participant three successive times then the
           mean had to be taken.

        4. A blood sample had been taken by a nurse in a heparinized tube and delivered to lab
           within six hours.

        5. The participant had been asked to walk as quickly as he could in a 30-meter pre-measured
           flat walking area with interval markings every three meters for six minutes. Cones or
           brightly colored tape to mark boundaries of the walkway with cones placed at the
           beginning and end of the 30-meter boundary to indicate turns. (Actual distance). (BALKE
           1963)

        6. Teaching the participant had been teached how to use the threshold based Inspiratory
           muscle trainer device.

        7. The load had been determined according to 10 maximum repetitions (10RMax).

        8. The intensity had been 60% to 80% of the participant's maximal effort.(Enright &amp;
           Unnithan 2011)

        9. The Inspiratory Muscle Trainer had been applied for (10 to 15) minutes once daily with
           frequency three times per week for four weeks as shown in fig (9).

       10. Post treatment evaluation had been done using step three, four and step five.

    <description>Threshold based trainer is a small handled device.It includes a mouthpiece and a calibrated spring loaded valve. The valve control a constant inspiratory pressure training load and the patient must generate a suffient inspiratory pressure in order for the inspiratory valve to be opened and allow the air to be inhaled. The amount of resistance can be adjusted by varying the compression of the spring-loaded valve. Adjustment from 9cmH2o to 41cmH2o.</description>
