  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine if 8 weeks of ketogenic (KD, high-fat) diet vs.
      standard diet (SD) significantly improves motor and sensory function, gut function, and
      functional independence in patients with complete SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing need for innovative therapies for improving neuro-recovery following
      spinal cord injury (SCI). Despite extensive research, clinical advancements, and improved
      rehabilitation strategies, SCI continues to be a significant cause of disability and
      mortality. Recent evidence shows that the diet-based therapies, such as ketogenic diet (KD)
      offer effective neuro-protection against secondary injury cascades in a rat model of SCI. The
      KD is a high-fat, low carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the metabolic and biochemical
      changes seen during calorie restriction, specifically, ketosis.In this study our goal is to
      determine if 8 weeks of KD vs. SD significantly improves motor and sensory function,
      functional independence and gut microbiome composition in patients with complete SCI. 56
      individuals with SCI (C5-T12/ American Spinal Injury Impairment Scale (AIS)21, 22 who are
      starting enteral feeding will be randomly assigned to 8 weeks of KD or SD. Individuals'
      caloric targets will be set by measuring resting energy expenditure via indirect calorimetry
      prior to interventions. Patients will start solid KD or SD when they are able to swallow.
      Blood ketones, motor and sensory recovery (via American Spinal Injury Association Impairment
      Scale [REF]), and functional independence (via Spinal Cord Independence Measure) scores will
      be measured before, after 4 and 8 weeks of KD vs. SD.

    <description>The ASIA Motor Index Score will be used for measuring motor function. This index uses standard manual muscle testing on a six grade scale. The total possible score from upper and lower extremity is 50. For the sensory examination, each dermatome will be tested for both sharp (pin-prick) and light-touch sensation and will be graded on a three point scale. Numerically, the sensory scores total 116 points. Measurement of motor and sensory function will take about an hour and will be performed 3 times during the course of the study.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (within 72 hours of injury), 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Urine samples will be collected to measure nutritional ketosis. 1-2 ml of urine will be collected at each time for 8 times during the course of the study (8-18 ml/about a table spoon of urine).</description>

    <measure>Change in functional Independence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 72 hours of injury), 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) will be used for measuring functional independence. The SCIM is, at present, the only comprehensive rating scale that measures the ability of patients with SCI to perform everyday tasks according to their value for the patient. It requires no manual testing and the range of the total score is 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in gut microbiome composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 72 hours of injury), 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three stool samples will be collected to measure gut function. A plastic hat will be placed over the patient's toilet seat to collect stool. Using a provided spoon the patient will fill up the cup (provided) about half full (two table spoons). A gut microbiome analysis will be performed on collected samples to determine microbiome composition changes.</description>
