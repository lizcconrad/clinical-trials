  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial nerve paralysis is due to inflammation around the facial nerve. Current treatment for
      facial nerve paralysis is a 10 day course of oral steroids (which will reduce the
      inflammation), with electrodiagnostic testing. There have been limited studies on the use of
      intratympanic steroid injection, in addition to oral steroid, in the recovery of facial nerve
      paralysis. There are indications that the use of intratympanic injections, in addition to the
      oral steroids, will speed up the recovery rate of the facial nerve paralysis, as well as
      improve the complete recovery of the facial nerve paralysis. This study will randomize
      patients with facial nerve paralysis into two groups: 1) oral steroid only and 2) oral
      steroid plus a 3 intratympanic steroid injections spaced out over three weeks. There are a
      subset of patients that are unable to take oral steroids for medical reasons (such as
      diabetes); these patients will be placed into a third group and only receive 3 intratympanic
      steroid injections space out over three weeks. Subjects that are to receive the intratympanic
      injection will receive pre- and post-hearing exams as part of their standard of care.
      Patients will be evaluated via videorecording by two blinded investigators as well as in
      person evaluations by the unblinded treating physician.

      Subjects will be followed until complete facial nerve paralysis recovery or one year
      post-treatment, whichever comes first.

    <textblock>
      Facial nerve paralysis is due to inflammation surrounding the facial nerve. Current clinical
      practice guidelines for treatment of facial nerve paralysis recommend a 10 day course of oral
      steroids +/- oral acyclovir. Treatment should begin within 72 hours of symptom onset. In
      patients with complete facial paralysis, electrodiagnostic testing should be offered to the
      patient (1-2). In patients with 90% degeneration on electroneuronography (ENoG) testing,
      facial nerve decompression may be considered but is not a current recommendation.

      In 1973, Bryant reported on ten cases where intratympanic steroid injection was used for the
      treatment of Bell's palsy (3). All but one of these patients had complete recovery of their
      facial nerve function. The remaining patient had 75% recovery. None of these patients
      suffered complications from the injections. The next study published on intratympanic steroid
      injection for Bell's palsy was not published until 2014 (4). It was a randomized control
      trial that divided patients into standard treatment (oral steroids and acyclovir) versus
      standard treatment with intratympanic steroid injection. There was not a statistically
      significant difference between the complete recovery rate of the control group and of the
      intratympanic steroid group; however, the time to recovery was significantly shorter in the
      intratympanic steroid injection group as compared to the control group. Limitations of this
      study include small sample size and high attrition rate.

      There have not been any other studies published in the literature looking at improving facial
      nerve recovery in idiopathic facial nerve paralysis with the use of intratympanic steroid
      injections.

    <description>Injection will be up to 1cc of dexamethasone 24mg/mL. The procedure will be performed at supine position under a microscope. Local anesthesia will be achieved with topical phenol. A myringotomy will be made in the tympanic membrane. A 1 mL syringe connected to a needle will be used to slowly inject between 0.2 cc and 1.0 cc of solution through the myringotomy, with the subject's head turned 45 degrees to the opposite side. The subject will be asked to maintain positioning for at least 30 minutes and refrain from swallowing. The dose administered will vary due to subject-specific factors.</description>
