      This pilot trial studies how well a stress test works in detecting heart damage in
      premenopausal women with stage I-III breast cancer. Giving a stress test with adenosine or
      regadenoson and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging may help doctors detect heart
      damage caused by breast cancer treatments including chemotherapy and aromatase inhibitors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe decrements in left ventricular myocardial microcirculatory perfusion reserve
      in premenopausal women treated with an aromatase inhibitor for high-risk hormone
      receptor-positive breast cancer and in premenopausal women treated without an aromatase
      inhibitor for triple negative breast cancer over three to six months of in the first 24
      months on an aromatase inhibitor or after cessation of chemotherapy, respectively.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe changes between the cohorts with hormone receptor-positive and triple negative
      breast cancer in other measures of cardiovascular function as measured by myocardial rest T1
      (myocardial fibrosis burden) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured
      noninvasively with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging over three to six months.

      II. To describe the relationship of clinical and demographic variables in relation to their
      potential contribution to changes in left ventricular myocardial microcirculatory perfusion
      reserve over three to six months in both groups.

      III. To study the overall feasibility of accruing and retaining premenopausal women with
      stage I-III breast cancer in a trial using adenosine stress CMR to assess myocardial
      perfusion reserve (MPR) and other parameters of cardiovascular health.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 2 years of initiating anti-estrogen therapy or 2 years after completing chemotherapy,
      participants undergo a stress test which consists of receiving adenosine intravenously (IV)
      over 1-5 minutes or regadenoson IV over 2 minutes and then undergoing CMR imaging over 45-60
      minutes at baseline and then 3-6 months later.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 30 days.
