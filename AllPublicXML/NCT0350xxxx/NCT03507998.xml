  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, repeat dose, Phase 1 study consisting of a Dose
      Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      clinical activity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to examine the safety and determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced GI tumors that have
      relapsed or are refractory to or not considered medically suitable to receive standard of
      care treatment.

      Once the dose is identified in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will
      start. The purpose of the Dose Expansion Phase is to continue to examine the safety and
      confirm the final Phase 2 dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced GI
      tumors who meet the entry criteria.

    <description>Dose Escalation Phase: Ascending doses of CGX1321 will be administered by cohort to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Patients will receive CGX1321, once daily, orally, for 3 weeks (21 days) followed by a one week (7 day) washout period in each 28 day cycle, according to the cohort they are assigned.
Dose Expansion Phase: Patients will receive the recommended dose (identified in the Dose Expansion Phase) of CGX1321</description>
