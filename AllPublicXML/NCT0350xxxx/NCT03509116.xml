  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the experience of the dietetic consultation from the
      perspective of nutritionally vulnerable older patients receiving oral nutrition support and
      dietitians, as well as other key stakeholders involved in the process of such a consultation.

      Malnutrition is prevalent and increases the risk of health complications and socioeconomic
      burden. Patients with malnutrition are often older patients with complex needs and therefore
      may require specialist knowledge and skills to provide nutritional support. Dietitians are
      uniquely skilled to assess the multiple factors that underpin diet and to tailor nutritional
      support, which could help improve outcomes. Although the causes of malnutrition are
      complicated, its treatment typically involves oral nutritional supplements, dietary advice or
      food-based interventions, either separately or in combination.

      Effectiveness of the various oral nutritional support interventions has been studied, with
      the findings on food-based interventions suggesting more research is needed and the
      widespread research on ONS suggesting contradictory results and interpretations. Despite
      this, the factors responsible for these inconsistencies have not been identified. There are
      no studies so far that have examined the patient experience of the consultation with the
      dietitian in the context of nutritional support. Although the patient experience of
      consultations is increasingly being recognised as an important part of investigating their
      effectiveness in healthcare, to date, there are a number of limitations in this literature,
      leaving the role of the patient experience in dietetic consultations for the management of
      malnutrition, poorly understood. It's probable that this is one contributing factor to the
      variation observed in the literature.

      A review of the literature indicates a need for exploration of the patient experience and its
      possible impact on the success or failure of the dietetic encounter. This study aims to
      address some of the knowledge gaps. The use of qualitative interviews will allow an in-depth
      understanding of the experience of the dietetic consultation for the provision of nutrition
      support and will utilise an overall illuminative evaluation approach to broaden that
      understanding by considering data from various sources. Participants will include older
      patients who are considered nutritionally vulnerable, their consulting dietitians and
      patient-nominated key stakeholders. Four clinical settings within the Trust where dietitians
      would often see patients for nutritional support will be included.
