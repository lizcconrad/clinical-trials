    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the mass balance, routes of elimination and
      characterize the metabolic profiles of a single intravenous dose of [14C]-TAK-954, identify
      major circulating and excreted metabolites. This study will also determine the single-dose PK
      of total radioactivity, TAK-954 and its metabolites where possible.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. This study will assess the mass
      balance, metabolic profiles and routes of elimination of single intravenous dose of
      [14C]-TAK-954, and will determine the major circulating and excreted metabolites and
      single-dose PK of total radioactivity, TAK-954, THRX513466, and THRX 913682 in healthy male
      participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. All participants will receive a single
      dose of [14C]-TAK-954 0.5 mg on Day 1.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Netherlands. The overall time to participate in
      this study is approximately 6 to 7 weeks. Participants will make a final visit to the clinic
      15 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 18 and less than or equal
             to (&lt;=) 30 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) and a body weight greater than (&gt;) 50
             kilogram (kg) at the screening visit.

          2. Be a nonsmoker who has not used tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (example,
             nicotine patch) for at least 6 months before administration of the initial dose of
             trial drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has total 14C radioactivity measured by accelerator mass spectrometry in plasma
             (during screening) exceeding 14C/12C ratio 1.1E-12.

          2. Participated in any study with a radiation dose above 0.1 millibecquerel (MBq) or
             radiation burden above 0.1 millisievert (mSv) within 1 year before screening.

          3. Was exposed to significant radiation (example, serial x-ray or computed tomography
             scans, barium meal, current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure
             monitoring) within 12 months before check-in.

          4. Irregular defecation pattern (less than once per 2 days).

          5. Has a history of alcohol consumption exceeding 2 standard drinks per day on average (1
             glass is approximately equivalent to beer 354 milliliter [mL]/12 ounce [oz], wine 118
             mL/4 oz, or distilled spirits 29.5 mL/1 oz).

          6. Consumes excessive amounts, defined as greater than 6 servings (1 serving is
             approximately equivalent to 120 mg of caffeine) of coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks,
             or other caffeinated beverages per day.

          7. Has a substance abuse disorder.
