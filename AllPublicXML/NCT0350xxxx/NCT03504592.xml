  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will utilize MHealth technology to address the barriers providers and obstetric
      patients experience when reporting blood glucose results. Half of the participants will
      record their blood glucose values with the assistance of a smartphone device, the other half
      will continue in the traditional care method of the clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective single center randomized trial piloting the use of mHealth
      applications in an obstetric population with diabetes. Participants will be enrolled in the
      study after the diagnosis of diabetes is made in pregnancy for those with gestational
      diabetes, or for patients with preexisting diabetes they will be enrolled upon initiation of
      prenatal care. Participants will be randomized to traditional care or mHealth intervention.
      Outcomes will include completeness and accuracy of the participant glucose log, unscheduled
      health care access episodes in the pregnancy, patient satisfaction, percentage of glucose
      values at goal and percent change in Hemoglobin A1C.
