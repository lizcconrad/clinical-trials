  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genomic Health's OncotypeDX® Prostate Cancer Assay is a commercially available laboratory
      test that measures the activity of certain genes in prostate cancer. The purpose of this
      study is to better understand how the use of this test result impacts or affects treatment
      decisions for men newly diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer, their confidence in the
      treatment decision, and the effects and side effects of the treatment chosen on certain
      aspects of Quality of Life. This study will also determine what percentage of men choosing an
      active monitoring program as prescribed by their doctor remain on Active Surveillance and
      have avoided any treatment at one and two years after diagnosis after receiving the assay
      result.

    <measure>Rate of persistence on Active Surveillance at 1 and 2 years after receiving the OncotypeDX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The analysis will estimate the absolute magnitude of the rates of persistence at these two time points (1 and 2 years after receiving GPS)</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis will estimate the absolute magnitude of the rates of persistence at these two time points, and the change between the two rates. The rate of persistence, at the particular timepoint, will be calculated as the proportion of patients who remain on Active Surveillance as of the doctor visit at the time. The rate of persistence will range from 0% to 100%, with 100% indicating all evaluable patients stay on Active Surveillance at the particular timepoint, and 0% indicating no evaluable patient on Active Surveillance.</description>
