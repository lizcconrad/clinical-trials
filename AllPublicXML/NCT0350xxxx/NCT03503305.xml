  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, active controlled, single site safety and
      efficacy study in subjects suffering from chronic wrist osteoarthritis comparing a single
      ADRC injection generated with the Transpose® RT system into the wrist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to investigate the therapeutic benefit of autologous
      adipose-derived regenerative cells in patients with wrist arthritis. The hypothesis of this
      trial is that the use of adult-adipose derived regenerative cells as a treatment of wrist
      arthritis will induce healing and decrease pain compared to the control group. With
      adult-adipose derived regenerative cell administration, the medical practitioner would
      anticipate a reduction in inflammation, acceleration in healing, decreased pain in patients
      post procedure, and increased function and strength in the affected wrist. Currently, no
      clinical studies have been constructed to determine the efficacy of ADRCs in wrist arthritis
      patients.

      Subjects will fall into two categories: treatment group (20) and control group (20 subjects).
      The treatment group will undergo a small liposuction procedure and receive wrist
      osteoarthritis treatment with an ultrasound-guided injection of 5 ml adipose-derived stem
      cells (ADSCs) into the wrist. The control group will receive a 5 ml cortisone injection into
      the wrist.
