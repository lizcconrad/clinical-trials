  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinically significant improvement (50% reduction or greater) in number of headache days in a 4-week period from baseline to 4-months post-randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 4-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>An electronic headache diary will be asked to be used for 4 weeks. Each day participants will be asked to record whether or not they have experienced a headache.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Statistically significant improvement in peak headache severity in a 4-week period from baseline to 4-months post-randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 4-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>An electronic headache diary will be asked to be used for 4 weeks. On days that participants report a headache(s) in the diary, they will be asked to rate highest headache intensity for the day using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS-11). The peak headache severity will be calculated in two different ways: (1) the average of the highest headache intensity per week over the 4-week period, and (2) the number of days that participants have reported a headache episode with a NRS-11 of 8 or higher over the 4-week period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Statistically significant improvement in headache-related functional impairment from baseline to 4-months post-randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 4-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure impairment with either the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale -Pediatric version (PedMIDAS) for ages 14-18 years or the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) for ages 19-40 years. MIDAS and PedMIDAS measure headache-related functional impairment. We will use the total score, which is the sum of answers across the 6 items for PedMIDAS and the sum of answers across the 5 items for MIDAS. A higher score indicating greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Statistically significant improvement in depressive symptomatology from baseline to 4-months post-randomization.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 4-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The Centre for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D) will be used to measure depressive symptomatology. Responses will be summed to provide a total score that can range from 0 to 60; with higher scores indicating the presence of more symptoms and higher frequency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of acceptability to the treatments (i.e., PRISM and SPHERE)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) will be used to measure level of acceptability to the treatments. The total score will be used. The total score is the sum of item responses and ranges from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating higher levels of satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of acceptability to the treatments (i.e., PRISM and SPHERE)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The single-item Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale will be used to measure level of acceptability to the treatments. The PGIC is 7-point categorical scale (&quot;very much improved&quot; to &quot;very much worse&quot;) to report the perceived improvement with an intervention.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  aged 14-40 years

          -  fluent in the English language (i.e., speaking, reading and writing);

          -  suffer from headaches for a minimum of one year

          -  stable pattern of headache symptoms (e.g., headache frequency, severity, location of
             pain, symptoms associated with headache) for the past 6 months

          -  suffer from migraine headaches as indicated with a score of 2 and above on the ID
             Migraine

          -  have a Smartphone as PRISM has been designed to be accessed from a Smartphone and
             SPHERE encompasses the myWHI diary which has also been designed to be used from a
             Smartphone

          -  use the Smartphone for activities other than texting and calling (e.g., email,
             Facebook) as the programs are designed for migraineurs who are familiar with using
             Smartphones and use them in their daily life

          -  have daily Internet access from their Smartphone, because running the programs require
             an Internet connection

          -  minimum of four headache days during 4 weeks that they are asked to use an electronic
             headache diary

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  health care professional has not ruled out any underlying medical condition related to
             their headaches (e.g., head trauma, meningitis)

          -  are pregnant, planning to get pregnant (in the next 4 to 6 months), or breastfeeding,
             as hormonal changes are known to exert potent influences on migraine headaches

          -  have an impairment which compromises their ability to give informed consent

          -  having been diagnosed with psychosis and/or schizophrenia, because a past or current
             diagnosis may likely interfere with the participants ability to fully participate in
             the study

          -  have participated in our recent three-armed pilot RCT (i.e., any participant who
             consented and was randomized)

          -  they complete less than 50% of daily entries (i.e., less than 14 daily entries) in an
             electronic headache dairy when they asked to use it for 4 weeks

          -  More than 15 headache days during the 4 weeks that they are asked to use an electronic
             headache diary
