      Evaluate the long-term safety of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg taken daily at bedtime over an additional
      40 weeks in patients with PTSD who have participated in a double-blind lead-in study and
      completed an initial 12-week open-label extension study (TNX-CY-P303).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, extension trial designed to evaluate safety over 40 additional weeks
      of TNX-102 SL therapy taken daily at bedtime for the treatment of PTSD.

      The study will consist of 5 in-clinic study visits, including Baseline Visit 1 (Day 0, which
      is anticipated to be the same visit as the last visit of the 12-week open-label extension
      study TNX-CY-P303), followed by in-clinic visits after 7, 16, 28 and 40 weeks of open-label
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has completed a double-blind lead-in HONOR study and a 12-week open-label
             extension study P303 and is judged by the investigator as reasonably compliant, with
             at least 60% compliance with study medication usage (based on drug accountability).

          -  The patient has provided written informed consent to participate in this extension
             study.

          -  The patient met all prior inclusion and exclusion requirements for the double-blind
             lead-in HONOR study, or the site received medical monitor approval for the patient to
             remain in the lead-in study after the retrospective discovery of an entry violation
             that did not pose any threat to the patient's safety or well-being.

          -  During the course of the lead-in HONOR study or 12-week open-label extension P303
             study, the patient has had no intervening medical conditions including pregnancy,
             clinically significant increase in suicidal ideation (plan or intent) or significant
             worsening of depression, newly arising clinically significant abnormal laboratory
             tests, or any clinically significant, uncontrolled, or unstable medical or surgical
             condition that could affect the patient's ability to participate in the study or
             potentially compromise the patient's well-being during the study.

          -  The patient does not require treatment with a potent (strong) cytochrome P450 subtype
             3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor, or St. John's wort.

          -  The patient is willing to refrain from use of all other formulations of
             cyclobenzaprine for the duration of the study.

          -  The patient is willing to refrain from use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential continue to agree to practice one of the
             medically acceptable methods of birth control detailed in the lead-in study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There are no exclusion criteria for this study.
