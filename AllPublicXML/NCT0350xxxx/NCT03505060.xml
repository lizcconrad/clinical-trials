      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the IHV01 protein vaccine primed
      and co-administered with HIV DNA CON-S env vaccine in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive 4
      mg of DNA CON-S env at Months 0 and 1. They will receive 4 mg of DNA CON-S env and 150 mcg of
      IHV01 at Months 3 and 6. Participants in Group 2 will receive placebo at Months 0, 1, 3, and
      6.

      Study visits will occur at Day 0 (study entry), Week 2, and Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6 + 1
      week, 6.5, and 12. Visits may include physical examinations, medical history, injection of
      study product, blood and urine collection, pregnancy testing, HIV testing, risk reduction
      counseling, and questionnaires.
