  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to measure the concentration and the regional brain
      distribution of pathologic amyloid deposition using the PET tracer [C-11]PiB in participants
      in the UAB Alzheimer's Disease Center cohort. Assessment of interactions between race and
      vascular risk factors, brain amyloid levels measured with [C-11]PiB-PET, and cognitive status
      will be the primary outcome of this imaging study.

      The primary objective of this study is to measure the concentration and the regional brain
      distribution of pathologic amyloid deposition using the PET tracer [C-11]PiB in participants
      in the UAB-ADC cohort. The amount and distribution of [C-11]PiB in the brain will be
      correlated to demographic, clinical, genetic, and biospecimen data acquired through the
      separate ongoing UAB-ADC study. Assessment of interactions between race and vascular risk
      factors, brain amyloid levels measured with [C-11]PiB-PET, and cognitive status will be the
      primary outcome of this imaging study. As a secondary aim, the investigators will assess the
      ability of the early flow frames from [C-11]PiB-PET and brain volumetric measurements with
      MRI to serve as a marker of neuronal injury and to predict cognitive status in conjunction
      with the amyloid-PET results.

    <description>All participants in this study will undergo an amyloid-PET imaging using the tracer [C-11]PiB with a simultaneous PET/MRI system. The [C-11]PiB dosage is 300-670 MBq (8 - 18 mCi) given intravenously, and the PET/MRI imaging time is approximately 60 min.</description>

    <description>All study participants will undergo brain imaging with [C-11]PiB-PET/MRI. [C-11]PiB is a PET imaging agent used primarily to measure the amount of abnormal protein (called beta-amyloid) in the brain. The investigator will also use this tracer to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow.</description>
