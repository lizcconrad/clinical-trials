  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical trial to validate the MCPM (Multi-parameter Combined Physiological Signal-based
      Monitoring), in estimating autonomic nervous system activity level, at rest and while exposed
      to noxious stimuli.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MCPM system acquires physiological signals and calculates the physiological parameters.
      The relationship between these parameter forms the basis for the system mechanism of
      operation, which non-linearly combines inputs from the individual parameters into a
      measurable index (the CPAI) that represents an integrated measure of patient's physiological
      changes.

      Subjects who meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the study
      and their physiological measures, at rest and during exposure to the noxious stimuli will be
      recorded by the MCPM and the ProComp system. All subjects will be recorded according to a
      standard procedure; subjects will be lying in the supine position and will be instructed to
      avoid any movements. The experimenter will connect the sensors (MCPM finger probe, the
      ProComp device). During the experimental session, different noxious stimuli will be
      administrated via the cold pressor test, with intervals of rest between stimuli. The last
      stimuli is an exercise preformed by the subject. One week after the first visit, about half
      of the subjects will be invited to a second visit, identical study visit, to assess the
      between session test-retest reliability of the signals. Moreover, in this additional session,
      a repeated stimuli will be added.
