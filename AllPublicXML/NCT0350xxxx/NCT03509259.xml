      This study is a cross-sectional study to evaluate the relationship between coronary calcium
      score and clinical parameters of asthma such as onset of disease, lung function parameter and
      airway inflammation parameter (sputum eosinophil or FeNO) in Korean elderly asthma and
      asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) overlap patients

    <textblock>
      Subjects who visited Allergy Clinic in SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center for asthma or ACO will
      be recruited consecutively. Subjects who meets the inclusion criteria and agree to
      participate in the study will take coronary artery calcium scoring CT and asthma CT
      (inspiration and expiration images). The correlation between the degree of coronary
      calcification and airway diameter, airway wall thickness, air-trapping and emphysema will be
      evaluated as well as clinical parameters of asthma. We will also compare those correlations
      from the images of healthy control subjects who performed the coronary calcium scoring CT for
      health checkup purpose.
