      Sacroiliac joint fusion versus sham operasjon for treatment of sacroiliac pain. A prospective
      double blinded randomized controlled multicentre study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sacroiliac(SI) joint pain can lead to long-lasting severe pain and reduce physical function.
      It is shown to be the source of pain in 13-30% of patients with low back pain. Former
      surgical techniques had a high level of complications and low success rates. Newer
      mini-invasive surgical approaches have shown promising results in scientific studies. It is
      difficult to find an adequate control group for surgery as most patients already have tried
      conservative and alternative treatments without effect. A sham-designed study is the best
      alternative. This study is designed as a prospective randomized double blinded controlled
      mulitcenter trial. The investigators want to examine whether there is a difference in SI
      joint pain in patients operated with miniinvasive arthrodesis of the SI joint compared to a
      sham operated control group. Patients with SI joint pain are included. They will be
      randomized to either surgery with arthrodesis or sham surgery. Neither patient nor health
      personell who work with the patient after the surgery will know what has been done. The
      primary end point for the study is sacroiliac joint pain on the operated side after 6 months.

    <description>The intervention Group receives operation with SI-joint arthrodesis with the iFuse implant. The patient undergoes full anesthesia. The procedure starts with an approximately 5cm long skin incision over the posterolateral aspect of the pelvis. A guide-pin is inserted over the sacroiliac joint at the desired entry-point, verified by fluoroscopy. The surgeons drills and boraches over the pin and the ifuse implant is inserted. This is repeated for a total of three implants. The wound is closed with non-resorbable suture. An injection of the SIJ with Marcaine is performed under guidance of fluoroscopy after closure.</description>

    <description>The sham operation will consist of the surgeon making the same skin incision as for an iFuse procedure, although nothing more, and then closing the wound.
The patients undergoing a sham operation will be under general anesthesia for a random time of 20-40minutes in order to keep the two procedures as similar as possible.
An injection of the SIJ with Marcain is performed under guidance of fluorscopy after closure.</description>

        and randomized to SIJ fusion or sham surgery in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe low back pain due to other causes, such as lumbar disc degeneration, lumbar
             disc herniation, lumbar spondylolisthesis, lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar facet
             degeneration, and lumbar vertebral body fracture.

          2. Sacroiliac pathology caused by auto-immune disease (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis)
             and/or neoplasia (e.g. benign or malignant tumor) and/or crystal arthropathy

          3. History of recent (&lt;1 year) fracture of the pelvis with documented malunion, non-union
             of sacrum or ilium or any type of internal fixation of the pelvic ring.

          4. Spine surgery during the past 12 months.

          5. Previously diagnosed or suspected osteoporosis (defined as prior T-score &lt;-2.5 or
             history of osteoporotic fracture)

          6. Documented osteomalacia or other metabolic bone disease

          7. Any condition or anatomy that makes treatment with the iFuse Implant System infeasible

          8. Patients with prior successful fusion to the contra lateral side are exluded from the
             study.
