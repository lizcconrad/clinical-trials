      Prospective, baseline-controlled evaluation of the UltraShape Power device for non-invasive
      fat reduction in flanks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will receive 3 bi-weekly treatments (2 weeks interval) with the UltraShape
      Power device according to the study protocol.

      One random flank will be treated with one pass or remained as a control (no treatment) while
      the second flank will be treated with multiple passes.

      Subjects will return for up to 4 follow up visits: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and (optional)
      24 weeks following end of treatment/s.

      Each subject will be enrolled for total expected study duration of up to 28 weeks.

      After last follow up visit, subjects who wish will receive compensation treatments (up to 3)
      on the flank who received regular treatment (single pass) or remained as a control (no
      treatment).

    <description>UltraShape Power is a non-invasive focused ultrasound device, approved by the FDA (160896K;170370K); CE; Israeli Ministry of Health. The UltraShape Power system works by emitting acoustic waves of focused ultrasonic energy (200 ± 30 KHz frequency) that converge into a confined focal volume underneath the skin, thereby, targeting only subcutaneous fat at a controlled depth. Unlike traditional ultrasound technology, UltraShape Power's energy transmits pulsed ultrasound, allowing control over temperature elevation. The system comprised of two main parts:

         11. Very poor skin quality (i.e., severe laxity)

         12. Abdominal wall diastasis or hernia on physical examination
