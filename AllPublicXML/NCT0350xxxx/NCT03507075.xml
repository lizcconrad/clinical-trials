  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Directly reinforcing abstinence from alcohol with monetary incentives is an effective
      treatment for alcohol dependence, but barriers in obtaining frequent, verified biochemical
      measures of abstinence limit the dissemination of this treatment approach. The goal of this
      feasibility study is to determine if using technological advancements to remotely,
      accurately, and securely monitor alcohol use with a newly developed breathalyzer is an
      effective treatment that is acceptable to participants. If validated, this treatment approach
      has the potential to facilitate the dissemination of an effective, evidence-based treatment
      for alcohol dependence to a broader population whose treatment needs are not currently being
      adequately met.
