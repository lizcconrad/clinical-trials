  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to explore two marketed devices providing a multimarker monitoring including
      physical activity under real-life conditions in patients with heart failure with preserved
      ejection fraction (HFpEF) and with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). It
      aims to identify potential new endpoints for future HFpEF trials by exploring clinically
      relevant changes over time and correlations/associations with conventional endpoints such as
      the six minute walking distance (6MWD), biomarkers and clinical events. Furthermore, it aims
      to address the challenges and feasibility of implementing device based measurements under
      real-life conditions.
