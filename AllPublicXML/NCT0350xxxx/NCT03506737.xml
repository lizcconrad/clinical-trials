      Objective: To evaluate the effects of an early-based cardiac rehabilitation program on the
      functional capacity, inspiratory muscular strength and clinical outcomes in hospitalized
      heart failure patients before and after heart transplantation. Method: 30 hospitalized heart
      failure patients awaiting cardiac transplantation will be selected and randomized in 2
      groups: conventional group (n = 15) - conventional exercise protocol: breathing exercises and
      global active exercises of upper and lower limbs in the sitting position; and Intervention
      group (n = 15) - cycle ergometer exercise protocol: each session consists of cycling on a
      stationary bicycle in the seated position for 20 minutes. In both groups, the exercise
      protocols will be applied twice a day until the hospital discharge, always supervised by a
      physiotherapist and a doctor. The evaluation procedures in all patients of the research will
      be: functional capacity measured by the 6 minute walk test and inspiratory muscle strength
      measured by manovacuometry. Evaluations will be repeated in 3 distinct moments: after 24h of
      hospital admission and/or clinical stabilization; before transplantation and after
      transplantation in hospital discharge.
