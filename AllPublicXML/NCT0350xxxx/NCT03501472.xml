  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pictorial cigarette warning labels (PWLs) are thought to increase risk knowledge, but
      experimental research has not examined PWLs' longer term effects on memory for health risks,
      or for numeric risks (e.g., percentage risk for developing lung cancer). This trial tests
      memory for numeric health risks immediately or after a six-week delay for US adult smokers.
      In addition, the trial tests the effects of different warning label components (e.g., whether
      the numeric risks are percentage or frequency), participants' level of numeric ability, and
      the consequences of memory for numeric risks on participant risk perceptions and quit
      intentions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>numeric risk recognition</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately following last exposure or after 6-week delay</time_frame>
    <description>Participants answered one multiple choice question about the numeric risk for smokers and nonsmokers (combined in one question) for each of the 8 outcomes that had been paired with the PWLs. For each question, there were four decoy responses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>smoking risk perceptions</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately following last exposure or after 6-week delay</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed several scale items about how much risk they perceived smoking posed to them (e.g., &quot;Compared to the average nonsmoker your age, gender, and race, how would you rate your chances of&quot;: 1) &quot;getting a life threatening illness because of smoking,&quot; 2) &quot;getting lung cancer,&quot; and 3) &quot;dying at a younger age than average&quot; (-3 = Much lower, +3 = Much higher))
They also gave verbal likelihood ratings for each of the 8 outcomes of smoking that had been paired with the labels (e.g., &quot;Thinking of risks that you were shown in the warnings, what is the likelihood of a smoker [non−smoker] dying from heart disease?,&quot; 0=impossible, 11=certain)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
