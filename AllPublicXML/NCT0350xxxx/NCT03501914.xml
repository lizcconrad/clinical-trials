  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pre-post intervention study to investigate the acceptability and
      feasibility of a mindfulness based program for people with intellectual disabilities and
      their caregivers in a low income setting in Pakistan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Pakistan, prevalence of intellectual disability is 19.1/1000 severe intellectual
      disability and 65/1000 for mild level of intellectual disability. Disability not only affects
      the individual but also the family in general and caretaker specifically.

      Several researches proved that parents of children with disabilities experience number of
      problems related to parenting stress. There is a dire need to develop feasible,
      cost-effective, community level interventions, that would augment existing healthcare
      systems.

      Mindfulness as a relatively new therapeutic strategy, has not been practiced as far as
      individuals with intellectual disability are concerned. This study aims to explore the
      feasibility and acceptability of mindfulness-based strategies for individuals with
      intellectual disability and their care takers in improving their well-being. A sample of 12
      participants will be recruited from rehabilitation centers. The study will be conducted in
      Karachi. The group intervention will consist of twelve sessions; approx. 90-minutes per
      session weekly. therapy logswill be used to measure feasibility and acceptability of the
      intervention and the full Psychological Therapies Outcome Scale - intellectual disabilities
      (PTOS)-ID (psychological distress and positive well-being scales) will be used as secondary
      outcome measure. In addition, the positive well-being section of the PTOS-ID will also be
      administered at session 3 and 6 as an interim measure of well-being.

      Baseline assessment will be done following the consent. Post assessments will be conducted at
      the end of intervention (at 3 months).

    <description>PTOS-D will be used to assess psychological distress and positive well being of the participants and caregivers. it is a 29 item scale with 16 questions (Measuring Psychological Distress: higher score indicates higher psychological distress) and 11 questions measuring positive well-being: higher scores indicates higher positive well-being. The other two questions: Q-12 and Q-13 does not contribute to the indexes.</description>
