      Multicenter, open-label study of various ASTX727 LD doses and schedules to assess safety,
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and hematologic response in subjects with IPSS risk
      category of low-risk or Intermediate-1 MDS. In Phase 1 Stage A, subjects will be randomized

      when safety is established in Stage A, 24 evaluable subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1
      ratio in Phase 1 Stage B into 4 cohorts of 6 subjects each in a 14-day schedule in 28-day
      cycles. In Phase 2, 40 new subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 doses/schedules

      A Phase 1-2, multicenter, open-label study of various ASTX727 LD doses and schedules to
      assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and hematologic response in
      subjects with IPSS risk category of low-risk or Intermediate-1 MDS. The study will be
      conducted in 2 phases: Phase 1 Stages A and B, and Phase 2. Randomization will be stratified
      by diagnostic category (low-risk vs Intermediate-1 based on IPSS), baseline absolute
      neutrophil count (ANC) (≤10^9/L vs &gt;10^9/L), and ECOG Performance Score (0-1 vs 2).

      Phase 1: In Stage A, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 cohorts of 6
      subjects each in a 10-day schedule in 28-day cycles. When safety has been established in
      Phase 1 Stage A, Phase 1 Stage B will open, wherein additional subjects (n=24 evaluable) will
      be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into 4 cohorts of 6 subjects each in a 14-day schedule in
      28-day cycles.

      Dose Levels by Cohort (Dailyx5, Offx2, Dailyx5):

        -  1: 5 mg decitabine, 100 mg cedazuridine

        -  2: 10 mg decitabine, 100 mg cedazuridine

        -  3: 15 mg decitabine, 100 mg cedazuridine

      Phase 2: Using 2 doses/schedules selected from Phase 1, 40 additional subjects per
      dose/schedule will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The selected doses/schedules will be
      evaluated for safety (drug-related AEs), efficacy (including hematologic response), PD
      (LINE-1 methylation, and fetal hemoglobin as fraction of total hemoglobin), and PK.

                  aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) and alanine
                  aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤5 × ULN.

               2. Renal: serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN or calculated creatinine clearance or
                  glomerular filtration rate ≥50 mL/min.

          5. Women of child-bearing potential (according to recommendations of the Clinical Trial
             Facilitation Group [CTFG]) must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and must have a
             negative pregnancy test at screening.

          6. Subjects and their partners with reproductive potential must agree to use 2 highly
             effective contraceptive measures during the study and must agree not to become
             pregnant or father a child for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with any investigational drug or therapy within 2 weeks before study
             treatment, or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before the first dose of study
             treatment, or ongoing clinically significant AEs from previous treatment.

          2. Treatments for MDS, including erythropoietins, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs),
             thrombopoietins, chemotherapy, and immunosuppression including calcineurin inhibitors,

          6. Life-threatening illness, medical condition or organ system dysfunction, or other
             reasons including laboratory abnormalities, which, in the investigator's opinion,
             could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of
             ASTX727 LD, or compromise the integrity of the study outcomes.

          7. Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin
