  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will investigate whether reduction in ambient light and elimination of noise
      during induction and emergence from anesthesia influences the response time of the anesthesia
      provider to auditory and visual alarms when compared to a standard operating room. In
      addition, the investigators will assess the cumulative level of noise exposure that providers
      experience during the perioperative period.
