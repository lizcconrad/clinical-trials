  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to characterize the influence of a ketogenic diet and intermittent
      therapeutical fasting on the course of the disease, as measured by T2-hyperintense cerebral
      lesions with magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) in patients with multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
      The investigators expect in both intervention groups fewer cerebral T2 lesions occurring
      after 18 months in comparison to the control group and as detectable by MRT. According to
      current recommendations of the German Society of Nutrition (DGE), the control group receives
      a vegetarian-focused, anti-inflammatory diet.
