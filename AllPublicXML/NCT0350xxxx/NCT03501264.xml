    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of a
      game-based intervention is able to increase help-seeking-related knowledge, attitudes, and
      behaviors, reduce health risk factors/behaviors, and increase resiliencies among sexual and
      gender minority (SGM) youth. The goals of the proposed study are to: (1) Test the feasibility
      and acceptability of a game-based intervention to increase help-seeking-related knowledge,
      attitudes, and behaviors among SGM youth; and (2) Using a randomized controlled trial, test
      the efficacy of a game-based intervention to increase help-seeking-related knowledge,
      attitudes, and behaviors, reduce health risk factors/behaviors, and increase resiliencies
      among SGM youth.

    <description>A measure of help-seeking intentions for emotional/mental distress from different sources of help. Options range from 1= never, 2=rarely, 3=occasionally, 4=a moderate amount, 5=a great deal. Total scale is out of 105 with higher scores indicating greater health seeking intentions. Questions were asked about: parents/guardians, relatives/family member, teacher, friend, mental health professional, nurse or doctor, and phone/chat line. Mean scores will be calculated at baseline and 1-month post intervention. These scores will then be compared to determine change over the intervention period.</description>
