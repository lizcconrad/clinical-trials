  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to gain important knowledge on the pathogenesis and prognostic
      factors in severe invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, as well as the effects of
      individual characteristics of both the pathogen and the patient on disease severity. The aim
      is to recruit a minimum of 60 patients from Tampere and Turku University Hospitals in 2-3
      years to gather a suitably wide spectrum of manifestations of the disease, and gather
      genetic, transcriptomic and diagnostic data on both the patients and pathogens in an effort
      to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of severe invasive GAS disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infection is a severe, life threatening disease. New
      prognostic markers are needed to better identify patients at risk of severe complications to
      better improve their care. By advancing understanding of the mechanisms of severe disease,
      treatments may be found to hinder the processes behind them. It is likely that different
      individuals react differently to the same microbe.

      From previous incidence data the investigators have estimated that it will be possible to
      recruit a minimum of 60 patients over the course of 2-3 years from Tampere and Turku
      University Hospitals. This sample size should contain a reasonably wide array of infections
      with varying stages of severity. The investigators will then gather genetic and
      transcriptomic data on these patients at three time points, as well as salival samples for
      antibody analysis, and throat cultures to screen for carriage of the pathogen in question.
      The genome of all the GAS strains obtained from the patients will also be sequenced. From
      this the investigators hope to derive information pertaining to the interplay of the patients
      immunologic response and the pathogens inherent characteristics.

        A minimum of 60 patients from Tampere and Turku University Hospitals who contract invasive
        group A streptococcal disease within our recruitment period. The size of the study
        population has been difficult to calculate exactly, but the investigators have gauged the
        size according to previous epidemiological data to have a population that has a wide
        variety of disease courses to get a good understanding of the pathogenesis, and that can be
        recruited within 2-3 years.
