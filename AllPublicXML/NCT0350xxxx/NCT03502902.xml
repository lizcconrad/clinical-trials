      A Phase I, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Single Oral Dose, Safety, Tolerability, and
      Pharmacokinetic Study, Incorporating an Evaluation of the Effect of Food on the
      Pharmacokinetics of HEC68498 in Healthy Male and Female Subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-dose, sequential-group design incorporating a food-effect evaluation. Each subject
      will participate in 1 treatment period, except for Group 5, where each subject will
      participate in 2 treatment periods. In each group, 6 subjects will receive HEC68498 and 2
      subjects will receive placebo. Subjects in Group 5 will receive the same dose level of
      HEC68498 (or placebo) in both treatment periods. All doses will be administered either after
      an overnight fast of at least 8 hours or, for subjects in the food-effect evaluation,
      approximately 30 minutes after starting a standard high-fat breakfast. The first 2 subjects
      in each group will be dosed (1 subject receiving HEC68498 and 1 subject receiving placebo) 48
      hours prior to the remainder of the subjects. There will be a minimum of 7 days between dose
      escalations. The washout period for subjects in Group 5 will be determined following review
      of available PK data.

    <description>HEC68498 is a potent,highly selective inhibitor of class 1 isozymes of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian(PI3K) and of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It has shown good activity against fibrosis and inflammation in vitro and in vivo, with a lower effective dose and better efficacy than pirfenidone and nintedanib.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females, of any race, between 18 and 60 years of age, inclusive, at
             Screening.

          2. Body mass index between 18.0 and 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening.

          3. In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical
             history,physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs measurements, and clinical
             laboratory evaluations (congenital nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's
             syndrome] is not acceptable) at Screening or Check-in as assessed by the Investigator
             (or designee).

          4. Females will not be pregnant or lactating, and females of childbearing potential and
