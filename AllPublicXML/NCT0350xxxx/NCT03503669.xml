    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study will be to test whether Kundalini yoga (KY) and Kirtan Kriya
      (KK) yogic meditation is superior to Memory Enhancement Training (MET) for improving
      cognitive functioning, health (including cardiovascular factors), and mood in women with high
      AD risk.

    <textblock>
      Overall, the investigators anticipate recruiting 100 women (50 or older) with MCI and high
      Alzheimer's disease risk. Subjects will either receive: (1) MET class for 60 minutes per
      week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and &quot;Kirtan Kriya&quot; meditation class for 60 minutes per week.
      Assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions at 6 and 12 weeks and
      follow-up visits at week 24 and 48 to monitor the overall benefit of the intervention.

    <measure>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) total recall score</measure>

    <description>Primary outcome measures were administered by a cognitive battery of neuropsychological and included memory and executive functioning. Verbal memory was measured with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) total recall scores. The HVLT form contains 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories (e.g., precious gems, articles of clothing, vegetables, etc.), to be learned over the course of three learning trials. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score. Total scores range from 0-36 with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>
