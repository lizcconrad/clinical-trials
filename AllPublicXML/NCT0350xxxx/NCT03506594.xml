    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in women at the menopause with a clinical diagnosis of Genitourinary
      Syndrome, which presents symptoms in of vulvovaginal atrophy and tract urinary and were
      treated with radiofrequency non ablative technique for capacitive transfer in intra-vaginal.
      All participants were evaluated by a physical therapist and did the exam of PH vaginal, cell
      maturation index and questionnaires. The participants made five sessions of Radio Frequency
      (RF) with an interval of seven days between them. The application of RF was performed by
      physical therapist trained in the technique of radio frequency through the Capenergie brand
      device with capacitive transfer method using non-ablative handle with active electrode
      intra-vaginal and coupling electrode placed on the participant's back. For application, the
      participants were in gynecological position. The session had an average duration above 20
      minutes. The temperature was measured by an infrared thermometer when it reached 41graus
      radiofrequency was maintained for 2 minutes in the anterior wall and 2 minutes more in the
      posterior wall of vagina.

    <description>The radiofrequency application protocol with CAPENERGY device, which has two electrodes: an active one, which will be introduced into the vagina, using a condom and gel to the emission of radiofrequency and another electrode, dispersive, coupled to the patient's hip, which will function as earth. The temperature used in the treatment will be 41° C, which this parameter will be placed in the equipment, maintained for 2 minutes at the anterior wall and 2 others minutes at the posterior wall. Five RF sessions will be performed, with a seven-day interval between them. For the application, participants will be placed in supine position. The session will be quick, with an average duration of 20 minutes. Kinesiotherapy will be done once a week, totaling five sessions. Initially, verbal information about location, function, and the correct way to contract the pelvic floor (PA) will be given.</description>
