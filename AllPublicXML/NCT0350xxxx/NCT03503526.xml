  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a mixed methods randomized controlled trial (Wait List Control), that
      investigates the effects of Group Music and Imagery (GrpMI) therapy in the treatment of women
      suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Complex PTSD.

      The aim is to detect if the intervention has an effect on PTSD symptoms, dissociation,
      quality of life, and the capability of regulating the autonomic nervous system (ANS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are adult women suffering from PTSD or Complex PTSD (n=56) that are randomized
      to three months of weekly (12) sessions of trauma modified GrpMI therapy or no treatment for
      an equal amount of time (wait list control).

      Primary outcome is pre, post and 3 months follow-up measures of PTSD checklist 5 (PCL-5).

      Secondary outcome is pre, post and 3 months follow-up measures of dissociative experience
      scale (DES), positive state of mind scale (PSOM-S), Hopkins symptoms checklist (HSCL-25),
      somatoform dissociation questionnaire (SDQ-5), and reactivity and recovery of different
      physiological measures related to arousal regulation ability in a script driven imagery
      setting.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months (post intervention) and 6 months (follow- up).</time_frame>
    <description>PCL-5 is a 20-item self-assessment scale, measuring symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The total score range are from 0-80. Higher scores indicate more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <description>DES is a 28-item self-assessment scale that measures psychoform dissociation. Each item ranges from 0 % to 100 % and the mean score is used as an index for the severity of the dissociative symptoms. A higher mean score indicates more dissociative symptoms.</description>

The mean score is used as an index of anxiety. A high mean score indicates more anxiety symptoms. The second subscale measures depression and has 15 items. Each item range from 1 to 4. The mean score is used as an index of depression. Higher mean score indicate more depressive symptoms.</description>
