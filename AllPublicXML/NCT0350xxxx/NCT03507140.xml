  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies describe the relationship between microbiota alteration and the occurrence of
      metabolic, alcoholic or inflammatory liver diseases. Nevertheless, the modifications of
      microbiota during liver transplantation (LT) as well as its implication are poorly studied.
      Similarly, only the intestinal microbiota is studied in this context, and no data are
      available on the biliary microbiota, even if it is known that bile microbiota can interfere
      with hepatobiliary diseases.

      This study proposes a clinical and biological in-depth follow-up with multiple sampling of
      liver transplanted patients to study biliary and intestinal microbiota alterations along LT,
      as well as bile acids metabolism in corresponding fluids.

      Indeed, in recipient samples as saliva, blood, urine, and feces can be taken before LT, and
      surgeons can easily perform bile sampling during LT. In donors all samples can be taken
      during liver removal. This offers the opportunity to have a microbiotic landscape of
      individuals without liver disease (donor), and patients suffering from a chronic liver
      disease or a liver cancer before and after transplantation.

      Also, in Grenoble University hospital, in case of biliary anastomotic incongruence, a biliary
      stent is placed during LT in 60% of recipients. This stent is removed by endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 6 months after LT, offering a second
      opportunity to obtain bile samples in transplanted patients, after the early post-LT period.
      Patients who do not require a biliary stent will also be included for the study of secondary
      objectives, as intestinal microbiota is very poorly characterized in liver transplanted
      patients too. A portion of the patients without biliary stent, may also develop an
      anastomotic biliary stricture requiring an ERCP. If this ERCP is realized within the
      follow-up period of the study, the patient will also be included in the primary objective of
      the study.

      These multiple and sequential samples will allow a complete analysis of microbiota changes in
      LT patients and aim to answer to 3 questions:

        1. What are the modifications of intestinal and biliary microbiomes during LT?

        2. What is the influence of bile acids' composition on intestinal and biliary microbiota?

        3. What are the relationships between microbiome alterations and the emergence of LT
           complications?
