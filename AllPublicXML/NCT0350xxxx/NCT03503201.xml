    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial . It included 60
      infertile obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), who are scheduled for
      intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle. The patients will be randomly allocated into
      two equal groups; Group (A): patients receive chromium supplementation as capsules of 200
      micrograms of chromium picolinate (Arab company for pharmaceuticals and medicinal plants),
      Group (B): no chromium supplementation. Both patients and outcome assessors are blinded to
      allocated group. All 60 participants underwent similar ICSI cycles. Primary outcome is
      clinical pregnancy rate per cycle. Secondary outcomes include number of oocytes retrieved,
      fertilization rate, number of embryos, embryo quality, chemical pregnancy rate, twins rate
      and miscarriage rate per cycle.

      This study is a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial . Ethical committee
      approval is obtained. The study includes infertile obese patients with PCOS diagnosed
      according to Rotterdam criteria, who are scheduled for ICSI cycle. Patients with body mass
      index (BMI) 30-35kg/m2 are included.

      Women with diabetes, thyroid disorder or other endocrine dysfunctions, uterine abnormalities
      are excluded.

      All patients receive detailed information about the study and informed consent is given by
      those who accepted to participate in the study. Each patient is subjected to history taking
      about obstetric history, medical and surgical history and demographic distribution. Full
      physical examination and 2D transvaginal sonography (TVS) are done on day 2 to 5 of menses to
      assess antral follicle count (AFC), uterus and adnexa .

      All 60 participants are scheduled for ICSI cycles. Randomization is done by withdrawing
      closed envelopes for each patient into group A and group B . Group (A): patients receive
      chromium supplementation as capsules of 200 micrograms of chromium picolinate (Arab company
      for pharmaceuticals and medicinal plants) for 2 months, Group (B): no chromium
      supplementation. Both patients and outcome assessors are blinded to allocated group.

      Long protocol is started from day 19th - 20th by Gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist
      (GnRH) agonist ;Triptorelin 0.1mg subcutaneous (S.C.) (Decapeptyl, Ferring).Then the1st visit
      is scheduled after 2 weeks of start of GnRH agonist or day 2 of cycle to confirm down
      regulation by a serum level of E2to be &lt;50 pg/ml, endometrial thickness &lt;5mm, no ovarian cyst
      by ultrasound. Gonadotropins are given as I.M. injections of 150-300 I.U. of highly purified
      Human Menopausal Gonadotropins daily (Merional, 75 I.U. /vial, IBSA). The dose is adjusted
      according to the age, BMI, AFC, serum levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) and ovarian response.

      The next visit is on 6th - 7 th days of gonadotropins and then every other day to do
      folliculometry by TVS and Estradiol (E2) level in serum.

      The trigger by Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG)10000 IU Intramuscular injection
      (I.M.)(Pregnyl, Organon) is given when at least 3 follicles reach 18mm in mean diameter or
      more and E2 level is less than 2500 pg/ml. Ovum retrieval is done 34 hours after HCG
      injection and embryo transfer using Wallace catheter on day 2 to 3. Luteal support include
      natural Progesterone 400 mg 1x2 as rectal suppository, Folic acid 0.5 mg orally once daily,
      Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid 1gm 1x2x7 orally,Progesterone 100 (I.M.) daily for 10 days,
      Acetylsalicylic Acid once daily. Quantitative ÃŸ- HCG in serum after was done after 14 days of
      embryo transfer.TVS is performed to detect clinical pregnancy at 6-7 weeks of gestation.

      Primary outcome is clinical pregnancy rate per cycle. Secondary outcomes include number of
      oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, number of embryos, embryo quality, chemical pregnancy
      rate, twins rate and miscarriage rate per cycle.
