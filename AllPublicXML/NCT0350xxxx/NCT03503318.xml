  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of different
      dose regimens of TV-46000 administered subcutaneously as compared to placebo during
      maintenance treatment in adult patients with schizophrenia. The study will include male and
      female patients, 18 to 65 years of age, who have a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia, are
      clinically stable, and are eligible for risperidone treatment.

    <description>Stability is defined as meeting all of the following criteria for at least 4 consecutive weeks: outpatient status; PANSS total score ≤80; minimal presence of specific psychotic symptoms on the PANSS, as measured by a score of ≤4 on each of the following items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content; Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score ≤4 (moderately ill); and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality (CGI-SS) score ≤2 (mildly suicidal) on Part 1 and ≤5 (minimally worsened) on Part 2. The percentage will be calculated as the number of patients who maintained stability at endpoint divided by the number of patients in the given treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Positive symptom, negative symptom, and overall symptom remission will be examined and are defined by Andreasen et al (2005), including severity and duration criteria. All remission criteria can be derived from PANSS items.</description>
