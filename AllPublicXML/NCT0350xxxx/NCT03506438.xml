  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of palliative care is highly variable for many patients treated in intensive care
      units (ICUs) and their family members. To address these challenges, the investigators will
      test the impact of a mobile app designed to help families navigate ICU-based palliative care
      vs. usual care. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will reduce
      patient/family member unmet palliative care needs and improve the quality of clinical-family
      communication in racially/ethnically diverse populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quality of palliative care is highly variable in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting.
      These markers of poor quality are even more common among Black patients and families than
      among Whites. To address these challenges, the investigators developed a mobile app that
      allows families to both give and receive information relevant to palliative care and for ICU
      clinicians to visualize patient/family data and therefore better support them.

      To determine the effect of this intervention,the investigators propose to conduct a
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the intervention to usual care to address four
      specific aims: (1) Using a cluster randomized clinical trial, determine the effect of the
      intervention vs usual care on unmet needs [as measured by the NEST scale] and
      patient-centered care [as measured by the IPC scale], (2) Determine the impact of the
      intervention on unmet needs and patient-centered care based across different racial groups,
      and (3) Explore family member and clinician experiences with intervention using mixed methods
      to understand mechanisms within unique case contexts [exploratory aim]. The investigators
      hypothesize that compared to usual care, PCneeds will reduce family members' unmet needs,
      increase the patient-centeredness care, and reduce hospital length of stay overall--though
      the magnitude of effect will be greater among Blacks compared to Whites.
