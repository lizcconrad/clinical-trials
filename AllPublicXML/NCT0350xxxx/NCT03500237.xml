  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic health conditions (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes) represent any physical
      condition that persist for 3 months or more that requires ongoing management. Chronic health
      conditions are very common, and increase in prevalence with age. Internet-delivered Cognitive
      Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) is a promising approach for overcoming these barriers, and improving
      access to mental health care. In ICBT, clients receive content from traditional face-to-face
      CBT over the Internet, while receiving support and assistance from a guide through secure
      e-mail. The Chronic Conditions Course is an 8-week, 5 lesson ICBT program that consists of
      education and relapse prevention as well as cognitive, behavioural, and physical strategies
      for managing chronic conditions. This intervention has traditionally been delivered either
      with no support or with weekly brief (15 minute) individual therapist guidance via email and
      phone. However, in order to provide a faster response to clients using an on the demand
      (responding as quickly as possible and for sure within one business day team based approach
      (e.g., first available therapist responds) may be beneficial.

      The proposed trial will examine the Chronic Conditions Course delivered by a team at the
      Online Therapy Unit based at the University of Regina versus a self-directed program. In the
      team based approach, participants will be able to contact the Online Therapy Unit if they
      have any questions regarding the content of the Chronic Conditions Course during the 8 week
      program. Participants in this group will receive a response from one of the members of the
      team within one business day. In the self-directed group, clients will receive automatic
      messages from the Online Therapy Unit that encourage participation during the 8 week program
      but otherwise will work on the course on their own. All participants will complete
      questionnaires prior to the start of the program, before each lesson of the program, once
      they have completed the program, and 3 months after completing the program. The primary
      outcome measures include anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes include fatigue, pain,
      self-efficacy, disability, overall quality of life, and life satisfaction.
