  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To investigate the efficacy and acceptability of a guided internet-delivered
           transdiagnostic intervention targeting repetitive negative thinking for individuals with
           elevated levels of depression and generalized anxiety disorder (mild to moderate
           clinical symptoms) vs a wait-list control group (WLCG).

        2. To investigate the hypothesized mechanism of change: Repetitive negative thinking is
           reduced first, and consequently the clinical symptoms (depression and/or anxiety)
           decrease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of a Rumination Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (RF-CBT) will be
      compared with a wait list control group using a randomized control trial (RCT) design in a
      culture where this has not been tested before. The treatment approach was design to
      specifically target repetitive negative thinking (e.g., rumination and worries).
      Specifically, the treatment involves first a functional analysis design to help participants
      identify when rumination starts, distinguish between helpful versus unhelpful repetitive
      thinking, and learn more functional responses, and experiential and imagery exercises design
      to help them shift their thought processing towards concreteness, absorption and compassion.
      The main goal of the study is to test the effectiveness of this transdiagnostic approach in
      reducing symptom of depression and anxiety.

    <measure>Rumination Response Scale -10 items (RRS10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Absolute values (average score) of RRS10 subscales (Reflection and Brooding) at 8 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Rumination Response Scale -10 items (RRS10) was designed to measure participant's level of rumination. The scale has two subscale: Reflection (5 items) and Brooding (5 items). The score for each subscale ranges from 5 to 20, while the total score ranges from 10 to 40. Low scores are associated with low levels of rumination, while high scores are associated with high levels of rumination.</description>

    <time_frame>Absolute values (average score) of GAD7 at 8 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7) was designed to measure participant's level of generalized anxiety or worry. The scale is unidimensional and the total score ranges from 0 to 21. Low scores are associated with low levels of worry, while high scores are associated with high levels of worry.</description>
