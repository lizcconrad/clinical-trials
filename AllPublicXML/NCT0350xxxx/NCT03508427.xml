  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric illness with chronic course and it is associated
      with high risk of relapse and hospitalisation, and many patients do not recover to their
      previous psychosocial functioning. Major reasons for poor outcomes are delayed intervention
      for prodromal mood and behavioural symptoms as well as incomplete treatment responses.
      Current diagnostic approaches used to assess mood symptoms rely on symptom-based categories,
      which lack sensitivity to detect subtle mood and behavioural changes. Therefore, the ability
      to better characterizing bipolar patients may allow to detect possible differences in the
      illness activity.

      On the other hand, there is a growing interest in the potential use of mobile technologies
      such as mobile apps, smartphone and internet in psychiatric care. Some projects have been
      testing the potential benefits of mobile apps to assess and treat individuals at-risk or
      suffering from mood and bipolar disorders, using online signs and symptoms monitoring, yet to
      the investigators knowledge, none of them have integrated a dimensional approach in a
      smartphone app to assess mood and behavioural alterations and bipolar illness activity,
      including subjective and objective data (e.g. physical activity, social activity, etc.).

      In this feasibility study the investigators will evaluate the potential relevance of Toi Même
      app to self-monitoring mood and behavioural changes in bipolar patients with different mood
      phases compared to the gold-standard mood rating tools used in clinical practice. All
      patients will be followed for 3 months, with outcome assessments after 2 weeks, after 1
      month, 2 months and after 3 months.
