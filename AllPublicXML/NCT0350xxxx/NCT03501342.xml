  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait disorder, imbalance, and fatigue are the most frequently reported complaints in Multiple
      Sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurodegenerative disease. The first symptoms in patients with MS
      are emerging in the age range 20-50 and these patients need long-term rehabilitation. The
      virtual reality applications developed for these problems which affect the quality of life
      negatively and cause disability in the following periods may be a good alternative for
      conventional rehabilitation applications. In this long-term where motivation is important,
      virtual reality applications in different environments provide patients with the opportunity
      to do many different tasks amused. In recent years, the vividness has been increased by the
      3D virtual reality headsets.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of immersive virtual reality on the
      balance, mobility, and fatigue in patients with MS.

      The study was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled study. The patients will be
      randomly assigned to three groups, the &quot;immersive virtual reality (IVR)&quot; group, the &quot;dynamic
      balance training (DBT)&quot; group and the control group. The trainings will be twice a week for 8
      weeks. In the IVR group, firstly 30 minutes of Pilates training, 10 minutes of rest and then
      20 minutes of virtual reality will be applied. In the DBT group, 20 minutes of dynamic
      balance exercises will be applied after Pilates training. In dynamic balance training,
      exercises will consist of similar movements required by virtual reality games. The control
      group will be taught relaxation exercises and will be asked to perform the exercises 2 times
      for 8 weeks at home.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
      IL, USA). The pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the
      Wilcoxon Test. The significance level was set at p&lt; 0.05.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention will be assessed</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue impact scale consists of forty questions and evaluates the effects of fatigue on the 3 dimensions of daily life activities; cognitive function, physical function and psychosocial function. Each question is graded between 0 (no problem) and 4 (maximum problem).</description>
