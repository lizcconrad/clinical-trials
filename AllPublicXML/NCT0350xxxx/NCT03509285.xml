  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-dose, placebo- and active-controlled, crossover study will evaluate
      the abuse liability potential of cenobamate in recreational drug users with sedative drug use
      experience.

      In the Qualification phase, subjects will receive a single dose of either alprazolam or
      placebo in a crossover design, with a wash-out period of at least 24 hours between
      treatments. Subjects who are clearly able to distinguish the positive control from placebo
      will be enrolled in the Treatment phase and will be randomized to single oral doses of
      cenobamate (2 dose levels), alprazolam (2 dose levels), and placebo in a double-blind,
      double-dummy, 5-way crossover design. Washout-periods between the 5 treatment periods in the
      Treatment phase will be at least 16 days.
