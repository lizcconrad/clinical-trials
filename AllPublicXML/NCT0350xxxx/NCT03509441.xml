  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between insulin resistance (IR) and
      myocardial tissue abnormalities. The study will focus on a patient population, South Asians,
      with a high prevalence of IR.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac fibrosis has been linked to adverse outcomes in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Fibrosis
      is also detectable in diabetic patients, but does not appear to closely track with insulin
      sensitivity. Hence, fibrosis may be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in IR and
      diabetic patients. As a result, a critical need exists to develop a non-invasive tool to
      identify and treat the highest-risk patients. Early detection of cardiac fibrosis and other
      CMR- detectable abnormalities in IR patients may help to 'stage' a patient's disease process
      and future risk of events, ultimately leading to an adjustment in the aggressiveness of their
      medical management and long-term monitoring accordingly. This project is aimed at reducing
      the mortality and morbidity associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, and the
      investigators believe this project could have a transformative impact on long-term diabetic
      care and shed new light upon the biology of diffuse cardiac fibrosis in insulin resistance
      and diabetes and its role in shaping the long-term cardiovascular risk for these patients.

    <measure>Identifying patients with high fibrosis levels using peripheral blood samples</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples drawn once at baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will collect and store peripheral blood samples from every patient, identify those with high and low fibrosis levels using our described protocol, and then select patients with disproportionately high fibrosis levels given their disease burden.
The investigators can test for the level of fibrosis by generating induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC- CMs) from these collected blood samples. These iPSC-CMs will be tested, in vitro, for drug sensitivity, susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli, and the propensity to produce pro-fibrotic cytokine activation- all factors which will help the investigators determine fibrosis levels.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin Sensitivity measured by OGTT</measure>
    <time_frame>OGTT done at baseline/ first visit</time_frame>
    <description>An oral glucose tolerance test with insulin measurement (OGTT) will be performed for all the patients. The investigators will draw blood to determine a fasting glucose measurement, and then the patients will be given a 75 g glucose solution to drink. Blood samples will be collected at serial time points (30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes) after ingestion of this liquid to determine blood glucose and insulin levels. The OGTT will help investigators determine the patient's degree of insulin sensitivity.</description>

    <description>Baseline fasting lipids will be assessed to calculate a TG/HDL-C ratio, which also correlates with the degree of insulin sensitivity or lack thereof. These results will be correlated to the insulin sensitivity assessment performed by the OGTT.</description>

    <description>Cardiac MRI/ CMR done to noninvasively image heart and assess ventricular function through myocardial tagging. By modulating the magnetization gradient of the MRI prior to acquiring images, any parts of the heart which are not contracting can be identified.

      The investigators will probe individual patient risk based on initial cardiac fibrosis
      measurements. In insulin resistance, the degree of fibrosis may be out of proportion to
      disease severity, pointing to a genetic predisposition for increased cardiac cell dropout
      (i.e. apoptosis) and replacement fibrosis. To address this idea, the investigators will
      collect and store peripheral blood samples from every patient, identify those with high and
      low fibrosis levels, and then select patients with disproportionately high fibrosis levels
      given their disease burden. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC- CMs)
      will then be generated. The iPSC-CMs will be tested, in vitro, for drug sensitivity,
      susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli, and the propensity to produce pro-fibrotic cytokine
      activation. In this manner, the investigators will study the individual patient's myocardial
      cell features that increase the risk of cardiac fibrosis and the subsequent adverse outcomes
      that ensue.
