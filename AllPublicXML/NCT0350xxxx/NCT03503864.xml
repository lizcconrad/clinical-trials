  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects and toxicity of chemotherapy
      combined with arsenic trioxide treating patients with recurrent or refractory stage 4
      Neuroblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomly divided into experimental group and control group. Experimental group
      receive arsenic trioxide combined with induction chemotherapy while control group receive
      conventional induction chemotherapy alone. The 3 year overall survival rate (OS) and
      progression free survival (PFS), as well as incidence of adverse events, will be compared
      between two groups. Patients are followed every 3 months in the first year, every 6 months in
      the second year, and then annually thereafter.

    <description>Patients will receive arsenic trioxide alone on days 1-2 and combined with conventional induction chemotherapy on days 3-10. Arsenic trioxide 0.16mg/kg will be diluted into 250 ~ 500 ml of normal saline or a 5% glucose solution for intravenous drip over 4 hours per day. At the same time vitamin C 0.5 ~ 1.0g will be added in 5% glucose injection 100 ~ 250 ml with arsenic trioxide. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 9 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
