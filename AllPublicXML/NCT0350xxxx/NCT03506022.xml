  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Type 2 diabetes are two frequent diseases that occur in
      adult population. The prevalence of OSA is higher in people with Type 2 diabetes compared
      with the general population7 ; in addition, the OSA syndrome is almost assessed in obese type
      2 diabetes. The relationship between OSA and Type 2 diabetes has been well characterized: the
      OSA can contribute to increased insulin resistance or glucose intolerance; and, diabetes may
      worsen sleep-disordered breathing because of autonomic neuropathy8,9. The main link between
      OSA and Type 2 diabetes is central obesity, which triggers glucose intolerance/insulin
      resistance and is also an independent risk factor for OSA. Type 1 diabetes is generally not
      related to obesity; however, sleep-disordered breathing in these patients was described in
      few reports early as 1985 by pioneers such as Guilleminault5 and the prevalence of OSA is
      estimated at range 10 to 40% in type 1 diabetes patients. Few studies had evaluated the
      prevalence of sleep disorders in particular the sleep apnea syndrome in patients with type 1
      diabetes and even less their influence on the glycemic control.

      This study will take place at the CHU of Amiens-Picardie during a one-night hospitalization.
      The investigators will study in 44 type 1 diabetes mellitus (IAH apnea hypopnea index ≥15)
      who underwent polysomnography and continuous glucose monitoring of blood glucose
