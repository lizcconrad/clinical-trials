  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated whether the provision of a to-go container influenced the portion
      size effect at a meal. Following a screening visit, women came to the lab once a week for 4
      weeks to eat a meal of multiple foods. At each visit, the portion size of the meal was varied
      in a counterbalanced order. Prior to their first meal, women were randomly assigned to one of
      two groups: a group that would have their leftovers packaged to go (to-go group) and a group
      that did not have leftovers packaged (control group). Women were instructed to eat ad libitum
      at the meals. They also answered questions about hunger and fullness as well as food
      characteristics before and after each meal. Following the final meal, subjects completed a
      series of questionnaires assessing subject characteristics as well as food characteristics.
      It was hypothesized that the effect of portion size on intake would be attenuated in subjects
      who received a to-go container with the meal. In addition, we aimed to identify any subject
      characteristics that moderated or exacerbated the portion size effect. It was also of
      interest to determine whether the portion size effect on individual foods were influenced by
      food characteristics such as perceived value.

    <intervention_model_description>The two factors were meal portion size and provision of a to-go container. The portion size factor was within-subjects (crossover). All subjects received each of the 4 portions served (the order in which portions were served was counterbalanced). The container factor was between-subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: one group had uneaten food packaged to take home, the other group (control) did not.</intervention_model_description>
