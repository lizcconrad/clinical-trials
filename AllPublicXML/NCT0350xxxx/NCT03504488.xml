  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of BA3021, a conditionally active
      biologic (CAB) ROR2-targeted antibody drug conjugate (CAB-ROR2- ADC) in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. This study will consist of a dose escalation phase and a dose
      expansion phase.
