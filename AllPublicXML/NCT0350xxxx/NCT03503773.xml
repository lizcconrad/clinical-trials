               -  Be willing to discontinue his/her antihypertensive medication(s), and to adhere
                  to the no medication regimen for at least 12 weeks (4 week run-in period and 8
                  week post treatment period).

          5. Investigator judges that the subject can be discontinued safely from all current
             antihypertensive medication (where applicable) and managed safely for at least 12
             weeks (4 week run-in period and 8 week post treatment period) without antihypertensive
             medication intake.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use acceptable methods of
             contraception (as defined in Section 5.3), from the time of informed consent through
             to the last follow-up visit.

          7. Subject agrees to have all study procedures performed and is able and willing to
             comply with all study follow-up visits and protocol requirements.

          8. Subject has 3 office blood pressure measurements with a mean office SBP of ≥140 mmHg
             and ≤180 mmHg AND mean office DBP ≥90 mmHg.

          9. Subject has a mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP of ≥135 mmHg and ≤170 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a contraindication known for conventional percutaneous interventional
             procedures.

          2. Subject has an acute or sub-acute infection that the investigator judges would pose
             unacceptable procedural risks to the subject.

          3. Subject has imaging-assessed renal artery anatomy abnormalities or variations based on
             investigator's evaluation of the screening images (i.e. MRA/CTA examination and/or
             renal angiography) meeting one of the following criteria:

               -  Main renal artery that has a diameter of &lt;4 mm or &gt;7 mm and length of &lt;5 mm

               -  Accessory renal arteries with diameter &gt;2 mm or &lt;4 mm, which supply &gt;20% of the
                  whole kidney parenchyma on that side, per the investigator's judgment. Note:
                  subjects with more than one eligible accessory renal artery per side will be
                  excluded.

               -  Renal artery stenosis &gt;50% of the normal diameter segment (diameter stenosis,
                  compared to the angiographically normal proximal or distal segment)

               -  Any renal artery abnormality or disease that, per the physician assessment,
                  precludes the safe insertion of the guiding catheter (including, but not limited
                  to, severe renal artery aneurysm, excessive tortuosity, severe renal artery
                  calcification)

               -  Previous renal angioplasty associated with stenting or other implants, that, per
                  the physician's assessment, precludes the safe deployment of the Peregrine
                  Catheter components in the target treatment segment of the renal artery

               -  Previous renal denervation

        chronic renal replacement therapy.

        10. Subject has nephrotic syndrome. 12. Subject has a history of nephrectomy, a single
        kidney or kidney tumor, or urinary tract obstruction (with potential for hydronephrosis).
        Note: Simple renal cysts are not an exclusion.

        13. Subject has a renal transplant, or is known to have a non-functioning kidney or unequal
        renal size 14. Subject has a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or
        stroke/TIA within 6 months prior to the planned procedure.

        15. Subject has any of the following conditions: severe cardiac valve stenosis, heart
        failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV), chronic atrial fibrillation,
        and known primary pulmonary hypertension (&gt;60 mmHg pulmonary artery or right ventricular
        systolic pressure).

        20. Subject has any other acute or chronic condition that the investigator believes will
        adversely affect the ability to interpret the data or will prevent the subject from
        completing the trial procedures, or has a life expectancy of &lt;12 months.

        22. If female, subject is pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment or planning to
        become pregnant during the trial time period.

        23. Subject has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational drug or
        investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in
        another clinical study involving an investigational drug or investigational device during
        the course of this study. Subjects enrolled in observational registries not involving renal
        denervation may still be eligible.
