  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pre-post trial with 150 parents in rural South Central
      Montana. The study will recruit families to cooperating community locations (e.g., churches,
      public libraries) to participate in research evaluating the efficacy of parents installing
      restraints with guidance from a remotely-located technician using interactive virtual
      presence. Following informed consent procedures, parents will complete a brief survey on
      behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions about child safety and restraints while an on-site
      technician evaluates baseline safety of the restraint. Parents will then engage remotely
      using their personal smartphone with an off-site certified car seat technician, obtaining
      advice to install the child restraint properly via the HelpLightning interactive virtual
      presence app. Following the remote interaction, the on-site technician will again inspect the
      restraint using the validated checklist (and correct any errors prior to the participant
      leaving). The overall goal is to demonstrate installation of child restraints can be
      effectively accomplished to rural populations using interactive virtual presence. The study
      has 2 specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate technological and behavioral efficacy of providing instructions
      on child restraint installation remotely to rural populations. Demonstrate &gt;95% of
      interactions proceed without technical problems, without reports of communication difficulty
      on either end of the exchange (the parent or the technician), and without interruption.

      Specific Aim 2. Identify accuracy of child restraint installation by parents using
      instructions provided by a remotely-located certified technician via interactive virtual
      presence. Demonstrate installation in this manner achieves ≥90% accuracy across all aspects
      of child restraint installation. Demonstrate installation in this manner significantly
      reduces restraint installation errors.
