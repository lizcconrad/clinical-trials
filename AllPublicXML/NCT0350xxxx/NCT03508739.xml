  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is common, increases in prevalence with age, and patients with diabetes have
      an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A relatively new cardiovascular medication
      currently used for the treatment of heart failure in the United States inhibits an enzyme
      that breaks down a variety of signaling hormones. This clinical trial tests if it may also be
      a target for the treatment of diabetes by decreasing the breakdown of a hormone that
      increases insulin release after a meal.

      This study will test the hypothesis that neprilysin inhibition with sacubitril/valsartan will
      increase endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) after a mixed meal compared to valsartan.
      The primary statistical analysis will be within subject comparison (paired t-test or
      nonparametric equivalent) of area under the curve intact GLP-1 after the meal during
      sacubitril/valsartan compared to valsartan. Neprilysin inhibition may be a new drug target
      for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by increasing intact GLP-1 and may be of particular
      benefit to individuals with increased risk of hypoglycemia and cardiovascular disease.

    <description>Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down several proteins, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Sacubitril in sacubitril/valsartan is a pro-drug of a neprilysin inhibitor. This assay level will help to determine if the changes seen after the meal are related to alterations in this enzyme activity and administration of the drug sacubitril/valsartan compared to valsartan. We will measure this before the medication is administered (thus at baseline) and two hours after the drug is administered and just prior to the mixed meal.</description>

    <description>Subjects will present for a baseline mixed meal study day 1 (no medication). Next they will be randomized to sacubitril/valsartan 200mg po and then valsartan 160 mg po with each medication given on study day 2 and 3, respectively (order AB). At each study day, subjects will present after fasting and receive blinded study medication on study days 2 and 3. After an IV is placed, neprilysin activity will be measured at baseline. Two hours later, subjects will have neprilysin activity collected again as well as baseline insulin, glucose, GLP-1, and triglycerides. Following this, subjects will ingest a mixed meal. Blood samples for insulin, glucose, GLP-1, and triglycerides will be collected after the meal for four hours total. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored.</description>
