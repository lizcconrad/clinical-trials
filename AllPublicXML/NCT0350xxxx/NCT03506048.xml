  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenvatinib works when given together with standard of
      care iodine I-131 in treating patients with radioactive iodine-sensitive differentiated
      thyroid cancer. Lenvatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib pretreatment along with radioactive iodine (RAI) in
      patients with previously treated RAI sensitive thyroid cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the safety of the combination of lenvatinib and RAI in patients with Iodine
      sensitive differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).

      II. To assess dynamic changes in established serum based biomarkers of DTC (thyroglobulin
      [Tg] and Tg antibody).

      III. To explore the utility of protein and genetic biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenvatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 8 weeks and up to 12 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Patients also receive iodine I-131 PO
      daily as standard of care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 6 weeks, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then periodically thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with therapeutic dose of radioactive iodine (&gt; 50 mCi) with evidence

          -  Patients with previously untreated and or symptomatic brain metastases are excluded
             from this clinical trial because of the risk of intracranial bleeding with angiogenic
             agents and tumoral swelling from RAI

             composition to lenvatinib

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (requirement for more than 2 blood pressure
             [BP] medications or grade 2 or higher BP elevation while on adequate doses of not more
             than 2 antihypertensive agents) are excluded from the study because one of the

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenvatinib is a tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with lenvatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with lenvatinib

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
