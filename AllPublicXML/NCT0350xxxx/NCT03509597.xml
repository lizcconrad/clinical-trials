    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the brain correlates of Cognitive Training and Aerobic Exercise in
      schizophrenia. A third of participants will receive Cognitive Training plus Standard Care for
      schizophrenia. Another third of participants will receive Aerobic Exercise Training plus
      Standard Care for schizophrenia. A control group will of participants will receive Standard
      Care plus Occupational Activities for the same duration and frequency as the experimental
      groups.

      This study, randomized, open, controlled with schizophrenia-standard-care, is aimed to
      determine structural and functional brain changes associated to cognitive remediation and
      physical exercise in schizophrenia.

      The study participants will be enrolled in the catchment area of the Hospital Psiquiatrico de
      Alava, in the province of Alava, Basque Region, Northern Spain.147 patients diagnosed with
      schizophrenia will be randomly assigned to Cognitive Training Group or Aerobic Exercise Group
      or a Control Group for a five-month period.

      Both Cognitive Training Group patients and Aerobic Exercise Group patients will participate
      in training sessions of 90 min/d, 3 d/wk. Patients assigned to Control Group will receive the
      standard care for schizophrenia in this area plus occupational activities for the same
      duration and frequency than the two experimental groups.

      Cognitive Training will be implemented through REHACOP, a cognitive remediation program for
      Spanish speaking patients with schizophrenia whose efficacy on cognitive performance and
      negative symptoms has already been demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia. REHACOP is a
      &quot;paper &amp; pencil&quot; based cognitive remediation program that covers 8 cognitive domains
      including social cognition. It is based on the principles of Optimization, Restauration &amp;
      Compensation.

      Aerobic Exercise Training will consist of an intensive physical exercise program supervised
      by certified graduates and doctorate students of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences.
      Sessions will include 10-minute warming-up and 10-minute back exercises and stretches. The
      main part of the session will consist of aerobic exercise (20-minute indoor bicycle) and
      muscle-resistance and strength exercises for 20 minutes. The intensity of the sessions will
      be determined on a case by case basis according to the HR necessary to achieve the intensity
      ranges (R2-moderate and R3-high). During the sessions, the bicycle's power and pace will be
      individually adjusted to achieve the selected HR.

      The assessment batteries, neuroimaging and Serum BDNF levels will be administered and
      determined at baseline and immediately following the completion of the Cognitive Remediation
      or Aerobic Exercise interventions. Psychologists, psychiatrists and

      Primary outcomes: Structural and functional brain changes will be assessed by MRI
      neuroimaging. A Philips Achieva 3.0T MRI system equipped with a modular 32-channel
      architecture. 3 different types of images will be acquired: a) T1-weighted MRI imaging, b)
      Diffusion Tensor imaging, c) fMRI imaging at rest and using a cognitive paradigm.

      Secondary outcomes will be changes in cognitive performance, clinical and functional changes
      and Serum BDNF changes.

    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The UPSA includes the following 5 subscales: Financial Skills, Communication, Comprehension/Planning, Transportation, Household Management. Total scores for each sub- scale are calculated by transforming raw scores into a 0- to-10 scale, yielding comparable scores on each scale. In order to have a 100-point summary score, each subscale score is multiplied by 2, yielding subscale scores ranging from 1 to 20. A summary UPSA score is calculated by summing these five scores, resulting in total scores rang- ing from 0 to 100. Scores of 0 represent maximum severity of functional impairment and a score of 100 represents total absence of functional disability.</description>

A score of 36 represents total absence of disability and 180 maximum severity of disability.</description>

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

Each session includes 10 minutes of warm-up exercise before the main exercise and 10 minutes of cool-down afterwards.the principal exercise section includes 20 minutes of aerobic exercise and 20 minutes of resistance and strength exercises. The exercise intensity will be regulated according to the heart rate measured by a pulsimeter throughout the exercise. The target intensity level will be individualized according to the heart rate to set the moderate intensity level (HR values between ventilatory thresholds) and high intensity level (HR values from 2nd. ventilatory threshold to the peak threshold).</description>
