  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and consequences of musculoskeletal pain is considerable among healthcare
      workers, allegedly due to high physical work demands of healthcare work.

      Performing physical exercise at the workplace together with colleagues may be more motivating
      for some employees and thus increase adherence. On the other hand, physical exercise
      performed during working hours at the workplace may be costly for the employers in terms of
      time spend. Thus, it seems relevant to perform a brief intervention. This study is intended
      to investigate the difference between the effect of workplace-based physical exercise (using
      elastic bands and body weight exercises) and a group control on musculoskeletal pain,
      physical exertion during work, physical function, need for recovery, self-rated use of
      analgesics, and work ability among healthcare workers.
