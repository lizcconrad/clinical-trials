  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy with platinum salts is very emetic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      benefits of foot reflexology in nausea and vomiting induced by platinum salts-based
      chemotherapy in patients with thoracic or digestive tumors.

    <description>The relative change in VAS* associated with nausea and vomiting will be evaluated between T1 (measured at least 2 hours after the start of chemotherapy injection) and T2 (measured at least 6 hours after the start of injection of the drug chemotherapy).
*VAS : from 0 to 10 ; 0 is no nausea or vomiting and 10 is insufferable nausea or vomiting</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nausea and vomiting between each chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, between day 14 and day 21, between day 28 and day 42, between day 42 and day 63.</time_frame>
    <description>Between each chemotherapy the patient notes daily whether or not he has had nausea on a notebook.</description>

    <description>Relative variation of the EORTC QLQC 30* (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) between the inclusion visit (V2) and the end-of-study visit (V6).
*EORTC QLQ C30 : All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Between day 0 and day 78</time_frame>
    <description>Relative variation of the HADS* (Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale) anxiety score between the inclusion visit (V2) and the end-of-study visit (V6).
*HADS : 0 to 21, the highest scores corresponding to the presence of a more severe symptomatology</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body image</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the body image to the end-of-study visit by the Body Image Questionnaire* (BIC), which measures the body image at a given moment t. The analysis will take into account the self-esteem assessed upon the inclusion visit on the Rosenberg scale** (V2).
*BIC : The total score is between 19 and 95.
**Rosenberg Scale : The total score ranges from 10 to 40. A score below 31 is considered low self-esteem</description>

During a session focused on the treatment of nausea / vomiting, the reflexologist will stimulate the reflex zones related to the digestive system in order to calm and stimulate all areas for deep relaxation of the patient.</description>
