    <textblock>
      Current medical treatment allows more people to survive heart attacks than in the past.
      However, some of the survivors suffer heart disease and require hospitalization later on. The
      causes behind this heart disease (heart failure) after a heart attack are poorly understood.

      Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) is a protein that cuts other proteins into pieces, and is
      activated in heart muscle when there is a heart attack. MMP-2 causes heart injury when the
      blood flow to the heart is restored after the attack. Blocking MMP-2 activity is a potential
      therapy to prevent heart injury under these circumstances. The only MMP-2 inhibiting drug
      currently approved for clinical use is doxycycline, specifically used to treat periodontitis
      (gum inflammation) and rosacea (a skin condition). At higher doses doxycycline also acts as
      an antibiotic for which it has been clinically used for decades.

      A previous clinical study found that taking doxycycline twice a day, for one week after a
      heart attack improved the health of the patients' hearts. We conducted a similar study in
      patients that had surgery to replace blocked coronary arteries (blood vessels that feed the
      heart muscle). These patients took a low dose of doxycycline once a day for 2 days before
      surgery, on the day of the surgery, and three days after surgery. The participants in this
      study showed no adverse effects of using doxycycline.

      Our goal is to see if doxycycline protects the hearts of patients that suffered a heart
      attack. All patients will receive standard clinical care for their condition, but in addition
      will take a doxycycline capsule twice a day, or a placebo capsule for 7 days, as soon as
      possible after being diagnosed with a heart attack. Three months later, we will evaluate the
      patients by looking at their heart structure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a
      powerful tool that allows doctors to see inside the body without surgery or X-ray radiation.
      The hearts of those patients that received doxycycline are expected to be healthier than
      those who received placebo.

      We plan to promote the use of doxycycline to protect the hearts of patients with heart
      attacks. If successful, doxycycline could help improve the quality of life of heart attack
      survivors.

      Background:

      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are activated in myocardial ischemia, digesting key
      structural components in cardiac muscle in the setting of myocardial infarction and
      myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (Schulz, 2007, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 47,
      211-42).

      The antibiotic doxycycline is the only drug approved as an MMP inhibitor by Health Canada and
      the U.S. FDA for the treatment of periodontitis and rosacea at sub-antimicrobial doses.

      Doxycycline decreases intracellular proteolysis, improves cardiac function, and reduces
      infarct size in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (Cheung et al, 2002, Circulation
      101:1833-39; Villarreal et al, 2003, Circulation 208:1487-92).

      TIPTOP (Cerisano et al, 2014, Eur Heart J 35: 184-91) was a randomized open-label trial (110
      patients) that studied the effect of 1-week doxycycline given post-percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) in patients with anterior STEMI. Patients who received doxycycline showed
      improved echocardiographic indices at 6 months relative to untreated controls: left
      ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVi) -8 mL ± 14 mL (P=0.004), left ventricular end
      systolic volume index (LVESVi) -6 mL ± 12 mL (P=0.02), and left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF) +5% ± 12% (P=0.04). They also showed decreased infarct sizes (-6%, P=0.05) by single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

      Rationale for study:

      The TIPTOP pilot study showed promise for doxycycline therapy to decrease adverse ventricular
      remodeling post-PCI in STEMI patients. Animal models suggest that MMP activation occurs early
      in reperfusion (within 5 minutes) following severe ischemia, and the TIPTOP pilot showed that
      early treatment may result in measurable clinical benefit. However, the TIPTOP pilot was an
      open label study and used a low resolution approach to measure clinical outcomes.

      This is a small-scale, single-centre Phase II trial with double blinding, and includes the
      use of magnetic resonance imaging to measure primary (LVESVi) and secondary outcomes (LVEF ad
      LVEDVi). We anticipate beneficial effects of doxycycline, with patients showing lower levels
      of LVESVi and LVEDVi, increased LVEF by MRI, and reduced infarct sizes, compared to placebo
      at 3 months. We also expect hospitalization and mortality rates due to cardiac events to be
      reduced in these patients.

      If successful, our overarching goal is to develop a multi-center randomized, blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial to examine the effect of early doxycycline therapy in the setting of
      STEMI.
