  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine in a cost-effective manner; the safety and efficacy of
      &quot;standard of care&quot; renin-angiotensin-aldosterone System (RAAS) alone or in combination with a
      fixed dose of Spironolactone (25 mg) on eGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and
      proteinuria in African Americans with type II diabetes and diabetic nephropathy.

      Determine the safety and efficacy of combination drug therapy in under-represented
      populations and to evaluate the efficacy of current clinical practices that involve the
      treatment of diabetic nephropathy with a combination of Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists(MRA). The trial that will examine the
      safety and efficacy of combination ACE and MRA therapy in reducing proteinuria and slowing
      the progression of Stage III diabetic nephropathy. Additionally, the study will administer a
      specific questionnaire, which will determine the level of individual patient understanding of
      their renal disease and how to partner with healthcare providers to optimize their care. The
      questionnaire will determine whether routine patient education yields the same level of
      comprehension and participation among different ethnic groups. The questionnaire will also
      analyze cultural roads blocks that have impeded minority groups from participating in
      clinical research. By incorporating the survey into the study, questions will work to
      validate the utility of the survey and to disseminate findings to the chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) clinical research community.
