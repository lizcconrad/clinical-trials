    <textblock>
      Introduction: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is characterized by
      dysregulation of the innate immune response it's associated with Th1, Th17 up-regulation,
      reflected by increased cytokine secretion including TNF-α. A main effective therapeutic
      interventions is blocking TNFα. Vedolizumab, an anti integrin, is a new class of treatment
      designed to block trafficking of lymphocytes in the gut. Clinical trials and real life
      experience response rates at week 6 range between 30-45%. Curcumin suppresses NFκβ levels via
      alteration of TLR2/4 pathways lowering TNF-α upstream. Curcumin is safe and efficacious in
      inducing response and remission in mild-moderate Ulcerative colitis (UC) and maintaining
      remission when used as an add-on to 5ASA derivatives, only with strict adherence to treatment
      overtime.

      Objectives: Facing the low rate of response to therapies in IBD, the need for new treatments
      and the use of combination strategies lead us to believe that combining vedolizumab and
      curcumin may have a synergistic effect and will enable optimal immunomodulation.

      Hypothesis: Concomitant oral curcumin in IBD patients with colonic involvement will augment
      remission rates as well as clinical and biochemical response.

      Type of research and methods of data collection: A randomized controlled trial in 84 adults
      with colonic IBD (UC and CD). Eligible patients are during vedolizumab induction, patients
      will randomized will be into curcumin or placebo. Data will managed by investigators.
