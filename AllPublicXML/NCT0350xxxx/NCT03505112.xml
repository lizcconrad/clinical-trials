  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal-directed therapy (GDT) has been applied to various clinical settings and has been widely
      researched recently as a method for perioperative management of patients. Radical cystectomy
      is a complex surgical procedure in which the bladder is removed, followed by urinary
      diversion. It is an extensive and time-consuming intervention and has high probability of
      fluid imbalance and bleeding during surgery. We hypothesized that the application of GDT in
      these patients would improve clinical postoperative outcomes. Therefore, we will attempt to
      evaluate improvement of postoperative outcomes after applying GDT protocol based on changes
      in stroke volume index, cardiac index and mean arterial pressure in radical cystectomy.

    <description>The patients in GDT group will receive intravenous crystalloid fluid or vasopressor or inotropic agent according to the goal-directed therapy protocol utilizing FloTrac / EV1000 clinical platform (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA).
After induction of anesthesia, the baseline stroke volume index (SVI) is measured and then 200-250 ml of crystalloid is administered over 5-10 minutes. If SVI increase by ≥10%, 200-250 ml of crystalloid is given repeatedly until the increase in SVI &lt;10%. If SVI does not increase by ≥10% and there is no decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP), revaluate SVI every 10 minutes. Despite an increase in SVI of &lt;10% after fluid challenge, if a decrease in MAP is accompanied by cardiac index (CI) ≤ 2.5 L/min/m2, dobutamine is administered by continuous infusion. If there is a decrease in MAP but no decrease in CI, start low dose norepinephrine continuous infusion.</description>
