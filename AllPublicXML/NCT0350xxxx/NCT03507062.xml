  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will investigate the effect od different crystalloids with increasing
      strong ion difference (SID) on plasmatic pH and urinary electrolytes.

      Every patient will receive a solution with known SID at two different volumes to investigate
      effects of different hemodilution in vivo during general anesthesia.
