      Randomized, single-center, waiting-list control group study: Introvision as preventative in
      Migraine

      Randomized, single center, waiting-list group control study to evaluate the effect of
      Introvison, a mental and emotional self regulation method to reduce headache days in patients
      with migraine, migraine and tension type headache and chronic migraine. The number of
      headache days 3 months after completion of the last session of Introvision will be compared
      with the number of headache days of the waiting list group in the month before the course to
      learn Introvision.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of headache days per month</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 months, as the course to learn Introvision and the three individual sessions will take nearly 2 months to be completed, and headaches per month will be assessed in the month 3 months after the last session of Introvision.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of headache days per month 3 months after completion of the last session of Introvision will be compared with the number of headache days of the waiting list group in the month before the course to learn Introvision.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Headache intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Headache intensity rated by the patients themselves with a scale in the headache diary: weak (=1) , moderate (=2), severe (=3) headache. Scores may range from 1 to 3. Average headache intensity of the attacks per months will be compared three months after the last session of Introvision compared to the waiting list group before Introvison.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>acute medication per month</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 months, experimental group compared to the waiting list group</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days with acute medication against migraine attacks/headache per month 3 months after completion of the last session of Introvision will be compared with the number of days with acute medication per month of the waiting list group in the month before the course to learn Introvision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>number of headache days per month in pooled groups analysis before and 3 months after Introvision as parameter for the efficacy of Introvision</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>number of headache days per months in pooled groups analysis before and 3 months after Introvision, measured with the number of headache days per months as in the primary outcome measure, but both groups together compared before Introvision and three months after the last session</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Headache Management Self-efficacy Scale-German-short form (HMSE-G-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The headache specific self-efficacy scale (Headache Management Self-efficacy Scale-German-short form: HMSE-G-SF) consists of 6 items with a 7-point response scale which ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).The 6 items measure self-efficacy beliefs, for instance: &quot;There are things I can do to alleviate the headache&quot;. The scores for each of the six items are combined to compute the total score, that may range from 6 to 42 points. A higher score indicates a stronger self-efficacy in headache management. It is measured before Introvision and three month after the last session of Introvision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Headache-Impact Test 6, HIT-6</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Impact of headache (Headache-Impact Test 6, HIT-6), compared three months after the last session of Introvision to the waiting list group before introvision. The total score may range from 6 to 78 points, a higher score indicates a higher impact of headaches on daily activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>overall satisfaction of patients</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked whether they would recommend Introvision for headache patients and can choose between &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Influence of frequency of exercises as exploratory outcome measure</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Influence of frequency of self-regulation exercises per week on outcome, measured with reduction of headache days per month before and after Introvision.
The frequency of self-regulation exercises is documented by the patients themselves on average in a month in the headache diary, with a three categories scale: 0 exercise per week; 1-3 exercises per week, more than 4 exercises per week.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>patients' mastery of introvision as exploratory outcome measure</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>investigators' estimation of patients' mastery of introvision,. Evaluated by the investigator after the last session in a three category scale: good mastery, moderate mastery, insufficient mastery.
Does the mastery of introvision influence the reduction of headache days per month?</description>
