  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of IMAB362 plus mFOLFOX6 compared with
      placebo plus mFOLFOX6 (as first-line treatment) as measured by Progression Free Survival
      (PFS) in participants with Claudin (CLDN)18.2 positive, HER2-negative locally advanced
      unresectable or metastatic gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma.

      This study will also evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of IMAB362, as well as its
      effects on quality of life. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of IMAB362 and the immunogenicity profile
      of IMAB362 will be evaluated as well.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a generic, preference-based measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item self-reported measure of functioning and wellbeing, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples.</description>
