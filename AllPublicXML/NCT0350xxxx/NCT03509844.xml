  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares three established, manual based psychotherapies for Complex
      Post-traumatic Stress disorder (CPTSD) in patients with childhood trauma (e.g. sexual abuse,
      violence). The primary aim of the study is to compare phase-oriented treatment (Stabilization
      + Exposure) with two non-phased treatments, Exposure and Stabilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available treatment procedures for PTSD are largely developed within the context of adult
      trauma (e.g. accidents, natural disasters, rape or combat). The need for additional treatment
      options targeting dysfunctional affect regulation and interpersonal problems in patients
      suffering after childhood trauma is debated in research and clinical settings.

      96 patients will be recruited from referrals to an in-patient clinic in Norway called Modum
      Bad. After assessment, patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms.
      One-third will receive 10 weeks of Prolonged Exposure, one-third 10 weeks of Skills Training
      in Affect and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR), and the last third a phase-based treatment
      lasting 16 weeks (STAIR + Narrative Therapy).
