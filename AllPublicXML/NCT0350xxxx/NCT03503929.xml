  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LaparoGuard is intended as an adjunctive safety system for laparoscopic surgery. The system
      allows surgeons to virtually annotate a safe anatomical volume inside the body cavity of the
      patient during a laparoscopic surgery. The surgeon then receives notification throughout the
      procedure whenever a tracked rigid instrument has exited that volume. This open label,
      prospective, feasibility, single site, multi-investigator trial will evaluate the feasibility
      and usability of the LaparoGuard system during laparoscopic surgical procedures.

      PHASE 1) LaparoGuard will be used as an adjunctive tool for maintaining safety during
      procedures performed by expert surgeons. The pre-operative instructions for use will be
      evaluated along with ease of procedural setup, as reported by pre-operative nurses. The
      intraoperative instructions for use will be evaluated along with system usability, as
      reported by the expert surgeons. The perceived clinical utility will be judged by expert
      surgeons. Postoperatively, the system data will be reviewed. This phase will include 4-6
      subjects.

      PHASE 2) Novice surgeons will conduct procedures alongside expert surgeons. Expert surgeons
      will establish the safe zone. LaparoGuard will record all deviations, speed and smoothness of
      tip movements. The training utility of LaparoGuard will be assessed by both the expert and
      novice surgeons. This phase will include 4-6 subjects.

    <description>For each surgical procedure conducted, the case will be defined as a technical success if: the surgical team is able to complete the procedure without needing to turn off the LaparoGuard system. Failure will be if the operator deems it necessary to stop utilizing the LaparoGuard system and resort to the standard (non-annotated) endoscopic camera feed. Potential reasons for doing so may be device reporting errors, such as the LaparoGuard system consistently incorrectly reporting that a surgical tool has exited the safe zone.
In emergency situations, such as changes in medical condition unrelated to use of the LaparoGuard system, the operator may also deem it necessary to resort to the standard-of-care; however, these situations will not be judged as failures and the case data will be utilized for study purposes up until that point.</description>

    <description>Following setup of the LaparoGuard system preoperatively, but prior to bringing the patient into the surgical suite, study staff will conduct a short interview with the surgical nurses to evaluate their comfort and ease with the system setup procedures. If any use errors or confusion were observed by the study staff, these shall be discussed in depth. Comments reported by the nurses on difficulties encountered and potential simplifications to the procedures will be recorded.</description>
