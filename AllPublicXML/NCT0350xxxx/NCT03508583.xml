  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family-centred care (FCS) is considered the best practice in providing rehabilitation to
      children with disabilities and special needs. Family-centred care has been described as a
      partnership approach to healthcare decision making. As a philosophy of healthcare, today many
      multidisciplinary healthcare facilities have organized their services according to a
      family-centred approach. TheMeasure of Processes of Care (MPOC) is the most widely used
      instrument to assess parents' self-reported experiences of family-centred behaviours of
      rehabilitation services providers. The aim of this study is to translate the scale to Turkish
      and to determine validity and reliability of The Measure of Processes of Care (MPOC 56- 20-
      SP)

  <detailed_description>

      The MPOC is a questionnaire designed to find out what parents of children with disabilities
      think of the services they and their children receive and how these services affect their
      psychosocial outcome. MPOC exists in two versions: the 56-item version was published in 1995
      and the MPOC-20 in 2004. The20-item version was developed due to disadvantage of the longer
      version, because its completion can be very time consuming and the consequences of low
      respondent percentages . King and colleagues assert that the56-item MPOC is useful for
      research, while the MPOC-20 is better applied as a measure of parents' perceptions of the
      elements of FCS. The 20 items in the short version are distributed among the same ﬁve scales
      as in the MPOC-56. This ensures that the MPOC-56/20 captures aspects of care and services
      that have most importance for parents. The items are included in one of the following ﬁve
      scales:

      1 Enabling and partnership; 2 Providing general information; 3 Providing speciﬁc information
      about the child; 4 Coordinated and comprehensive care; 5 Respectful and supportive care.

      The Measure of Processes of Care for Service Providers (MPOC-SP) was developed to assess FCS
      from the perspective of professionals. The MPOC-SP has also been used in many different
      studies with different populations.

    <description>Assessing of the participation level of children. The Measure of processes of care-56 (MPOC 56) will be applied for once for 300 participants. The MPOC consists of 56 questions, which are related to important aspects of care that are closely related with satisfaction of parents. The 56 items are divided into ﬁve factorially deﬁned subscales: Enabling and Partnership (EP), ProvidingGeneral Information (PGI), Providing Speciﬁc Informationabout the Child (PSI), Coordinated and Comprehensive Care(CCC) and Respectful and Supportive Care (RS). The items are answered on a seven-point scale ranging from 7 ('to a very greatextent') to 1 ('not at all'), with a 0 for 'Not applicable'. A higherscore reﬂects a more favourable judgement of the care process.</description>

The Measure of Processes of Care for Service Providers consists of 27 items categorized into four scales: (1) Showing Interpersonal Sensitivity (SIS), (2) Providing General Information (PGI), (3) Communicating Specific Information about the Child (CSI), and (4) Treating People Respectfully (TPR), .All response options are labelled, ranging from 1 ('never') to 7 ('to a great extent'). A higherscore reﬂects a more favourable judgement of the care process.</description>
