  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. There is a growing demand for long-term care settings. Care-home residents are a
      vulnerable group with high levels of physical dependency and cognitive impairment. Long-term
      care facilities' policy need to adapt and offer more effective and sustainable interventions
      to address their complex physical and mental health needs. Despite the increasing emphasis on
      patient and public involvement, marginalised groups such as care-home residents, can be
      overlooked when including people in the research process. The GET READY project aims to
      integrate service-learning methodology into Physical Therapy and Sport Sciences University
      degrees by offering students individual service opportunities (placements) with residential
      care homes, in order to co-create the best suited intervention with researchers, older adults
      of both genders (end-users) in care homes, health professionals, caregivers, family members
      and policy makers.

      Methods. Stage 1 will integrate a service-learning methodology within a Physical Therapy
      module in Glasgow and Sport Sciences module in Barcelona, design two workshops for care home
      residents and conduct a co-creation protocol. Stage 2 will assess the intervention
      feasibility, safety and preliminary effects of the co-created intervention in a group of 60
      care home residents, within a two-armed pragmatic randomized clinical trial.

    <description>Stage 1. Workshops and co-creation protocol. A purposive sampling strategy will be used to identify a total of 5 to 6 residents living in one care home in Glasgow and in one care home in Barcelona. The service-learning methodology will be integrated within a current module in the Physical Therapy degree in a University located in Glasgow and in the Sport Sciences degree in a University located in Barcelona. A group of students will be involved in the design of two workshops for care home residents. After the two workshops, we will conduct two discussion groups. The first discussion group will be conducted by the same three to four students with researcher supervision. The second discussion group will be conducted by the same students, two researchers, three health professionals working in the care home (e.g. physical therapist, nurse, occupational therapist, geriatrician), one caregiver, one family member, and one policy maker will be invited.</description>

    <description>The intervention will be co-created with care home residents and staff working in the Care Homes, relatives and relevant stakeholders (including policy makers), following the aforementioned protocol (stage 1 of the study). The co-creation stage will allow us determine the intervention ready to be tested in a pilot randomized clinical trial.</description>
