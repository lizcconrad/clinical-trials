    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of paroxetine
      hydrochloride 20 mg tablets (test) and Paxil® (reference) administered as 20 mg tablet under
      fed conditions.

      The study design is an Open-Label Randomized, Single-Dose, 2-way Crossover Bioequivalence
      Study with a washout period of 14 days. During each session, the subjects will be
      administered a single dose of 20 mg Paroxetine (one Paroxetine Hydrochloride Tablet 20mg or
      one Paxil® Tablet 20 mg) under Fasting and Fed conditions. Venous blood samples will be
      collected at pre-dose (0 h), and up to 96 h post dose.
