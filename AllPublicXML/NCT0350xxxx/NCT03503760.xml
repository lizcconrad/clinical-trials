  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind crossover study. The investigators applied ELF with a
      device named &quot;LIMFA Therapy®&quot; to 48 fibromyalgic patients, assigned in two groups (true-sham
      and sham-true). Fibromyalgia severity was assessed with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire
      (FIQ), quality of sleep with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and
      global quality of life with Short Form-12 of Physical and Mental Health Summary (SF-12)
      questionnaire.

      In the first part of the protocol the group true-sham received 6 twice a week sessions of
      true ELF therapy of 1 hour, following the antinflammatory, analgesic and biorhythm settings
      of the device &quot;LIMFA Therapy®&quot;. The sham-true group patients received 6 twice a week sessions
      of sham therapy (no therapy).

      During the second part of the protocol, the true-sham group received the sham therapy twice a
      week for 3 weeks and the sham-true group received the actual true therapy twice a week for 3
      weeks.

      For the assessment of pain, sleep quality and global quality of life, a set of questionnaires
      were administrated at specific stages of the protocol. Questionnaires were administrated
      every three weeks: before the first therapy, after the first course of therapy, after the
      washout period, after the second course of therapy, and 3 weeks after the end of treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients have been randomized in two groups using &quot;Research randomizer&quot; avaliable at www.randomizer.org.
The first group of patients &quot;true-sham&quot; received 6 twice a week sessions of true ELF therapy of one hour with &quot;LIMFA Therapy®&quot;, following the antinflammatory, analgesic and biorhythm settings of the device. Then, after a wash-out period (three weeks), it received the sham therapy (no therapy) twice a week for three weeks.
The second group &quot;sham-true&quot; received 6 twice a week sessions of sham therapy (no therapy) and then, after the wash-out period (three weeks), it received 6 session of true ELF therapy twice a week for three weeks.
A set of questionnaires were administrated: before first session, after first session, after the wash-out period, after second session and after three week follow-up in both groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participant and care provider were unaware of the treatment as the machine does not make any sound or heat during the session. Only the nurse that physically connect the cable to the generator knows if the patient recieve or not the therapy but she was not involved in clinical evaluation.</masking_description>

    <description>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire is a comprehensive questionnaire for evaluation of fibromyalgia severity. The scale range is from 0 to100 and higher values are considered worse outcomes. In the severity analysis a FIQ score from 0 to 38 represents a mild condition, from 39 to 58 represents a moderate condition, and from 59 to 100 a severe condition. A reduction of FIQ between 10 and 20% is related to a clinically significative intervention. (Bennett, R. et al.(2009))</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSQI</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire measures the quality of sleep. The scale range is from 0 to 21. Higher scores are related to worse sleep condition and the best cut-off score is 5: starting from it, people are identified as affected by sleep disorders. A significant reduction of sleep impairment after treatment is one of the secondary outcome.</description>

    <description>Short Form-12 of Physical and Mental Health Summary measures global quality of life.
The results consist of two index: Physical Component Summary(PCS) and Mental Component Summary(MCS). The lower outcomes represent a worse physical and mental condition. A significant improvement of quality of life after treatment is one of the secondary outcome.</description>
