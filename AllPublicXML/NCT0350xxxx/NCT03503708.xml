      Alcoholic liver disease represents the major health issues and it ranges from simple
      steatosis to cirrhosis. There is a paucity of data to support the allopathic intervention
      among these group of patients. Livitol-17 consist of the 3 whole herbs and extract which has
      antioxidant, hepatoprotective as well as reno-protective properties. The aim of this trial is
      to study the efficacy of herbal supplement to improve the liver function of alcoholic liver
      disease subject.
