  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in three American adults have prediabetes, and up to 70% of adults with prediabetes
      eventually develop type 2 diabetes. With the high cost of treating diabetes, cost-effective
      approaches are needed to reduce the incidence of diabetes. One new strategy may be to change
      when people eat. Studies in rodents suggest that a form of intermittent fasting that limits
      eating to a short time period each day and involves fasting for the rest of the day
      (time-restricted feeding; TRF) improves blood sugar control and cardiovascular health.
      Preliminary studies suggest that TRF also improves blood sugar, weight loss, and
      cardiovascular health in humans. This study will be the first full-scale, controlled feeding
      trial to determine whether TRF can improve 24-hour blood sugar control, 24-hour blood
      pressure, and cardiovascular disease risk factors even when food intake is matched to the
      control group. This clinical trial will also determine whether the benefits of TRF depend on
      the time of day that people eat. Participants will be assigned to one of three groups: (1)
      'Early TRF' (eat between ~8 am-3 pm), (2) 'Mid-day TRF' (eat between ~1 pm - 8 pm), or (3)
      Control Schedule (~8 am - 8 pm) for 10 weeks. All food will be provided and matched between
      groups.
