  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blinded placebo-controlled trial.

      Patients will be randomized to one of three arms: (1) injection of liposomal bupivacaine at
      the end of the operation, (2) injection of standard bupivacaine at the end of the operation,
      or (3) no injection of local anesthetic. All patients will be able to receive IV and oral
      narcotic medications in the postoperative period on an as-needed basis.

      If a patient is randomized to the LB arm, at the appropriate time, under a surgeon's
      direction, 266 mg of (liposomal bupivacaine) LB in 20 cc of solution was expanded with
      various amounts of normal saline to cover the appropriate surgical field. Our routine
      expansion for a bilateral mastectomy is to add 80 mL of saline to 20 mL (266 mg) of LB. In
      our practice,we use an 18-gauge needle to inject the medication in a &quot;field-effect&quot;
      encompassing all 4 quadrants of the chest muscles (pectoralis and serratus) followed by
      injecting around the edges of the skin incision and drain site. This occurs prior to
      dissection of the pectoralis muscle and implant or tissue expander placement.

      Patients randomized to the SB arm will receive weight-based dosing of bupivacaine,
      administered in the same manner as the LB arm.

      Patients who are in the placebo arm will have a similar volume of saline injected into the
      operative site.

      Postoperatively, all patients will be kept in the hospital for at least one night. Total
      length of stay will be documented. They will all have the option of receiving IV morphine
      injections as well as oral acetaminophen-hydrocodone as needed for additional pain control.
      The administration of these additional medications will be recorded for each patient.

      On postoperative day 1, each patient will be administered the American Pain Society Outcome
      Questionnaire while in the hospital. After discharge from the hospital, we will call the
      patient on postoperative day 2, 3, 5 and 7 to assess pain and satisfaction scores, using the
      same questions each time. For any patients staying in the hospital longer than 1 day, the
      questionnaire will be administered in the hospital on the same postoperative days. Subject
      participation only lasts for these 7 days of follow up.
