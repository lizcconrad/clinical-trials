  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate the efficacy of a newly developed exercise device (RehabTouch) for people
      in the subacute stage after a stroke compared to a traditional tabletop exercise program.
      RehabTouch uses embedded sensors that can track and record the patient's direction and degree
      of movement as they perform exercises described on a computer.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fugl-Meyer Arm Motor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Arm Motor Score is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index which measure arm movement patterns based on a scale of 0 to 2. Zero means unable to perform the movement pattern. 2 means faultless in movement patterns.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Action Research Arm Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) assesses upper arm functioning using observational methods which measures arm and finger dexterity based on a scale of 0 to 3. Zero means unable to perform the task. 1 means able to perform a part of the task. 2 means able to complete the task with compensatory movement pattern or with longer time required. 3 means faultless at tasks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Box and Blocks Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Box &amp; Blocks Test (BBT) score assess hand function and gripping ability by instructing an individual to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment to the other for a period of 60 seconds. The BBT is scored by counting the number of blocks carried over the partition from one compartment to the other during the one-minute trial period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The TIS measures the motor impairment of the trunk after a stroke through the evaluation of static and dynamic sitting balance as well as co-ordination of trunk movement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Lower Extremity Motor Score is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index which measure leg movement patterns and abilities based on a scale of 0 to 2. Zero means unable to perform the movement pattern. 2 means faultless in movement patterns.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) assesses mobility, balance, walking ability, and fall risk in older adults.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 Meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The 10MWT assesses walking speed in meters per second over a short duration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The MAL is a semi-structured interview to assess arm function. Individuals are asked to rate Quality of Movement (QOM) and Amount of Movement (AOM) during 28 daily functional tasks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A standard analog scale that ranges from 0 to 10 for assessing pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to One-month Post-therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS measures spasticity in patients with lesions of the Central Nervous System. Tests resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity.
Scores range from 0-4, with 6 choices.</description>
