  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study about the improvement of cognitive, psychopathological and functional abilities in
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infected patients after eradication of the virus with direct
      antiviral agents.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect that the eradication of the HCV has on
      cognition, quality of life and psychopathology. At the same time, investigators intend to
      study the association between cognitive changes and some clinical variables.

      The sample consists of 80 subjects (40 HCV patients and 40 HCV patients coinfected with the
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV). Exclusion criteria: Cirrhosis, presence of minimal
      hepatic encephalopathy or active drug consumption.

      A neuropsychological assessment is made before the treatment with direct antiviral agents to
      evaluate memory, executive functions, processing speed, anxiety, depression and quality of
      life. Additionally, the following clinical variables are collected: Viral charge,
      immunosuppression (measured with T Cells CD4 (CD4), CD4 nadir and T Cells CD8 (CD8)) and
      fibrosis level, HCV genotype and plasma biomarkers: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF),
      Interleukine 6 (IL6), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-a),Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
      Soluble CD14 (SCD14), Neuro-specific enolase (NSE).

      The second neuropsychological assessment and clinical data collection is carried out after
      treatment, concretely 6 months after HCV is undetectable in plasma.

    <description>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RVLT, Spreen &amp; Strauss 1998) assesses verbal learning, recall and recognition memory; Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale III backward digits subtest (WAIS, Wechsler 1997) assesses working memory. All direct scores have been transformed into T-scores (mean=50; SD=10), which allows to obtain a single memory component.</description>

    <description>Continous Performance Test (CPT, Conners 2000) assesses sustained attention, inattentiveness and impulsivity; WAIS forward digits subtest (WAIS III, Wechsler 1997) assesses attention. All direct scores have been transformed into T-scores (mean=50; SD=10), which allows to obtain a single attention component.</description>

    <description>Stroop Test (Stroop, 1935) assesses flexibility and inhibition of automatic responses; Trail Making Test (TMTA-B Reitan, 1993) assesses visual tracking and flexibility, phonetic and semantic fluency tests (Lezak, 1995) assess verbal fluency; Tower of London (Culbertson &amp; Zillmer, 2005) assesses visual reasoning and planification. All direct scores have been transformed into T-scores (mean=50; SD=10), which allows to obtain a single executive function component.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, change at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-registering scale of 14 items: 7 items evaluating anxiety and 7 items evaluating depression (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983).
Scoring range: 0-21 for each subscale. Scores &gt;10 in each subscale imply a significant anxious/depressive symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 )</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, change at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-registered scale for the assessment of quality of life ( Alonso y cols. , 1995). It consists on 8 dimensions: Physical functioning, limitations for physical issues, corporal pain, social functioning, mental health, limitations for emotional issues, vitality and general perception of the own health. For each dimension, the scoring range goes from 0 to 100, where higher values represent better outcome (better quality of life/less limitations/better functioning).</description>
