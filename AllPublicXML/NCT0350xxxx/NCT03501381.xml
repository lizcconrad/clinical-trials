  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label study of high dose interleukin 2 vs high dose
      interleukin 2 plus entinostat in treatment-naïve clear cell RCC patients who are candidate
      for high dose interleukin 2. Patients will be randomized to ARM 1 (high dose interleukin 2
      plus entinostat) or ARM 2 (high dose interleukin 2). Subjects will receive 2 treatments of
      high dose interleukin 600,000 units/kg administered IV every 8 hrs on Days 1-5 and Days 15-19
      (maximum 28 doses) +/- entinostat 5 mg orally given every 2 weeks starting on Day-14,
      continuously. Tumor response assessment will be performed between HD IL 2 treatments.
