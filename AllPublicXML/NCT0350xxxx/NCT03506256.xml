      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most common bacterial infections, affecting
      150 million people each year worldwide. Clinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or
      complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy and
      have no structural or neurological urinary tract abnormalities; these infections are
      differentiated into lower UTIs (cystitis) and upper UTIs (pyelonephritis). Several risk
      factors are associated with cystitis, including female gender, a prior UTI, sexual activity,
      vaginal infection, diabetes, obesity and genetic susceptibility.

      UTIs are caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as by certain
      fungi. The most common causative agent for both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs is
      uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). For the agents involved in uncomplicated UTIs, UPEC is
      followed in prevalence by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus
      faecalis, group B Streptococcus (GBS), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. Currently, antibiotics — such as trimethoprim
      sulfamethoxazole, floxacin and ampicillin — are the most commonly recommended therapeutics
      for UTIs6. UTIs are becoming increasingly difficult to treat owing to the widespread
      emergence of an array of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Of particular concern are members
      of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which have both
      acquired plasmids encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). These plasmids rapidly
      spread resistance to third-generation cephalosporins as well as other antibiotics.

    <description>The recommended dosage of norfloxacin for urinary-tract infections in adults is 400 mg orally every 12 hours; the drug should be given for 7 to 10 days in uncomplicated infections and for 10 to 21 days in complicated ones. Adverse drug effects were mild and included disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The study shall be completed in accordance with the ICH topic E6 (R1)(CPMP/ICH/one hundred thirty five/95) guiding principle for top medical practice and the ideas enunciated within the announcement of Helsinki and the approval by way of an Institutional Ethics Committee.</description>
