  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomised controlled trial investigating a combination of unilateral
      strength training (cross-education) and mirror therapy for the rehabilitation of upper limb
      impairment following a stroke. This study has been conducted as part of a PhD qualification
      at the Institute of Technology Sligo in Ireland with all assessments being conducted at the
      institute and all therapy sessions taking place at the participant's home. The study was
      conducted in conjunction with Sligo University Hospital and it attained ethical approval
      through the relevant University Hospital Ethics Committee.

      The study necessitated patients with chronic stroke to perform a strength training programme
      with their less-affected upper limb. The mirror and strength training group observed the
      reflection of the training limb in a mirror, the strength training only group exercised
      without a mirror entirely. Patients were referred through Hospital Health Professionals.
      Prior to trial commencement all participants were given comprehensive trial information and
      provided signed written informed consent. A total of 32 participants were recruited. After a
      warm-up participants performed 4 sets of 5 maximal isometric elbow extensions with their
      less-affected upper limb, three days per week, for four weeks. Patients received outcome
      assessment prior to the beginning of the intervention, directly after it and at three-month
      follow-up assessment. All assessments were carried out by a blinded Chartered Physiotherapist
      specialising in stroke rehabilitation. Patients were assessed using established outcome
      measures for upper limb isometric strength, motor function, muscle tone, and self-perceived
      participation.

    <description>Patients performed 4 sets of 5 maximal isometric elbow extensions with their less-affected upper limb (Cross-Education of Strengthening) while observing the reflection of the exercising limb in the mirror (Mirror Therapy) which was placed in the patient's mid-sagittal plane.

    <description>Mirror Therapy involved the patient sitting on a chair at a table with a standard mirror placed on the table in the mid-sagittal plane between both arms, with the reflective side of the mirror facing the non-affected arm. The patient is instructed to observe the reflection of the non-affected arm during the sessions. The patient was not given any instruction on the use of the affected arm.</description>
