  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine if a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical intervention, based on a
      dietetic intervention and physical exercise, supplemented with a polyphenolic extract,
      decreases blood pressure in hypertensive volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Slightly hypertensive individuals, before diagnosed with type 1 hypertension, are generally
      monitored by their physician and given dietetic and physical activity guidelines. The
      objective of this intervention is to prevent onset of a hypertensive pathologic condition.
      However, in many cases, this intervention is unsuccessful, and therefore the patient must
      follow-up with anti-hypertensive drugs.

      Here, in the current study, the objective is to include a nutritional supplement in the
      intervention in order to increase the probability of success of the diet/exercise
      intervention. Previous studies with the supplement Metabolaid has shown the product to
      significantly decrease the blood pressure of slightly hypertensive individuals. It is
      estimated, based on the results of previous clinical studies, that the polyphenolic content
      of the nutritional supplement will reduce at least an additional 10% of the blood pressure of
      the patients undergoing a diet and exercise intervention.
