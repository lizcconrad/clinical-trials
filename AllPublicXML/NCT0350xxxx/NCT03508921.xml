  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) into the bladder is a widely used treatment option
      for patients with overactive bladder who have failed medical therapy. Urinary tract infection
      is the most common side effect of this procedure and therefore antibiotics are given around
      the time of injection in order to prevent these events. While antibiotics are commonly given
      at the time of injection, the duration of these antibiotic regimens are variable. The
      investigators propose a study to investigate different antibiotic protocols and their affect
      on the rate of urinary tract infection after injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravesical injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) is a widely practiced third line therapy
      for non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB). However, a paucity of data exists regarding
      urinary tract infections (UTI), the most common adverse event following injection. The
      investigators propose a randomized, controlled cross-over trial to investigate the utility of
      commonly practiced antibiotic protocols and simultaneously derive information regarding risk
      factors for post-procedural UTIs and their affect on treatment efficacy.

      The investigators plan to initiate a prospective, randomized non-inferiority cross-over
      trial, in which a participant receives peri-procedural antibiotics exclusively at the time of
      one injection, and then at a subsequent injection, completes a three-day course of
      antibiotics post-operatively in addition to the peri-procedural dose. Enrollment is planned
      to achieve a total of 68 participants. Participants will be evaluated at 3 weeks and 3 months
      following injection to identify adverse events and treatment success. Inter-injection time
      will be measured and used a surrogate for efficacy over multiple injections.

      These results, in addition to filling a void in current literature regarding the increasingly
      utilized treatment with BTX-A, have the potential to modify clinical practice regarding
      antibiotic use and decrease rates of adverse events. The means to stratify patients based on
      their specific risk of UTI may be used to facilitate antibiotic stewardship and improve
      patient outcomes.

If allergic to both of the above antibiotics, patients will receive 100mg nitrofurantoin BID for three days.
