  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of IMAB362 as a
      single agent as assessed by an independent central reader. This study will also assess the
      ORR and Progression Free Survival (PFS) of IMAB362 in combination with mFOLFOX6, assess the
      safety and tolerability, assess the effects on CLDN18.2 expression and assess the
      immunogenicity and immunomodulatory effects of IMAB362 as a single agent and in combination
      with mFOLFOX6. This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IMAB362,
      oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (5-FU), evaluate health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL),
      evaluate the Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of Response (DOR), PFS and Overall Survival
      (OS) of IMAB362 as a single agent.

    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the antitumor activity of IMAB362, an Immunoglobulin (IgG1)
      chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against CLDN18.2, in subjects with recurrent locally
      advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma whose tumors have
      high or intermediate CLDN18.2 expression. For each cohort, the study consists of the
      following periods: pre-screening; screening; treatment; and follow-up for disease
      progression. In addition, there will be a survival follow-up period for Cohort 1 subjects
      only.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a generic, preference-based measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item self-reported measure of functioning and wellbeing, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples.</description>

    <description>Participants will be treated with IMAB362 and mFOLFOX6 on a 42-day cycle in which IMAB362 is administered on days 1 and 22, and mFOLFOX6 is administered on days 1, 15 and 29; however, for the first cycle, IMAB362 will be administered on day 3 (instead of day 1) to allow for pharmacokinetic collection. Participants will receive 12 mFOLFOX6 treatments (4 cycles). Beginning at cycle 5, participants may continue on 5-FU and leucovorin along with IMAB362 for the remainder of the study per investigator's discretion. mFOLFOX6 treatment includes oxaliplatin: intravenous [IV] infusion, leucovorin: IV infusion, fluorouracil bolus: IV bolus, fluorouracil infusion: continuous IV infusion.</description>
