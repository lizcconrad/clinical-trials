  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial increases radiation to areas of the brain considered to be at risk for
      cancer. The at-risk areas are identified by a biological MRI scan. The study will look at
      side effects of the radiation and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if increasing radiation dose to at-risk areas impacts overall survival
      without causing a decrease in quality of life or an increase in radiation side effects.

      Standard radiation dose for glioblastoma (GBM) is 60 Gray in 30 fractions, with patients
      receiving 1 fraction per day, Monday through Friday.

      This trial will use a total of 75 Gray in 30 fractions, with participants receiving 1
      fraction per day, Monday through Friday. Participants will still receive the standard
      chemotherapy (temozolomide) at the standard dose (75 mg/m2, once daily, 7 days a week).

      This study also uses a different imaging technique to identify the tumor target and the
      tissues at risk. Normal imaging techniques will be used to define the standard target volume
      and will receive the standard radiation dose (60 Gray). A special MRI sequence will identify
      at risk areas based on diffusion and perfusion abnormalities. This area will receive the
      higher radiation dose (75 Gray).

      Participants will also be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires and neurocognitive
      evaluations at specific time points. This is to identify any side effects from the higher
      radiation dose. Preliminary work done at University of Michigan suggests a lack of side
      effects from the higher dose of radiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to provide informed consent

          -  Newly diagnosed, histologically-confirmed supratentorial WHO grade IV gliomas
             including glioblastoma (all variants) and gliosarcoma.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.≥

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70

          -  Minimal life expectancy of 12 weeks.

          -  Maximal contiguous volume of tumor based on high b-value diffusion MRI and perfusion
             MRI &lt; 1/3 volume of brain

          -  Patients must be treated within 6 weeks of most recent resection

        Within 21 days of radiation fraction 1, the following blood test parameters must be met:

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL (transfusion is acceptable)

          -  absolute neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm3

          -  platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3

          -  total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless elevated bilirubin is
             related to Gilbert syndrome)

          -  ALT and AST ≤ 5 x ULN

          -  serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent glioma, or tumor involving the brainstem or cerebellum. Prior low-grade
             glioma without prior RT, now with malignant progression are eligible.

          -  Prior use of Gliadel wafers or any other intratumoral or intracavitary treatment is
             not permitted. Prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable if interval
             since last treatment cycle completion is &gt;3 years.

          -  Evidence of CSF dissemination (positive CSF cytology for malignancy or MRI findings
             consistent with CSF dissemination).

          -  Multifocal disease (&gt;1 lobe of involvement) of discontiguous, contrast enhancing
             disease as seen on conventional MRI

          -  Evidence of severe concurrent disease requiring treatment

          -  Known active malignancy as determined by treating medical and radiation oncologist

          -  Patients unable to undergo MRI exams

          -  Patients treated with previous cranial or head/neck radiotherapy leading to
             significant radiation field overlap.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection requiring inpatient hospitalization or delay treatment, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or
             compromise subject safety.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ionizing radiation is a known
             teratogen, and temozolomide is a Class D agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects.

          -  Nursing mothers declining to discontinue breastfeeding are excluded because there is
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with temozolomide.

          -  Patients with reproductive potential declining to use an effective contraceptive
             method during treatment are excluded from this study.
