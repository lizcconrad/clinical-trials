  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter， open-label study to evluate the efficacy and safety of a novel PARP
      1/2 inhibitor fluzoparib （SHR-3162）in BRCA1/2-mutant Relapsed Ovarian Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluzoparib (SHR-3162) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine
      diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) 1/2 being developed for treatment of
      BRCA1/2-mutant solid tumor. The tolerability, safety and PK of fluzoparib has been evaluated
      in Phase 1 study. An oral formulation is the focus of current development efforts.
