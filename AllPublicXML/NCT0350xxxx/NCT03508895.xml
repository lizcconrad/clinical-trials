  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to study the effect of whole hemp seed protein, hemp
      seed protein hydrolysate derived bioactive peptide and casein protein consumption on systolic
      and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure. This study is will be conducted in 35 hypertensive
      participants aged between ≥18 and ≤75 yrs who have systolic blood pressure higher than 130
      mmHg or diastolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg. The study will consist of 3 periods of 42
      days each during which participants will consume assigned treatment. Consumption of
      treatments will be from days 1 to 42. There will also be a washout period of a minimum of 14
      days between the 3 treatment periods where the participants can consume their habitual diets.
      The entire study is designed to take 22 weeks from start to completion. The participants will
      consume the assigned treatment twice a day. The treatments are in the form of a smoothie and
      the smoothies will consist of frozen fruit, fruit juice, vanilla and 25 g of protein from
      treatment protein powder which is 25 grams of casein protein, 25 grams of hemp seed protein,
      or 22.5 grams of hemp seed protein and 2.5 grams of hemp seed protein hydrolysate derived
      bioactive peptides. On days 1 and 42 of each treatment period of the trial, body weight,
      waist circumference, blood pressure, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI)
      will be measured. Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) over 24 hours will also be measured on day
      1 of phase 1 and day 42 of each treatment period of the trial.
