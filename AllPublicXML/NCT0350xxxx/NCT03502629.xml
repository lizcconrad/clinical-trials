  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a multi-center, prospective, open-label, two-stage optimized design, single-arm, phase
      II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GB226 for the treatment of relapsed
      and refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), and to evaluate the immunogenicity of
      GB226.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GB226, 3mg/kg/time, is intravenously infused once every two weeks until disease progression,
      intolerable toxicity or study withdrawal decided by the investigator/subject.

      It is expected that each subject will be followed for 2 years. Subjects receiving GB226
      treatment will be followed once every 2 weeks to the end of this study. If the patients
      terminate the treatment and their imaging assessment shows no progressive disease (PD), they
      should be followed once every 6 weeks until progressive disease (imaging evaluation). If the
      patients have progressive disease (imaging assessment), they should be followed every 3
      months until the end of this study or premature withdrawal from the study. Relevant tests and
      evaluation should be completed at each visit according to standard of care. The follow-up
      visits can be performed by telephone.

      During the study, subjects must complete one imaging test and efficacy evaluation every 6
      weeks until disease progression. Moreover, patients should be closely monitored for adverse
      events from subject enrollment to 30 days after the last dosing
