  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Today diabetic nephropathy is a frequent, and the most lethal and costly
      complication of diabetes. Although treating blood pressure with agents blocking renin
      angiotensin system has improved outcome, the prognosis is still poor and no new interventions
      have been successful during the past decade. There is an urgent need for discovery of new
      pathways behind the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy as well as of
      biomarkers which can identify subjects at risk of developing adverse events. Objective: By
      using a multidimensional 'omics' approach, we aim to search for novel proteins, metabolites
      and pathways that will point to the putative new mechanisms which underlie the early renal
      decline.

      Design: Cross-sectional study, with long-term register-based follow-up. Study population: 160
      patients with type 1 diabetes recruited from Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen stratified
      based on stage of diabetic kidney disease, and 50 healthy non-diabetic controls. Endpoints:
      Primary endpoint: Glycocalyx thickness, assessed as perfused boundary region. Secondary
      endpoints: Gut microbiome characterisation and markers of gastrointestinal inflammation,
      autonomic and periphery neuropathy, urine and plasma Flow Cytometry Analysis (FACS),
      metabolomics and proteomics in plasma and urine, and other potential biomarkers.
