    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the influenza virus vaccination in evaluating human immune
      response in patients with lymphoma. Evaluating immune response may increase the understanding
      of how the immune system changes when patients receive treatment for lymphomas by looking at
      the antibody levels and the level of the different cells that make up the immune system over
      time compared to those without lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the seroprotection and seroconversion rates after influenza vaccination in
      patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize influenza-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after influenza
      vaccination in patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      II. To investigate the longevity of humoral immunity to influenza virus in patients with
      lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      III. To assess the timing and strength of the peak immune response to influenza vaccination.

      IV. To assess the effect of different lymphomas and treatment modalities in the immune
      response to influenza vaccination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 14, 28, 90, and 180

                  anthracycline-based chemotherapy

               -  DLBCL in complete remission and within 12 months after completion of

          -  Hemoglobin: 7.0-16.1 gm/dL

          -  Platelet count: 10-600/ÂµL

          -  Subjects who have not received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the current flu
             season and are not suspected to have had an influenza infection in the current flu
             season

        Exclusion Criteria:

             principal investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to

             a temperature â¥ 38.0 C, systolic blood pressure â¤ 90 or &gt; 180 mmHg, pulse â¤ 60 or &gt;
             130 beats per minute, new rash, signs of infection

          -  Subjects who have already received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the current
