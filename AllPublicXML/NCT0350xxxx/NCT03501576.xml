    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the influenza virus vaccination in evaluating human immune
      response in patients with lymphoma. Evaluating immune response may increase the understanding
      of how the immune system changes when patients receive treatment for lymphomas by looking at
      the antibody levels and the level of the different cells that make up the immune system over
      time compared to those without lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the seroprotection and seroconversion rates after influenza vaccination in
      patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize influenza-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after influenza
      vaccination in patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      II. To investigate the longevity of humoral immunity to influenza virus in patients with
      lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      III. To assess the timing and strength of the peak immune response to influenza vaccination.

      IV. To assess the effect of different lymphomas and treatment modalities in the immune
      response to influenza vaccination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 14, 28, 90, and 180

               -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have received 1 cycle of
                  anthracycline-based chemotherapy

               -  DLBCL in complete remission and within 12 months after completion of

             be available for all study visits

          -  Hemoglobin: 7.0-16.1 gm/dL

          -  Platelet count: 10-600/µL

          -  Subjects who have not received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the current flu
             season and are not suspected to have had an influenza infection in the current flu
             season

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or
             hepatitis B virus (HBV); this information will be obtained verbally from the patient

          -  Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
             investigator is a contraindication to study participation; this includes any chronic
             medical condition, defined as persisting 3 months (defined as 90 days) or longer, that
             would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable

             principal investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to
             assess safety parameters as required by the protocol and was not due to an influenza
             infection

          -  Subjects taking long-term systemic steroids defined as greater than 3 months in the
             past 12 months

          -  Subjects who, at screening, have abnormal vital signs and/or physical exam, including
             a temperature ≥ 38.0 C, systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 or &gt; 180 mmHg, pulse ≤ 60 or &gt;
             130 beats per minute, new rash, signs of infection

          -  Subjects who have already received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the current
