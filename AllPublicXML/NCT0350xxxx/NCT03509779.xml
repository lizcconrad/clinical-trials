  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present research is to identify an &quot;EMT signature&quot;, associated with long
      disease-free survival after surgery, which might potentially lead to specific treatment
      recommendations, thanks to an integrated molecular approach, including tissue analysis at
      DNA, RNA and miR levels Fonctional analyses using lung cancer cell lines will subsequently be
      used to validate markers identified in tumor screenings.

      One critical issue in studying oncogenesis is the comprehensive understanding of tumor genome
      complexity. Molecular subtypes may be identified through large-scale molecular screenings or
      gene expression analyses and molecular signatures are recognized as a relevant source of
      disease stratification.

      We focus on NSCLC patients with localized diseases that are included in the ONCOHEGP tissue
      collection project (OncoHEGP, Ministere de la Recherche n° DC 2009-950). We had previously
      shown that in EGFR mutated cancer, reactivation of TWIST1 was reversibly linked to EMT and to
      survival. To go further, we planed to investigate EMT in a large cohort of patients with lung
      cancer to identify prognostic and predictive markers.

      We will integrate mutation, and copy number alterations to EMT gene expression analysis and
      miR profilling to analyse tumor phenotype. Tumor phenotype, miR signatures, mutation status
      will help classify patients according to survival.

      Clinical data will be assessed thanks to the epithor database. Epithor is a
      government-recognized clinical database, accredited by the French Health Authorities (Haute
      Autorité de Santé) and is supported by the National Cancer Institute (Institut National du
      Cancer).

      EMT characterization and scoring is done using 10 markers by qPCR, mutation and CNV
      screenings by targeted NGS analysis, miRs signature by MIRSeq and qPCR.
