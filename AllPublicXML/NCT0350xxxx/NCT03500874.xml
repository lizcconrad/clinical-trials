    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to optimize the overall survival of patients with resectable
      colorectal liver metastasis who have undergone liver metastasis resection. The patients will
      be treated with systemic chemotherapy plus hepatic arterial infusion With floxuridine, or
      with systemic chemotherapy only
