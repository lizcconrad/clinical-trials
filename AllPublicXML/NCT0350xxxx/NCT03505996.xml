  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      CS1001 monotherapy for relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (rr-cHL)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects with rr-cHL who failed at least two prior lines of therapies are planned to
      receive CS1001 1200 mg intravenous infusion every three weeks until progression of disease,
      intolerable toxicity, consent withdrawn or death.The primary endpoint of this trial is
      objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by independent radiological review committee
      (IRRC) based on Criteria for Response Assessment of Lymphoma: Lugano 2014 Classification.
