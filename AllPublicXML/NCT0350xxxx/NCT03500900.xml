  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inactivates glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Whether DPP-4
      inhibition affects GLP-1 metabolism in vivo and/or food intake remains unknown.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of vildagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) on gastric
      accommodation and ad libitum food intake in healthy volunteers (HVs).These effects will be
      evaluated in two randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded trials. Each protocol will
      include ten volunteers.

      Protocol 1: Sixty minutes after treatment a nutrient drink (270 kcal) will be
      intragastrically infused and intragastric pressure (IGP) will be measured for one hour.

      Protocol 2: 60 min after treatment the participants consume one nutrient drink (300 kcal).
      Thirty minutes hereafter, the participant will eat ad libitum from a free-choice buffet for
      30 minutes. Blood will be collected at several time points to measure active GLP-1 plasma
      levels.
