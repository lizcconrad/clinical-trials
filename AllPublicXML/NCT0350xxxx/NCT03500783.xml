      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) delivered
      to the extracorporeal circulation circuit for cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion
      injury during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
      A total of 60 patients with ischemic heart disease referred for CABG with CPB are included in
      prospective randomized study. Patients are randomized to receive standard treatment or
      surgery based on modified CPB protocol. According to modified protocol, 40-ppm NO is supplied
      to the CPB circuit during CABG. The primary endpoints are changes in cardiac troponin I
      (cTnI) levels at 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery compared with baseline. The secondary end
      points are the changes in the levels of creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB) compared with
      baseline and vasoactive inotropic score (VIS) at 6, 24, and 48 hours. NO supplied to the CPB
      circuit exertes cardioprotective effect. Changes in cTnI, CK-MB, and VIS are considered
      indictors of the presence or absence of cardioprotective action of NO supplied to the CPB
      circuit.

    <description>Vasoactive inotropic score (VIS) is assessed at 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. VIS is calculated as follows: (dobutamine μg/kg/min × 1 + dopamine μg/kg/min × 1 + milrinone μg/kg/min × 10) + 100 × (adrenalin μg/kg/min + noradrenaline μg/kg/min + vasopressin μg/kg/min).</description>
