  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implementation research project aims to develop and evaluate models for scaling up KMC in
      health facilities across India and Ethiopia and thereby develop effective approaches to
      achieve high population coverage

    <textblock>
      Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is the practice of early, continuous and prolonged skin-to-skin
      contact between the mother and the baby with exclusive breastfeeding. Despite clear evidence
      of impact in improving survival and health outcomes among low birth weight infants, KMC
      coverage has remained low and implementation has been limited. The multi-site project
      includes formative research to identify barriers and contextual factors that affect
      implementation and utilization of KMC and design scalable models to deliver KMC across the
      facility-community continuum. This will be followed by implementation and evaluation of these
      models in routine care settings, in an iterative fashion, with the aim of reaching a
      successful model for wider district, state and national-level scale-up. The aim is to
      successfully provide KMC to 80% or more of babies born in the study area weighing under 2000
      grammes
