  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that patients with head and neck cancer who have had radiation therapy to the
      structures of the neck are at a greater risk of difficult mask ventilation and tracheal
      intubation than the majority of patients undergoing general anaesthesia.

      Failure to maintain oxygenation can lead to catastrophic consequences for any patient
      undergoing general anaesthesia, such as severe hypoxic brain injury and death.

      As such, the current guidelines from the Difficult Airway Society promote the use of a second
      generation laryngeal mask airway to maintain oxygenation in the event of failed mask
      ventilation or tracheal intubation, a rescue technique that has in most patient groups a very
      high chance of success. Unfortunately these guidelines are by necessity generic guidance and
      do not take into account the clinical performance of these devices in specific patient
      groups. While there is evidence of the effectiveness of the IGEL device as the primary method
      of airway maintenance in many studies there are none that describe its clinical performance
      in a group of patients in whom the rate of failed mask ventilation and tracheal intubation
      are significantly higher than the general population of patients. It is therefore of great
      interest to have an idea of the likelihood of success of rescue ventilation with this device
      in a group of high risk patients.
