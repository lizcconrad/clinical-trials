  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All UK patients who participated in the TARGIT-A Trial were initially treated for early
      breast cancer between 2000-2012. A total of 3451 patients from 33 hospitals in 11 countries
      participated in the trial and a comparison was made between traditional radiotherapy given
      over several weeks (external beam radiotherapy, EBRT) with TARGeted Intraoperative
      radioTherapy (TARGIT-IORT) as a single dose given during the operation to remove the breast
      cancer. The trial was funded by the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme of the
      Department of Health, UK and sponsored by University College London. The results from this
      trial have been published in major medical journals and have already started changing the way
      breast cancer in treated around the world; please see www.targit.org.uk for more details. We
      would like to continue to collect data about the health status of all patients to enable us
      to learn about longer term differences in the effects of these treatments on health. An
      analysis of this information could improve treatment for patients with breast cancer. For
      this, HTA have granted us further funding.
