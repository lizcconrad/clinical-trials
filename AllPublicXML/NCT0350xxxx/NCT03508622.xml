      This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a group telehealth model,
      compared with a standard multi-disciplinary, individualized, in-clinic weight management
      model, for treatment of adolescents with obesity.

      Background

      As noted above, EMPOWER is a multi-disciplinary, team-based clinic model, involving
      physicians, psychologists, registered dietitians (RDs), and physical therapists (PTs)
      providing tertiary care management of obesity. Data from the first two years of EMPOWER show
      that patients with four or more visits (n=109) experienced a decrease in average BMI z-score
      (-0.09SD). This, though modest, is promising; however, both cost and patient retention
      present significant challenges to EMPOWER and other tertiary care pediatric obesity programs,
      and may be barriers to further progress. Much administrative personnel time is consumed in
      working with insurers in order to authorize visits, and nevertheless, this type of
      hospital-based care is poorly reimbursed. Getting to Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA)
      is often a major challenge for our patients, due to the large urban sprawl of Los Angeles,
      traffic, limited and expensive parking, and poor public transportation. Frequent visits
      result in missed work and school days, a burden to families. Adolescent patients face even
      greater challenges, as they learn to manage their own health and balance the emotional and
      social changes required in the transition to adulthood, with family and parental expectations
      and limitations.

      Telehealth technology presents an innovative, cost-effective, and often highly-engaging
      alternative to in-person visits, which bypasses many of the logistical difficulties of
      getting to CHLA. Moreover, adolescents today are highly attuned to, and aligned with, digital
      and mobile technologies, and are natural consumers of media in this format. There is strong
      evidence from numerous published studies that telehealth can be an effective tool for chronic
      disease management. Additionally, many youth with obesity are significantly socially
      isolated, and our current individual patient-provider model does not effectively address this
      isolation in the way we expect a group session will; various published studies of group
      treatment have demonstrated inter-participant support and positive effects of social
      interaction.

      While Empower's current model leads to successful weight management in many of its patients,
      that success is often modest, as alluded to above; and for some of patients, it simply does
      not work. With this study, the investigators intend to pilot a group telehealth model
      targeted at adolescents with obesity.

      Specifically, the investigators aim to:

        1. Pilot a new care delivery model for CHLA EMPOWER patients using group telehealth visits.

        2. Assess the feasibility of using telehealth with adolescent patients

        3. Test the efficacy of group appointments using telehealth

      Hypotheses:

        1. Use of shared medical appointments via telehealth is a feasible, cost-effective care
           delivery model for adolescents being treated for obesity.

        2. Efficacy of this model will be comparable to, or better than, standard
           multi-disciplinary in-person visits. This will be measured by:

           a. Clinical and anthropomorphic data: i. Changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI
           percentile, and BMI percent of the 95th percentile ii. Change in blood pressure
           percentile iii. Change in hemoglobin A1C, ALT, triglycerides b. Quality of life c.
           Self-efficacy d. Satisfaction

        3. Attendance to telehealth visits will be better than attendance to standard in-person
           visits, as measured by no-show rates and same-day reschedules

      Methods and study design:

      Youth 14-18 years of age who meet EMPOWER clinic criteria and consent to the study will be
      prospectively randomized to the intervention telehealth group (n=24) or the standard EMPOWER
      group (n=24). Since the investigators do not expect a statistically significant difference in
      BMI change between the telehealth intervention and standard EMPOWER, power calculations were
      conducted on change scores in Quality of Life indicators. Using Optimal Design software v1.77
      and specifying a = 0.05, anticipated effect size Î´ = 0.40, between-group variance ranging
      around 0.05, and controlling for effects of the covariates on Quality of Life outcomes at 3
      and 6 months, it is expected that 24 participants per condition will provide a moderate power
      to identify a treatment effect for proof of concept purposes.

      The intervention group will receive:

        -  Group telehealth sessions twice per month for 6 months. The group sessions will be 60
           minutes and involve delivery of a semi-structured curriculum including topics such as
           nutrition education, reducing barriers to physical activity, and mindfulness techniques.
           Sessions will be facilitated by EMPOWER providers (physicians, psychologists, RDs, and
           PTs) who will use a combination of: 1) motivational interviewing techniques, modified
           for the group setting, 2) supportive exploration of barriers to behavior change and 3)
           setting SMART goals.

        -  Brief individualized coaching by the program coordinator between sessions via telephone
           or email. It will be comparable to the personalized feedback and motivation provided in
           standard EMPOWER.

        -  Parent telehealth sessions once a month. It is widely recognized that teens' families
           must be willing to make changes in order to increase their child's chances for success
           in weight management. More practically, most food is purchased and prepared by parents
           or older family members, so it is essential that they receive education and support as
           well.

        -  Intervention group participants will also be given Bluetooth enabled scales and will be
           asked to weigh in once a month. Comorbidities such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia,
           PCOS, and NAFLD will be managed remotely through prescriptions and follow-up lab work
           and/or imaging coordinated with the patients' primary care physicians.

      Control subjects will receive the standard EMPOWER model consisting of monthly in person
      clinic visits where they meet individually with a combination of providers (physician, RD,
      PT, and/or psychologist).

      Both intervention and control participants will have in-person visits at baseline, 3 and 6
      months to measure weight, vertical growth, and blood pressure, and complete questionnaires
      assessing quality of life, self-efficacy and satisfaction.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. class 2 or 3 obesity OR

          2. class 1 obesity plus a significant comorbidity, such as impaired glucose tolerance or
             type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver
             disease (NAFLD), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), or obstructive sleep apnea.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. significant intellectual or neurodevelopmental disability

          2. non-English speaking; and/or

          3. systolic and diastolic blood pressures &gt; 95th percentile for age, gender, and height.
             Given the shared nature of group appointments, participants should be at approximately
             the same developmental stage as their peers. Discussion topics may include stigma,
             body image, family dynamics, and school issues, and therefore a wide variance in age
             range or cognitive status could potentially diminish the effectiveness of the group
             sessions. Non-English speaking youth will be excluded due to limitations in
             translation services for such a small pilot project. English speaking adolescents with
             non-English speaking parents will be included. Lastly, patients with stage 1 or 2
             hypertension will be excluded, as they require in-person follow-up for blood pressure
             checks and medication adjustments.
