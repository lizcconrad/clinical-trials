  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most common type of stroke, which has high rate of
      morbidity, mortality and disability. A large number of studies have confirmed that the
      thrombolytic therapy can effectively open blood vessels and improve the functional prognosis
      of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, all guidelines recommend giving thrombolysis treatment
      to acute ischemic stroke patients within 4.5 hours of onset. However, about 1/3 patients
      receiving thrombolysis will have good prognosis, while a large number of patients will still
      be disabled and even dead. How to improve the neurofunction prognosis of thrombolytic
      patients has been a hot topic in the world.

      Recent studies have found that the combined application of argatroban and rt-PA in the
      treatment of acute anterior circulation infarction might improve the clinical prognosis and
      not significantly increase bleeding. Some studies have reported that the combined application
      of argatroban and rt-PA could improve the blood vessel opening rate, and prevent re-occlusion
      after opening.

      Based on the discussion, the present study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of
      argatroban plus rt-PA in the treatment of acute posterior circulation infarction.
