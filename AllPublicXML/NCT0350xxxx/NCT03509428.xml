      Trial Phase: Phase III: A multi-centre efficacy pragmatic factorial design randomised
      controlled trial with patient informed development and process evaluation

      Indication: Patients undergoing major electively resectable intra - cavity cancer surgery
      with or without neoadjuvant cancer treatments (including chemotherapy (NAC),
      chemoradiotherapy (CRT), or immunotherapy).

      Objective: To investigate the efficacy of a community based Structured Responsive
      Exercise-training Programme (SRETP) ± psychological support on surgical outcome by reducing
      postoperative length of stay (LOS) and complications.

      Secondary Objective:

      To investigate the efficacy of a community based Structured Responsive Exercise-training
      Programme (SRETP) ± psychological support to improve disease-free overall survival.
      Cardiopulmonary Exercise test (CPET) variables, physical activity, morbidity, radiological
      markers of sarcopenia, toxicity, tumour down-staging, tumour regression, disability adjusted
      survival (WHODAS) overall survival and quality of life (QoL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Fitter patients have better surgical outcomes. Poor physical fitness measured
      objectively using cardiopulmonary exercise testing has been associated with increased LOS,
      increased morbidity and mortality in many patient cohorts undergoing major cancer surgery.
      Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have detrimental effects on physical fitness, which may in turn
      have a detrimental effect on the patients' ability to withstand surgery. Research suggests
      psychological factors including depression and self-efficacy (confidence to manage
      cancer-related problems) prior to surgery predict recovery trajectories in health-related
      quality of life up to 2 years after major surgery for colorectal cancer.

      The aim is to investigate whether SRETP (Prehabilitation) ± psychological support prior to
      and during cancer treatment before major elective surgery reduces LOS, increases survival and
      improves their ability to self manage. Additionally, we aim to see if this intervention can
      bring about long-term behavioural change in relation to physical activity.

      Trial Design: Phase III: A pragmatic factorial design randomised controlled to assess the
      effectiveness of a prehabilitation programme delivered prior to cancer treatments and/or
      major cancer surgery in patients undergoing elective intra-cavity major cancer surgery in
      Wessex.

      Sample size: 1560

      Intervention:

        1. An in-hospital transition to a community based Structured Responsive Exercise-Training
           Programme (SRETP) ± psychological support (delivered in community/ council gyms or
           Cancer Support Centers). The intervention/s will be delivered before surgery. Patients
           receiving neoadjuvant cancer treatments prior to surgery will receive the intervention
           during and after these treatments.

        2. Control: Standard care with extra monitoring

    <description>SRETP will involve short periods of exercise at a high intensity interspersed with short periods of exercise at a moderate intensity (aerobic interval training). We will also include resistance training in each session. Exercise intensities during the interval exercise-training program are specific to each patient and derived from CPET. Moderate intensity exercise is below the anaerobic threshold (AT). Patients will exercise at 80% of oxygen uptake (VO2) obtained at the anaerobic threshold (80%AT) for moderate intensity exercise - 3 minutes. Severe exercise intensity is recognised as 50% of the difference between the VO2 AT and VO2 Peak (50%∆) - 2 minutes.</description>

    <description>Support sessions will be patient-centred, giving the patient an opportunity to raise any issues/concerns they are having, this may include (but will not be limited to) ways of coping with their reactions to cancer, family and relationship issues, exploring personal issues and dealing with practical issues. Patients will have access to other resources available at the cancer centres including but not restricted to further information about their condition and how to access financial support. These processes reflect the best practice currently being delivered by cancer support centre staff in the Wessex region. Any patient deemed at risk (i.e. from suicidal ideation or self harm) will be reported to their GP, followed up by a letter.</description>
