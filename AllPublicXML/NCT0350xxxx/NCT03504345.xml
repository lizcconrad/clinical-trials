  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) occurs after women undergo in vitro fertilization and
      have multiple embryos transferred but no resulting pregnancies. RIF is a very challenging
      clinical entity for the reproductive physician and the patient. In fact, there is not even an
      agreed upon definition in the medical community. Many potential causes have been investigated
      over the past several years but no clear answer has emerged. Interest has recently turned to
      the endometrium, or the lining of the uterus. Studies have shown that the genes that are
      turned on in the endometrium vary based on how long this tissue has been exposed to
      progesterone, an important hormone that prepares the uterine lining for implantation of the
      growing embryo. In some women, it seems that they require longer periods of progesterone
      exposure to reach the same state of readiness. We hypothesize that an even larger proportion
      of women in RIF population will require longer treatments with progesterone.

      In this study, we will randomize women with RIF who are about to undergo a frozen embryo
      transfer to one of two groups. The first group will have their embryo transfer done on the
      standard sixth day of progesterone treatment. The other group will have their transfer done
      on the seventh day of progesterone. We will be comparing the clinical pregnancy rate of the
      two groups as well as the live birth rate and miscarriage rate. We expect that extending the
      progesterone treatment by one day will increase the pregnancy rate of women with RIF.
