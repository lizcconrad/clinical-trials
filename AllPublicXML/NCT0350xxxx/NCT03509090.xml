  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a recently described block. Although there is still no
      consensus of its mechanism, the published case series seems to promise a new regional
      anesthesia technique for both chronic and acute pain. In this clinical trial, the
      postoperative analgesic effect of ESPB will be studied in patients underwent unilateral
      breast cancer surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study 30 patients will be enrolled to study between March 2018-August 2018. All
      patient will be randomly selected who will be operated for breast cancer surgery between
      determined dates. Age, weight, ASA score, body mass index , additional dissease ststus will
      be recorded. The patients will be divided in two groups. One group will have ESPB at the end
      of the operation and the second group will be treated with multimodal analgesia techniques
      and both groups will receive patient controlled analgesia. Both groups will receive identical
      anaethesia protocols. Perioperative analgesia protocols will provide acetaminophen 1 gr and
      the same dose will be repeated in every 6 hours regardless of the pain scores. In
      postoperative period the pain scores of the patients will be recorded according to the
      numeric rating scale (NRS) in every three hours. If pain score raises over 4/10 on NRS the
      patient will receive tramadol 100mg as rescue analgesia. In case of persisting pain first,
      meperidine 50 mg will be apllied and other multimodal analgesic drugs will be added to
      protocol. At the end of the study 24 hours total opioid usage of patients, pain scores and
      side effects will statistically be analyzed.

    <description>Unilateral ESP block will be apllied as postoperative regional analgesia technique in addition to the multimodal therapy. Before patient is awakened, she is positioned in a right lateral position to perform ESP blocks. The skin will be disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine and 70% alcohol. ESP block at one side will be performed in the lateral decubitis position and at T4 transverse process level by using 10-MHz lineer ultrasound probe (Logic E book XP General Electrics, USA). The probe will be located 3 cm lateral to T4 spinous process in longitudinal parasagittal orientation. An 8 cm 21 gauge needle (BRAUN Stimuplex AÂ®, Germany) will be inserted by using out of plane technique. The ESP blocks proceed with 15 ml of 0,25% bupivacaine, 7,5 ml 1 % lidocaine, ,7,5 ml 0,9 % NaCl as total 30 ml . The injections will be applied after the confirmation of location by hidrodisection developed anterior to erector spinae muscle with 1-2 ml of local anesthetic solution.</description>

    <description>In this group, patients will receive only multimodal analgesic treatment including patient-controlled analgesia prepared with tramadol.Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with tramadol at 3mg/cc concentration is programmed with no basal infusion, demand dose 10 mg and 20 minute lock-out interval.Also, patients received 1 gr paracetamol in every 6 hours.</description>
