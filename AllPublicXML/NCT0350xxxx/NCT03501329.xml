      Investigation of the change of The WHO-5 Wellbeing Index during a year in a Community
      Psychiatry in Denmark.

      Introduction

      In the Community Psychiatry of the town Holbaek part of Region West of The Region Sjaelland
      in eastern Denmark the WHO-5 Well-Being Index has for 5 years been used in order to obtain
      the patients personal evaluation of their actual quality of life. That has given the
      possibility of following changes during the treatment. The questionnaire is easy to
      understand and to use as part of a consultation. The patients will answer the 5 questions in
      a few minutes. The WHO-5 questionnaire is thoroughly evaluated internationally and described
      and used in many clinical situations also outside of psychiatry and fulfill measures of
      psychometric quality. With this work the intention was to try to answer often critical
      questions from our administration and from the press and in the society. There was no funding
      for the work.

    <description>This is a Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) for studying changes in the Well-Being Index during ongoing treatment. In many cases it was not possible to maintain the patients in the study for the intended time period and it was found necessary to accept the latest evaluation as the final measurement of change. It will be possible to report the observation time in months for each single case and to report the median of these periods of observation.</description>
