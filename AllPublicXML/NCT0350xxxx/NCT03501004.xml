    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare vascular and functional neurological changes of
      acupuncture in patients with Parkinson's Disease and Sleep Disorders. In the randomized
      controlled clinical trial study, patients meeting the criteria for inclusion will be randomly
      enrolled and divided into two groups in a 1:1 ratio: the acupuncture group and the sham
      acupuncture group. The intervention is going to be executed using the acupoints
      GV14（Dazhui）and GB20 (Fengchi).The acupuncture needles will be inserted to a depth of 0.8 to
      1 cm using GV14（Dazhui）and GB20 (Fengchi) in the acupuncture group. The sham acupuncture
      group's needles will be inserted to a depth of 0.1 to 0.2 cm with nonacupuncture points
      located 0.5 cm in lateral to the real acupoint or to the right for midline points.During the
      study, researchers will observe changes in cerebral blood vessels and neuroimaging before and
      after acupuncture in the two groups. Using multimodal fusion advanced vascular-neuronal
      imaging techniques could evaluate the effect of acupuncture on brain blood vessels and
      function in patients with Parkinson's disease and Sleep Disorders and provide an objective
      neuroimaging basis for assessing the effectiveness of acupuncture.

      Neuroimaging assessment:Subjects are keeping awake, resting flat on the examination table,
      using rubber earplugs to reduce noise, using foam headbands to fix head movement artifacts,
      closing eyes to calm breathing, fixing the head and minimizing head and other parts of the
      initiative and passive exercise.At the same time, it is required not to carry out any
      thinking activities. After the subject is familiar with the environment, it begins to scan
      and conduct a comprehensive MRI scan before and after the acupuncture needling.
