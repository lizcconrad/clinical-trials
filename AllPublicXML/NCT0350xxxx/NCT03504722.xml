  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop and pilot test feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an adjunct intervention
      for use with Empirically Based Treatments (EBT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in
      order to increase treatment engagement, treatment completion, and improve treatment response
      regarding emotional numbing symptoms. Recovery through Engagement with Shelter Canines,
      Understanding, and Exposure (RESCUE), is an adjunctive, Human Animal Interaction (HAI)
      intervention that will be developed for integration into Prolonged Exposure (PE) treatment.
      Feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy testing of the experimental treatment
      condition will be conducted in a pilot crossover randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted
      with 75 veterans with PTSD randomly assigned to RESCUE delivered with PE (RESCUE+PE) or to
      standard PE initiation (PE + delayed RESCUE).

    <description>RESCUE is designed to adapt to individualized needs based on each veteran's performance. The volunteer training consists of weekly sessions lasting 90 minutes each and occurring at area Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) facilities.All veterans will receive individualized, evidence-based prolonged exposure therapy. Foa's PE protocol will be used given consensus statements indicating that exposure therapy is currently the most appropriate psychotherapy for PTSD.</description>

    <description>RESCUE is designed to adapt to individualized needs based on each veteran's performance. The volunteer training consists of weekly sessions lasting 90 minutes each and occurring at area SPCA facilities. The logistics of the training sessions will be facilitated by study staff, with SPCA animal behaviorists and professionals conducting the training program identical to the program that they use for their general volunteer training. During volunteer sessions, the veteran learns behavioral techniques for training non-aggressive dogs through didactic instruction followed by demonstration and supervised practice. The animal socialization component of the RESCUE volunteer sessions are comprised of the SPCAs current training program, which is designed developmentally such that early training focuses on general topics (safety, basic handling skills) and later training builds on previously learned skills through successive approximation within each individual's zone of proximal development.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Veterans with a principal Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5th edition (DSM-5) PTSD
             diagnosis (via CAPS) stemming from a Criterion A event.

          2. Men or women aged 18 to 64 inclusive.

          3. Given that individuals with PTSD often have comorbid psychiatric disorders,
             participants with comorbid depressive, anxiety, substance use disorders, and
             personality disorders other than Antisocial Personality Disorder will be included as
             long as PTSD is the primary disorder

          4. Individuals with the ability to comprehend and satisfactorily comply with protocol
             requirements and who sign the written informed consent given prior to entering any
             study procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals with active substance use disorders that require medical detoxification
             will be initially excluded from participation, but will be eligible once they have
             completed their detoxification.

          2. Veterans with comorbid Antisocial Personality Disorder, or history of animal cruelty
             will be excluded. Veterans with comorbid disorders that fall into the following DSM-5
             categories will also be excluded: delirium, dementia, amnestic disorders, other
             cognitive disorders and psychotic disorders. Veterans with active Bipolar I or II and
             are not on a stable medication regime will be excluded.

          3. Given evidence suggesting that benzodiazepine medications restrict the therapeutic
             benefits of PE, potential participants will be required to taper and cease use under
             supervision of their prescribing physician. Participants must be off benzodiazepines
             for at least two weeks prior to enrolling in the study. Patients using antidepressant
             medication for PTSD will be eligible for participation as long as they are on a stable
             regimen (i.e., consistent dose for at least two weeks prior to enrollment and
             throughout the study).

          4. For safety purposes, Veterans who based on history or mental status examination have a
             significant risk of committing suicide, or who are homicidal or violent and who are in
             the Investigator's opinion in significant imminent risk of hurting others, will be
             excluded.

          5. Patients who are unable to speak, read, and understand English or are judged by the
             investigator to be unable or unlikely to follow the study protocol and complete all
             scheduled visits.

          6. Patients who report a dog phobia or are otherwise opposed to working with dogs.
