      This study will evaluate the combination of Nivolumab and Ramucirumab in patients with
      previously-treated mesothelioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) [16] and VEGFR2 [34] are highly-expressed on
      mesothelioma cells, and are therefore attractive options for this cancer. We chose to study
      the combination of ramucirumab with nivolumab because of the potential efficacy of these two
      agents in mesothelioma and because of the potential synergistic activity between them [30].
      As previously discussed, immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 inhibitors must contend with a
      hostile, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment due to angiogenesis that results in
      hypoxia. This hypoxia decreases the ability of antibodies to infiltrate the tumor. We
      hypothesize that the normalization of tumor vasculature (by reducing the area of the tumor
      that is hypoxic) with an anti-VEGF strategy (i.e., ramucirumab) used in synergy with a PD-1
      inhibitor will facilitate the infiltration of T-lymphocytes into tumor parenchyma. We will
      conduct a phase II study based on this premise using nivolumab and ramucirumab as second-line
      therapy in patients with malignant mesothelioma who have failed standard doublet platinum and
      anti-folate therapy.
