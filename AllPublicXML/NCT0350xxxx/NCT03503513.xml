    <textblock>
      A cross over study evaluating the efficacy of intravesical gentamicin on the occurrence rate
      of urinary tract infections and bladder complications in patients after spinal cord injury
      (SCI), and to assess its effectiveness in promoting overall quality of life (QOL), community
      living, and participation.
