  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II Randomized comparison clinical trial of activated CIK armed with
      anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for advanced lung cancer. And the aim of this research is
      to study the clinical efficacy and safety of activated CIK armed with anti-CD3-MUC1
      bispecific antibody for lung cancer.

    <textblock>
      Primary pulmonary carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in China, ranking first in
      all malignant tumors and mortality.Immunetherapy is considered to be one of the most
      promising means of human against cancer. This is a phase II clinical trial of single- center,
      The investigators plan to recruit for 90 patients with advanced lung cancer,and all patients
      are divided into three groups.one group will receive cryotherapy, one group will receive
      conventional therapy，and the rest one will receive mixed liquor of activated CIK and
      anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody together with cryotherapy.

      The result of this study was statistic and analysed with the record of Response Evaluation
      Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.1) evaluation standard.
