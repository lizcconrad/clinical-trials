  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic-progressive and neurodegenerative disease. Thus,
      exercise programs are needed to maintain and increase functional status of persons with MS
      (pwMS). Pilates exercises designed by physiotherapist can enhance participation and
      functionality in pwMS. The aim is to investigate the effects of a clinical Pilates training
      on balance, walking, fall risk, respiratory and cognitive functions in pwMS.

      Forty-two pwMS will be included in this randomized controlled trial. Participants will be
      divided into two groups with stratified randomization. Pilates exercises group (n=21) will
      receive therapy once a week for 8 weeks plus home exercise programme. The home exercise
      program group (n = 21) will be given written exercises that matched the aims of the Pilates
      exercises and the program compliance will be monitored by telephone calls once a week. The
      assessments will be done twice at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. The outcome
      measures include the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Timed Up and Go
      (TUG), TUG cognitive and manual forms, 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12),
      Curl-Up Test (CUT), Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), Activities-specific Balance
      Confidence (ABC) Scale, respiratory muscle strength assessment, Brief International Cognitive
      Assessment for MS (BICAMS).

    <description>The 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) is a self-report measure of the impact of multiple sclerosis on the individual's walking ability. The first 3 items are scored 1 - 3, and the other 9 items are scored 1 - 5. Scores on the 12 items are summed. The minimum score is 12 and the maximum score is 54. Higher the score, greater the impacted walking quality.</description>

    <description>Falls Efficacy Scale-International is a 16-item self-administered questionnaire designed to assess fear of falling. Items are scored a 1 if they are not at all concerned about falling going up to 4 if they are very concerned during each activity: 1 = Not at all concerned, 2 = Somewhat concerned, 3 = Fairly concerned, 4 = Very concerned. Item scores are summed to calculate a range of total score from minimum 16 to maximum 64. Higher the score, greater the fear of falling.</description>

    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale is a subjective measure of confidence in performing various ambulatory activities without falling or experiencing a sense of unsteadiness. 16-item self-report measure in which patients rate their balance confidence for performing activities. This stem is used to lead into each activity considered: &quot;How confident are you that you will not lose your balance or become unsteady when you...&quot; Items are rated on a rating scale that ranges from 0 - 100. Score of zero represents no confidence, a score of 100 represents complete confidence. Overall score is calculated by adding item scores and then dividing by the total number of items.</description>

    <measure>Expanded Disability Status Scale</measure>

    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of people with multiple sclerosis. The Expanded Disability Status Scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist. Expanded Disability Status Scale steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with multiple sclerosis who are able to walk without any aid. Expanded Disability Status Scale steps 5.0 to 9.5 are defined by the impairment to walking. Persons with multiple sclerosis with Expanded Disability Status Scale steps 6 and below will be participated in the study.</description>
