    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease whose prevalence is estimated between
      200 and 500 patients per 100,000 persons in France (120 to 500,000 patients). It affects
      women (90%) between 40 and 60 years of age and main manifestations are generalized sicca
      syndrome (ocular, oral, cutaneous) and arthralgia. In 20% of cases, Sjögren's syndrome is
      associated with peripheral neuropathies, and the most common form is painful small fiber
      neuropathy (SFN). SFNs are mainly featured by neuropathic pain including burns (90%),
      numbness (87.5%), tingling (72.5%), electric shocks (70%) and tingling (82.5%) and also
      autonomic disorders (50 to 70%).

      However, there are still important issues that deserve to be investigated by clinical and
      basic research. Among these issues, this study will focus on:

        -  The impact of SFN on the quality of life of patients with Sjögren's syndrome.

        -  The medico-economic impact of the SFN taking into account the repercussions on the
           quality of life, including professional life, usual care cost (analgesics, medical and
           paramedical consultations, hospitalizations or emergency).

      EXPECTED RESULTS

        -  Confirmation of the major impairment in the quality of life of patients with
           Sjogren-associated SFN

        -  Analysis of correlations to highlight or not clinical or biological factors associated
           with quality of life impairment.

        -  Evaluation of the cost attributed to the presence of an SFN in patients with Sjögren's
           syndrome and the pharmaco-economic interest of conventional therapeutic management
           (analgesic treatment, consultation pain) compared to the cost of more aggressive
           immunomodulatory treatments.

      Primary objective: Identify the predictors of quality of life impairment and costs of
      management of patients with Sjögren's syndrome and small fiber neuropathy (SFN).

      Secondary objectives :

        1. Hospital, drug and city-care costs

        2. Distribution of cost items

        3. Part of costs attributable to pSS-associated SFN

        4. Loss of quality of life attributable to pSS-associated SFN

        5. Relationship between the domains of the EQ 5D questionnaire and the other specific
           quality of life questionnaires

        6. Association of the EQ 5D and other questionnaires with the costs (part of the costs
           variance that might be explained by the quality of life).

      PATIENTS AND METHODS / Study population

      Monocentric study in the Department of Internal Medicine of Lariboisière Fernand Widal
      Hospital.

      All included patients fulfilled 2002-criteria of primary Sjogren syndrome.

      Patients are classified into 2 arms:

      Arm1: patients with Sjögren's syndrome and definite SFN

      Arm2 ( Control Group) : patients with Sjögren's syndrome and WITHOUT clinical and
      paraclinical arguments for peripheral neuropathy

      RESARCH PROCESS

      This study will be based on the delivery and analysis of validated questionnaires (collection
      sheet) in chronic diseases, pains or Sjögren's syndrome:

        -  SF-36 for quality of life,

        -  DN4 questionnaire to estimate the probability of neuropathic pain

        -  EQ5D Health questionnaire

        -  ESSPRI (4 questions): Sjogren-patient questionnaire

        -  PROFAD-SSI (19 questions), to assess tiredness, discomfort, pain and dryness symptoms
           associated with Sjögren's syndrome.

        -  The economic evaluation will be done after the inclusion visit and will be based on the
           collection of care resources consumed by the patients during a period of 6 months
