  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a crossover randomised controlled trial. Alcohol or cocaine dependent
      participants will be recruited from inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatment centres,
      on the approval of their treating physician. A healthy control group will be recruited using
      online advertising. All participants will undergo each of three conditions in a randomised
      order; 1) 20 minutes of cycle ergometry at 50-60% of maximum heart rate; 2) 20 minutes of
      exercise at 70-80% of maximum heart rate; 3) 20 minutes of quiet reading. Immediately before
      and after each condition, participants will be asked to complete a computerised Stroop test,
      watch a film containing substance-related images, and self-report craving levels. During the
      Stroop test and film viewing, participants' neural activity will be measured via functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of this study is to examine whether, following acute exercise bouts at moderate and
      high intensities, reduced craving and increased inhibitory control can be observed in alcohol
      or cocaine dependent individuals. As the focus of this study is the potential of exercise to
      be integrated into treatment, individuals in treatment for their dependence, who have been
      abstinent for a short period, will be recruited.
