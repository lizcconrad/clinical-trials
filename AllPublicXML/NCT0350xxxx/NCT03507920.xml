    <description>Measures overall improvement as perceived by the participant. It is a 15-point scale ranging from -7 (a very great deal worse), through 0 (no change), to +7 (a great deal better). Values above 0 denote improvement following treatment, 0 denotes no change, and values below 0 denote worsening after the treatment. The higher the value, the greater the improvement; the lower the value, the greater the worsening. The participant will be asked to provide a value that represents their change (they may give 0, which denotes no change) following the intervention.</description>
