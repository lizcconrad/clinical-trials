  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disentangling the vegetative state from the minimally conscious state is often difficult when
      relying only on behavioral observation. In this study, the investigators explored a new
      event-related potential paradigm as an alternative method for the detection of voluntary
      brain activity and cognitive abilities in the patients with disorders of consciousness.

    <textblock>
      Auditory emotional stimuli have potential beneficial effects on cognitive functions and
      consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC); however, precise and
      accurate quantitative indices to estimate cerebral activation to different auditory stimuli
      remain scarce. In this study, investigators assessed the response of different brain regions
      to emotional stimuli using ERP(Event-related potential),and further investigated the brain
      activation network.

    <measure>electrophysiological index:the cognitive event-related potentional components</measure>
    <time_frame>from 200 msec before the stimuli onset to 1000ms after the auditory stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The event-related potential waveforms uncover voluntary responses to external stimuli that could assist in detecting signs of consciousness to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. P300 is a large positive going potential that increases in amplitude from the frontal to parietal electrodes and has a peak latency of about 300 ms for auditory and 400 ms for visual stimuli. And N1 is a negative potential in the posterior superior temporal lobe with the peak latency of about 170ms.Peak amplitudes and latency were obtained for the interest ERP components(N1,P300) .Peak amplitudes and latency for were analysed in a series of repeated-measures ANOVAs for each component (N1, P2), with factors of condition (emotion: mean happy/angry vs. neutral).</description>

    <measure>CRS-R(Coma Recovery Scale-Revised)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before the auditory stimualtion and 30 minutes after each stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>CRS-R has been designed to differentiate VS from MCS and consists of 23 hierarchically arranged items that comprise six subscales addressing arousal, auditory, visual, motor, oromotor/verbal, and communication functions. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity while the highest item represents cognitively mediated behaviors.</description>

    <description>Neutral voice is a meaningless sound (namely the interjection &quot;ah&quot;) and the emotional stimuli were the same voice pronouncing the same word with an emotional prosody of happiness or sadness.The stimulus material consisted of positive and negative sound selected from the International Affective Digitalized Sounds (IADS) database.In order to identify experimental stimuli sets that were matched for ratings of arousal and valence between the two valence types,investigators used an algorithm to equate normative valence and arousal ratings for the selection of auditory stimuli.</description>
