      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the difference in intubation difficulty scale
      (IDS) score after the placement of the endotracheal tube placement (i.e. insertion of a
      breathing tube through the mouth into the airway) that will occur at the beginning of general
      anesthesia (i.e. combination of drugs to sedate and put you to sleep during surgery) with
      TotalTrack Video Laryngeal Mask (VLM) versus conventional intubation with Macintosh curved
      laryngoscope in adult patients. Both devices are approved by the US Food &amp; Drug
      Administration (FDA) for clinical use in patients. Pending partial HIPAA waiver approval,
      potential subjects will be identified via review of surgery schedule on IHIS. Patients
      undergoing qualifying surgeries and fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be approached.
      Patients will be consented prior to surgery in a private room in the pre-operative area prior
      to the administration of any medications that might affect their cognitive ability. The
      patient will be given an opportunity to either accept or decline involvement. If he/she
      declines to participate in this research study, no changes will be made to surgical or
      anesthesia care, and procedure will proceed as originally planned. If the patient agrees to
      participate in this research study, the following procedures will occur as part of your
      participation: After the subject has signed the informed consent, a research staff member
      will record information about their medical history including allergies (seasonal and drug
      related), demographics (gender, age, years of education, race, and ethnicity), history of
      alcohol or drug abuse, history of smoking, and history of postoperative nausea or vomiting.
      All medication they have taken 7 days prior to surgery will also be recorded. In addition,
      the subject will be randomly assigned (like flipping coin) to either the TotalTrack VLM or
      the Macintosh curved laryngoscope. The subject has a 50/50 chance of being assigned to the
      either device. The surgeon and anesthesiologist will perform routine examinations related to
      surgery. This includes a physical examination and airway assessment, which are standard
      before any surgical procedure. If the patient decides to take part in this study, the
      anesthesiologist will perform additional assessments to further examine and characterize
      their airway. This will determine whether or not the anesthesiologist anticipates controlling
      your breathing during surgery (airway management) will be more difficult than usual. If your
      anesthesiologist deems it appropriate, he/she will use the TotalTrack VLM or the Macintosh
      curved laryngoscope for airway management according to the randomization group the subject
      has been assigned. These devices are used while the subject is unconscious; the subject will
      not be awake while they are being utilized. The TotalTrack VLM consists of disposable parts
      connected to a reusable camera. The reusable portion will be properly cleaned between uses
      per &quot;Videotrack Instructions for Use&quot; (uploaded). Additionally, vital signs (blood pressure,
      heart rate, etc) and oxygenation measurements will be recorded using our standard monitoring
      devices that the physician places as part of your routine standard of care. This data will be
      collected right before, during and 5 minutes after intubation. Following intubation, after
      surgery is complete, both devices will be removed and the anesthesiologist will awaken the
      subject. In the recovery room, he/she will perform another airway assessment. This will
      evaluate the characteristics of the subject's airway after surgery. The research staff will
      record these results. Later, the research staff will conduct a follow up phone call with the
      subject one week after surgery (5-9 days). After this call, research participation is
      complete.

      The Macintosh curved laryngoscope is used as the current standard of care. It is FDA approved
      for clinical use in patients. Totaltrack VLM was created in Spain by Dr. Pedro Acha, and has
      been available for clinical use since September 2014. The device consists of two independent
      disposable pieces (latex free), and a reusable component (video camera) [11]. It is FDA
      approved for clinical use in patients. The first component is a phthalate-free polyvinyl
      chloride (PVC) flexible structure. The second component, a curved &quot;J&quot; shaped rigid
      polycarbonate blade, is distally inserted on the tab of the mask, and clasps the flexible
      plastic structure as an anchorage. The Videotrack represents the reusable component. It
      consists of an upper mounted reusable video camera corresponding to the optic guide that is
      introduced into the left channel of the flexible tube. The VLM does not depend on other
      devices to assure patient oxygenation. If subsequent intubation attempts fail, mask mode can
      be resumed maintaining oxygenation/ventilation without adding further risks to the patient.
      VLM could play a significant role during difficult extubation scenarios and can be useful in
      other settings such as elective surgery, intensive care unit, emergency department, and
      pre-hospital emergency care. VLM features make this device suitable for expected and
      unexpected DAW management.

    <description>The Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) is a mixture of subjective and objective conditions that allows a qualitative and quantitative methodology to the progressive nature of the difficulty of intubation (easy=0, slightly difficult= 0&lt;IDS≤5, moderate to major difficult= 5&lt;IDS, impossible intubation= ∞). It could be used to asses intubating conditions and methods with the objective of determining the relative values predictive factors of intubation difficulty and of the techniques used to decrease such difficulties. It has seven parameters that are scored after an intubation: # of intubation attempts; # of alternative techniques used; a modified Cormack grade for glottic visualization; subjective impression of the lifting force needed during laryngoscopy; the need for external laryngeal pressure to optimize glottic exposure; and the position of the vocal cords.</description>

    <description>The Totaltrack Video Laryngeal Mask (VLM) (Medcom Flow, Viladecans, Barcelona, Spain) is a new SGD model with a combined function: a conventional laryngeal mask (mask mode), and a real time view video laryngoscope/intubation device. The mask ensures continuous administration of fresh gas flow (FGF) for oxygenation/ventilation. These features are expected to overcome difficult ventilation, failed intubation, or difficult extubation [10].</description>
