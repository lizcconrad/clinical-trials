      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical study Of PuraPly® AM and
      standard of care (SOC) compared to SOC alone for the management of Stage II-IV pressure
      ulcers located in the gluteal, ischial, hip, sacral, coccygeal, and trochanteric, malleolus,
      or heel area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to demonstrate how PuraPly® AM performs against standard of care in Stage
      II-IV Pressure Ulcers through a prospective randomized controlled study design.

      Subjects may be enrolled for up to 24 weeks; if healing occurs prior to week 24, a follow up
      healing confirmation visit shall occur two weeks later to confirm maintenance of complete
      wound closure and participation may continue up to 24 weeks. Subjects that are randomized to
      the SOC group have the opportunity to cross over and receive PuraPly AM at week 12 if their
      index ulcer has not healed; they will then be followed for an additional 12 weeks for up to
      24 weeks.

    <description>PuraPly® AM is a class II medical device, that has been 510(k) cleared by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (K051647) and is intended for the management of acute and chronic wound management across a variety of wound types, including partial- and full-thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, surgical wounds, trauma wounds, venous and diabetic ulcers.</description>

    <description>SOC group will receive institutional standard of care which includes, but is not limited to, debridement, negative pressure wound therapy (i.e. VAC), ensuring perfusion and oxygenation, evaluating nutritional status and addressing deficits, offloading, keeping the ulcer bed moist with appropriate cleansing at the time of each dressing change. Standard dressings may include hydrocolloids, alginates, transparent film, foam, moist gauze dressings. In addition, a non-toxic topical antiseptic, may be used per NPUAP Clinical Practice Guidelines (2014) for SOC group only, if colonization is suspected.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Subject has a Stage II-IV pressure ulcer located in the gluteal, ischial, hip, sacral,
             coccygeal, and trochanteric, malleolus, or heel area.

          3. Pressure ulcer should be present for 4 weeks duration and have a ulcer surface area &gt;
             2cm2

          4. If multiple ulcers are present, one ulcer must be identified as the index ulcer.

          5. The index ulcer is free from active infection at the time of randomization.

          6. Willingness to off-load or pressure redistribute ulcer for duration of enrollment

          7. The index ulcer has been offloaded for at least 7 days prior to randomization.

          8. The index ulcer must have been present for at least 30 days at time of study
             enrollment.

          9. The index ulcer is separated at least 4 cm from all other ulcers at Study Day -7 and
             Study Day 0 (post-debridement) and has a margin of intact skin sufficient for
             anchoring of the required study dressing.

         10. Subject has read and signed the IRB/IEC approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) before
             screening procedures are undertaken.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of signs and symptoms of infection at the index ulcer site, including but not
             limited to cellulitis, acute osteomyelitis, excessive exudate, gangrene or deep tissue
             infection

          2. The index ulcer is not free of necrotic tissue and is unable to tolerate debridement

          3. Non-enteric or unexplored sinus tract

          4. Concomitant conditions that in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry to the study

          5. Subject has a known sensitivity to porcine materials

          6. Subject has a known sensitivity to polyhexamethylenebiguanide (PHMB)
