    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of non- TBI (total body irradiation) conditioning for B-ALL
      patients with low risk of relapse as defined by absence of NGS-MRD (next generation
      sequencing minimal residual disease) before receiving a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).
      Patients diagnosed with B-ALL who are candidates for HCT will be screened by NGS-MRD on a
      test of bone marrow done before the HCT. Subjects who are pre-HCT NGS-MRD negative will be
      eligible to receive a non-TBI conditioning regimen as part of the treatment cohort of the
      study. Subjects who are pre-HCT NGS-MRD positive will be treated as per treating center
      standard and will be followed in an observational cohort (HCT center standard of care).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase II pilot trial will estimate survival after a non-TBI based conditioning regimen in
      patients diagnosed with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are pre-allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) next-generation-sequence (NGS) minimal residual
      disease (MRD) negative.

      The relationship of NGS-MRD status to survival in children, adolescents, and young adults
      with B-ALL undergoing any approach to allogeneic HCT will be explored in a larger cohort
      (treatment [phase II] and observational arms of the study).

      The primary objective is to estimate 2-year event free survival (EFS) in pre-HCT NGS-MRD
      negative patients with B-ALL undergoing a non-TBI based conditioning regimen through a
      multi-center prospective trial. The accrual period is 3 years.

      Patients that are NGS-MRD negative with B-ALL may be eligible for the Treatment Arm, which is
      myeloablative non-TBI conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa followed -matched
      related, unrelated, and umbilical cord blood transplants. Patients that are NGS-MRD positive
      will be followed on the observational arm for outcome.

      Study sampling will include NGS-MRD bone marrow (BM) aspirate and peripheral blood (PB)
      samples collected [same day when possible] pre-HCT (within 4 weeks), and post-HCT on days 42
      ± 14, 100 ± 20, and 365 ± 60; PB samples only will also be collected day 180± 60 and 270± 60;
      day +30, day +100, and 1-year post-HCT. NGS-MRD peripheral blood sample only at 6 months and
      9 months post-HCT; (Blast specimen at time of diagnosis or relapse is required for NGS-MRD
      testing).

          -  Patients who have received inotuzumab treatment prior to allogeneic HCT are NOT
             eligible for the study treatment arm. Inotuzumab treatment may increase the risk of
             VOD/SOS for any allogeneic HCT recipient, but could potentiate the risk for with
             busulfan-based myeloablation (study-directed non-TBI conditioning). All

             arm).

          -  Pregnant or lactating females are ineligible as many of the medications used in this
             protocol could be harmful to unborn children and infants.

          -  Patients with HIV or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections are excluded.
             Patients with history of fungal disease during induction therapy may proceed if they

             of non-progressive disease remaining by CT evaluation.

          -  Patients with active CNS leukemia or any other active site of extramedullary disease
             at the time of enrollment are not permitted.

          -  T-ALL and MPAL patients are only allowed on the observational arm.

          -  Patients with genetic disorders (generally marrow failure syndromes) prone to
             secondary AML/ALL with known poor outcome are not eligible (Fanconi Anemia, Kostmann
             Syndrome, Dyskeratosis Congenita, etc).
