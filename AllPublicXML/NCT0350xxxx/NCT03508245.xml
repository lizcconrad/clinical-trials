      This study examines circadian rhythms and morningness-eveningness preference in youth with
      Persistent Tic Disorders (PTDs), including Tourette's Disorder (TD); and assesses the effects
      of wearable short wavelength light therapy on circadian rhythms and tic symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with Persistent Tic Disorders (PTDs), including Tourette's Disorder (TD)
      fail to significantly benefit from existing tic treatments. Case studies have shown morning
      exposure to light therapy, known to advance circadian phase is associated with modest to
      large tic reductions (Coles &amp; Strauss, 2013; Niederhofer, 2003) suggesting the presence of
      circadian abnormalities (i.e., phase delay) in select individuals with PTDs. The present
      project assesses circadian phase and morningness-eveningness preference in youth with
      Persistent Tic Disorders (PTDs), including Tourette's Disorder (TD), and examines whether
      morning use of wearable short wavelength light therapy is associated with shifts in circadian
      rhythms and reductions in tic severity.

      Study participation will take place over a three-week period. Clinician-rated tic interview
      and rating scales of morningness-eveningness preference, sleep, tic, and other symptoms will
      be completed during an initial screening assessment. Participants will then monitor sleep at
      home using an actigraph for one week and return for a baseline clinical assessment of tic
      severity and evening assessment of internal melatonin levels involving saliva sampling every
      30 minutes for 6.5 hours in a dimly lit room. Next, participants will complete an abbreviated
      course (i.e., two weeks) of morning light therapy using wearable short wavelength (i.e.,
      blue-green) light-emitting glasses while continuing to monitor sleep using the actigraph.
      Following this two-week period participants will return for a final assessment of tic
      severity and internal melatonin levels.

    <measure>Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS (Leckman et al., 1989) is a clinician-administered measure of tic severity encompassing tic number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The measure yields independent severity ratings for motor and vocal tics, a combined total tic severity score (0 to 50), and an independent tic-related impairment score (0 to 50).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I (Guy, 1976) is a clinician-rated scale that has been used in a number of clinical trials for over 25 years, and in several studies with TD patients. The CGI-I is a clinician-rated measure of global patient improvement relative to baseline based on the clinician's perspective. Scores of Much (2) or Very Much (1) Improved indicate positive treatment response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Morningness-Eveningness Preferences Scale (CMEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CMEP (Carskadon et al., 1993) is a 10-item measure of diurnal or nocturnal activity preference in recent past weeks. It will be modified to assess symptoms in the past week for the present study. The measure yields a total score ranging from 10 (extreme evening preference) to 42 (extreme morning preference).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Tic Questionnaire (PTQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PTQ (Chang et al., 2008) is a parent-reported measure of tic severity assessing both motor and vocal tics present within the past week. Individual tics are rated separately according to frequency and intensity. The measure yields separate scores for motor and vocal tics, in addition to a combined total tic severity score.</description>
