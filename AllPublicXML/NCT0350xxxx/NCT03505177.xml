  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research study is to characterize gut microbiota composition and activity
      after a daily supplementation of 4.5 g of chitin-glucan during 3 weeks. For this purpose, a
      monocentric longitudinal intervention study without control will be performed. Fecal
      microbiota composition and fecal concentrations of gut microbiota-derived metabolites (bile
      acids, conjugated-polyunsaturated fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids) will be measured.
      In addition, during ten hours following the ingestion of a test meal rich in fibers, the
      kinetic of production of H2, methane and volatile compounds exhaled from breath will be
      evaluated.
