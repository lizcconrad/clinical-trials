  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjogren's Syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by sicca (dryness) symptoms
      of the mouth and eyes. This autoimmune disease is less commonly studied and there are no
      licensed treatments to treat the underlying cause of disease and current management is based
      on clinical experience and/or small clinical studies. This study is based on DSP methodology,
      a multinational, cross-sectional, multi-sponsor survey of robust real-world data. DSP
      methodology collects quantitative market research data. The pSS DSP will survey a sample of
      approximately 230 to 325 rheumatologists and their prospectively consulting pSS subjects in
      France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the US. The data will be collected via physician
      interviews, physician workload questionnaires, detailed patient record forms (PRFs) to be
      completed by physicians, and a self-completion questionnaire by pSS subjects. The data
      collected using this method includes subjective and objective evidence, clinical information
      about individual patients, their disease and their treatment. This DSP will follow three key
      phases: preparatory phase, data collection phase and data processing/analysis phase.
