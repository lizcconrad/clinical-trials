  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the LedRad trial is to determine the efficacy and durability of radiotherapy as
      treatment for patients with Ledderhose disease and to compare this to the natural course of
      Ledderhose disease.

    <description>The economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective, incorporating cost of travel to the hospital and cost of absence from work as well as direct medical cost of radiotherapy (cost of irradiation and outpatient visits). Questionnaires will be used to collect data regarding health care consumption, travel and time costs, and productivity loss at study entry and at 6-month intervals thereafter. In addition to the pain scores, quality of life will be assessed at 6-month intervals using the Rand-36 questionnaire. The utilities based on the results of the questionnaire will be used in a cost-utility analysis, calculating the ratio of incremental costs versus incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALY).</description>

          -  Able and willing to complete quality of life questionnaires in Dutch

          -  Must be accessible for treatment follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgical intervention before for Ledderhose disease

          -  Previous radiation treatment for Ledderhose disease

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule

          -  Not able to lay prone for at least fifteen minutes
