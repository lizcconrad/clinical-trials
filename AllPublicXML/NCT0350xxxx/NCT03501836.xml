  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the performance of both 6 and 10 electrode ECGs from the
      handheld device with the conventional 12 lead ECG. As well as comparing the detection of
      atrial fibrillation, the study will also compare the detection of other heart problems and of
      normal heart rhythm.

    <textblock>
      An Electrocardiogram (ECG) 6 electrode, wireless handheld device held on the chest is being
      developed to allow diagnosis of heart rhythm problems without the need for connecting
      electrodes to the chest, arms and legs as in a standard 10 electrode (referred to as a
      12-lead) ECG measurement. A faster and simpler yet accurate method for acquiring ECG data may
      be useful in many healthcare settings, including screening for irregular heart rhythms such
      as Atrial Fibrillation (AF), which is a risk factor for stroke. The wireless 6 electrode
      device has an extension arm for the handset with 4 additional electrodes (also positioned on
      the chest) to give a full 12 lead ECG signal. This study is designed to compare the
      performance of both 6 and 10 electrode ECGs from the handheld device (used on the chest with
      the subject seated) with the conventional 12 lead ECG (used with electrodes on the chest,
      arms and legs with the subject lying down). As well as comparing the detection of atrial
      fibrillation, the study will also compare the detection of other heart problems and of normal
      heart rhythm. Adult patients attending the clinics at Central Manchester University Hospitals
      NHS Foundation Trust for an ECG assessment are eligible to participate in the study. A
      maximum of 500 patients will be recruited to the study in order to find the number of cases
      with Atrial Fibrillation required to properly compare the methods. A subset of patients with
      normal ECGs will have additional measurements with both methods whilst lying down, reclining
      at an angle and sitting upright to investigate any effects of body posture on chest based
      ECGs.

    <description>We want to explore whether using 6 electrodes on the chest (as in the Rapid Rhythm Handheld 8-lead ECG device) can give the same diagnostic result to the standard 10 electrode (12-lead) ECG, which uses 6 chest electrodes plus 4 electrodes on the arms and legs.
To do this we need to compare measurements taken with the 6 electrode (8 lead) study device to those taken with the gold-standard 10 electrode (12 lead) method.
We want to find out whether the new equipment can detect the same heart rhythms as the standard method, so that ECG measurements might be made more quickly and easily in the future.</description>
