      A prospective non-randomized open label clinical trial to research the efficacy and safety of
      sirolimus in patients with symptomatic, recurrent uterine fibroids or/and various rare
      leiomyoma.

      Recent studies indicate that mTOR pathway is a specific and sensitive tumor target molecule
      in uterine fibroids, which can be used as a target molecule for interventional therapy and
      can provide a new cut-in point for nonoperative treatment. However, the application of mTOR
      inhibitor (sirolimus) in the treatment of uterine fibroids remains blank. Our study was
      designed as a prospective non-randomized open label clinical trial to research its efficacy
      and safety.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patients who suffer from menorrhagia and pressure symptoms and whose pelvic ultrasound
             or pelvic MRI indicates uterine fibroids; or who has underwent myomectomy but suffer
             from menorrhagia and pressure symptoms again with pelvic ultrasound or pelvic MRI
             indicating uterine fibroids; or whose other imageological examinations or established
             surgical diagnosis indicate various rare types of myomatosis and who expect a drug
             therapy.

          2. Symptoms of uterine fibroids can be confirmed if one or multiple symptoms below exist:

               -  MP shows an excessive amount of bleeding during menstruation (＞80.0 mL)

               -  A subject report shows three excessive amounts of bleeding during menstruation in
                  latest six months

               -  A subject report indicates pelvic pressure symptoms/pain that are likely related
                  to uterine fibroids.

          3. According to results of medical history, physical examinations, gynecological
             examinations and laboratory examinations, patients are in a good overall condition
             (except uterine fibroids).

          4. Cervical smears show a normal result or have no clinical significance, where further
             follow-up is unnecessary. If there's a normal result in the latest six month in the
             medical record of a subject, the subject can pass the inspection of cervical smears. A
             HPV test can be applied to subjects with equivocal ASCUS as an auxiliary test. ASCUS
             subjects who get a negative result of a HPV test can be included into this study.

          5. Endometrial biopsy should be conducted to eliminate non-endometrial lesions if
             necessary.

          6. Subjects didn't receive any drug therapy for uterine fibroids three months before the
             clinical test.

          7. Female adults have menstruation (&gt;18 years old) and are not during pregnancy and
             lactation.

          8. Subjects have good organ function and results of their biochemical examinations meet
             the following conditions:

               -  AST≤2.5×the upper limit of normal (ULN),

               -  ALT≤2.5×the upper limit of normal (ULN),

               -  Serum total bilirubin≤1.5×the upper limit of normal (ULN),

               -  Creatinine≤1.5×the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          9. Patients have signed the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients are in a period of pregnancy and lactation (patients delivered, miscarried or
             breast-feed in three months before the treatment)

          2. Patients are allergic to any ingredient of the medicine

          3. Patients suffer from a disease requiring immediate blood transfusion

          4. Patients suffer from a disease that may impact implementation of the study or
             explanation of results. This type of diseases includes:

               -  Known severe blood coagulation disorders

               -  Known anemia that is not caused by HMB

               -  Known hemoglobinopathy

               -  Patients suffered or suffer from cancer of the uterus, cervical carcinoma,
                  ovarian cancer or breast cancer 5) An ultrasonic examination shows one or
                  multiple ovarian cysts with a diameter ＞30 mm 6) Ovarian tumors or pelvic mass of
                  unknown origin 7) Known or suspected endometrial polyp ＞15 mm

          5. Alcohol or drug (such as aperient) abuse

          6. Undiagnosed abnormal bleeding of the reproductive system.

          7. Patients also participate in another clinical medicine study

          8. Patients took part in another clinical trial that may influence this study before this
             study
