  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to undertake a study to determine the diagnostic utility of using RCM for the
      diagnosis of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) in a tertiary referral centre as outlined by the
      recent NICE report (Nov 2015). This will allow an assessment of the potential to avoid
      diagnostic biopsy within the treatment pathway.

      Study Design This is an observational, non-randomised, non-controlled, prospective cohort
      study to look at the efficacy of in vivo RCM as a diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of BCC.

      Study Hypothesis The hypothesis of this study is that the use of RCM is would enable a
      reduction in the number of diagnostic biopsies taken before definitive treatment of BCC by at
      least 50%.

      The secondary hypothesis is that the intra- &amp; inter-observer agreement for interpreting the
      RCM images will have kappa scores 0.6 or greater (indicating good agreement).

      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of Skin Care Network London.
