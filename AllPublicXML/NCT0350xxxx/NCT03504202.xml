    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study which aims to explore the effect of Trimetazidine on the
      improvement of coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with INOCA (ischemia and no
      obstructive coronary artery disease). Enrolled patients will be assessed SAQ(Seattle Angina
      Score), Canadian Angina Grade(Canadian Cardiovascular Society, CCS), Six-Minute Walk Test,
      CFR(coronary flow reserve) .CFR inspection with D-SPECT and pressure guide wire.Patients will
      receive six months Trimetazidine(20mg tid) after enrollment. And their SAQ (Seattle Angina
      Score), Canadian Angina Grade(Canadian Cardiovascular Society, CCS), Six-Minute Walk Test,
      CFR will be followed up.
