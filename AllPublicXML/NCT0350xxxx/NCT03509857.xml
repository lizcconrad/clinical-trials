      Vibration Analgesia in Propofol Infusion During Anesthesia Induction

      Nash, D &amp; Pothula, A

      Background and Significance

      Infusion of propofol during the process of inducing anesthesia can cause a fair amount of
      transient discomfort to patients while the are on the operating table and of intact
      faculties. It is not uncommon for patients to cry out in pain. The investigators have noticed
      this first hand on numerous occasions and have wondered if there is a risk-free way to lesson
      the pain associated with propofol infusion.

      This study will focus on the use of vibration analgesia to potentially reduce the pain
      associated with propofol infusion. Vibration is proposed to stimulate A-beta nerve fibers,
      which transmit information from vibration and touch which, according to the Gate Control
      Theory of Pain (Melzack and Wall 1965), inhibits signal transduction by A-delta and C fibers
      (Kakigi and Shibasaki 1992). Vibration has been demonstrated to be effective to decrease pain
      during vaccinations, phlebotomy, and dental anesthesia (Baxter et al. 2011; Nanitsos et al.
      2009).

      In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate the role of vibration in the reduction of
      discomfort associated with painful stimulus associated with anesthesia induction. Through
      this study, the investigators hope to develop a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to
      minimize patient discomfort during anesthesia induction.

      Study Design

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of vibration as a analgesic
      during induction of anesthesia. It is the investigators hypothesis that both vibration will
      lessen the pain of propofol infusion.

      Patients sets to receive a propofol infusion as part of induction of anesthesia during
      surgery will be recruited to participate in this study. All participating patients will be
      randomized following acquisition of consent for study participation to one of two
      intervention groups: 1) normal standard of care infusion of propofol without analgesia 2)
      infusion of propofol with application of vibration analgesia. Patients will then be asked to
      place a mark on a 100-mm visual analogue scale corresponding to the level of pain that they
      experienced during the digital block. Additionally, Please see the next section for specific
      details regarding the intervention.

      Due to constraints regarding the validity of the linear visual analogue scale in very young
      patients (Stinson et al. 2006), only those aged 8 years or older will be eligible for
      participation in the study. Parents or guardians will provide consent for minors or for
      individuals who are otherwise unable to provide consent themselves.

      Exclusion criteria include The primary outcome will be the level of pain reported by the
      patient following propofol injection, with or without an vibration analgesia adjunct.
      Secondary outcomes will include subgroup analysis for responses in pain as stratified by
      pathology, age, sex, and ethnicity.

      Intervention

      Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (as described above).

      The intervention group will receive vibration only, with application of the BUZZY device just
      proximal to the intravenous infusion site immediately before and during propofol infusion.

      Randomization will be performed by placing equal numbers of indicators for each treatment
      group in opaque, sealed envelopes, which will be shuffled. The surgeon will have access to a
      kit which contains these envelopes. One card will be selected in sequence from the
      pre-shuffled stack for each patient who gives consent to participate in the study.

      Following intervention, patients will be asked to rate the discomfort of the procedure on
      both a Numeric Rating Scale, with a number between 0 and 10, and a Visual Analogue Scale, by
      placing a mark on a continuous 10 cm line corresponding to their level of perceived pain.
      These values will be used to compare efficacy between each intervention arm as described in
      the Statistics section.

      With regards to safety outcomes, no significant safety issues are anticipated beyond those
      inherent to established practice.

      Response cards will not contain any identifiable patient information, and will be linked to
      consent forms only through a numerical key. Consent forms will be stored separately in a
      secure in-hospital location following each patient interaction.

      Intervention will be performed in the operating room during anesthesia induction, as
      indicated, following acquisition of patient consent and randomization to a treatment arm as
      described above. Only a single intervention will be performed. Routine office follow-up will
      be offered to each patient for longitudinal management of any potential harms experienced
      from digital block.

      Population

      Patients will be recruited from Montefiore Medical Center, Hutchinson ambulatory surgery
      center in the preoperative holding area prior to their surgery.

      The study sample size will need to be approximately 200 patients, 100 in each treatment arm,
      to achieve a power of 80% to detect a difference of 10 mm on the Visual Analogue Scale
      between any two study arms. This was based upon a previous study (Nakayama et al. 2001) which
      demonstrated a mean reduction in discomfort between buffered and unbuffered lidocaine of 1.0
      on the Numeric Rating Scale (from 3.5 to 2.5, with a SD of 1.4).

      Given that the study involves a single interaction, there is no dropping out from the study
      or loss-to-follow-up anticipated.

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the previous section. Specifically,
      however, children younger than 8 years may not be recruited into the study, as the Visual
      Analogue Scale is not considered reliable for that age group (please see Study Design
      section). Additionally, patients for whom no consent may be obtained from the patient,
      parent/guardian, or surrogate, will not be eligible for the study.

      The consent form will be provided in English, and will be reviewed via translation phone for
      non-English-speakers, provided that the treating or examining physician is not fluent in the
      patient's preferred language.

      No tissue specimens or blood samples will be obtained from participating patients.

      Recruitment

      Patients will be recruited into the study by the surgeon prior to their operation. No
      additional recruitment materials will planned. The study will be explained in-person and
      consent obtained with appropriate documentation. Privacy will be protected by keeping the
      consent documentation in a separate, locked, secure location from the response cards.

      Informed Consent

      The informed consent form in use for this study is based upon the Einstein IRB recommended
      template and has been included with this study application.

      Informed consent will be obtained in the preoperative holding area where the patient is
      spoken to by both the anesthesiologist and surgeon. Eligible patients will be given the
      opportunity to enroll in the study after it has been determined that they will receive
      propofol infusion as part of their anesthesia..

      If they prefer to forgo study participation, they will receive the Standard Treatment and
      will not be enrolled; no information from the encounter, excepting a running count of
      individuals who refused to participate, will be recorded for use in the study. There is no
      requirement for a waiver of informed consent.

      In the case of unemancipated minors over the age of 7, the informed consent discussion will
      be held with the legal parent or guardian of the child, as self-identified, with verbal
      confirmation by the examiner, with the same assurances as above. If a parent or legal
      guardian is unavailable, the child/adolescent will not be enrolled into the study. Verbal
      assent from the minor will be obtained prior to enrollment in the study.

      This study will be performed without additional cost to participating patients and no
      renumeration will be offered for participation.

      All enrolling physicians will be employees of Montefiore Medical Center or the New York City
      Health and Hospitals Corporation and will have received training in accordance to the Health
      Information Portability and Accountability Act.

      Risks/Benefits

      Risks associated with the BUZZY(tm) device There are no known risks for the use of the
      BUZZY(tm) device, which is registered as an FDA class III device (&quot;therapeutic massager&quot;).

      Risks to privacy The only identifiable patient information in this study will be the consent
      form, which will be linked to the corresponding response for by a numerical key. The consent
      forms will be collected daily and placed in a separate, secure location. No component of this
      study will be videotaped for research purposes.

      Benefits Patients who agree to participate in this study will be given the chance to have an
      opportunity to receive an analgesic modality (vibration) to reduce the pain of local
      anesthetic injection. This is expected to reduce the discomfort of propofol infusion.

      This study will benefit general practice by helping reduce pain with propofol infusions and
      become the new standard of care for its administration. There is a non-negligible cost
      associated with its use.

      Statistical Methods All data will be entered into a single SPSS database. ANOVA will be
      performed to determine if significant differences are present between study groups in terms
      of demographic/injury characteristics and the primary outcome. Univariate analysis will be
      performed on the demographic and injury characteristic to determine if any of them have a
      significant effect on the primary outcome. If any individual characteristic is found to have
      a significant effect, multiple linear regression will be performed to control for potential
      confounders.

      As no intervention in this study entails significant risk above that entailed by the
      standard-of-care, there is no plan for interim analysis or early termination of the study.

      Since this investigation involves only a single patient interaction, there are no anticipated
      issues regarding loss-to-follow-up.

      Data Quality Control The primary data points for this study are the Visual Analogue Scale and
      Numerical Rating Scale of pain, as reported by patients immediately following digital block.
      The NRS, although not necessarily as reliable as the VAS, is a single whole number, which
      cannot be subject to interpretation by the examiner. The VAS is measured from a value of
      0-10cm along a continuous line, and the patient is asked to place a mark on the line at a
      point at which, they feel, corresponds to the level of their pain. This value will be
      measured by a third,independent investigator not otherwise involved in the study.

      Following acquisition of the NRS and VAS pain values, these values will be entered in the
      study database, which will be maintained solely by the primary investigators, keyed to
      individual participants' consent forms by a non-identifying serial number. Again, the consent
      forms will be stored in a separate location.

      All statistical analyses will be reviewed and verified with a faculty statistician.
