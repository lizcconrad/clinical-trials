  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate the effects of a simple cognitive task (a
      memory cue following by playing the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) on intrusive memories
      (&quot;flashbacks&quot;) and other symptoms after a traumatic event. Patients presenting to a hospital
      emergency department soon after a traumatic event will be randomly allocated to either the
      simple cognitive task intervention or control. Participants will be followed up at one week
      and one month, and where possible 3 and 6 months. It is predicted that participants given the
      simple cognitive task intervention will develop fewer intrusive memories and less severe
      clinical symptoms than those who are not. This will inform the potential future development
      of a simple technique to prevent distressing psychological symptoms after a traumatic event.
      Implementation aspects in a new hospital context will also be explored. Patients use their
      smartphone for part of the intervention in the study.

    <measure>Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) Intrusion Subscale: Degree of subjective distress of post-trauma symptoms in the intrusion (re-experiencing) symptoms cluster</measure>
    <time_frame>One week and 1, 3, and 6month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Full scale is a 22-item self-report measure that assesses subjective distress after a traumatic events. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) and subscale scores are calculated for the Intrusion, Avoidance, and Hyperarousal subscales summed. Higher scores indicate worse outcome. Our secondary outcome measure is the Intrusion subscale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): Anxiety and depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>One week 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. Higher scores indicate worse severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the perception of stress and the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The 14 items aims to assess how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very often&quot;) and summed to a total score of 56. Seven items concerns positive experiences and are hence reversed in scoring. Higher scores indicate worse severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS): Daily function</measure>
    <time_frame>[One week and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up]</time_frame>
    <description>The Work &amp; Social Adjustment Scale is a simple 5-item measure of general social impairment which grew out of a study of change during psychotherapy. The maximum score of the WSAS is 40, lower scores are better.</description>

    <measure>Feedback Questionnaire about Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>One month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>22 bespoke items including questions about study participation e.g. how burdensome was it to participate in the study?&quot; rated on 9-point scale from 1 (never) to 9 (always); and those about what has happened since the study with a yes/no response e.g. have you had any psychological or medical treatment since our last contact; and items with a free text response field e.g. do you have any comments about what it was like to take part in the study.</description>

    <measure>Credibility/expectancy questionnaire: Treatment credibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>5 item questionnaire (11 item scale from 0 to 10) that rates to what degree the participants finds the intervention credible. High scores indicate greater credibility.</description>

    <measure>Self Rated Health (SRH) rating</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, one week and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A single item measuring perceived health status on a seven-point scale (from very good to very bad). High scores indicate good outcomes.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self rated Sleep ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, one week and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Two self rated items: Item 1 measures the extent of being troubled by poor sleep in the last month on a 5 point scale (from not at all to very much), and item 2 measures the number of nights in the week with sleep problems on 5 point scale (from 0-1 to 5-7 nights). Each 5-point scale is reverse scored (0 - 4) then summed. Possible total scores ranges from 0 - 8, with higher values indicative of better sleep.</description>
