  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A key component of effective offender treatment is an initial assessment of risk factors
      followed by feedback to facilitate problem awareness and engagement in appropriate treatment
      and/or behavior change. Feedback regarding areas of high risk, however, can be experienced as
      threatening.

      The investigators propose to develop, fine-tune, and pilot-test a computerized system for
      risk assessment and feedback, including evaluation of a brief pre-feedback prosocial values
      affirmation exercise (Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014) aimed at decreasing defensiveness and increasing
      inmates' willingness to access and process risk-relevant information and to utilize
      post-release treatment resources, thereby reducing post-release substance misuse, HIV risk
      behavior, and criminal recidivism. Participants will be 170 jail inmates nearing release into
      the community - 20 pilot participants and 150 study participants randomly assigned to one of
      three conditions: (1) Values Affirmation + Personalized Risk Feedback; (2) Personalized Risk
      Feedback only; (3) Control. The baseline and risk assessment, values affirmation
      manipulation, and personalized risk feedback will be presented via touch-screen computers,
      requiring minimal training to administer. Analyses will assess:

        1. The feasibility of utilizing a computerized system to assess and share risk information
           with jail inmates, including a brief values affirmation exercise to reduce
           defensiveness;

        2. The acceptability of this approach from the perspectives of jail staff and inmates
           themselves;

        3. The impact of the intervention on observed proximal outcomes (mechanisms of action),
           such as time spent viewing feedback, electing to print a copy of informational and
           treatment resources, and consequent changes in perceptions of risk, treatability, etc.;

        4. The impact of the intervention on key post-release outcomes including engagement in
           relevant treatment services, substance misuse, HIV risk behaviors, re-offense and
           re-arrest;

        5. The links between proximal outcomes (MOAs) and key post-release outcomes;

        6. Potential moderators of treatment effectiveness.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sufficient proficiency in spoken English to understand computer-assisted assessments
             and feedback

          -  post-sentencing with a sentence (i.e., less than 12 months) likely to be served out at
             the jail (vs. a state or federal prison) and likely to be released into the community.
             The invitation to participate will be timed so treatment is delivered toward the end
             of incarceration (within one week of release) to minimize decay of effects, and to
             capitalize on the motivational value of the up-coming release.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those with detainers to other jurisdictions and to Immigration and Customs Enforcement
             (ICE)

    <ipd_description>We will make the data and associated documentation available to researchers under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) release of individually prepared datasets containing the subset of variables required to answer the requester's research question(s); (2) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to attempt to identify any individual participant; (3) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology housed in a secure laboratory facility; and (4) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Because of the exceptionally sensitive nature of the data, detailed criminal history and re-arrest information and self-reports of undetected criminal behavior will not be shared. Data requests will be accepted beginning 12 months after publication of the primary findings of the proposed project.</ipd_description>
