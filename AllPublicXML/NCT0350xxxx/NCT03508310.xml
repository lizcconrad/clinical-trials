  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to beta-test a brief waiting room video intervention that
      promotes early initiation of antiretroviral treatment among treatment-na√Øve HIV-positive
      patients, adherence to antiretroviral treatment and retention in care among HIV-positive
      patients currently on therapy, sexual risk reduction tailored to HIV-positive persons, and
      patient-initiated discussion of these topics with their health providers. The video is
      currently being created, and will be ready for beta-testing by June 1, 2016. Results of the
      beta-testing will be used to refine and improve the video before dissemination to HIV/AIDS
      treatment facilities nationally. This video project is being funded by the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to beta-test the waiting room video in three HIV/AIDS
      treatment facilities in different US jurisdictions with high AIDS prevalence. These results
      will be used to refine the video and to increase its effectiveness among minority persons
      living with HIV infection. The beta-testing will consist of: 1) unobtrusive observations of
      waiting room patients for one day at each facility and 2) de-identified, existing patient
      medical data abstracted from each facility's electronic medical record (EMR) system to
      investigate outcomes relevant to HIV medication adherence and retention in care.

    <description>29-minute clinic waiting room video intervention that includes three vignettes and a 2-part animation sequence about main characters who model overcoming challenges to optimal HIV care. The video was played on continuous loop in recognition of typically short patient wait times. Waiting room posters used images from the video to direct patients' attention to the video and reinforce prevention messages.</description>
