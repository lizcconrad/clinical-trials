  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the absolute bioavailability of BI
      409306. The secondary objective is the evaluation and comparison of several pharmacokinetic
      parameters for the different treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based
             on a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR),
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

             accordance with GCP and local legislation

          -  Known CYP 2C19 metabolizer status

          -  Male subjects, or female subjects who meet any of the following criteria starting from
             at least 30 days before the first administration of trial medication and until 30 days
             after trial completion:

               -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. non-hormonal intrauterine device plus condom.

               -  Sexually abstinent

               -  A vasectomised sexual partner (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to enrolment)

               -  Surgically sterilised (including hysterectomy)

               -  Postmenopausal, defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
                  questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous levels of FSH (follicle
                  stimulating hormone) above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia
             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients)

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication if that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation)

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Current smoker or ex-smoker who quit smoking less than 30 days prior to screening

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 20 g per day for females and 30 g per day for
             males)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 msec in males or repeatedly greater than 470 msec in
             females) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

        Female subjects will not be allowed to participate if any of the following applies:
