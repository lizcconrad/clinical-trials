  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to determine upper extremity selective motor control (SMC) in
      Children with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (CP). It was also aimed to determine the relationship
      between upper extremity SMC and upper extremity functions in unilateral CP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four unilateral CP participated in the study between the ages of 6 and 18 years.
      Children's manual skills classified with MACS. To assess the quality of the upper extremity,
      the Quality of Upper Extremity Skill Test (QUEST) which assessed four areas including
      dissociated movement, grasp, weight bearing and protective extension, was used. Upper
      extremity functions were assessed using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT). The
      Selective Control of Upper Extremity Scale (SCUES) was used to evaluate the selective
      movements of the upper extremity. The SCUES evaluates the movement of the trunk during the
      upper limb movements and mirror movements via video recording.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Selective Control of the Upper Extremity Scale (SCUES)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The SCUES evaluate for movement at each joint level: the presence of mirror movements, movement of additional joints the target or index joint, presence of trunk movement, dynamic motion less than passive ROM. Upper extremity joint levels and motions examined include the shoulder (abduction/adduction), elbow (flexion/extension), forearm (supination/pronation), wrist (flexion/extension), and fingers/thumb (grasp/release). A video camera is placed in front of a participant sitting on a table. The examiner demonstrate the desired motion to the participant, then passively moves the participant's joint in the desired planes. The participant is then asked to perform the same motion. This activity is graded by the examiner from the videotape. Evaluation lasts less than 15 minutes. Motion at each of the five joint levels is graded on a four-point scale: no SMC, moderately diminished SMC, mildly diminished SMC, and normal SMC</description>

    <measure>Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a standard test used to evaluate the general hand function of the person. Seven subsets of the test simulate hand function, which includes writing, simulated page turning, stacking checkers, simulated feeding and picking up small common objects, large light objects, large heavy objects</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Upper Extremity Skill Test (QUEST)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The QUEST evaluates the quality of the upper extremity to four areas; Dissociated Movement, Grasp, Weight Bearing and Protective Extension. A score of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is given according to the completion of each movement or task. The four field scores are summed to achieve the total score. During evaluation, the child is not allowed to use any device in the upper extremity</description>
