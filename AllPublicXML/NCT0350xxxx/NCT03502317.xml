  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial aiming to investigate the use of a prehabilitation regimen
      for patients undergoing major GI cancer surgery and its effects on measurements of HRQOL,
      LOS, and post-operative complications. Participants will be randomized to either the
      Prehabilitation arm or the Usual Care arm (control group). The Prehabilitation arm will be
      prescribed both physical and psychological prehabilitation prior to undergoing surgery for
      their GI cancer. The Usual Care arm will be counseled to continue their current level of
      activity and given the information on exercise as outlined in the Cancer Care Ontario
      guidelines. Participants in the Usual Care arm will also be given the same activity tracker
      as patients in the Prehabilitation arm in order to eliminate the activity tracker as an
      intervention itself. Clinical, patient-reported outcomes and health system outcomes will be
      evaluated. Outcomes will be measured at consent (baseline), immediately preoperatively, and
      postoperatively at 1, 3 and 6 months. The investigators will collect measures of recruitment,
      attrition and self-reported compliance via a log completed by the coordinator during weekly
      patient phone calls.

    <measure>Presence and severity of symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately preoperatively, and postoperatively at 1, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The presence and severity of nine common symptoms in cancer patients will be examined using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS).

    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately preoperatively, and postoperatively at 1, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in anxiety and depression will be examined using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS assesses anxiety and depression through self-reporting based on the frequency of symptoms over the past week. There are 2 subscales, one for anxiety and for depression, each with 7 items. Items are scored on a 4 point Likert scale (0-3), with the subscale scores being sums of each item (0-21). A higher score is indicative of higher or worse anxiety and depression.</description>

The MOS-SSS SF-20 is a 20 item questionnaire that measures physical functioning, social functioning, mental health, current health perceptions, and pain. After reverse scoring of the appropriate items according to the MOS-SSS core scoring manual, a higher value indicates better functioning, health, and more pain in the respective measures. All measure scores are transformed linearly to scales from 0-100, with 100 being the highest score possible.</description>

There are two domains that are measured - attachment anxiety and avoidance. Each domain includes 8 items. Items are scored on a 7 point Likert Scale (1-7). After appropriate reverse scoring, a high score indicates higher attachment anxiety or avoidance.</description>

    <description>No specific exercises or stress reduction techniques are prescribed and the patient will be counseled to continue their current level of activity, and will be given the information on exercise as outlined in the Cancer Care Ontario guidelines. Patients in the Usual Care arm will also be given the same Fitbit activity tracker as patients in the Prehabilitation arm in order to eliminate the activity tracker as an intervention itself and to be able to track the activity (steps) for comparison. Patients in the Usual Care arm will be required to wear their Fitbit activity tracker from the day of randomization to 90 days post-surgery. Patients will record their steps in the diary provided.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physical Prehabilitation</intervention_name>
    <description>Physical prehabilitation will comprise a personalized, home-based exercise program designed to meet the Cancer Care Ontario Exercise Guidelines for Cancer Survivors. A Registered Kinesiologist (RKin) will complete a baseline physical assessment and prescribe an individualized multi-modal exercise program consisting of 4-5 days of 30+ minutes of aerobic exercise (brisk walking or equivalent to target heart rate of 40-60% of max) and 2-3 days of moderate intensity resistance training of major muscle groups (8-10 repetitions). Participants will be provided with a Fitbit with a heart rate monitor, resistance bands, and a stability ball. Patients will be required to wear their Fitbit and record the number of steps at the end of each day from randomization to 90 days post-surgery.</description>

    <description>Psychological prehabilitation will consist of one in-person coaching session of a 'mindfulness' informed intervention conducted by a specially trained RKin. The 40 minute coaching session will include a guided mindfulness session and debriefing. Participants will be asked to practice for 20 minutes twice a day. The patients will be given access to an audio file that will walk them through the 20 minute sessions.</description>
