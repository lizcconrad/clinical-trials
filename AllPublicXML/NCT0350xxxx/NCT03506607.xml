  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to:

      Phase I: To explore, in a first pilot phase, the adequate combination of hypoxia severity and
      exercise intensity in patients with symptomatic lower extremity artery disease (LEAD). Acute
      walking performances and physiological responses (vascular and muscular) to a normobaric
      hypoxic exercise performed will be assessed at two different altitudes (1500 m and 2500 m).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of this first phase will then be used to determine the optimal hypoxic level for
      the exercise training program which will be assessed during the Phase II.
