  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orkambi is currently approved for patients with CF carrying two copies of the common F508del
      variant, but not for those with the P67L mutation. This is a clinical study of 22 subjects
      carrying P67L, each given Orkambi for approximately four weeks. The researchers will monitor
      clinical endpoints that include FEV1, sweat chloride, and nasal potential difference.
      Cutaneous punch biopsy material will be obtained from each subject so that iPS cells can be
      differentiated into airway epithelial monolayers and tested for response to Orkambi.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life threatening genetic disorder resulting from mutations found in
      the gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defects in
      this gene prevent correct chloride absorption in and out of the cells. The current trial is
      intended to show for the first time that primary induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells
      differentiated to an airway epithelial phenotype can be used to predict in vivo clinical
      response for a rare CF patient population, with the long-term goal of facilitating drug
      access for individuals with other rare CF variants.

      This study addresses gaps in knowledge, and limitations to therapeutic drug access, as these
      features relate to CF precision medicine. Specifically this study highlights the situation
      for individuals carrying P67L, an orphan allele noted in approximately 240 CF patients and
      emblematic of hundreds of other rare CFTR mutations. Individuals with the P67L variant
      exhibit recurrent pseudomonas pneumonia, reduced FEV1, and early death. This study is an
      open-label, two-center study of orally administered lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi) that
      will enroll 22 patients (11 at each site) with the P67L/F508del genotype. The researchers
      will monitor clinical endpoints that include FEV1, sweat chloride, and nasal potential
      difference. The researchers will also obtain cutaneous punch biopsy material from each
      subject so that iPS cells can be differentiated into airway epithelial monolayers and tested
      for response to Orkambi.

    <measure>Change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 provides a direct measurement of patient health among individuals with cystic fibrosis and declines in FEV1 are associated with poor outcomes among those with CF. FEV1 is measured by spirometry and is the maximum amount of air the participant can blow out in one second. In this study a clinical response to the study treatment at Week 4 will be defined as an improvement, from baseline, in FEV1 &gt; 5% predicted in at least 40% of study participants.</description>

    <measure>Response of iPS cells to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Cutaneous punch biopsy material will be collected from each participant so that iPS cells can be differentiated into airway epithelial monolayers and tested for response to Orkambi. By using iPS cells differentiated to exhibit a respiratory epithelial phenotype, this study will determine whether the cells can be used to predict FEV1 response among individuals carrying P67L/F508del who receive Orkambi.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sweat chloride</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Persons with CF have higher levels of chloride in their sweat. Sweat chloride concentrations of less than or equal to 29 mmol/L are considered normal, concentrations of 30-59 mmol/L are considered intermediate and indicate that the individual may have CF. Concentrations of 60 mmol/L and more mean that a diagnosis of CF is likely.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in nasal potential difference (NPD) measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal potential difference assesses the function of CFTR protein by measuring the electrical response of nasal mucosa to the perfusion of different ionic solutions. The nasal potential difference test uses a small needle placed under the skin of the arm a few inches above the wrist. A very thin piece of tubing is placed into the nose, through which ionic solutions are pumped. Response to each solution is recorded by an electrode feeding into a microvolt meter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will take the CFQ-R that corresponds to their age to assess quality of life. Responses to questions are coded as 1 = very true or always, 2 = mostly true or often, 3 = somewhat true or sometimes, and 4 = not at all true or never. Some items are reverse scored so that higher scores indicate increased ability and higher quality of life. For this study, a summary score will be calculated to provide a single quality of life value. The questionnaire for ages 12-13 includes 35 questions and total scores can range from 35 to 140. The questionnaire for ages 14 and older has 50 questions and total scores range from 50 to 200.</description>
