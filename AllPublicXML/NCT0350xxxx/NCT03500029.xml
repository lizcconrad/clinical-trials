  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the most common psychiatric condition and a important public health concern in
      society. But medications for depression don't work as well as people expected and cause
      serious side-effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive electrical
      stimulation treatment for depression, which has been approved by the FDA and added to the
      Guidelines for the Treatment of Depression in China. Despite the effect of the treatment is
      clear ,the TMS target,the neural circuit which plays a role in TMS and its mechanism remain
      unknown now. TBS target and effective site may be not in the same position. A large number of
      previous studies demonstrate the advantages and application prospects of different techniques
      of magnetic resonance (MR)in the study of pathogenesis of depression. Based on the results of
      previous research supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China,the National
      Key Technology Research and Development Program of China during the &quot;10th Five-Year Plan&quot; and
      New Health Care and New technology. project team puts forward the idea of joint use of brain
      structure imaging of MR ,Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI
      (fMRI) with different analysis methods to conduct a comprehensive study. The study is focused
      on the effects of TBS treatment on brain structure network, fiber connectivity network and
      functional connectivity network ,and nodes affected by it. Then we make further investigation
      about the mechanism of TMS treatment. The research will provide not only help for studying
      the pathogenesis of depression but also more reliable targets of next TMS treatment.

      The advantages of 3D T1 WI are thin slice scan，no interval, scanning fast and three-dimension
      reconstruction in any orientation compared with 2D SE. It is not easy to miss small lesions,
      and shows normal anatomy and lesions more objectively and more accurately.

      Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) can reflect white matter fiber so that can be used to determine
      whether the various diseases affect nerve cell connections.

      Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is non-drug perfusion imaging and completely noninvasive
      technology which can reflect brain perfusion better.

      Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is used to located the abnormal brain regions whose
      activity is consistent with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by the abnormal resting
      spontaneous brain activity in patients with depression and the abnormal functional
      connectivity network.
