  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents are the highest consumers of sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) potentially because
      their developing brains are most susceptible to the rewarding neural effects of sugar
      consumption. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) (implicated in control of impulses, choices, and
      decision-making) is not fully developed in adolescents, undergoing significant development
      into young adulthood, and thus has not yet gained mature regulatory capacity over
      reward-motivation (striatal) and hunger-satiety (hypothalamic) brain regions, to control
      sugar sweetened beverage intake and potentially mitigate excessive consumption in
      adolescents. Thus, we specifically target this vulnerable population (adolescents) to
      understand neural mechanisms involved in excess sugar consumption which predisposes to the
      development of obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes.
