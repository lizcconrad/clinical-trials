  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether a short-term intervention strategy using air cleaner
      reduces indoor exposure to airborne particles (particulate matter with an aerodynamic
      diameter ≤2.5μm, PM2.5) and phthalates and improves cardiopulmonary health among Chinese
      healthy adults based on a randomized double-blinded crossover trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized double-blind crossover trial includes two cohorts with different intervention
      and health examination settings and will be conducted in Beijing, China between November
      2017-May 2018.

      The first cohort will include 70 healthy college students who live in school dormitories,
      which were randomized into two dormitory groups to receive either true or sham air cleaner
      treatment for 1 week and then alternate the treatment after a wash out interval of at least 2
      weeks. All participants and research staff are blinded to the group assignment. All
      participants are encouraged to stay in the dormitory with windows/doors tightly closed
      throughout the 1-week treatment period as far as possible, whereas necessary outdoor
      activities such as attending classes and dining in school canteens are allowed. All
      interventions will start at noon on Tuesday or Thursday and continue to the next morning of
      Tuesday or Thursday to avoid issues related to diurnal variation. Real-time PM2.5
      concentrations will be measured using portable monitors and airborne PM2.5 mass samples will
      be collected in air filters throughout the treatment period. Air and fine particle phase
      phthalates samples will be collected using glass sampling tube filled with XAD2 macroporous
      resin and PM2.5 air filters respectively during the last day (24 hours) of the treatment
      period. Health variables, including blood pressure, lung function, fractional exhaled nitric
      oxide (FeNO), will be evaluated and biological samples including morning urine and fasting
      blood will be collected immediately after the completion of each treatment period. Efficacy
      of air cleaner treatment to reduce indoor exposure to particles and phthalates and related
      improvements in cardiopulmonary health variables will be evaluated using professional
      statistical methods.

      The second cohort will include 30 healthy college students who will undergo extended
      treatment period covering the start, peak and end phases of smog episodes occurring in
      Beijing. All interventions will start from the beginning to the end of typical smog episodes.
      PM2.5 exposure monitoring as detailed above will be performed throughout the treatment period
      and repeated health examinations will be conducted at time points corresponding to the start,
      peak and end phases of the smog episodes. Efficacy of air cleaner treatment to reduce indoor
      exposure to PM2.5 and related improvements in cardiopulmonary health variables throughout the
      smog episodes will be evaluated using professional statistical methods.
