    <textblock>
      SafeBreak Vascular is a medical device indicated for fluid flow control during the
      administration of IV fluids/medication to the patient's vascular system and to aid in the
      prevention of unintended disruption and dislodgment of IVs. SafeBreak Vascular may be used
      for any hospitalized patient with gravity tubing or IV pumps, for intermittent infusion or
      continuous infusion.The primary objective of this study is to determine if the delivery of IV
      medications and/or fluids with SafeBreak Vascular functions with the same reliability as
      current standard IV tubing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will have a SafeBreak Vascular installed in each of their existing or
      newly installed IV lines. The clinical literature shows in prospective observational studies
      that a mean of 9.2% of patients dislodge their peripheral IVs. SafeBreak Vascular is a
      medical device designed to aid in the prevention of unintended disruption and dislodgement of
      IVs, such as peripheral IVs, peripherally inserted central lines, central lines, etc.
      SafeBreak IV will be installed in each IV line between the study participant's catheter and
      the IV tubing that goes to the IV bag or IV pump. When a harmful force is placed on the IV
      line, SafeBreak Vascular is designed to separate so that the harmful force is removed from
      the line and IV dislodgement is prevented. SafeBreak Vascular has a valve in each end of the
      device. Upon separation, each valves closes, stopping the flow of fluid. The primary
      objective of the study is to determine if the delivery of IV medications and/or fluids with
      SafeBreak Vascular functions with the same reliability as current standard IV tubing. The
      number of IV dislodgements and IV restarts will be recorded. The study will also collect data
      for analysis concerning the following:

        -  device design characteristics

        -  certain human factors (patient or operator) associated with the use of the device

        -  the impact of this device usage on clinician workflow

        -  any unknown safety concerns

        -  obtain preliminary data for use in designing a subsequent pivotal study of the device.
