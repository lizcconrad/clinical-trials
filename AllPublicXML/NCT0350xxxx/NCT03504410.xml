    <textblock>
      A Phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in combination with High
      Dose Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone in comparison with high dose Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone in
      older patients with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia. CPI-613 targets the altered
      energy metabolism and processes for production of ATP and essential bio-intermediates unique
      to and characteristic of most cancer cell types. The addition of CPI-613 to high dose
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone (CHAM) will improve the complete remission (CR) rate in patients
      60 years or older with relapsed or refractory AML when compared to HAM alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients age ≥60 years must have histologically documented AML that is relapsed from,
             or refractory to, prior standard therapies.

          -  Refractory is defined as failure to achieve CR or CRi following:

               1. 2 standard dose cytarabine based induction cycles or one HiDAC based cycle, or

               2. Failure to respond to one cycle of either standard dose or HiDAC (defined as no
                  decrease in marrow blast percentage from diagnosis on day 14 marrow), or

               3. No response after at least 3 cycles of a hypomethylating agent (azacytidine or
                  decitabine).

          -  Relapse is defined as development of recurrent AML (as described by Döhner et al,
             2010) after CR or CRi has been achieved with a prior chemotherapy or after progression
             on a hypomethylating agent.

          -  ECOG PS (performance score) 0-2.

          -  Expected survival &gt;3 months.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically
             sterile) must use accepted contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device
             [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment initiation (Note: Pregnant
             patients are excluded because the effects of CPI-613 on a fetus are unknown).

          -  Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study period,
             unless documentation of infertility exists.

          -  Mentally competent, ability to understand and willingness to sign the informed consent
             form.

          -  No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents, treatment with biologic agents or
             any anti- cancer therapy within the 2 weeks prior to treatment with CPI-613.
             Hydroxyurea and oral tyrosine kinase or IDH1/2 inhibitors being used with Grade ≤ 2
             toxicity can be taken until day 1 of therapy. Patients must have fully recovered from
             the acute, non-hematological, non-infectious toxicities of any prior treatment with
             cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or other anti- cancer modalities with the exception of
             alopecia (returned to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment). Patients
             with persisting, non-hematologic, non-infectious toxicities from prior treatment ≤
             Grade 2 are eligible but must be documented as such.

          -  Laboratory values ≤2 weeks must be:

               1. Adequate hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST/SGOT] ≤5x upper normal
                  limit [UNL], alanine aminotransferase [ALT/SGPT] (≤5x ULN, bilirubin≤1.5x UNL).

               2. Adequate renal function (serum creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min per CG or
                  ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2 per MDRD eGFR formula).

               3. Adequate coagulation [International Normalized Ratio (INR) must be &lt;1.7 unless on
                  vitamin k antagonist anticoagulation].

          -  Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (by TTE, MUGA or cardiac MRI) sufficient to safely
             administer mitoxantrone as determined by the treating physician.

          -  No marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated exhibition of a QTc
             interval &gt;450 ms for male and &gt;470 ms for female patients).

          -  No history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., clinically
             significant heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received previous cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment for their
             relapsed or refractory AML. Previous treatment with hypomethylating agents (decitabine
             or azacytidine) or targeted therapies including FLT3 or IDH1/2 inhibitors or hydrea is
             allowed.

          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic myocardial infection,
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, pericardial disease or New York Heart Association
             Class III or IV), or severe debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially
             increase patients' risk for toxicity.

          -  Patients with active Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement.

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding, and any patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g.,
             active peptic ulcer disease).

          -  Pregnant women, or women of child-bearing potential not using reliable means of
             contraception (because the teratogenic potential of CPI-613 is unknown).

          -  Lactating females because the potential of excretion of CPI-613 into breast milk.
             (Note: lactating females are excluded because the effects of CPI-613 on a nursing
             child are unknown.)

          -  Fertile men unwilling to practice contraceptive methods during the study period.

          -  Life expectancy less than 3 months.

          -  Any condition or abnormality which may, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise
             the safety of patients.

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.

          -  Patients with large and recurrent pleural or peritoneal effusions requiring frequent
             drainage (e.g. weekly). Patients with any amount of clinically significant pericardial
             effusion that requires drainage.

          -  Evidence of ongoing, uncontrolled infection.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection (Note: Patients with known HIV infection are
             excluded because patients with an immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, and because there may be
             unknown or dangerous drug interactions between CPI-613 and anti-retroviral agents used
             to treat HIV infections).

          -  Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their cancer,
             or any other investigational agent for any indication within the past 2 weeks prior to
             initiation of CPI-613 treatment (the use of Hydrea and/or oral tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors or IDH 1/2 inhibitors is allowed).

          -  Patients who have received immunotherapy of any type within the past 4 weeks prior to
             initiation of CPI-613 treatment.

          -  Requirement for immediate palliative treatment of any kind including surgery. Patients
             that have received a chemotherapy regimen with stem cell support in the previous 6
             months.

          -  Patients that have creatinine clearance (CLcr) &lt;60 mL/min per Cockcroft Gault (CG)
             formula or &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 per (MDRD) (modified diet in renal disease) eGFR
             (estimated glomerular filtration rate) formula.
