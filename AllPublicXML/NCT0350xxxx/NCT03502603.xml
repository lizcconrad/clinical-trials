  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at investigating three new tests that will form part of a computerized
      tool designed to test brain/cognitive functioning. The system will be evaluated along with
      the tests' usability on samples of healthy controls and neurologically impaired patient
      participants. These new tests will be assessed with regard to reliability and validity.
      Reliability will be addressed through investigation of internal consistency of the test
      items. Validity will be evaluated relative to traditional paper-and-pencil tests and
      differentiation between patient and healthy participants.Each participant will complete both
      the computerized and paper and pencil-based tests. The results will be analyzed to see how
      performances on the two test types compare. The overall aim of this project is to determine
      if these new computerized tasks are an improvement over standard paper and pencil-based
      neuropsychological measures.
