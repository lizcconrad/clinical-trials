  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective multicenter study including all patients undergoing elective total hip (THA) or
      knee (TKA) arthroplasty (primary and revision). Patients will be screened for glycemic
      control using HbA1c levels, fructosamine levels, and blood glucose levels. Blood samples will
      be obtained at the preadmission testing (PAT) within 30 days of surgery. On postoperative day
      1 (POD-1), morning glucose levels will be obtained for all patients as well. Patients will be
      followed up for 90 days postop.

      Study aims

        1. To examine the association between serum fructosamine levels and the risk for adverse
           outcomes (mainly PJI) following TJA among patients with and without diabetes.

        2. To compare the utility of fructosamine levels to HbA1c in predicting adverse outcomes.

        3. To determine the &quot;best&quot; threshold of fructosamine to determine adverse outcomes.
