  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the TearCare System will be compared with standard-of-care warm compress
      treatment and lid massage in patients with dry eye disease. The objective is to demonstrate
      that the TearCare System is safe and effective in relieving the signs and symptoms of dry eye
      disease and that it is superior to a commonly prescribed, standard treatment of warm compress
      and lid massage.

    <measure>Meibomian Gland Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Meibomian Gland Secretion Scoring is an assessment of the quality of the secretions produced by the meibomian glands in the lower eyelids. Fifteen glands in each lower eyelid are scored. The Score is calculated by summing the grade (0 - 3) for each of the 15 glands. Range for this score is 0-45, with 45 being the best and 0 being the worst.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal and conjunctival staining graded using the NEI/Industry Grading System.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>For corneal staining, the assessor scores 5 areas of the cornea (grade 0-3) and sums the grade for each area to obtain the total score. The score ranges from 0-15 with 0 being the best and 15 being the worst.
For conjunctival staining, the assessor scores 6 areas of the conjunctiva (grade 0-3) and sums the grade for each area to obtain the total score. The score ranges from 0-18 with 0 being the best and 18 being the worst.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) and Eye Dryness Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The SANDE is a simple dry eye instrument containing two items measuring the frequency and severity of symptoms, each is assessed on a 100 mm visual analog scale. The Eye Dryness (VAS) measures the level of discomfort associated with eye dryness on a 100mm VAS. The score for each question is calculated by measuring the distance from the left end of the line to the subject's response (range 0-100).
For these scales, a lower score is better than a higher score.</description>
