  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 31 subjects diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma will receive one application of
      a permeation enhancer and 2, 3 or 5 treatment applications of a Cisplatin drug-loaded patch
      to the tumor site at each of 4 treatment visits. These 4 treatment visits will be scheduled
      to occur during the 3 weeks prior to the standard of care tumor resection.

      Up to 31 subjects diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma will receive one application of
      a permeation enhancer and 2, 3 or 5 treatment applications of a Cisplatin drug-loaded patch
      to the tumor site at each of 4 treatment visits. These 4 treatment visits will be scheduled
      to occur during the 3 weeks prior to the standard of care tumor resection. After the surgery,
      subjects will be followed for 6 months for disease recurrence.

      Ten subjects will be enrolled in Stage 1 of the study and will receive permeation enhancer
      and 3 treatment applications of the cisplatin drug-loaded patch at each treatment visit. Up
      to 21 additional subjects will enroll in Stage 2 for the purpose of 16 total evaluable
      subjects at the final dose for the efficacy analysis. In Stage 2, the dose may be escalated,
      de-escalated or remain the same based on the results in Stage 1. All subjects will be
      followed for 6 months post surgery for disease recurrence.

      During and at the conclusion of the treatment period, subjects will be monitored for local
      and systemic safety, tumor response due to the treatment, and systemic drug exposure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically confirmed T1 (&lt;2 cm) or T2 (&gt;2 cm but &lt; or = 4 cm) squamous cell
             carcinoma (SCC) of the lip or oral cavity (anterior 2/3 of the tongue, floor of mouth,
             lower and upper gingiva, salivary gland, hard palate, and buccal mucosa).

          2. Tumor must be easily accessible, with no evidence of infection or active bleeding,
             encroaching major vessels or clinical evidence of neural invasion. Not previously
             irradiated.

          3. Tumors must be amenable to surgical resection approximately 3 weeks after initiation
             of PRV111 treatment.

          4. Clinically or radiologically measurable tumor.

          5. Absence of any serious medical conditions that would impair the subject's ability to
             participate.

          6. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          7. Able to return to the study site for treatment and follow-up visits as defined in the
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known distal metastasis of the SCC of the oral cavity.

          2. Systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of SCC of the head and neck less than 2 years
             prior to screening.

          3. Concurrent documented malignancy, with the exception of localized SCC of the skin.

          4. Exposure to any investigational agent within 3 months prior to screening.

          5. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to platinum-containing agents.

          6. Known or suspected pregnancy, planned pregnancy or lactation.
