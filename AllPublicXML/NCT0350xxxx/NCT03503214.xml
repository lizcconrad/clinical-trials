  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alterations of acid-base equilibrium are very common in critically ill patients and
      understanding their pathophysiology can be important to improve clinical treatment.

      The human organism is protected against acid-base disorders by several compensatory
      mechanisms that minimize pH variations in case of blood variations in carbon dioxide content.
      The aim of the present study is to quantify the buffer power, i.e. the capacity to limit pH
      variations in response to carbon dioxide changes, in critically ill septic patients and
      compare these results with data collected from healthy volunteers.

      Alterations of acid-base equilibrium are very common in critically ill patients and
      understanding their pathophysiology can be important to improve clinical treatment.

      The human body is protected against acid-base disorders by several compensatory mechanisms
      that minimize pH variations in response to acid-base derangements.

      The present study focuses on the acute compensatory mechanisms of respiratory acid-base
      derangements, i.e., respiratory acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. In this case the
      non-carbonic buffers are constituted by albumin and phosphates in plasma, with the addition
      of hemoglobin in whole blood.

      Aim of the present in-vitro study is to measure the buffer power of non-carbonic weak acids
      contained in whole blood and isolated plasma, assess the relative contribution of red blood
      cells and plasma proteins and perform a comparison between septic patients and healthy
      controls.

    <description>Correlation between hematocrit [expressed as percentage] values and Strong Ion Difference variations [expressed in mEq/L] induced by acute in vitro changes of Carbon Dioxide.
Acute variations in partial pressure of carbon dioxide cause changes in Strong Ion Difference. The hypothesis is that the magnitude of Strong Ion Difference variations correlate to the hematocrit, being the red blood cell the major source of electrolytes. The higher the hematocrit, the higher the possible change in Strong Ion Difference induced by acute variations in partial pressure of carbon dioxide.</description>
