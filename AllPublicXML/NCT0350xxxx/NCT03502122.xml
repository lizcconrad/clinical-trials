        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  the first time hemiparetic stroke;

          -  diagnosis confirmed by a physician on the basis of the findings of neurological
             examinations and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography
             scan);

          -  aged between 20 and 85 years;

          -  Brunnstrom's stage II to V over the proximal and distal part of the upper extremity on
             the affected side;

          -  no cognitive dysfunction, measured by the Mini-Mental State Exam (â‰§24; suggested by 36
             with respect to age and educational level)

          -  willing/able to participate and having signed an informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  unstable vital sign

          -  irreversible contracture over any of the joints of the affected upper extremity

          -  history of surgery, fracture, arthritis, pain, or any other complications that might
             influence the recovery of upper extremity function like aphasia, apraxia and neglect;

          -  having spasticity, as measured using the Modified Ashworth scale (score &gt; 2);

          -  poststroke seizure;

          -  heart attack within 3 months poststroke; cortical lesions in any of the five core
