    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label phase Ib study of combining eribulin mesylate with avelumab.
      The initial 9-12 patients (MTD cohort) will be enrolled to determine safety of avelumab in
      combination with eribulin mesylate. Upon determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 12
      additional patients will be enrolled in an expansion cohort (efficacy cohort) to determine
      ORR at 6 months.

      Dose Escalation Plan:

      A standard &quot;3+3&quot; design will be used to determine the MTD of eribulin with avelumab.

      The maximum tolerated dose is the dose of eribulin combined with avelumab with dose limiting
      toxicity of 0-1 of 6 patients in the first cycle of combination therapy. After the MTD has
      been determined, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled in an expansion cohort at the MTD
      to evaluate the efficacy of this combination.

      After determination of MTD for eribulin mesylate, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled
      on the expansion cohort. Subjects on the expansion cohort will be assessed for adverse events
      but will not be assessed for DLTs.

             on the clinical trial. TURBT specimens are preferred but tissue from lymph node or
             visceral areas are also acceptable. If archival tissue is not available, the subject
             must be willing to consent to a fresh biopsy for research prior to registration for
             protocol therapy. If archival tissue is not available and there are no sites amenable
             to biopsy, enrollment must be discussed with the sponsor-investigator on a case by
             case basis.

          -  Palliative radiation therapy prior to or during the treatment is allowed if indicated.
             However, if prior to start of treatment, radiation therapy must complete at least 7
             days prior to cycle 1 day 1 of treatment.
