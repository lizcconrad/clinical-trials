      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 36 week
      multicenter Phase 2 study of two doses of CT1812 in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD).

      This Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety of two doses of CT1812 administered
      once daily for 6 months in adults aged 50 to 85 who have been diagnosed with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease (the targeted clinical indication for CT1812). Randomized participants
      will receive 100 mg of CT1812, 300 mg of CT1812, or placebo once daily for 182 days.
      Exploratory endpoints that evaluate the effect of CT1812 on biomarkers are also included.

          1. Men, and women of non-childbearing potential, 50-85 years of age inclusively, with a
             diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease according to the 2011 NIA-AA
             criteria and at least a 6 month decline in cognitive function documented in the
             medical record.

             i) Non-childbearing potential for women is defined as postmenopausal (last natural
             menses greater than 24 months) or undergone a documented bilateral tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy. If less than 24 months, an serum FSH value confirming post- menopausal
             status can be employed.

             ii) Male participants who are sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential
             must agree to use condoms during the trial and for 3 months after last dose unless the
             woman is using an acceptable means of birth control. Acceptable forms of birth control
             include abstinence, birth control pills, or any double combination of: intrauterine
             device (IUD), male or female condom, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap.

          2. Diagnostic confirmation by amyloid PET with florbetaben or another approved amyloid
             PET ligand. Previous amyloid imaging study with a positive result will be accepted. If
             none is available, then amyloid PET will be conducted during screening.

          3. Contraindication to the MRI examination for any reason.

          4. Neuroimaging (MRI) obtained during screening consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
             Alzheimer's disease and without findings of significant exclusionary abnormalities
             (see exclusion criteria, number 3).

          5. MMSE 18-26 inclusive.

          6. No active depression and a GDS ≤6 (see exclusion criteria number 5).

             administration of study drug, and is willing and able to participate in all clinic
             visits and some study assessments. The caregiver/ study partner must provide written
             informed consent to participate in the study.

             to the study procedures and for use of protected health information [Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization, if applicable]. If the
             Subject can provide only assent, their legally authorized representative also must
             provide written informed consent. Written informed consent also shall be obtained from
             the responsible caregiver. All consent processes must be undertaken in the presence of
