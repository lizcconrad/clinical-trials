  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single institution, pilot study is to explore the out of pocket
      (OOP)costs and financial toxicity of cancer care for patients during definitive treatment of
      head and neck cancer with radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy and surgical
      resection. The study team will assess how the financial burden of cancer care impacts quality
      of life as well as treatment-related decision-making from a patient perspective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single institution, survey-based study to assess OOP costs, financial
      toxicity and pateint reported outcomes (PROs') (including QOL, quality of care, and
      attitudes/perspectives on the role of cost in treatment decisions). Potential participants
      are new patient consults in Radiation Oncology Head and Neck Cancer Clinic. Patients with an
      indication for definitive treatment involving radiation therapy will be approached by study
      staff and, if amenable, enrolled in the study. After signing informed consent, they will
      complete a baseline survey assessing socioeconomic household information, baseline
      symptoms/QOL and baseline costs/financial toxicity. They will be followed prospectively and
      re-surveyed at 3 and 6 months after completion of radiation therapy. Repeat assessments will
      document treatment costs and PRO including QOL, financial toxicity, and self-reported quality
      of care. Patients will be asked to collect all treatment-related bills in a provided binder,
      which will be reviewed at each survey date. Basic demographic data (including age, sex, race,
      marital status, zip code, and insurance coverage), comorbidities, smoking status, cancer
      characteristics (stage, site, histology), treatments received, emergency department visits
      and hospitalization rates at baseline, end of treatment, 3 months and 6 months after
      radiation treatment will be collected as part of this study. Disease status and survival will
      also be assessed from standard of care follow-up visits up to five years after completion of
      radiation treatment.
