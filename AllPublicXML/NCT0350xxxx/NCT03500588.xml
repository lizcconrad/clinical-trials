  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators assessed one of the released protein factors during
      pathophysiology of preeclampsia. They evaluated vascular endothelial growth factor gene
      mutation which affects the angiogenesis in case of inadequate placentation.

    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a syndrome characterized by occurrence of hypertension and proteinuria after
      20 weeks of gestation. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia involves abnormalities in the
      development of placental vasculature early in pregnancy may result in relative placental
      under perfusion/hypoxia/ischemia, which then leads to release of factors into the maternal
      circulation that alter maternal endothelial function and cause hypertension and other
      manifestations of disease .Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signal protein
      produced by cells that stimulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. It is part of the system
      that restores the oxygen supply to tissues when blood circulation is inadequate. Human VEGF
      gene is located on chromosome 6 and consists of 8 exons with alternate splicing, forming a
      family of proteins. There are several common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
      VEGF gene, which could alter gene expression and protein production, and alter the risk of
      developing diseases characterized by deranged angiogenesis including preeclampsia.
