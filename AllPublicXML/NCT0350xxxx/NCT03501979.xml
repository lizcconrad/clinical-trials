      A phase 2 non-randomized study to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      tucatinib and trastuzumab with capecitabine for the treatment of leptomeningeal metastases in
      HER2-neu positive breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new treatment for patients with HER2+ metastatic
      breast cancer (MBC) with leptomeningeal disease (LMD). This is a rare and fast-growing form
      of cancer. Leptomeningeal disease refers to the seeding of tumor cells to the leptomeninges
      and dissemination in the cerebrospinal fluid.

      Currently, there are is no standard of care treatment for LMD. However, we think the
      combination therapy will be safe and well-tolerated and may also improve survival. Blood and
      spinal fluid samples will be collected to evaluate the effects on the body and the cancer,
      which will help provide greater understanding to therapy response in patients.

      The study has a two-stage design with the first stage including 15 subjects from up to ten
      institutions nationwide. If it advances to the second stage based on the number of successes,
      another 15 subjects will be enrolled.

                  mandatory for the first 15 patients enrolled onto the protocol (first stage). In
                  the second stage, this is strongly recommended per protocol. If a patient cannot

                  be allowed to enroll.

                       within 1 week (7 days) prior to first dose of study drug. Note: Radiation
                       for the purpose of palliation in the setting of a painful bone or dural
