  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, multicenter, 2-arm, open-label clinical trial designed to
      compare the safety and efficacy of RC48-ADC with that of capecitabine + lapatinib in
      participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive locally advanced
      or metastatic breast cancer. Participants will be treated until disease progression (PD),
      unmanageable toxicity, or study termination. Once disease progression is reported, all
      participants will be followed for survival every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up,
      withdrawal of consent, or study termination.
