  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently a computerized injection pump has been programmed with its own mathematical
      algorithm to measure on a digital display the pressure trend in the form of a continuous
      curve and it has been connected to an acoustic device that emits a sound at increasing
      frequencies during the progress of the epidural needle (Compuflo®, Milestone Scientific,
      Livingston, NJ); it has therefore been made capable of controlling the pressure at the
      injection point and adjusting the infusion rate according to a predetermined maximum value
      using the registered Dynamic Pressure Sensing (DPS) technology.

      The Compuflo® system guarantees feedback on simultaneous and continuous pressure data, both
      visual and auditory, identifying and differentiating the different types of tissue. This safe
      and effective feedback helps medical personnel to identify the epidural space with greater
      accuracy and alerts them if the needle moves into the identified position.

      The aim of the study was to verify the efficacy and usability of the Compuflo® system in a
      clinical setting.

      The setting was the area of gynecology and obstetrics at a tertiary referral level University
      Hospital.

      All the consecutive patients undergoing to an epidural catheter placement with Compuflo® were
      collected until to a sample size of 140 patients.

      Primary endpoint was the number and percentage of successes in the placement of epidural
      catheters with Compuflo® Epidural. Secondary endpoints were: the number and percentage of
      accidental dural punctures during epidural catheter placement; the number of attempts aimed
      at the correct positioning of the epidural catheter; the measurement of procedure time
      duration; the measurement of pressure in the interspinous ligament, in the yellow ligament
      and within the epidural space; the measurement of volume of saline injected by Compuflo® to
      identify the epidural space.
