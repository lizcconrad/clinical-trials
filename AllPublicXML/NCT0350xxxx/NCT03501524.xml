  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, randomized study comparing VATS (video- Assisted Thoracoscopy) to
      reinsertion of a thoracostomy tube in patients with persistent traumatic haemothorax. The
      incidence varies and can be as high as 20%, but in most studies is found to be 1-4% after
      initial tube thoracostomy for chest trauma. The most accepted complication of retained
      hemothorax is empyema.Retained hemothorax treatment started by physiotherapy and early
      withdrawal of tube thoracostomy which lead to more complications as empyema, fibro
      thorax/entrapped lung, flail chest and diaphragmatic hernia. Early VATS is an alternative
      treatment for retained hemothorax with evidence that it is a superior intervention when
      compared to a second tube thoracostomy.

      Traumatic injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in our society.At
      Assiut university hospitals, chest injuries (17.7%) considered as second cause of mortality
      after head injuries (34.6%) of registered deaths by cause of injury at trauma unit, Assiut
      university hospitals in a study conducted between,2002-2009. In United States, thoracic
      injuries are the primary factor in approximately 35% of these deaths, one -third of which
      occur immediately following the injury, and are contributing in nearly 75% of trauma -related
      deaths. Up to 15% of patients who sustain thoracic trauma undergo emergent thoracotomy for
      resuscitation, massive hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, large thoracic wounds, major thoracic
      vascular injuries, tracheobronchial injuries, or evidence of esophageal injury. The remaining
      85-90% of patients who reach the emergency department does not require emergent thoracotomy
      are initially managed with tube thoracostomy, pain control, pulmonary toilet, and observation
      .Patients failing this management ultimately require elective thoracotomy for further
      evaluation and treatment(clotted hemothorax, empyema and diaphragmatic hernia. The current
      role of VATS in trauma includes evaluation and control of continued chest tube bleeding,
      early evacuation of retained hemothorax, evacuation and decortication of posttraumatic
      empyemas, evaluation and limited treatment of suspected diaphragm injuries, evaluation and
      treatment of persistent air leaks, and evaluation of mediastinal injuries.
