  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      57 eyes of 57 healthy pregnant women who were visiting Obstetrics and Gynecology department
      for routine examination and 26 eyes of 26 non pregnant control subjects who were at the first
      week of the menstrual cycle were enrolled in the study. All subjects had a detailed
      ophthalmologic examination including the best corrected visual acuity with a Snellen chart,
      slit- lamp biomicroscopic evaluation, and indirect fundoscopy. The biomechanical properties
      Corneal Hysteresis, Corneal resistance factor, corneal compensated intraocular pressure and
      Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure values were measured with ORA (Ocular Response
      Analyzer, software version 1.02, Reichert, Inc.) Central corneal thickness was measured with
      a built-in ultrasonic pachymeter attached to the ORA device.Axial length , Anterior chamber
      depth , and keratometry readings were acquired with an ocular biometer (IOLMaster; Carl-Zeiss
      Meditec, Inc.) before CCT determinations had been taken. Results of these parameters were
      compared between pregnant group and healthy control group.
