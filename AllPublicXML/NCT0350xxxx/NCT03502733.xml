      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of copanlisib and nivolumab in
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body or lymphoma.
      Copanlisib stops tumors from growing by blocking proteins that are known to be important for
      tumor cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may unblock the immune system so
      that it can recognize and attack tumor cells. Giving copanlisib and nivolumab may work better
      in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety, tolerability, and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      copanlisib and nivolumab combination in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the copanlisib and nivolumab combination on markers of anti-tumor
      immunity in circulating immune cells, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and pre- and
      post-treatment tumor biopsies.

      II. Evaluate the effect of the combination on biomarkers of AKT inhibition, deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) damage (gammaH2AX, pNbs1, Rad51), apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      in CTCs and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies.

      III. Assess preliminary antitumor activity of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and nivolumab
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1 or on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
