             negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment initiation.

          -  Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study, unless

          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed from any prior surgery with resolution of any
             sequela.

          -  Laboratory values ≤2 weeks must be:

               -  Adequate hematologic values (platelet count ≥100,000 cells/mm3 or ≥100 bil/L;
                  absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥1,500 cells/mm3 or ≥1.5 bil/L; and hemoglobin ≥9
                  g/dL or ≥90 g/L).

               -  Adequate hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST/SGOT] ≤3x upper normal
                  limit [UNL], alanine aminotransferase [ALT/SGPT] ≤3x UNL (≤5x UNL if liver

             patient has been disease-free for at least 3 years.

          -  Unwilling or unable to avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers or
             inhibitors during treatment with Irinotecan.

             QTc interval &gt; 480 milliseconds (ms) (CTCAE grade 1) using Fredericia's QT correction
             formula (i.e. QTcF).
