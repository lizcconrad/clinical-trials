  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to use the new molecular probe 18F-PSMA for the diagnosis,staging ,recurrence
      monitoring and evaluation of the prostate cancer.By compared with the conventional imaging
      methods (whole body bone scintigraphy and MRI) and molecular imaging methods (11C-choline
      PET/CT),we hope to find the advantages of 18F-PSMA PET/CT in the diagnosis and metastases of
      prostate cancer, and lay the foundation for the further clinical transformation.
