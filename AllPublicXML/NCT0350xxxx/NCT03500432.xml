  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In comparison with transrectal prostate biopsy, transperineal prostate biopsy has the
      advantage of better sampling from the anterior area, low risk of infection, and no rectal
      bleeding. The main problems associated with the transperineal method are pain control and
      additional general or spinal anesthesia. Three types of anesthesia have been reported for
      transperineal prostate biopsy: (1) spinal anesthesia; (2) general anesthesia; and (3) local
      anesthesia. From the viewpoint of patient selection (general anesthesia is contraindicated in
      some patients) and medical cost, local anesthesia is the most suitable choice for prostate
      biopsy. Periprostatic block is the standard method of local anesthesia for this procedure.
      However, periprostatic block is insufficient for transperineal prostate biopsy due to high
      pain sensitivity in this region. A number of new methods to eliminate pain have been
      reported, including (1) periapical triangle (PAT) block, (2) paraprostatic plus sexual nerve
      block, and (3) periprostatic block plus pudendal block.However, there is no anatomical basis
      for some of these methods, and there have been no randomized controlled trials to evaluate
      their effectiveness, and some methods are technically difficult to learn. In the previous
      perineal nerve autopsy, we found that there are two branches leading into the prostate and
      anterior lateral prostatic tissue, which is the main site of puncture pain. There is a fixed
      position where the two branches appear. Therefore, this anatomical position block may be a
      useful site for local anesthesia. We named this location the 'transperineal prostate biopsy
      local anesthesia switch' (abbreviated as TPA switch). In order to validate its effect, we
      organized this clinical trail.

      Ninety patients scheduled for prostate biopsy will include in this study. The clinical trial
      validation process will be as follows: (1) all patients are randomly divided into three
      groups (Figure 1): group 1, subcutaneous local anesthesia+periprostatic block; group 2,
      subcutaneous local anesthesia+periapical triangle (PAT) block; group 3, subcutaneous local
      anesthesia+TPA switch (transperineal prostate biopsy local anesthesia switch) block; VAS
      scores for each puncture and complications will be recorded.

    <description>the highest VAS (visual analogue scale) scores during the procedure in one patient. A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms. VAS is the most common pain scale for quantification of endometriosis-related pain and skin graft donor site-related pain. In detail, it is a 10-point categorical scale pain measurement. The score ranges from 0 to 10, and the no pain is 0, and highest pain is 10.</description>
