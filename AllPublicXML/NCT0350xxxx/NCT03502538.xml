      Objective: To compare the efficacy of Curaprox® CS 5460 Ultra Soft and Oral-B® Indicator Plus
      toothbrushes in dental plaque removal. Methods: 50 adult participants will be included in the
      sample. For a period of 24 hours (at two different times), they will be instructed to stop
      oral hygiene. During the final 4 hours, the interruption of consumption of foods and liquids
      will be recommended, and in smokers' case, the use of cigarettes. In two clinical visits (T0
      and T1), volunteers will be asked to brush their teeth for 1 minute with Curaprox® (CS 5460
      Ultra Soft) e Oral-B® (Indicator Plus) toothbrushes. Disclosure will be performed prior to
      and after brushing and the presence of plaque on the tooth surfaces will be evaluated.
      Turesky Modified Quigley Hein Plaque Index will be used for the plaque record. For
      statistical analysis, paired t tests will be performed to compare the effectiveness of
      toothbrushes and correlation test to assess whether the fact that the patient was aware of
      the toothbrush that will be used influenced in their performance.

      For the study, 50 patients, between 18 and 55 years of age, of both sexes and healthy will be
      selected. For the study performance, volunteers will be instructed to stop their brushing for
      23 to 25 hours before the first clinical visit. In addition, they will be also instructed to
      stop eating (solid foods and liquids) and to stop the use of cigarettes, if smoker, for 4
      hours before evaluation. Prior to the study, a pilot study will be conducted at the
      University Hospital of Brasília for the researcher calibration using the Turesky Modified
      Quigley Hein Plaque Index, following the predetermined protocol.

      A double-blind crossover study will be designed in which each volunteer will test two
      different models of toothbrushes. Prior to the beginning of the study, the brushes handle
      will be hidden with tape in a way that it will be not possible to see the toothbrush
      trademark. During the two visits, both brushes will be placed on the workbench and in the
      absence of the researcher, the participant will select one of the brushes. In the following
      visit, the same procedure will be performed and the participant will use the second brush. A
      period of washout of at least one week between the the first visit and the second visit will
      be done to obtain non-interference between results. No brush restriction will be imposed for
      the participant during this period.

    <description>The participants should stay for 24 hours without toothbrushing. After that, their dental surfaces will be stained, evaluated and the amount of dental plaque will be recorded. The first recording of the dental plaque will be registered and the brushing with each toothbrush model (at two different times, being these at least one week apart) was performed. Then, a second registration will be recorded. The measurement will be perfomed by visual assessment, according to the Plaque Index mentioned before. The index is based on the assessment of six areas of the dental surface; three in the buccal surface (mesio, middle and distobuccal) and three on the palatine / lingual surface following the same order (mesio, medium and disto). For each area a value according to the presence of plaque will be recorded. These values can be from 0 to 5. A statistical analysis will be performed to compare the amount of plaque removing after brushing with each toothbrush model.</description>

    <description>The toothbrush Curaprox 5460 Ultra Soft will be the tested toothbrush model, in order to asses its efficacy in plaque removal. Therefore, the study participants should brush their teeth using this toothbrush model, following the instructions of the investigator. From the data collect related in plaque removal the results will be arrived at.</description>
