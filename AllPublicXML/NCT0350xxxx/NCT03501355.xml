  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well-known that not only peripheral muscles, but also respiratory muscles muscle
      weakness and deconditioning play an important role in low exercise capacity of patients with
      Heart Failure (HF). Exercise training has been shown to improve exercise tolerance and
      quality of life in patients with heart disease. However, hearth failure patients with
      pacemaker such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronization
      pacemakers or defibrillators (CRT-P or CRT-D) have additional specific issues when performing
      exercise. No study investigated the effects of different inspiratory muscle training
      protocols. For this reason, we aimed to investigate the effects of inspiratory muscle
      training on outcomes in hearth failure patients with pacemaker
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure patients with pacemaker will be included. Primary outcome measurement is
      respiratory muscle strength, secondary outcomes are functional exercise capacity, peripheral
      muscle strength, pulmonary functions, maximal exercise capacity, fatigue, quality of life,
      depression, physical activity.

    <description>Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey (Turkish version of scale) The SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire that measures eight multi-item dimensions of health: physical functioning (10 items) social functioning (2 items) role limitations due to physical problems (4 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), mental health (5 items), energy/vitality (4 items), pain (2 items), and general health perception (5 items). For each dimension item scores are coded, summed, and transformed on to a scale from 0 (worst possible health state measured by the questionnaire) to 100 (best possible health state).</description>

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) - Short Form (Turkish version of scale ) This questionnaire assesses, in minutes, the physical activity performed by the volunteers during the period of one week. The IPAQ considered all activities carried out by the volunteer (e.g. leisure, sport, exercise, and activities at home or in the garden). According to the responses, the volunteer is considered very active, active, irregularly active or sedentary, according to the intensity and time of the exercises practiced over the last week.</description>

The questions have been grouped into seven categories, each rationally representing a different cognitive domain or function: Orientation to time (5 points); Orientation to place (5 points); Registration of three words (3 points); Attention and Calculation (5 points); Recall of three words (3 points); Language (8 points) and Visual Construction (1 point). The severity of cognitive impairment is classified as normal (30-27) mild cognitive impairment (26-20); moderate cognitive impairment (19-10); and severe cognitive impairment(&lt; 10).</description>
