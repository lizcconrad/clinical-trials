    <textblock>
      This study compares the intraoperative opioid free anesthesia approach in laparoscopic
      bariatric surgery to a conventional opioid- based anesthesia. Half of participants will
      receive opioid free anesthesia with dexmedetomidine, lidocaine and ketamine while the other
      half will receive opioid based anesthesia with fentanyl, remi-fentanyl and ketamine

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since optimal analgesia for the obese patients undergoing bariatric surgeries has always been
      challenging, and knowing the comorbidities and physiological changes in this population, use
      of opioid-sparing agents during anesthesia has attracted substantial research.the use of
      opioids in the perioperative period in obese patients is associated with an increased risk of
      complications . They are especially more sensitive to the respiratory depressant effect of
      opioids , thus any analgesic alternative without further compromising airway tone would be a
      desirable choice.

      Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-two adrenergic receptor agonist that has
      antinociceptive, analgesic and sedative properties, without compromising airway tone and
      reflexes .

      Lidocaine, a local anesthetic that has been shown to be an effective multimodal strategy to
      minimize postoperative pain was evaluated in one study involving obese patients undergoing
      bariatric surgery. Its usage was associated with an improved quality of recovery compared to
      placebo .

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative pain score for 48 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the pain score using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be' The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain. The score ranges from 0 to 100 mm. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The distribution pain is the following:no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).Postoperative pain will be measured using Verbal Analogue Scale (VAS) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 and every 6 hours up to 48 hours post surgery.</description>

    <time_frame>2 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>After the surgery the patient will go to the PACU (Post Anesthesia Care Unit). the patient will receive morphine if the pain score is more than 4. the total dose of morphine in mg (milligrams) will be documented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative morphine consumption at the surgical ward for 48 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative opioid consumption will be based on the amount in mg (milligrams) of opioid required in the 48 hours postoperative.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative morphine Side effects: Sedation score .for 48 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation score:
0 alert
Mild, drowsy , easy to awake
moderate, easy to arouse
Severe: somnolent difficult to arouse 4:sleeping The Sedation score will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours and then every 6 hours up to 48 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative morphine Side effects:Respiratory depression for 48 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the respiratory rate : The number of breaths per minute. In practice, the respiratory rate is usually determined by counting the number of times the chest rises or falls per minute.
The respiratory rate will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours and then every 6 hours up to 48 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative morphine Side effects: Nausea vomiting for 48 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Degree of nausea vomiting using the verbal rating score from 0 to 10 :
0= no nausea/ Vomiting, 10: worst possible nausea vomiting.
The degree of nausea vomiting will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours and every 6 hours thereafter up to 48 hours.</description>
