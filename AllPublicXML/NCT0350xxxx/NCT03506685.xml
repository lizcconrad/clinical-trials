  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if dry needling (DN) and soft tissue mobilization
      (STM) is superior to standard treatment protocol for affecting pain, pain medication usage
      and measurements of range of motion (ROM) after ACL reconstruction surgery compared to a
      standard treatment protocol. Measurements of pain, pain medication usage, lower extremity
      functional scale (LEFS) and ROM will be taken day 2 post op and 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and
      4 weeks post op. It is hypothesized that the inclusion of DN and STM will acutely decrease
      the demand for pain medication and improve objective measurements when compared to a standard
      treatment protocol. Findings will potentially lead to insights as to the benefit of applying
      these interventions to help decrease the demand for pain medication post-surgery.
