  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Next Generation Sequencing is able to sequence all DNA detected in a sample, including short
      strands. This differs from PCR testing, which uses pre-determined DNA primers to detect a
      limited number of specific, often large, strands of DNA. The investigators will test the
      ability of NGS to detect Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in the blood of study participants with an
      erythema migrans rash. This study will compare 20 study participants with the EM rash (cases)
      to 10 healthy study participants without an EM rash (controls). The investigators will
      collect clinically relevant information and send both currently used Lyme testing and Next
      Generation Sequencing in both the cases and controls. The case participants will then have
      two requested (but not required) follow up appointments at 1-3 weeks and 2-3 months later to
      obtain updated clinical information and send repeat NGS testing. The investigators will then
      conduct basic descriptive statistics on the results to determine if NGS is capable of
      detecting Lyme DNA during the acute phase of infection.
