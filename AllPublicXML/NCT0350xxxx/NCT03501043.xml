  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will aim to understand the potential benefit of the assessment of walking
      using video slow motion for muscle selection and the development of an image catalogue guide
      of the potential results of injection of abobotulinumtoxinA by comparing foot postures before
      and after injection. The objective is to evaluate the use of video assessment to improve
      muscle selection for the injection of botulinum toxin A to improve walking outcomes. Primary
      outcomes include: self-selected velocity (SSV), maximal velocity (MV) and symmetry of
      walking. Secondary outcomes include: passive range of motion (PROM), Modified Ashworth Scale
      (MAS) and the Tardieu Scale (TS). Fifteen persons post stroke or TBI over age 18 with
      equinovarus foot deformity who are able to ambulate will be included in the study. Dysport
      1000 to 1500 units will be used to be distributed on the basis of clinical indication to
      ankle plantar flexors (gastrocnemius and soleus), tibialis posterior and long toe flexors.
      The duration of subjects' participation is 4-6 weeks.

      This is a prospective, single arm, non-randomized clinical study with pre-post assessment to
      include post-stroke and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) outpatients with spastic ankle / foot
      muscles amenable to botulinum toxin injection. Subjects must be able to walk without braces.

      AbobotulinumtoxinA injection in a dose range of 1000 to 1500 units one time to be distributed
      on the basis of clinical indication to ankle plantar flexors (gastrocnemius and soleus), knee
      extensors, knee flexors, tibialis posterior and long toe flexors.
