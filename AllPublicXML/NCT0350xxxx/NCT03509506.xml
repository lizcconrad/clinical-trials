  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine the potential benefits that individuals with heart
      failure (HF) could experience from using a mobile application.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mobile application is called the Heart Failure Health Storylines (HFHS). The potential
      benefits will be examined by determining the changes in physical activity and quality of life
      of the participants, who will use the application and compare the results with the
      participants, who will not use the application.

    <description>The participants will be trained how to use the mobile application (Heart Failure Health Storyline (HFHS)) to track their health status, physical activity, manage their medications schedule, and explore the other features that the application has. Additionally, they will receive a pedometer to track their daily steps and record their data on the mobile application.</description>

    <description>The participants will be educated to use the HFHS application to monitor their daily vital signs (HR, BP, body weight), physical activity, and medications for 4 weeks.
The research team will monitor their data entry remotely via the HFHS App. The team will text the participant via the App if one or more of following conditions is noted:
The vital signs show undesired readings
The records on the HFHS App show that the participant did not take the medications as the schedule says
In addition, the team will call the participant 3 days later to follow up regarding the participant's action towards the text message that the team sent.</description>
