  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The possibility of exploring the lungs by lung ultrasound, a non-invasive tool, is becoming
      increasingly popular for anesthesiologists. Recently, Lichtenstein has described the FALLS
      protocol (Fluid Administration Limited by Lung Sonography) which uses the potential of
      pulmonary ultrasound to evaluate early pulmonary overload due to fluid administration at a
      subclinical stage. Indeed, fluid administration can generate a sub-clinical interstitial
      syndrome that can be detected by passing from a profile A to a profile B in lung ultrasound.
      The transition from a profile A to a profile B therefore corresponds to the transition from a
      state of preload dependent to a state of preload independence. However, this tool has not
      been studied in the operating room. The main objective of this study will be to study the
      correlation between pulmonary ultrasound and SV variation measured by esophageal Doppler
      during fluid administration in patients with haemodynamic optimisation in the operating room
      during digestive, urological, gynecological and orthopedic surgeries. The main expected
      result is the following: good correlation between the absence of increased SV in the
      esophageal Doppler and the appearance of a B-profile lung ultrasound fluid administration in
      the operating room.

    <description>Lung ultrasound consists of the application of a high-frequency ultrasound probe type Trans Thoracic Echography (ETT) on the anterior and lateral chest of the patient. Since air and bone do not pass through the US, it is the artefacts due to these structures that constitute ultrasound lung semiology.
Esophageal Doppler is a means of monitoring cardiac output measuring stroke volume (SV).</description>
