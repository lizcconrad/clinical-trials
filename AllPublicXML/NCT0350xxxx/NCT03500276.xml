    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a yoga program based on &quot;Yoga in
      daily life system&quot; in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

      The investigators want to explore whether this program will improve health-related quality of
      life and psychological well-being in patients. In addition they want to explore its potential
      positive modulation of the immune system.

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disabling inflammatory disease that substantially
      impacts health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients. In addition to pain, fatigue and
      physical disability the disease also affects psychological health. Yoga, a mind-body therapy,
      integrates physical exercises with relaxation and meditation. Published data suggest its
      beneficial effects on both physical and mental health in various chronic conditions. The true
      biological mechanism underlying these effects is not well known. Recent research suggests
      potential modulation of the immune system and inflammation-related gene expression changes.

      Hypothesis: Yoga program based on Yoga in daily life system has positive impact on clinical
      and biologic outcomes in RA patients.

      Aims: To determine the impact of a 12-week yoga program on measures of psychological
      distress, HRQOL, fatigue, pain, disease activity, levels of circulating inflammatory markers
      and pro-inflammatory gene expression.

      Materials and methods: 50 RA patients, aged 18-65 years, on stable standard pharmacological
      treatment will be randomly assigned to a 12-week yoga intervention (based on &quot;Yoga in daily
      life system&quot;) or arthritis-education control. Self-administered questionnaires will be used
      to assess quality of life and psychological well-being of the patients. Blood samples will be
      collected for measurement of inflammatory markers and expression of a set of pro-inflammatory
      genes. Disease activity will be assessed by DAS28CRP score. The patients will be assessed on
      baseline, post-treatment and at 3 months follow-up.

      This research will provide information on potential efficacy of yoga program in improving
      physical and psychological outcomes in persons with RA and explore its influence on
      immunological system.
