      The purpose of this study is to show that the addition of COMPOUND 2055269, an
      immunotherapeutic drug, to Folfox chemotherapy will improve the pathologic complete response
      rate in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      COMPOUND 2055269 has demonstrated meaningful clinical activity across various tumor types and
      treatment settings. No clinical trial is conducted over COMPOUND 2055269 in locally-advanced
      rectal adenocarcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged ≥18 years.

          2. Locally-advanced rectal cancer (cT2 N1-3, cT3 N0-3, evidence of extramural vascular or
             mesorectal fascia involvement).

          3. &lt;12 cm from anal verge.

          4. Histologically proven rectal adenocarcinoma.

          5. ECOG performance score ≤ 1.

          6. Have adequate organ function by meeting the following:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L;

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L;

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL;

               -  Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) range;

               -  AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 × ULN or AST and ALT levels ≤ 5 x ULN (for subjects with
                  documented metastatic disease to the liver);

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft- Gault
                  formula (or local institutional standard method).

          7. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening for women of childbearing
             potential.

          8. Highly effective contraception for both male and female subjects throughout the study
             and for at least 30 days after last COMPOUND 2055269 treatment administration if the
             risk of conception exists.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Distant metastasis (M1).

          2. Patients with T2 N0 or T4.

          3. Recurrent rectal cancer.

          4. Symptoms or history of peripheral neuropathy.

          5. Prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

          6. Current use of immunosuppressive medication, except for the following:

               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,
                  intraarticular injection);

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or
                  equivalent;

               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan
                  premedication).

          7. Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory
             agent. Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid

         12. Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
             antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3).

         13. Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (≥ New York Heart

             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 not constituting a safety
             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

         15. Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation.

             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

         17. Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug.

         18. Patients suspected by the physician that he/she will not compliant to the protocol
