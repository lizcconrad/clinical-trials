  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study of IMP4297 administered
      orally once every day to patients with advanced solid tumors for whom standard therapy either
      does not exist or has proven to be ineffective or intolerable. Patients with advanced breast
      cancer, ovarian cancer or prostate cancer are preferred. There are two stages to this study:
      a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage.
