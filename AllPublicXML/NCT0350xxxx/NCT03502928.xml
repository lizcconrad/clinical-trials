      INTRODUCTION: Whiplash is an injury produced by an acceleration-deceleration mechanism that
      transmits energy to the cervical spine. According to the bibliography, the conservative
      treatment (motor control exercises and manual therapy) has shown benefits in approaching this
      lesion, but its efficacy is limited. Dry needling has already shown its usefulness in
      different musculoskeletal pathologies, however, its efficacy is unknown when it is included
      in conservative treatment.

      OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to assess the effects of the incorporation of dry
      needling in the conventional treatment with manual therapy and motor control exercises,
      compared to the conventional non-invasive treatment in patients with acute or subacute
      whiplash.

      HYPOTHESIS: The inclusion of dry needling in conventional non-invasive treatment is more
      effective than conventional non-invasive treatment in patients with acute or subacute
      whiplash.

      METHODS: A randomized clinical trial will be conducted in which the subjects of study will be
      assigned to two groups, a control group (conventional treatment) and an experimental group
      (conventional treatment and dry needling).
