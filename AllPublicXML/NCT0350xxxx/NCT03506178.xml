  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an increasingly prevalent disorder characterized by repeated
      upper airway collapse during sleep, resulting in oxygen desaturation and frequent arousals.
      The etiology of OSA remains unclear.

      Many studies indicates an association between nasal obstruction and apnea. However,the
      precise nature of this relationship is far from clear and the importance of resistance to
      nasal airflow in the pathogenesis of airway collapse in OSA patients remains contentious.

      In this study, investigators perform 4 different ways to change subjective or objective
      patency of nasal cavity and observe the effects of the nasal airflow on nocturnal breathing,
      sleep,and upper airway muscles in OSA patients.

      1. All subjects underwent a standard overnight polysomnogram(PSG), including continuous
           genioglossal electromyography measurement , electroencephalogram, electrooculogram,
           electrocardiogram, nasal flow (thermister), respiratory (chest and abdominal)
           movements,oxy-hemoglobin saturation (pulse oximeter), and body position. Apnea event
           definitions and clinical classification were determined using the American Academy of
           Sleep Medicine(AASM) guidelines

        2. Pharyngeal electrical current sensory threshold was performed to identify the different
           Pharyngeal function between OSA patients and normal controls

    <description>A randomized, placebo-controlled double blind study on the effects of nasal spray oxymetazoline on sleep architecture, respiratory events, body position and subjective scores in OSA patients. All participants received specific physical examinations, subjective scale assessments and a two-night polysomnography sduty (by randomly applying oxymetazoline for one night and placebo for another.).Data collected after oxymetazoline or placebo treatments were compared. Apnea-hypopnea index(AHI),defined as the sum of apneas and hypopneas per sleep hour, was used as an important indicator for assess the severity of OSA.</description>

    <description>Participants were treated with 4 different nasal intervention ,including Oxymetazoline Nasal Spray, Normal saline Nasal Spray, Menthol Nasal Spray or Nasal mask with partly blocked when they sleep onset. At the treatment periods, subjects underwent overnight polysomnography with synchronous genioglossus electromyography . Genioglossus (GG) activations under different nasal ventilation conditions were compared.</description>
