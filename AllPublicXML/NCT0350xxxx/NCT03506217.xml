  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive transapical off-pump chordae implantation includes features such as
      tachycardia, arrhythmia, hemorrhage, sudden hemodynamic changes caused by the device moving
      in the left ventricle and the atrium, for anesthetists. In this observational study, the
      investigators presented the investigators's hemodynamic recuperation and anesthesia
      experiences revealed by cardiac output measurement after transapical mitral valve repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Sakarya University Educational Research Hospital, perioperative file records of 13
      patients who underwent mitral valve repair using the Neochord DS1000 system were
      retrospectively analyzed. In addition, hemodynamic measurements recorded with the Vigileo
      Flotrac invasive arterial cardiac output device were evaluated.

    <measure>systemic vascular resistance (SVR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1mounth</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic vascular resistance is used in calculations of blood pressure, blood flow, and cardiac function. Vasoconstriction (i.e., decrease in blood vessel diameter) increases SVR, whereas vasodilation (increase in diameter) decreases SVR</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>stroke volume variance (SVV)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 mounth</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke volume variation is a naturally occurring phenomenon in which the arterial pulse pressure falls during inspiration and rises during expiration due to changes in intra-thoracic pressure secondary to negative pressure ventilation (spontaneously breathing).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 mounth</time_frame>
    <description>The first (or top) number is your systolic blood pressure. It is the highest level your blood pressure reaches when your heart beats. The second (or bottom) number is your diastolic blood pressure. It is the lowest level your blood pressure reaches as your heart relaxes between beats.</description>
