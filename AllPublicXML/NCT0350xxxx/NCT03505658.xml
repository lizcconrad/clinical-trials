  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is significantly higher in specific ethnic groups and, in particular, Hispanics.
      There is an urgent need to implement culturally-sensitive lifestyle interventions and
      educational programs to decrease the burden of obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases
      in Hispanic populations. Accordingly, our overreaching goal is to tailor an existing and
      successful community-based program, Abriendo Caminos, to leverage effectiveness in promoting
      healthy nutrition and life-style behaviors among low income, low literacy Hispanic-heritage
      families. Our multi-function integrated project proposes to (a) adapt Abriendo Caminos for
      6-18 year-old children from Mexican and Puerto Rican heritage in five different locations
      (California, Illinois, Iowa, Puerto Rico, and Texas) and (b) Train existing professionals (in
      Extension and community agencies) and future professionals (Hispanic university students) to
      meet the specific needs of this population. Our central hypothesis is that participation in a
      6-week community-based program will prevent childhood obesity/maintain healthy weight by
      significantly increasing: (a) healthy dietary behavior patterns and basic knowledge of
      nutrition; (b) physical activity levels; and (c) the organization of collective/shared family
      mealtimes. The implementation of this culturally sensitive, workshop-based curriculum in
      different regions across the country will help to train the next generation of professionals
      in Extension and communities to deliver programs that meet the needs of Hispanic families.
      The integration of Hispanic college students in program implementation via an experiential
      learning course will further strengthen the program, as well as increase recruitment and
      retention of Hispanic students, increasing the capacity of Hispanic communities to meet their
      own needs in the future.
