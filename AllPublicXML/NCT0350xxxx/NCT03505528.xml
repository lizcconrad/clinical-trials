    <textblock>
      This phase 1b study will determine the safety and efficacy of combined treatment of Abraxane
      and phenelzine sulfate (Nardil) for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer.

      Participants may be eligible to join this study if they are aged 18 years or above and have
      been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer or inoperable locally advanced breast cancer.

      All participants will receive a combination of intravenous Abraxane and an oral dose of
      phenelzine sulfate. Abraxane will be administered weekly for the first 3 weeks of a 4-week
      cycle for 3 consecutive cycles. Phenelzine sulfate will be taken daily for the duration of
      the 3 cycles. Five patient cohort groups will receive a progressively increasing dose of
      phenelzine sulfate. Safety and efficacy will be assessed weekly over the 3 cycles of
      treatment.

      Although both drugs have been used in clinical care for more than a decade, they have not
      been intentionally combined together in a cancer therapy setting. This means that the
      combined effect of these two drugs has not been documented. This is being addressed in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) will be administered intravenously over 3
      cycles at a fixed dosage of 100mg/m2 to each study participant. This dose will be
      administered weekly for the first 3 consecutive weeks, over the 4 week cycle, before
      commencing the second and third cycles.

      In addition to the fixed dose of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, all patients will
      receive a continuous daily oral dose of phenelzine sulfate across all three cycles,

      Each of the five patient cohort groups will receive a progressively higher starting dose of
      phenelzine sulfate, consecutively. Cohort A will start at 15mg/day and will be increased to
      30mg/d by week 2 and further increased to 45mg/d for week 3, which will be maintained
      throughout the study. Cohort B will start at 45mg/d and will be held constant throughout the
      Study. Similarly, Cohort C, D &amp; E will start at 60, 75 and 90mg/d, respectively, and will
      also be held on this dose throughout the study. The decision to escalate the dose for the
      next cohort will be made on the basis of the number of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) events
      observed during the first 8 weeks in the preceding cohort group.

      Phenelzine sulfate compliance will be monitored weekly based on drug tablet returns.
