    <textblock>
      To determine biomarker responses to Entresto™in patients with Heart Failure with preserved
      Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) and who have high or low serum neprilysin (NEP) levels.

      This is a proof of concept single arm study in which 40 subjects with HFpEF will be assigned
      to Entresto™ 49/51 mg (sacubitril/valsartan) twice-daily for a total duration of up to 5
      weeks of treatment. Blood will be drawn prior to and at completion of treatment. The primary
      endpoint measured is change in biomarkers with Entresto™ administration that reflect NEP
      activity and myocardial stress (NT pro-ANP, -BNP, -CNP) and drug action (cGMP). This endpoint
      has been well validated as a measure of Entresto™ drug response.

    <description>The effect of administering Entresto™ to subjects with &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; NEP levels will be studied. Favorable response to Entresto™ therapy in these subjects will be assessed by evaluating a change in biomarkers that reflect NEP activity. Entresto™ is FDA approved for use in HFrEF and will be administered as recommended in the drug labeling information as an off label use in HFpEF as 49/51 mg twice-daily.</description>
