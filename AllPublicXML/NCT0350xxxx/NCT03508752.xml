      The phase I component of the study is to identify maximal tolerated dose (MTD). The phase II
      is to evaluate neurocognitive decline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On review of our experience with treatment for brain metastases since 2009, the investigators
      have treated over 100 patients with 6 or more metastases in a single radiosurgery session. In
      the past year and a half (2015-16) there have been approximately 50 patients treated with six
      or more metastases, indicating that there has been a shift in management of intracranial
      metastatic disease with increasing preference for radiosurgery despite the presences of
      greater metastatic burden. The phase I component will accrue 7-15 patients at each dose
      cohort until the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Once the MTD is reached, the
      phase II component will commence with a total of 50 patients total enrolled at the MTD, with
      a study time of 3 years. The primary endpoint of the phase I component is toxicity. The
      primary endpoint of the phase II component is the change in neurocognitive function, defined
      by a decline in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised delayed recall.

    <measure>Phase I: To determine the toxicity within 90 days from the date of SRS, in patients with a greater intracranial disease burden, defined as 6 or more metastases.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Any subject who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluated for toxicity. Each patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the study calendar. Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.
The following acute (&lt;30 days) and subacute (&gt;30 days - &lt;90 days) toxicities probably or definitely attributable to the protocol treatment, as defined in CTCAE v4.0, will be dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the study.
Grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicity in the below categories:
Ataxia
Symptomatic Central Nervous System Necrosis which is interfering with ADLs, or requiring treatment with hyperbaric oxygen, Avastin, or resection. Asymptomatic necrosis present on imaging alone does not constitute DLT.
Cerebral Edema (Grade 4)
Intracranial Hemorrhage
Seizure
Any Grade 4 or 5 toxicities definitely attributable to the protocol treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II: Determine the cognitive deterioration (HVLT delayed recall) in patients treated with SRS for multiple metastases (from baseline to 4 months)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) is a memory test that gives information about memory.
Each patient will serve as her or his own control, and the relative decline in HVLT-DR score from baseline to 4 month follow-up is deﬁned as
Δ HVLT-DR = (HVLT-R DR at baseline - HVLT-DR at 4 month follow up) / HVLT-DR at baseline.
A positive change indicates a decline in function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the optimal dose which will provide local control in patients with a greater intracranial disease burden, defined as 6 or more metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>It is assumed that the optimal dose will be the maximum tolerated dose. However, the maximum tolerated dose may or may not be the most ideal dose balancing benefit and toxicity with the widest therapeutic window.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Brain Subscale (FACT-BR).The FACT-BR is a multidimensional, self-report quality of life instrument specifically designed and validated for use with brain malignancy patients.</description>
