  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is reported that 85% of MS patients have gait disturbance, 87.9% balance, 35-90% fatigue
      and 45-60% cognitive problems. Rehabilitation approaches based on the motor control systems
      model, the plasticity concept, the motor learning principles, have been found to be effective
      for solving these problems. With these rehabilitation approaches, it is aimed to develop the
      ability of the person to meet the task and environmental demands and to realize the highest
      quality and the right function with maximum potential by consuming the least energy in
      different environmental conditions of different tasks. &quot;Task-oriented training&quot; may be one of
      the most effective among the evidence-based rehabilitation approaches for these goals.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of &quot;Task-Oriented Training&quot; on the
      physical and cognitive functions in patients with multiple sclerosis.

      The study was designed as a randomized, controlled, single-blind trial. The patients will be
      randomly assigned to two groups, the &quot;task-oriented training&quot; group, and the control group.
      &quot;Task-oriented training&quot; consisting of 10 different motor tasks including lower extremity and
      upper extremity activities will be applied to the training group twice a week for 6 weeks.
      The control group will be taught relaxation exercises and will be asked to perform the
      exercises 2 times for 6 weeks at home.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
      IL, USA). The pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the
      Wilcoxon Test. The significance level was set at p&lt; 0.05.
