    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of telemedicine intervention program upon glycemic control in
      type 1 diabetes mellitus children and their parents in Israel. Half of the participants will
      receive the telemedicine intervention for a period of six months while the other half will
      receive the regular treatment then vice versa. Each group will receive in the intervention
      period 6 telemedicine meeting with a dietician and six telemedicine meetings with a nurse.

      The investigators hypothesized that the participants that are recieving the telemedicine
      intervention will have a better glycemic control after 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 1 diabetes has been steadily increasing for the past few decades and
      is a relatively common chronic disease of childhood (1). Managing type 1 diabetes in young
      children presents unique challenges to the patient, parents, and to the pediatric health care
      provider. The diabetes regimen includes intensive blood glucose monitoring, multiple daily
      injections of insulin ,and frequent insulin dose adjustments according to the amount of
      carbohydrate eaten, blood sugar, and physical activity. The Diabetes Control and
      Complications Trail (DCCT) showed a significant link between blood glucose control and a
      slower onset and progression of diabetes complications, with improved glycemic control
      decreasing the risk of micro- and macro- vascular complication (2,3,4).

      Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures the

      In the past decade a significant progress took place in therapy and treatment of diabetes.
      However poor glycemic control is recorded in a significant proportion of adolescents.

      Telehealthcare is the use of telecommunications to deliver healthcare services and involves
      the remote interaction between a primary care provider and specialist. Telemedicine
      represents a useful and cost-effective solution to the strict follow-up required in diabetes
      management ,
