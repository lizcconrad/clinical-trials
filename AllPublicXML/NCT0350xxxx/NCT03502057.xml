      Study Design: Prospective, single-blinded, multi-center, randomized, controlled, pivotal
      study Study Objective: To evaluate if P-15L is not inferior in effectiveness and safety to
      local autologous bone (and allograft as extender where necessary) when applied in
      instrumented TLIF in subjects with Degenerative disc disease (DDD)

      Study Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: Month 24 Composite Clinical Success (CCS):

        -  Achievement of fusion (Evidence of continuous trabecular bridging bone in the
           intervertebral space)

        -  At least 15-point improvement in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)

        -  No new or worsening, persistent neurological deficit

        -  No subsequent surgical intervention at the index level

      Once fusion is radiographically confirmed, it will be assumed that fusion has occurred at all
      subsequent time points without the need to reconfirm fusion status at later time points.

      Multiplicity Controlled Secondary endpoint:

      • Visit at which fusion is confirmed.

      Other Secondary endpoints:

        -  Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores, changes over time, and achievement of a 20 mm
           improvement (Back, left leg, right leg);

        -  Physical Function and Mental Health Composite Scores (Short Form Health Survey SF-12 and
           changes over time).

    <textblock>
      Cerapedics currently markets a peptide-enhanced bone graft product, i-FACTOR putty, for use
      in cervical spine degenerative disk disease. i-FACTOR putty is a composite bone substitute
      material consisting of the P-15 peptide adsorbed onto anorganic bone mineral and suspended in
      an inert biocompatible hydrogel carrier. P-15 is a synthetic, 15-amino acid peptide that
      mimics the cellbinding domain of Type I collagen and is able to signal a mechanical and
      biochemical communication pathway that ultimately results in new bone formation. The P-15
      peptide enhances cell migration and induces osteoblast cell proliferation and
      differentiation. P-15 is specific to anchoring-dependent connective tissue mesenchymal cells,
      including osteogenic cells,and therefore does not induce bone formation in the absence of
      these cells. The receptor mediated anchorage of osteoblasts by P-15 initiates a number of
      signal transduction pathways that lead to the synthesis of growth factors, cytokines, and
      bone morphogenetic proteins.

      A prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial in cervical spinal fusion
      demonstrated the safety and efficacy of i-FACTOR putty compared to standard-of-care autograft
      (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00310440.) The results demonstrated that i-FACTOR putty was
      statistically non-inferior to autograft for fusion success, improvement in Neck Disability
      Index (NDI) scores, neurological success and number of adverse events, at both the 1 and 2
      year time point. The i-FACTOR putty was demonstrated to be statistically superior to
      autograft, at both 1 year and 2-years, for &quot;overall success&quot; which measures the patients that
      were successful in all of the test modalities.

      Cerapedics is developing a new bone graft product formulation to enhance our product
      portfolio, specifically a P15-based bone graft that is appropriate for lumbar spinal fusion,
      called P-15L. The new formulation comprises two new materials as compared to the original
      i-FACTOR putty. The first is the use of porcine-derived anorganic bone mineral (ABM) as the
      anorganic bone matrix. The second modification is the use of bovine collagen as the inert
      carrier for the anorganic bone granules. The introduction of collagen as the inert carrier
      will allow the P-15L to be used in a TLIF surgical indication since the collagen component
      provides material integrity for the putty in the implant site.

    <description>P-15L is a composite bone graft material consisting of multiple components - a synthetic peptide (P-15) adsorbed onto calcium phosphate particles, which are suspended in a collagen carrier. The P-15L Bone Graft is indicated for intervertebral body fusion of the spine in skeletally mature patients. The P-15L Bone Graft is intended to be used in conjunction with a PEEK TLIF Fusion Device and posterior pedicle screw fixation cleared by the FDA for use in the lumbosacral spine.The system is to be used in patients who have had at least six months of non-operative treatment.The P-15L Bone Graft is intended for use at one level in the lumbar spine (L2-S1) for the treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD) with up to Grade I spondylolisthesis. DDD is defined as back pain of discogenic origin with degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies.</description>
