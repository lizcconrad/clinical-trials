    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the how well apalutamide with or without stereotactic body
      radiation therapy work in treating participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
      Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using apalutamide
      may fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of testosterone by the tumor cells.
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays
      directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to
      normal tissue. It is not yet known whether giving apalutamide with or without stereotactic
      body radiation therapy works better in treating participants with castration-resistant
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate whether the proportion of patients with an undetectable serum prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) at 6 months following cessation of apalutamide is higher with addition
      of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to prostate specific membrane antigen
      (PSMA)-avid oligometastatic sites of disease compared to the group of patients receiving
      apalutamide monotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the time to PSA progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) criteria
      between treatment arms.

      II. To compare radiologic progression free survival (rPFS) between treatment arms.

      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apalutamide in combination with SBRT.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Beginning 60 days after first dose of apalutamide, participants also undergo
      stereotactic body radiation therapy for 1-5 fractions.

      ARM II: Participants receive apalutamide PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for
      up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed at for 30 days.
