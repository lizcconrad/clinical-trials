    <textblock>
      Despite exercise training decrease blood fasting glicaemy in 'average' terms, there is a wide
      inter-individual variability after exercise training explored mainly in adults but not in
      children. Thus, is yet unknown the effects and influence of the concurrent training (CT)
      eliciting responders (R) and non-responders (NR) cases (i.e., percentage of subjects who
      experienced a non-change/worsened response after training in some metabolic outcomes).

    <description>To concurrent training (endurance training plus resistant training, RT) program will be use cycle ergometers adapted for children (OXFORDTM, model BE2601, OXOFORD Inc, Santiago, Chile) were used. Prior to the CT intervention, all subjects were familiarized (during 3 sessions) with the training protocols. The CT intervention included 3 weekly sessions of both ET and RT. The core part of each session included RT followed by ET exercises (for 50 and 30 minutes, respectively) and was preceded and followed by a 5-minute warm-up and cool-down with callisthenic movements.</description>

    <description>CT in women with prediabetes and co-morbidities associated. Exercise will be performed at three sessions per week. Post statistical analyses will be including analyses by the 2 groups proposed. All sessions will be supervised by an exercise physiologist during 20-weeks.</description>
