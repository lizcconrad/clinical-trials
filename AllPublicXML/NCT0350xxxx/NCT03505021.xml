  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study,
      ODM-109 capsules and placebo capsules for ODM-109 is administered for 48 weeks. The subjects
      are allocated to 2 parallel groups receiving either levosimendan 1-2 mg daily or placebo in
      2:1 ratio. There is a screening visit, a baseline visit followed by visits at 2, 4, 8, 12,
      24, 36 and 48 weeks, and telephone contacts during weeks 18, 30 and 42. An end-of-study visit
      takes place 14-25 days after the last study treatment administration for each subject. The
      total study duration for each subject is about 51-52 weeks including the end-of-study visit.

      The planned number of study subjects is approximately 450.

      Primary objective is to confirm that levosimendan can significantly improve respiratory
      function in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

             definite ALS according to El Escorial revised criteria. Full electromyogram (EMG)
             report available consistent with ALS (but not necessarily fulfilling the
             electrodiagnostic criteria for ALS) from an experienced neurophysiologist

          -  Able to swallow study treatment capsules, and in the opinion of the investigator, is
             expected to continue to do so during the study

             visit
