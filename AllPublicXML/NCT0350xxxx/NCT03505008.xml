  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to evaluate the optimal dosage
      of methotrexate (MTX) as an add-on therapy to adalimumab (ADA) in participants with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have not achieved remission by MTX monotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The erythrocyte MTX-polyglutamates (MTX-PG) concentration will be measured to evaluate its
      relationship to the efficacy and safety of MTX therapy.
