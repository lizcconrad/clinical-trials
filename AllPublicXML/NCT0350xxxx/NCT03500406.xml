  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to utilize a novel, class I (ie. lowest risk, clinical studies not
      required) medical device to determine whether penile length can be increased in men prior to
      undergoing a penile prosthesis implantation procedure.

      Men with erectile dysfunction, unresponsive to conservative therapies, are recommended to
      undergo placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP); however, it is a common complaint
      post-operatively that their penis length is shorter than what it was previously.

      Several attempts have been made by investigators to optimize penile length prior to placement
      of the penile prosthesis. Compared to other options, penile traction therapy (PTT) offers
      several potential advantages in that it is minimally-invasive, does not increase the
      morbidity of surgery, and has not been shown to result in any long-term side effects.

      A new penile traction device (RestoreX® ) was created and funded through Mayo Ventures. Given
      the clinical issue of dissatisfaction with penile length post IPP, the potential role for
      PTT, and limited amount of data available, we sought to perform a clinical trial evaluating
      the effect of PTT on increasing the total length of prosthesis which can be inserted. We
      additionally sought to determine if PTT resulted in improved post-operative satisfaction on
      total penile length achieved.

      To accomplish the study, a population of men from Mayo Clinic planning to undergo placement
      of an IPP will be enrolled and will be randomized to either the control (no treatment) group
      or PTT for 3 months prior to their procedure. Outcomes will be assessed prior to surgery and
      3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. Results are to be used with the intent to publish in a
      scientific journal.
