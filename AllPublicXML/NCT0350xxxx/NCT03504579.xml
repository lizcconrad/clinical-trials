    <textblock>
      Auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia are one of the major symptoms of this disease and a
      major source of psychological discomfort. They are often difficult or impossible to treat
      with existing methods. This study will test the use of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to
      mitigate auditory verbal hallucinations in patients whose hallucinations are resistant to
      medication. Half of the patients will receive real time fMRI neurofeedback from a brain
      region involved in auditory hallucinations and half will receive it from motor cortex.

    <textblock>
      Auditory verbal hallucinations (AH) have long been a hallmark of schizophrenia (SZ) and are
      one of its major diagnostic features. They are difficult to manage with existing treatment
      options. Here, neurofeedback will be used to regulate the superior temporal gyrus (STG)
      activation which will not only lead to activation changes in the STG, but also to changes in
      the default mode network (DMN).

      The investigators will study SZ patients with medication resistant AH in the rt-fMRI
      intervention arm and in the sham-rt-fMRI arm. In both arms, the task and the rt-fMRI session
      structure will be identical. The SZ-intervention group will receive feedback from the STG
      while SZ-sham group will receive feedback from the motor cortex. In addition, 2 functional
      fMRI tasks will examine the effect of rt-fMRI neurofeedback and of sham-rt-fMRI on brain
      response.

      The investigators will randomly assign 48 SZ patients to either SZ-intervention (n=24) or
      SZ-sham-rtfMRI (n=24). The STG targeted neurofeedback is predicted to bring changes in brain
      regions involved in AH (STG and DMN) in SZ-intervention group only. The R61 GO criterion will
      be BOLD signal reduction in the STG, and resting state connectivity reduction between
      MPFC-PCC, post rt-fMRI-feedback in SZ-intervention group.
