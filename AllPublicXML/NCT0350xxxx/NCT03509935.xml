  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality and postoperative complications of high risk surgeries vary in the different
      series. The management of this group of patients in intensive care unit (ICU) is fundamental
      to improve these outcomes. The objective of this study will be to evaluate whether the use of
      bedside ultrasound has an impact on the management of this group of patients with a
      consequent reduction in the incidence of acute renal failure in ICU and, secondarily, the
      incidence of associated complications. All adult patients (≥ 18 years old) admitted to ICU at
      Hospital das Clinicas of UFMG in the immediate postoperative period of major surgery with
      indication of ICU monitoring will be included and randomly randomized to the control or
      intervention group. The control group will be conducted by the intensive care physicians in
      charge without the US, while the second group will be conducted based in US findings. The US
      protocol will consist of a pulmonary US in four windows in each hemithorax , qualitative
      assessment of contractility and variation of inferior vena cava diameter. The primary outcome
      will be the development of acute renal failure as measured by the KDIGO score. Secondary
      outcomes will be length of ICU and hospital stay, ICU and 28 days mortality, length spent in
      mechanical ventilation, accumulated water balance, noradrenaline and dobutamine dose. Serum
      and urinary biomarkers will also be evaluated. Key words: ultrasound, high-risk surgery,
      intensive care

      This is a single-center randomized clinical trial to be performed at the Adult Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU) of the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo
      Horizonte. The ICU is a clinical-surgical unit that has 18 beds with admission of
      approximately 100 patients per month, being 70% surgical patients and 30% clinical patients.
      Postoperative patients who meet the inclusion criteria reported below will be randomized to
      guide therapy according to ultrasound findings at the bedside versus a group that will not
      perform this method. Serum and urine samples will be collected in three times: admission
      (T0), after 12 hours (T1) and after 24 hours (T2) to analysed urine and serum biomarkers.

    <description>Patients will be submitted to Ultrasound protocol, namely:
In the first 6 to 12 hours of admission to ICU
Second US after 12-24 hours of inclusion.
Third US after 24-48 hours of inclusion.
Protocol:
US 4 pulmonary quadrants in each hemithorax: anterior and lateral, upper and lower regions.
US inferior vena cava, collapsability or distensibility index according to the patient's conditions, in spontaneous or controlled ventilation, respectively.
Cardiac US: subjective evaluation of contractility between normal, reduced or severely reduced.
The US findings will be communicated to the attending physicians who will conduct the patient, according to the protocol, recommending the administration of volume or not, and the use of vasopressors and/or inotropic drugs.</description>
