  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The progressive aging of the population is a socio-demographic phenomenon
      experienced by most countries in the world in recent decades, especially in Japan and in many
      European Union countries. During this process, so-called &quot;geriatric syndromes&quot; frequently
      occur. The focus of this study is the quality of life of the elderly in relation to these
      three factors: risk of falls, urinary incontinence, and insomnia.

      Objective: The main purpose is to determine the impact of a multifactorial intervention
      program implemented with institutionalized elderly people. The program is focused on the
      treatment of the aforementioned factors.

      Methods and Analysis: The study will be carried out with elderly people living in three
      residences for the elderly in A Coruña Province (Galicia, Spain).

      It is a prospective and longitudinal study, with a temporary series design of a
      &quot;quasi-experimental&quot; type that evaluates the effect of an intervention in one given
      population by doing assessments pre- and post-intervention, but there is no comparison with a
      control group.

      The intervention will be based on a multifactorial program, including the following phases:
      the use of wearable devices (wearable fitness trackers to register physical activity and
      sleep), the use of an App on a Tablet to record the participants' occupations and activities,
      counseling about performance in activities of daily living, the implementation of a physical
      activity program, and the treatment of the pelvic floor (according to each research line).
      The Quality of Life (QoL) will be assessed before and after the intervention, with the use of
      the questionnaire EuroQol-5D-5L. Data analysis will be applied with all registered variables
      through a quantitative perspective.

    <measure>Independence on Activities of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months later (during intervention). Three months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Index: This tool is used as a simple index of independence to score the ability of a patient to care for himself, and by repeating the test periodically, to assess his improvement. The performance is assessed based on these scores: &lt;20: total dependence, 20---40: severe dependence, 45-55: moderate dependence, and 60 or more: mild dependence.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months later (during intervention). Three months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The test is scored on the individual's ability to perform specific tasks. &quot;Scoring of the Tinetti Assessment Tool is done on a three-point ordinal scale with a range of 0 to 2. A score of 0 represents the most impairment, while a score of 2 represents independence. The individual scores are then combined to form three measures; an overall gait assessment score (12 points), an overall balance assessment score (16 points), and a combined gait and balance score (28).</description>

    <description>To implement this line, the protocol of the VIVIFRAIL Project will be used as a reference. That protocol has different physical exercises, divided into itineraries, in order to adapt it to a person's capability. Several sessions of this research line will employ the use of videogames so that the elderly can explore new forms of physical activity and thus establish contact and expertise with new technologies. It is estimated that two sessions per week over two months are needed for each person to continue doing physical activity independently and with autonomy.</description>

With each participant, routines and daily activities will be planned that will be adequate according to different recommendations about urinary incontinence, insomnia and risk of falls. Different performance guidelines will be established in order to establish a good balance between activities. The guidelines can include the recommendations about adjustments to the environment. It is estimated that three sessions per week for two months are needed to incorporate advice and routines into the daily lives of participants.</description>
