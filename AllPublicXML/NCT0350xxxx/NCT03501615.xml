      Multicentre Early Access Programme, designed to provide treatment access to moxetumomab
      pasudotox for eligible patients with relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia who are at least
      18 years of age, have adequate organ function and are Pseudomonas-immunotoxin naïve. Patients
      will be administered moxetumomab pasudotox on Days 1, 3 and 5 of each 28-day cycle until
      documentation of CR or for up to 6 cycles, progressive disease (PD), initiation of alternate
      therapy or unacceptable toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed HCL or HCL variant with a need for therapy based on at least
             one of the following criteria:

             a neutrophils &lt; 1.0x 109/L b platelets &lt; 100 x 109/L c hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL d
             symptomatic splenomegaly

          2. Pseudomonas-immunotoxin naïve

          3. At least 2 prior systemic therapies, including 2 courses of a PNA, or 1 course of
             either rituximab or BRAF inhibitor following a single prior course of PNA.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          6. Adequate organ function as defined below:

               1. total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, unless consistent with Gilbert's (ratio between
                  total and direct bilirubin &gt; 5)

               2. AST and ALT ≤ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               3. alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 ULN

               4. serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min as estimated by
                  the Cockcroft-Gault equation

          7. Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or partial thromboplastin
             time (PTT) &lt; 2.5 ULN, fibrinogen ≥ 0.5 lower limit of normal; if on warfarin, INR &lt;
             3.5, if on any other anticoagulation, PT &lt; 2.5 x baseline

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          9. Life expectancy ≥ 6 months.

         10. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male
             partner must use a highly effective method of contraception prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation, and must agree to continue using such
             precautions for 4 months after completion of moxetumomab pasudotox administration;
             cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible
             physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not
             acceptable methods of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Have had chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to initiation
        of treatment. 2. Receiving any other investigational agents. 3. Known brain metastases 4.

        5. Pregnant or breastfeeding females. . 6. Positive for Hepatitis B core antibody or
        surface antigen unless the patient is on Lamivudine or Entecavir and Hepatitis B Viral
        deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) load is &lt; 2000 IU/mL. 7. Active second malignancy requiring
        treatment other than minor resection of indolent cancers like basal cell and squamous skin
        cancers. 8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or
        active infection, Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
        uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, malaria infection, or psychiatric
        illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 9. Known
        human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients unless taking appropriate anti-HIV
        medications with a CD4 count of &gt; 200. 10.History of allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

             / HUS. 19.Corrected QT interval (Frederica) elevation &gt; 500 msec (manually over-read
             by medically qualified person) based on at least two separate 12-lead ECGs. 20.High
             dose estrogen (defined as &gt; 0.625 mg/day of an estrogen compound). 21.Clinical
