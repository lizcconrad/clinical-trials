      Does mixing alcohol make hangover worse?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hangover is the most commonly occurring morbidity associated with heavy drinking.

      Our aim was to test the hypothesis that mixing alcoholic drinks as compared to drinking one
      type of alcohol only (beer, wine or spirits) associate with a higher alcohol intake and worse
      hangover.

    <description>AHSS is a 12-item alcohol hangover measurement tool recommended for application in hangover research with a predictive validity of 92.4 %, significantly higher than that of other hangover scales (Penning et al., 2012). Alcohol hangover was measured thrice the day after drinking; in the morning immediately after waking up, at midday, and in the afternoon. The individual participant assessed his or her own hangover the day after.</description>
