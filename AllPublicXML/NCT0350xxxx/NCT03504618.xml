  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer with metastase in the diagnose time account for one significant rate and has a
      increasing trend. The treatment result of this patient group rests modest. The biological
      therapeutic treatment is still expensive for major part of Vietnamese patients. So that,
      research on a new affordable and efficacious chemotherapy combination for these patients is
      extremely necessary in our country The purpose of the study is to comment somes
      clinico-pathology features of metastatic colon cancer patients whose disease was not
      radically resectable.

      The second aim is to Evaluate the treatment result and toxicity of FOLFOXIRI in these
      patients

      In the world, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in male and the second most
      common cancer in female. In VietNam, the disease is the fourth cancer in male, the sixth
      cancer in female and increasing recently. About 20-40% of the colon cancer patients had
      distant metastasis at the time of diagnose, those treatment outcome remains poor (5years
      survival is about 11%). The targetted therapy medications are still not affordable for
      majority of Vietnamese patients. So that, 3 cytotoxic drugs (5-Fluoro-Uracil, Oxaliplatin and
      Irinotecan) remain back-bone in the treatment of metastatic colon cancer.

      According to one meta-analysis, the overall survival rate significantly correlated to the use
      of all 3 these drugs in the treatment time. If patients were give two drugs as the doublet in
      a line (FOLFOX/XELOX, FOLFIRI/XELIRI), not 100% of patients are treated with all 3 these
      drugs because some abandonned the following treatment lines. So, the trials that give all 3
      drugs in a line (first-line) as triplet (FOLFOXIRI) were carried out and had primirily good
      outcome. In 2010, FOLFOXIRI were recommended in NCCN guideline.

      In VietNam, FOLFOXIRI has been applied to treat patient since 2013. However, since then there
      was no clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and the toxicity of this combination.
      Therefore, we carried out the work &quot;Research on the treatment of metastatic colon cancer
      patients treated by FOLFOXIRI&quot;
