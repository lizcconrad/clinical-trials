  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the requirement for leucine, an essential amino acid, in adults
      over the age of 65 years. It is known that protein and amino acid metabolism may be altered
      with age and leucine, in particular, may be important in the diet of older adults.

      Eight different levels of leucine intake will be tested in each subject in random order. Each
      level of leucine intake will involve a 3-day maintenance diet, with measures being collected
      on the third.

      Leucine is an essential amino acid that is an important component of protein and stimulator
      of muscle protein synthesis. It is known that as people get older, over the age of 65, our
      body goes through many changes such as increase in fat mass and decrease in lean mass such as
      muscle. This is why we are studying how much of the essential amino acid, leucine, the body
      needs at this particular age.

      The indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method is a minimally invasive method for
      determining essential amino acid requirements.

      As essential amino acids cannot be stored in the body, they are either partitioned into
      protein synthesis or oxidized if in excess. The premise of the IAAO is that when any
      essential amino acid is limiting in the body then all other amino acids lose their ability to
      contribute to protein synthesis and are instead oxidized. The method therefore involves
      providing graded intakes (from deficient to excess) of the test amino acid, leucine, and then
      measuring the oxidation of another amino acid, which is called the indicator amino acid. This
      is done by isotopically labelling the indicator amino acid (we often use 13C- phenylalanine)
      and then measuring the appearance of labelled carbon dioxide (13CO2) in breath with the
      different intakes of the test amino acid, leucine. The requirement for leucine will be
      determined by the &quot;breakpoint&quot; - the point at which oxidation of 13C- phenylalanine will
      plateau.

      For the study, subjects will first participate in a pre-study assessment in which height,
      weight, body composition (fat mass and muscle mass) and resting energy expenditure and
      medical history will be assessed. Also, 10 ml of blood will be collected to test for diabetes
      and kidney function. The purpose of the pre-assessment is to calculate subject's dietary
      requirements for the study, and to assess health status, activity level and dietary patterns.

      Subjects will then participate in up to 8 different 3-day studies that will be separated by a
      minimum of 1 week between each 3-day study. The first 2 days are adaptation days and subjects
      will consumed the maintenance diet at home s 4 equal meals. The 3rd day is called a study day
      and subjects will consumed 8 hourly formulas; the first 3 at consumed at home and the
      remaining 5 are consumed at the Clinical Research Centre at the Hospital for Sick Children.
      Immediately after the 4th meal, 4 baseline breath and 3 baseline urine samples are collected.
      After the 5th meal, rate of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) is measured by indirect
      calorimetry for a period of 20 minutes. The 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th meal will contain a small
      amount of isotope labelled phenylalanine (13C phenylalanine). Two and a half hours after the
      isotope (13C phenylalanine) is given, 4 plateau breath and 3 plateau urine samples are
      collected.

      Breath samples are used to measure the enrichment of isotopic labelled CO2 (13CO2). Urine
      samples are used to measure the enrichment of isotopic labelled phenylalanine (13C
      phenylalanine). Through a series of calculations and applying a two-phase regression
      analysis, we will be able to determine the requirement for leucine.
