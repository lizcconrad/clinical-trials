  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a safety and feasibility study to assess the performance of artificial
      pancreas (AP) system using the Zone Model Predictive control (Zone-MPC) and Health Monitoring
      System (HMS) algorithms embedded into the APS APP platform.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The system will be evaluated on up to 10 adult subjects with type 1 diabetes age 18-75 years
      old at a single clinical site (Sansum Diabetes Research Institute), who will complete a
      48-hour closed-loop (CL) session in an observed CRC environment with medical staff present.
      During the session subjects will bolus for all meals and snacks and perform a 45-minute
      walking session while supervised by medical staff. The AP system used consists of an insulin
      pump, a CGM sensor, and a phone app (the Artificial Pancreas System [APS] phone app).
