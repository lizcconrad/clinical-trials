  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel, class I (ie.
      lowest risk, clinical studies not required) medical penile traction device in preventing loss
      of penile length in men undergoing robotic-assisted prostatectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of prostate cancer results in several known sexual dysfunctions, including
      erectile dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, penile curvature
      (Peyronie's disease), and reduced penile length. Among the dysfunctions, loss of penile
      length is often one that results in significant distress and bother to patients. Beyond the
      esthetic concerns, reduced penile length may lead to inability to participate in sexual
      intercourse, difficulty with future interventions to restore erectile function, and lead to
      worsened urinary hygiene.

      Penile traction therapy (PTT) is currently the best available treatment to maintain or
      restore lost penile length due to conditions that reduce length. To date, no studies have
      evaluated the benefits of using PTT in this clinical setting. The objective of the current
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel penile traction device (RestoreX®), created and
      funded through Mayo Ventures, in maintaining or restoring reduced penile length.

      To accomplish the study, a population of men from Mayo Clinic who have undergone a
      prostatectomy will be enrolled and randomized to utilize the device for varying amounts of
      time. Outcomes will be assessed at 6 and 9 months post-prostatectomy and results are to be
      used with the intent to publish in a scientific journal.
