    <textblock>
      Assessing program efficacy of under five food supplementation (PMT Biscuits) is needed after
      the first 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding, children were introduced to liquid and
      semi-solid food. In this phase of food introduction, children ability to accept food
      supplementation program was still questionable and the efficacy needs to be assessed.

      Another aspect that needed to be evaluated is assessing the efficacy of food supplementation
      to improve the nutritional status of wasting children in multiple cities to describe
      Indonesian geographical and socio-economic diversity (multi center studies). PMT biscuits
      supplementation intervention is accompanied by educational modules on Infant and Young Child
      Feeding (IYCF) in order to improve caregiver's knowledge and skills in providing economically
      affordable and nutritious food for their children. PMT biscuits supplementation evaluation
      will be assessed at 9 months observations (3 months intervals). The observation will be
      conducted every month up until the first 3 months then the observation will be continued in
      6th and 9th months of observation.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention is running parallel in three arms.
The first arm as a control group obtaining only routine IYCF counseling by the cadre and without the provision of biscuits. If there are respondents at the first three months data collection who experience a decrease in nutritional status, then the respondent will be given biscuits immediately
The second arm as the first intervention group to get biscuit with portion as recommended by Ministry of Health and also given the IYCF counseling by the cadres and nutritionist
The third arm as the second intervention group receiving biscuit with adjustment in portion and IYCF Counseling that emphasize the optimization of local food In the 2nd and 3rd arm, treatment was administered for 3 months according to the recommended duration of biscuit delivery by the Ministry of Health, but all respondents from three arms will continue to be followed in third, sixth, and ninth months from the beginning of treatment.</intervention_model_description>
