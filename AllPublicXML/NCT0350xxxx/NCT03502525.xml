  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Break the Cycle is a two-session, one-on-one, in-person intervention study designed to reduce
      the role persons who inject drugs (PWID) play initiating non-PWID into injection drug use.
      Study implementation is at two sites: New York City and Tallinn, Estonia. At baseline,
      quantitative data are collected via a structured computer-assisted personal interview, after
      which the intervention is conducted. At the 6-month follow-up, a modified version of the
      interview is repeated. The study uses a pre- versus post- design to compare the proportion of
      participants who helped with first injections, and who promoted injecting among non-PWID, in
      the 6 months prior to baseline with the proportions at the 6-month follow-up. Based on
      previous research on the intervention and on the underlying theory of motivational
      interviewing, increases in helping and promoting behaviors between baseline and follow-up
      would indicate that the intervention was not effective regardless of their effect size.
      Accordingly, the hypotheses that the intervention will produce reductions in assisting with
      first injections and engaging in injection promoting behaviors will be evaluated using
      one-tailed statistical tests. Break the Cycle intervention follows a motivational
      interviewing approach to enhance current injectors' motivation and skills to avoid helping
      with and promoting first injections among non-PWID. The intervention's core is a discussion
      between an interventionist and each participant on the following eight topics: the
      participant's first time injecting drugs; the participant's exposures to situations where
      helping with others' first injections is an option, and the extent to which they have helped;
      PWIDs' behaviors that might encourage non-PWID to inject for the first time; the range of
      risks associated with injection drug use; role-playing scenarios in which the participant
      develops behaviors and scripts for avoiding or refusing requests to initiate others into
      injection drug use; role- playing talking with other PWID about not encouraging non-PWID to
      start injecting; imparting safer injection practices when helping with a first injection
      seems like the best option; and receiving training in and using Narcan to reverse overdoses.
