    <textblock>
      A prospective, double blinded and randomized study included women with breast cancer and
      underwent mastectomy, and randomly allocated into two groups of equal size. Lidocaine group
      and control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women aged between 18 and 60 years old with breast cancer and underwent mastectomy, ASA I or
      II were included in the study.

        -  Group I (lidocaine): Patients were received intravenous 1 mg/kg of 2 % lidocaine as a
           loading dose (just before induction of anesthesia) then received 2mg/kg /h lidocaine as
           maintenance dose (with maximum of 200 mg/h) till the end of the operation (skin
           closure).

        -  Group II (control):- A standardized equal volume of intravenous bolus dose of normal
           saline was given as loading dose then normal saline was administered on an equal rate of
           infusion.
