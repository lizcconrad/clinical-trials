  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to clinically and radiographically compare the performance of short
      (6 mm-long) versus long (≥11 mm-long) dental implants placed in the interforaminal region of
      fully edentulous mandibles, supporting a screw-retained full-arch cantilever bridge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of short dental implants provides undeniable benefits in sites where the reduced
      available volume would otherwise need bone augmentation procedures and their use has greatly
      expanded in the recent years. However, well designed clinical trials which provide a sound
      evidence of their performance and reliability are still lacking to date.

      In this post-market, multi-center, open, parallel-group, randomized, controlled clinical
      trial the investigators aim to to clinically and radiographically compare the performance of
      short (6 mm-long) versus long (≥11 mm-long) dental implants supporting a mandibular
      screw-retained full-arch cantilever bridge.

      Five 4mm-wide/6mm-long (test) or 4mm-wide/≥11mm-long (control) titanium dental implants
      (Osseospeed™, ASTRA TECH Implant System™, Dentsply Sirona) are placed in the interforaminal
      region of fully edentulous mandibles, in non-regenerated sites, with at least 1 mm of
      peri-implant bone circumferentially.

      All products are CE (European Conformity) marked and used within their intended use.

      A two-stage surgery is performed, implants are positioned in healed bone and exposed after 3
      months to be connected with the prosthesis.

      This is a medium term (5 years) follow-up study including evaluations also at 1 and 3 years
      from the baseline.

      Three italian centers participate: Naples (University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot;), Naples
      (AORN &quot;A. Cardarelli&quot;), Catania (Private Office).

      The study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
      Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot;.

    <description>A surviving implant is defined as an implant in place at the time of the follow-up. Any implant loss shall be assessed as an early loss (implant fails before being osseointegrated) or late loss (after being osseointegrated).</description>

    <measure>Marginal bone level (MBL) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prosthetic loading), 1, 3 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal bone level (MBL) is measured as the distance in millimiters calculated on periapical radiographs from the implant neck to the most coronal bone-to-implant contact point at both the mesial and the distal side of each implant. The radiographs will be taken with an X-ray apparatus supplied with a long cone and Rinn's film holders.</description>
