  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      15 eyes of 15 patients with primary double-headed pterygia that underwent vertical split
      conjunctival autograft pterygium surgery were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had
      primary double-headed pterygia. Recurrence was defined as fibrovascular proliferation over
      the limbus onto the cornea.

      Vertical split conjunctival autograft using fibrin glue is an effective technique with good
      cosmetic results and low to no recurrence for primary double head pterygia treatment.

      The pterygium body was dissected from the sclera. Complete excision of the pterygium,
      subconjunctival Tenon's tissue and surrounding fibrovascular tissues followed.The
      conjunctival edge was trimmed. The corneal surface was gently scraped with a scalpel. The
      Same procedure was done on temporal pterygia. A free conjunctival autograft was obtained. The
      graft was divided vertically into two parts. The nasal part of the graft was cut from limbal
      attachment including limbal tissue; temporal part was left attached. The nasal part of the
      graft was moved to the nasal conjunctival defect and attached to the sclera with fibrin
      sealant (Tisseel; Baxter, Vienna, Austria). The Same procedure was done with the temporal
      part of the graft. The orientation of graft was ensured before securing it.
