  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune and sistemic disease,characterized by joint
      sinovitis and the production of autoantibodies (Ab). The Ab against citrullinated peptides
      (ACPA) are the most specific (92-98%), and high sensitivity (75-81%) and they are of
      prognostic value. ACPA are already in the beginning of the disease in most cases, having been
      found years before its onset. Recent studies have suggested that ACPA may have a role in
      perpetuating inflammation, in the generation of bone erosions and in pain in RA.

      Citrullination is a post-translational modification mediated by the PAD, which transforms an
      arginine into a citrulline. In vivo, this enzyme acts in proinflammatory environments.
      Despite being widely studied, none of the natural citrullinated substrates have been shown to
      be the triggering and/or perpetuating factor in the response of B cells in RA, understanding
      this response as the production of ACPA. In fact, the most specific and sensitive commercial
      test for the detection of ACPA uses synthetic peptides protected by a patent.

      In the other hand, the genetic factor that most increases susceptibility to develop RA is a
      shared sequence of aminoacids (QKRAA, QRRAA i RRRAA), in the HLA-DRB1 gene, known as the
      shared epitope (SE). Also, SE, confers prognostic value, and is associated with the presence
      of ACPA. These SE sequences contain arginines (R), which are susceptible to be citrullinated
      by the PAD enzyme.

      We propose the hypothesis that citrullinated SE act as an antigen capable of activating the
      inflammatory response mediated by B and T cells in RA. The recognition of an HLA as a foreign
      one, would originate an answer of alloimmune type, not valued to date.

      The objective of the study is to test the immune response mediated by B cells and T cells, in
      cases and control samples, through an in vitro model that confronts them with peptides
      containing the citrullinated-SE sequence. In addition, we will evaluate the association
      between these results with the clinical features of cases (RA included in the study). Their
      role as a biomarker, as well as their potential to improve the tests currently available to
      detect ACPA will be explored.
