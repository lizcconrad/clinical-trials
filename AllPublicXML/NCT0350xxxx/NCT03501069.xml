  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize safety and tolerability of TAK-418 in
      non-Japanese and Japanese healthy female participants when administered at single or multiple
      (once daily [QD]) oral doses.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-418. This study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD of single and multiple rising doses of TAK-418 in healthy Japanese or
      non-Japanese females.

      The study will enroll approximately 48 participants in 6 cohorts and each cohort will have 8
      participants. The study will include 2 parts: single rising dose (SRD) in Cohort 1 and
      multiple rising dose (MRD) in Cohorts 2 to 6. Cohort 3 will include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      collection. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one
      of the 6 cohorts.

      This two-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in Cohort 1 of this study is approximately 105 days and 98 days in Cohort 2. Participants
      will be contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

          3. Has a local infection at the puncture site.

          4. Has thrombocytopenia or other suspected bleeding tendencies noted before the
             procedure.

          5. Has developed signs and symptoms of spinal radiculopathy, including lower extremity
             pain and paresthesia.

          6. Has any focal neurological deficit that might suggest an increase in intracranial
             pressure.

          7. Has any abnormal finding on ophthalmological assessment/fundoscopy indicative of
             raised intracranial pressure (that is, optic disc swelling/edema; or [uncontrolled]
             hypertensive retinopathy).

          8. Regularly has moderate-to-severe headaches requiring analgesics.

          9. Has any bleeding abnormality or history of bleeding abnormalities.
