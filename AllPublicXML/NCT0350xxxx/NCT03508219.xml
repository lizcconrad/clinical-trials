    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to study the safety and efficacy of the BiOSS LIM C
      with respect to Patient oriented Composite Endpoint (PoCE) at 12 months in a &quot;real world&quot;
      left-main bifurcation population and as compared with a prespecified performance goal.

    <description>The BiOSS LIM C (Bifurcation Optimization Stent System, Balton, Warsaw, Poland). The BiOSS LIM C is a dedicated bifurcation stent covered with a mixture of a biodegradable polymer and the antiproliferative substance sirolimus. BiOSS LIM C will be used for treatment of the Left-Main bifurcation, according to its instructions for use.
The Alex-Plus cobaltchromium sirolimus eluting stent (Balton, Warsaw, Poland) will be used for treatment of distal left-main side branches according to its instructions for use (i.e. proximal segments of the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries as well as the ramus intermedius if the latter vessel is part of a trifurcation).
All other lesions (other than left-main bifurcations) will be treated with XIENCE family everolimus-eluting coronary stent systems.</description>
