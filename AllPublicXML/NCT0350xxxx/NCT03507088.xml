  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effects of fulvestrant on the ERs may be evaluable by molecular imaging using positron
      emission tomography with the ER-specific FES tracer. In this study we will determine the
      utility of FES-PET in the prediction of response to fulvestrant 500 mg in women with estrogen
      positive metastatic breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 70% of patients with metastatic breast cancer present with hormone receptor
      positive disease and for whom hormonal therapy is the preferred treatment approach.
      First-line treatment recommendations for women with hormone receptor positive locally
      advanced or metastatic disease includes a generation aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen.
      Fulvestrant, a 17Î²-estradiol analog, is an antiestrogen that suppresses estrogen signaling by
      binding to ER and inducing oestrogen receptor degradation and has estrogen antagonistic
      activity but no estrogen agonistic effect. Fulvestrant has been shown to have superiority
      over other endocrine therapy in a series of randomized controlled trials.

      The whole-body imaging of the availability of ER using FES-PET may prove valuable to evaluate
      the effects of fulvestrant on the ER non-invasively in individual patients. This potentially
      allows early prediction of therapy efficacy to fulvestrant in women with estrogen positive
      metastatic breast cancer.

      In this pilot-study we will evaluate 35 patients who received fulvestrant as treatment for
      metastatic breast cancer. All patients will undergo FES-PET/CT at baseline and FES-PET after
      28 days. Whenever possible, tumor biopsies will be performed to correlate to FES-PET results.
