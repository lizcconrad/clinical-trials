  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and pre-diabetes threatens the overall health and functional independence of elders
      but lifestyle weight management for diabetes prevention, soon to be reimbursed by Medicare,
      can reduce this burden. The current 24-month study will enroll adults, ages 60 and older,
      through senior community centers. The investigators will study how two long term weight loss
      maintenance programs, using group telephone sessions to support health behavior change,
      impact meaningful health outcomes. If successful, this project will provide a sustainable
      intervention model for healthy aging services that can benefit older adults and society.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The confluence of obesity and pre-diabetes in older adults increases the risk of diabetes,
      and accelerates functional decline, multimorbidity, disability, and death. More research is
      needed to refine and extend preventive interventions to reduce burden for elders and society.
      For over a decade efficacious 6- and 12-month Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle
      interventions have been translated successfully and demonstrated positive impact. However,
      efforts to develop and evaluate potentially scalable programs conforming to current
      guidelines for longer term DPP interventions (up to 24 months), which are consistent with a
      chronic care model, and help a greater proportion of enrollees achieve and sustain the
      recommended weight loss target of ≥ 5% are lacking. The scientific premise is that evaluation
      of translational DPP interventions, which has centered largely on strategies for weight loss
      induction, must be extended to include long-term interventions that clearly demonstrate
      meaningful weight, cardiometabolic and functional health benefits especially for vulnerable
      elders in community-based settings. A previous DPP-based study from our research team has
      documented the utility of telephone follow-up after a 6-month DPP weight loss induction and
      shown that 63% of a 65-80-year-old volunteer sample with obesity and other risk factors were
      able to sustain ≥ 5% weight loss at 12-months. Despite good evidence that longer duration
      lifestyle interventions yield better outcomes (reflected in the latest Medicare ruling) there
      are no translational studies of 24-month long DPP-based interventions for older adults
      exclusively. We now propose to utilize community based settings to examine whether we can
      sustain the impact of an elder-focused DPP approach using potentially scalable treatment
      components over a 24-month period. We will recruit and enroll adults 60 years of age and
      older, with obesity and pre-diabetes (N = 360) from a network of senior community centers
      that provide aging services. The intervention program sequencing will be aligned with current
      Medicare guidelines. First, from 0-6 months, experienced lifestyle coaches will administer a
      DPP-video and telephone coaching intervention for all participants, at least 25% from
      ethnic/racial minority groups. Next, participants, will be randomized (N = 180 per arm;
      stratified by weight loss of &lt; or ≥ 5%) to one of two 18-month follow-up conditions
      administered as monthly group telephone sessions between 6-24 months. The investigators will
      compare the effects of (1) 30-minute DPP behavioral intervention with healthy aging focus,
      and (2) 15-minute support and information calls on measures of weight/adiposity (the primary
      outcome) at 12, 18, and 24 months. In addition, we will collect cardiometabolic, physical
      activity, physical function, psychosocial, behavioral and other age-sensitive quality of life
      measures at 12 and 18 and 24 months. Medicare claims data will also be examined for a
      proportion of the sample regarding medication use, outpatient, inpatient, and emergency
      visits and enrollment/participation in elder-focused activity programs. This work, if
      successful, will have immediate potential for DPP-sustainable lifestyle interventions that
      benefit vulnerable aging individuals and society.
