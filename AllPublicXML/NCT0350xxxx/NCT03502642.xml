  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery is one of the most common surgical procedures, performed at an increasingly
      high rate. It is associated with intense postoperative pain that may hamper the
      rehabilitation process and interfere with patient satisfaction and care provided to the
      newborn. Therefore, control of perioperative pain with multimodal regimens using local
      anesthetic may be important in short- and long-term convalescence after surgery.

      Opioid-based regimens are the &quot;gold standard&quot; of cesarean delivery analgesia. However, spinal
      and epidural opioids have a ceiling effect.

      Wound infiltration with local anesthetics has been used widely in the multimodal approach of
      pain relief. Continuous wound infusion with local anesthetic through a multiorifice catheter
      increases the duration of action and efficacy of local surgical wound infiltration compared
      with a one-time wound injection of local anesthetic.

      After cesarean delivery, Local anesthetic continuous wound infusion would be associated with
      better reduction in pain scores when compared to intrathecal morphine . Therefore, an
      assessor and patient blinded, randomized study that aimed to compare the efficacy and side
      effects of these analgesia techniques was conducted.
