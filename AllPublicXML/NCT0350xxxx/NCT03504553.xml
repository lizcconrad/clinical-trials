  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will investigate whether reduction in ambient light and elimination of noise on
      induction of anesthesia alters anxiety (modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale or mYPAS) or
      compliance (induction compliance checklist or ICC scoring), alters recovery following
      emergence using pain scores, analgesic requirements, and emergence delirium (post anesthesia
      emergence delirium or PAED), or post-discharge behavior at 1, 7 and 14 days (modified post
      hospitalization behaviour questionnaire or PHBQ) in patients who receive anxiolytic
      premedication. In addition, the investigators will assess the cumulative level of nose
      exposure that patients experience during the perioperative period.
