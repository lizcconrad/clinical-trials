  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aimed to compare the ease of use of the LMA protector and I-gel LMA for
      tracheal intubation with the Aintree catheter in our study.

      Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) protector is the second generation perilaryngeal seal type
      supraglottic airway tool. The I-gel LMA is the second generation uncuffed supraglottic airway
      device. The Aintree Intubation Catheter has been designed for assisted fiberoptic intubation
      and for uncomplicated, atraumatic endotracheal tube exchange.Both LMA types have a structure
      that permits endotracheal intubation. In cases of difficult intubation, these two LMA types
      can be used. In the literature, there is no study comparing these two LMA types using Aintree
      catheter.Difficult Airway Society (DAS) published a guide for tracheal intubation in 2011
      using Aintree. According to this guide, LMA type LMA Supreme is the most unfavorable for this
      process. However, there is no research or recommendation on the type of LMA most suitable for
      use in the literature. In accordance with the data of this study, it will be tried to show
      which LMA type may be suitable for intubation with Aintree catheter in patients.

      Investigators will include adult patients over 18 years of age who will undergo a surgical
      operation requiring intubation. Patients will be divided into protector LMA and I-gel LMA
      groups by closed envelope method. Forty patients are planned for both groups. The age,
      weight, height, body mass index (BMI) of the patients, operation to be performed, ASA,
      mallampati, thyromental distance values will be recorded. A standard induction of anesthesia
      will be applied to the patient. After 2 minutes the LMA will be inserted. It will be recorded
      how many numbered LMAs are used, success rate, number of trials, optimization maneuver
      required. With LMA, whether sufficient amount of tidal volume can be given to the patient and
      whether sufficient amount of chest departure is observed during ventilation will be recorded
      together with tidal volume values. In patients with adequate ventilation, an Aintree catheter
      placed on a fiberoptic bronchoscope in LMA will be delivered. Fiberoptic laryngeal appearance
      staging will be performed:

      Stage 4: only the cords look Stage 3: cords + posterior epiglot seen Stage 2: cords +
      anterior epiglot seen Stage 1: no cords seen Cord vocals will be seen on the monitor and the
      aintree catheter will be sent into the trachea. After insertion of the trachea, the
      fiberoptic bronchoscope and LMA are removed and the patient's intubation tube is advanced
      through the Aintree catheter in the appropriate size and the tube is placed in the trachea.
      Once participants have made sure that the tube is trachea, it will be removed. The time from
      insertion of the LMA to placement of the endotracheal tube will be coded. During the
      procedure, the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, any complications
      that may develop will be recorded.
