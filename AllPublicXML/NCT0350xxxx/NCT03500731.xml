  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a lung transplantation prior to bone marrow
      transplantation (BMT) would allow for restoration of pulmonary function prior to BMT,
      allowing to proceed to BMT, to restore hematologic function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of performing lung
      transplantation followed by cadaveric, partially HLA-matched (≥1/6 HLA-match with an
      identical ABO blood type) CD3+/CD19+ depleted bone marrow transplantation in bone marrow
      failure and end-stage lung disease. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic,
      progressive, and fatal interstitial lung disease for which lung transplantation is the only
      therapy shown to prolong survival. Given the association of IPF with hematologic cytopenias
      and bone marrow failure, it is proposed that a tandem lung transplantation and bone marrow
      transplantation from a single cadaveric donor could be successful. This protocol focuses on
      performing combined transplantation for candidates that are unable to undergo standard lung
      transplantation. Lung transplantation prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) would allow
      for restoration of pulmonary function prior to BMT, and to restore hematologic function post
      BMT transplantation. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the feasibility and long-term
      complications associated with combined solid organ and BMT including the ability to initiate
      and successfully withdraw from immunosuppression following BMT and to attain independence
      from growth factors, red blood cell or platelet transfusions.

    <description>All patients will undergo a cadaveric, partially HLA-matched lung transplantation followed by a CD3+/CD19+ depleted BMT from the same donor. In this study, the investigators will use a ≥1/6 HLA-matched T cell depleted bone marrow transplantation from a cadaveric organ donor with an identical ABO blood type as the recipient. Prior to transplantation, the marrow will be negatively selected for CD3/CD19 using a CliniMACS® depletion device.
Subjects will undergo lung transplantation utilizing standard induction regimens selected by the CO-PIs based on the subject's underlying comorbidities and allosensitization. Rituximab may be initiated prior to the lung transplantation with tacrolimus as the ongoing maintenance immunosuppression.
Subjects will undergo BMT utilizing CD3+/CD19+-depleted bone marrow with bone marrow conditioning beginning no less than 8 weeks after lung transplantation. Bone marrow will be recovered alongside solid organs and will be processed and cryopreserved.</description>
