  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Eye drop medications
      reduce vision loss from glaucoma by at least 60%, but eye drops must be taken every day to be
      effective. However, adherence to eye drop treatment is poor with only 50% of patients
      regularly taking their prescribed eye drops. We are developing the Devers Drop Device (D3)
      eye drop monitor to accurately measure eye drop cap removal and to improve eye drop-taking
      behavior. We will test eye drop adherence with the D3 device in a randomized, prospective
      clinical trial.

      Universal Adherence is an emerging medical device company dedicated to improving adherence to
      ocular medications through innovative technical solutions. Our Devers Drop Device (D3) will
      accurately track when a patient removes an eye drop bottle cap, communicate usage data
      wirelessly to a database that researchers can access, and send alerts to patients when a
      medication is due. In addition to helping patients maintain their dosing schedule, the D3
      will also provide adherence information to researchers and eye care providers, which will
      help to understand poor treatment outcomes and to develop improved treatment strategies.The
      clinical benefits of our device in improving adherence will initially be assessed and
      targeted towards glaucoma, but the ability of the device to be attached to all FDA-approved
      eye drop bottle caps will make this device attractive to all patients that need consistent
      daily use of eye drops.

      Randomized, prospective clinical trial: We will enroll 50 participants (25 male, 25 female)
      into a prospective trial with duration of up to 50 days. The inclusion criteria are those who
      are prescribed latanoprost eye drop to be used once per day at bedtime, and own a functioning
      Apple iphone smartphone (iOs) with Bluetooth and cellular connectivity. We will exclude
      patients who currently use smartphone medication reminders and those with severe cognitive
      impairment limiting their ability to understand a questionnaire. The 50-day period is useful
      for glaucoma studies because patients revert to their normal dosing pattern within two weeks
      after their last visit. This study will include two stages: Stage 1) a 25-day period
      evaluating baseline patient adherence with the D3 device; and Stage 2) a subsequent 25-day
      period to determine the effect of no reminder, a daily reminder only using their smart phone
      calendar app, and a daily reminder using the D3 app, which includes integrated audio and
      visual reminders.
