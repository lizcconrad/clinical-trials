  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine sarcomas are rare tumors with a poor prognosis.

      The main purpose of this phase II proof-of-principle- pilot study is to test the efficacy of
      the hydroxamic acid-based Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) Vorinostat (SAHA) as
      monotherapy in patients with HDAC-positive, progressive, metastatic uterine sarcomas and
      mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumors after prior anti-proliferative therapy.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, proof of concept-study of the HDAC-inhibitor vorinostat in
      patients with refractory uterine sarcoma that have been pre-tested for an high expression of
      HDAC. Patients will receive Vorinostat, 400 mg (4 capsules รก 100mg of Zolinza) orally once
      daily for the first 14 days of a 21 day cycle. Treatment will be continued for 4 cycles
      (treatment period 1). Patients with a response or stable disease after 4 cycles as determined
      by computed tomography (CT) of target an non target-lesions will be continued on vorinostat
      therapy at the tolerated schedule and dosage until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity
      or patients' withdrawal of the consent. At the maximum, a total of 12 cycles will be
      administered over a 9 months period (treatment periods 2 and 3).
