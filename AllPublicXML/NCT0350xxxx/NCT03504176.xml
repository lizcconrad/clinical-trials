  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality rates in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) are
      higher in Asia compared to other regions. In adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome,
      the only therapy that improves mortality rates is a lung protective ventilation strategy. The
      pediatric ventilation recommendations by the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference
      (PALICC) are extrapolated from evidence in adults, including ventilation with low tidal
      volume, low peak/plateau pressures and high end expiratory pressure. A recent retrospective
      study of ventilation practices in Asia including Singapore showed that a majority of patients
      with PARDS were being ventilated with high tidal volume, high peak pressure and low end
      expiratory pressure, not in compliance with PALICC recommendations. We postulate that
      currently used ventilation strategies could have contributed to the high PARDS mortality
      rates in Asia. We aim to determine if implementing a ventilation bundle comprising PALICC
      recommendations lowers PARDS and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) mortality rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We implement a PARDS ventilation bundle compliant with PALICC recommendations. The bundle
      contains a daily checklist for ventilation targets and reference tables listing targeted
      tidal volumes and end expiratory pressure-fraction of inspired oxygen titration. We will
      recruit mechanically ventilated patients who meet PARDS criteria. After a one-month
      implementation period, we will collect patient data over the subsequent 18 months, and
      compare them with the corresponding data in the 18 months prior to the implementation. The
      primary outcome is PARDS mortality, defined as number of deaths out of PARDS cases. Secondary
      outcomes are feasibility of ventilation bundle implementation, ventilator (VFD) and intensive
      care unit (IFD) free days and PICU mortality (number of deaths out of PICU admissions).
