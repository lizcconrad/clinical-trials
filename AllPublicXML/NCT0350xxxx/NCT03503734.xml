    <textblock>
      Chronic headache is among the most common neurological disorders with major physical,
      psychological, social and economic impact. The aim of this prospective observational study
      isto investigate the effects of an interdisciplinary multimodal integrated care program in
      patients with chronic migraine and/or tension-type headache.

      158 patients with chronic migraine or tensions-type headache at least five days per month for
      at least 6 months and current intake of triptans (migraine) or analgesic drugs (tension-type
      headache) are eligible. Patients undergo inpatient, outpatient and/or semi-stationary
      treatment including conventional headache diagnostics and therapy as well as traditional
      Chinese medicine, European naturopathy, and mind-body-medicine approaches. Headache frequency
      is defined as the primary outcome; secondary outcomes include pain (visual analog scale, Pain
      Perception Scale), triptans and analgesics use (headache diary), health-related quality of
      life (SF-36), function (Headache Disability Inventory, Patient-specific Functional Scale),
      depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and pain self-efficacy (Pain
      Self-Efficacy Questionnaire). Outcomes are assessed at treatment start, treatment end and 6
      months after treatment end.

    <description>The treatment can be realized on an inpatient, outpatient and/or day care basis, according to the severity level of illness and comorbidities.
The inpatient treatment takes place at the Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine. The stay is slated for 14 days.
Day care can follow the inpatient stay or can be applied as sole therapy. As part of the standard care provided at the Department for Internal and Integrative Medicine, it occurs at a semi-residential clinic for 6 hours once a week over a total of 10 weeks.
The outpatient treatment is delivered in the Department's outpatient ward. It consists of acupuncture, cupping, hydrotherapy and massages as well as nutritional counseling. The patients can additionally be offered one-to-one mind-body-medicine interventions.</description>

        Patients insured with Barmer GEK or Techniker Krankenkasse, large German statutory health
        insurances, and diagnosed with migraine and/or tension-type headaches were eligible for
        integrated care. All patients, who were over 18 years old with headache at least five days
        per month for at least 6 months and current intake of a) at least 10 triptans per month or
        b) analgesic drugs that can themselves elicit headache were suited to be involved in the
        observational study. Patients were referred by specialists or general practitioners to the
        Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine.
