  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to test the primary hypothesis that the addition of
      intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnant women (ISTp) who receive routine
      antenatal care (ANC) in health facilities in high malaria transmission areas in Rwanda will
      reduce malaria prevalence among pregnant women when compared to routine antenatal cares
      services alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More specifically, the primary objective is to understand the effect of ISTp in a context
      where routine antenatal care does not include malaria chemoprohylaxis and whether this
      intervention is protective against malaria during pregnancy. The secondary objective is to
      determine whether this intervention results in an improvement in other key maternal and
      newborn health outcomes including maternal anemia, low birth weight and prematurity. The
      third objective is to determine the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of ISTp
      among women who receive ISTp and among health workers who deliver this intervention.

      This study will establish if testing and treating pregnant women is effective, feasible and
      whether it adds an additional burden to the work already being undertaken by facility-based
      health workers who provide antenatal care services. It is expected that the study will result
      in information to develop appropriate approaches that can be implemented in Rwanda in the
      prevention of malaria in pregnancy in addition to the use of preventive measures such as
      insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and case management. This information may
      potentially also be used by other countries with similar patterns of malaria transmission.

    <description>Women presenting for their first ANC visit to facilities will be consecutively enrolled after providing informed consent. Women in the intervention group (IST+ routine care) will be tested for malaria at the health center during their ANC visits with an RDT. If positive, they will be treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in second or third trimester or quinine in the first trimester.</description>
