  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the hypothesis that thrombectomy devices plus medical management
      leads to superior clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients at 90 days as compared
      to medical management alone in appropriately selected subjects with the Target Mismatch
      Profile and an MCA (M1 and M2 segment) or ICA occlusion or BA who have endovascular
      thrombectomy initiated between 6-24 hours after last seen well.

      Study design is a prospective, single-center study of acute ischemic stroke patients with
      large artery occlusion in 6-24 hours of stroke onset. According to patients or their family
      members' willing, patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to endovascular
      thrombectomy group with approved devices (only the devices listed in this protocol are
      approved for us) plus standard medical therapy or control group (standard medical therapy
      alone) after undergoing either CT Perfusion or MR Perfusion studies. Patients who have
      evidence of an ICA or MCA M1 or M2 or BA occlusion and a Target Mismatch Profile will be
      enrolled.

      The intent of this study is to support thrombectomy beyond the currently labeled 8 hour
      indicated time limit in wake up, unclear onset, and late presenting ischemic stroke subjects,
      who currently have no other option besides medical management of their symptoms, with careful
      selection.

      The study will enroll up to 55 patients. The primary endpoint, the modified Rankin Score,
      will be assessed at 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Clinical Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical signs and symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke

          2. Age ≥18 years

          3. NIHSS ≥ 6

          4. Endovascular thrombectomy can be initiated (femoral puncture) between 6 and 24 hours
             after time last know well

          5. No significant pre-stroke disability (pre-stroke mRS must be ≤ 3 )

          6. Patient/Legally Authorized Representative has signed the Informed Consent form

        Imaging Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ICA or MCA-M1 or MCA-M2 or BA occlusion (carotid occlusions can be cervical or
             intracranial with or without tandem MCA lesions) as evidenced by MRA or 4D-CTA

          2. Target Mismatch Profile on CT perfusion or MR perfusion: ischemic core volume is ≤ 70
             ml, mismatch ratio is &gt;/= 1.2 )

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Clinical Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other serious, advanced, or terminal illness (investigator judgment) or life
             expectancy is less than 90 days

          2. Subject with a co-morbid disease or condition that would confound the neurological and
             functional evaluations or compromise survival or ability to complete follow-up
             assessments

          3. Unable to undergo a contrast brain perfusion scan with either MRI or CT

          4. Pregnant

             recent oral anticoagulant therapy with INR &gt; 3 (recent use of one of the new oral
             anticoagulants is not an exclusion if estimated GFR &gt; 30 ml/min).

          8. Seizures at stroke onset if it precludes obtaining an accurate baseline NIHSS

          9. Current participation in another investigational drug or device treatment study

         11. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes an
             endovascular procedure or poses a significant hazard to the subject if an endovascular
             procedure was performed.

             criteria)

             hemorrhage, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or arteriovenous malformation

          4. Evidence of internal carotid artery dissection

          5. Intracranial stent implanted in the same vascular territory, known history of arterial
             tortuosity, and/or other arterial disease that precludes the safe deployment/removal
