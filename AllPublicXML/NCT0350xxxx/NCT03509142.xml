    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot clinical trial for Sirolimus-eluting Iron Bioresorbable Coronary
      Scaffold System（IBS）. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility,
      preliminary safety and efficacy of IBS. To provide the basis for subsequent large-scale,
      multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trials of IBS.

    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, First-in-Man trial;

      Study population: 45 subjects. The 45 subjects will be randomly assigned into two queues:
      queue 1(n=30), queue 2(n=15)

      The clinical follow up will be performed in all subjects at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2
      years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years post procedure;

      The Angiographic, Intra-Vascular Ultrasound (IVUS) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
      will be performed at 6 months and 2 years post procedure in queue 1. The Angiographic, IVUS
      and OCT will be performed at 1 year and 3 years post procedure in queue 2.

      The primary study endpoint is target lesion failure (TLF) at 1 month post procedure, and
      imaging outcomes as the secondary study endpoint, to evaluate the feasibility, preliminary
      safety and efficacy of IBS.
