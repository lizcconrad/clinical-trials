      The aim of the work is to provide a validated Arabic version of EuroQol 5D-5L ,so that it
      would be used as a quality of life assessment tool for Egyptian patients

      Specific objectives:

        1. Cross cultural adaptation of the translated Arabic version of EuroQol 5D-5L.

        2. Assessment of the reliability of the translated Arabic version of EuroQol 5D-5L.

        3. Testing the validity of the translated version of EuroQol 5D-5L.

      Chronic back pain is one of the most important disabling illnesses. It has a high incidence,
      high prevalence and high cost to society. One of the most common causes of back pain are
      degenerative spine diseases which aﬀect all aspects of quality of life (QoL) of the patients.
      They could aﬀect job opportunities, social activities and hinder the patients from performing
      common daily activities.It was found that many factors could affect quality of life of spine
      degenerative diseases patients such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), employment status ,
      living with other family members, smoking, orthopedic disorder in another part of the body
      (other than spinal disease), history of spinal surgery, and bladder function. Comprehensive
      assessment of these patients should include health related quality of life (HRQoL) measures
      in addition to the objective clinical measures of the diseases. Europeans Quality of life
      questionnaire 5 dimensions ,5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized measure of health status
      developed by the EuroQol Group which provides a simple, generic measure of health for
      clinical and economic appraisal (2).Despite being translated and validated in many languages,
      there is no validated Arabic version of EQ-5D-5L to measure the quality of life. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Arabic version of
      the questionnaire for Egyptian patients diagnosed to have Spine degenerative diseases.
