  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot study using (1) MRI to assess coronary artery endothelial
      function, (2) brachial ultrasound to assess systemic endothelial function, (3) serum markers
      of inflammation and of endothelial cell function and (4) echocardiographic measures of left
      ventricular diastolic and systolic properties, before and following initiation of PCSK9
      antibody in HIV positive subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab on coronary and systemic endothelial
      function, systemic biomarkers of endothelial function and of inflammation, and
      echocardiographic measures of left ventricular diastolic and systolic properties in subjects
      who are HIV+. Potential participants will be asked to undergo a screening MRI exam. Those who
      have evidence of coronary endothelial dysfunction on the MRI exam will receive evolocumab 420
      mg sq (the dose that is approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia) following the
      screening exam and again at one month. Repeat MRI and ultrasound measures of coronary and
      systemic endothelial function, as well as serum markers of endothelial function and
      inflammation, and echocardiographic measures of diastolic and systolic left ventricular
      function will be obtained at one and six weeks following the first administration of
      evolocumab.

      The investigators will test the hypotheses that PCSK9 inhibition improves endothelial
      function measured non-invasively on MRI and systemic markers of inflammation at one week (+/-
      3 days) and six weeks after initiation of the PCSK9 antibody.
