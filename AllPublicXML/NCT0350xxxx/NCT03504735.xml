    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Caduet in addition to therapeutic life-style change (TLC)
      intervention in resolving metabolic syndrome fifty three individuals were randomized to TLC
      intervention study with or without Caduet therapy for 12 months. The participants underwent
      monthly visits with investigators to obtain vital signs, and to undergo TLC counseling.
      Metabolic parameters were measured before and after intervention.

  <detailed_description>

      Single center, investigator driven, double blinded, randomized with Caduet 5/10mg vs placebo.
      The participants visited with investigators on a monthly bases to evaluate the BP, weight,
      and obtain the waist measurements, and counseling. OGTT was performed at the beginning and
      the end of the study. Lipid and glucose parameters were measured 5 times in duration of the
      study period.

      Exercise physiologists and dietitians completed the baseline evaluations and provided
      recommendations throughout the study period in person, via phone or e-mail: per subject
      preference. VO2 max was measured at the beginning and end of the study. Pedometers dispensed
      to encourage physical activity.
