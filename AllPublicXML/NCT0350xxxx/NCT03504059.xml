  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and objective:

      There is an alarming increase in obesity and unhealthy lifestyles in adolescents. This issue
      threatens to have a highly negative health and socioeconomic impact in the near future. The
      only way to tackle this epidemic is to implement effective preventive strategies able to
      positively impact on youth lifestyle behaviours. The school is the most appropriate
      environment for such an intervention. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of a comprehensive educational school-based intervention in adolescents on
      cardiovascular health, including obesity/adiposity and metabolic profiles. The project
      consortium constitutes a unique framework of research groups at the forefront of novel and
      successful approaches aiming to healthier behaviours and dietary habits.

      Methodology:

      A cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 24 secondary schools in Spain will be carried
      out. Schools will be 1:1:1 randomized to receive a short-term (2-year) or a long-term
      (4-year) comprehensive educational program, or to receive the usual curriculum (control).
      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, and after 2 and 4 years with the following:
      weight scale, circumference measuring tape, bioelectrical impedance, dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry, sphygmomanometer, blood analysis, saliva and urine analysis, accelerometers,
      and questionnaires. The primary outcome is the change in obesity and other health parameters
      from baseline to year 2 and 4, as assessed by the Ideal Cardiovascular Health score.
      Secondary outcomes include the change in adiposity, anthropometry and body composition
      parameters, physical activity and dietary habits, polyphenol and carotenoid intake,
      metabolomics and attitudes. Participants will be measured again when they reach 20 years old.

      Expected results:

      The investigators expects to show that a school-based educational intervention induces
      favourable lifestyle changes and improves cardiovascular health among Spanish adolescents,
      including obesity/adiposity and metabolic profiles. If successful, this strategy could be
      widely adopted having a meaningful effect on obesity and cardiovascular health promotion.
      Additionally, associations of health parameters with bioactive dietary compounds intake and
      metabolic profiles will be stablished.

    <description>Change in obesity and other health parameters from baseline to year 2 and 4, as assessed by the Ideal Cardiovascular Health (ICH) score, as recommended by the American Heart Association (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2010). The ICH score measures cardiovascular health and includes 7 components:
- Behaviors factors:
No smoking
Being physically active
Good nutritional habits
Normal weight
- Health factors:
Normal blood pressure
Normal cholesterol level
Normal glucose levels To meet the complete definition of ideal cardiovascular health, an individual would need to meet the ideal levels of all 7 components.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the association between changes in adiposity parameters and food and nutrient intake. To assess changes in diet and adherence to the Mediterranean diet will use a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (Tresserra-Rimbau et al., 2013).
