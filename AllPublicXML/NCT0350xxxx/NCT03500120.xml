      The present study was undertaken prospectively to compare the diagnostic significance of the
      SSST with the CCT in hypertensive patients with suspected PA using the FST as the reference
      standard, and to investigate the optimal cutoff of SSST for differentiating PA from other
      forms of hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA) typically requires at least one confirmatory
      test. Four tests are commonly recommended by the Endocrine Society guideline, namely, oral
      sodium loading, saline infusion, fludrocortisones administration with oral sodium loading,
      and captopril challenge testing (CCT). Of these, fludrocortisone suppression testing (FST)
      has been considered the most reliable, but is cumbersome, difficult to perform, and
      relatively expensive, requiring hospital admission for several days. Alternative approaches
      to FST have included saline suppression testing (SST), Which requiring patients staying in
      the recumbent position for at least 1 h before and during the infusion of 2 L of 0.9% saline
      IV over 4 h. This approach also has the disadvantages of brings much inconvenience to the
      patient (such as urine and cacation, etc.). Ashraf H. et al. have repored that seated SST
      (SSST) is more sensitive than recumbent SST (RSST), especially for posture-responsive PA
      (95.8% VS 33.3%), however, in this small scale study, only 31 patients was PA and only three
      patients was tested negative for PA by FST. Specificity of each form of SST was unable to
      estimate and meaningful ROC analyses could not be performed. Furthermore, it is lack of study
      in Chinese people. In addition, we have previously found the CCT was as accurate as the FST
      and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) post-CCT is the best approach to interpret the
      results of the CCT. The present study was undertaken prospectively to compare the diagnostic
      significance of the SSST with the CCT in hypertensive patients with suspected PA using the
      FST as the reference standard, and to investigate the optimal cutoff of SSST for
      differentiating PA from other forms of hypertension.

        1. For the screening test and the confirmatory tests, antihypertensive medication was
             withheld or changed according to the guideline. Samples for plasma renin concentration
             (PRC) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were collected in the morning after
             the subjects were out of bed for at least two hours. ARR was calculated.

          2. Patients who tested positive or who tested negative but PA was strongly suspected
             proceeded to the three confirmatory tests (SSST, CCT, FST, respectively), which were
             performed on three separate days. For the SSST, patients remainde in a seated position
             for at least 30 min and during the infusion

          3. For the remaining patients who tested negative (ARR&lt;2ng.dl-1/mIU.l-1) or/and PAC
             post-FST&lt;8ng/dl, were assigned to the control group.
