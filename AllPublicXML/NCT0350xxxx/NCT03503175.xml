  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystoscopy is a commonly performed procedure after gynecologic surgery, however, its use may
      increase patients' risk for acquiring urinary tract infections due to urinary tract
      instrumentation entry and reentry of the lower urinary tract with the cystoscope and foley
      catheter. Use of a novel multi-channel transurethral bladder catheter that allows for
      cystoscopy through a specialized port will permit cystoscopy to be performed without catheter
      removal. This may allow for intraoperative detection of urinary tract injuries with a
      reduction in both urethral manipulation and hospital-associated urinary tract infections.
      Other potential benefits may include a shorter procedure time and ease of use for providers.

    <textblock>
      A cystoscopy is a procedure that inserts a thin tube with a light and camera through the
      urethra, so that the inside of the bladder can be checked for injuries. Current guidelines
      recommend that this is done after a hysterectomy. Normally, doing a cystoscopy requires that
      a patient's foley catheter (a tube inserted through the urethra and into the bladder to drain
      urine) gets removed and then replaced. This can potentially lead to a urinary tract infection
      (UTI).

      CystoSureTM is a silicone device that was developed by surgeons to enable easy and
      standardized cystoscopy. The design of the CystoSureTM catheter has separate channels for
      draining the bladder and performing cystoscopy, so doctors can perform a cystoscopy without
      removing the catheter (which can, as described above, potentially lead to a UTI). In this
      study, investigators want to examine whether using a CystoSureTM catheter instead of a
      standard foley catheter could therefore lead to a reduced number of UTIs in hysterectomy
      patients. CystoSureTM is cleared by the FDA.
