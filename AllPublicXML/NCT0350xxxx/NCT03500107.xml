  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is a infectious process of the female genitourinary tract, an
      important health issue due to the high incidence and high rate of recurrence of the
      infection. Therefore, new therapeutic modalities are sought with the capacity to minimize
      drug side effects and reduce cases of recurrence of the disease. The objective of this study
      is to evaluate the clinical and microbiological responde of the 401+/- 5nm blue light
      emitting diode (LED) in the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis. The group of women
      with diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis will be submitted to the light therapy. These women
      will also be submitted to an evaluation and examination by a ginecologist before and after
      the therapy. There will also be an evaluation of the clinical condition and about the effects
      of the light through the questionnaire answered before and after participant's treatment.
      It's expected that the 41 +/- 5nm LED will destroy the VB demonstrated by laboratory
      examination and also improves the signs and results analyzed by the gynecologist and
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A current treatment proposal is the use of blue LED of 401 +/- 5 nm wich is a light that has
      antimicrobial effect when exposed to endogenous porphyrin of the pathogens. This exposition
      produces reactive oxigen and it causes cells death with no possibilities of resistance by the
      bacterium.

    <description>The Blue LED 401 +/- 5 nm will be applied in the participant, in a closed room by a physiotherapist for 1 hour. The apparatus will be supported on a tripod, statically, externally, 5 cm away from the vulva abd vaginal region, with the patient naked, in gynecological stretcher and lithotomy position. The protocol consists of only one session. This part of the study will see if there is bactericidal effect of the blue LED.</description>
