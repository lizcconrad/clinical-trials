  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a large and comprehensively phenotyped cohort with fasting glycaemia where the
      predictive value of body composition and anthropometric measures of total and central fat
      distribution for postprandial carbohydrate intolerance are studied.

      Subjects aged 18-70 years, who attended the Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition of the
      Clínica Universidad de Navarra from 2009-2014 for a check-up were offered to participate in
      the DICAMANO study. 853 subjects agreed to take part. Only those individuals with a normal
      fasting glucose level (≤5.5 mmol l-1) were analysed. Subjects with T2DM or severe renal,
      liver or thyroid dysfunction were excluded. Participants were instructed to temporarily
      discontinue for 48 hours any medication known to affect glucose or lipid metabolism. On the
      day of the study visit, each subject had a complete routine clinical assessment to evaluate
      the presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, renal or endocrine disorders. All patients
      underwent a 75-g OGTT with a concomitant anthropometric study, blood pressure monitoring and
      lipid profile analyses. They were classified by glucose tolerance on the basis of blood
      glucose levels according to ADA diagnostic criteria for T2DM (2017). Carbohydrate intolerance
      was defined as a 2-hOGTT glucose level ≥7.8 mmol l-1 (mg dl-1). Body composition, visceral
      adipose tissue, anthropometry study, OGTT-based parameters and cardiovascular risk factors
      are measured.

    <description>Investigate whether body fat percentage estimated by air-displacement plethysmography (Bod-Pod®, Life Measurements, Concord, CA, USA) predicts postprandial carbohydrate intolerance early on in the metabolic dysregulation process.
Body fat percentage (BF%) is calculated from body density by means of the Siri equation.</description>

    <description>Examine the predictive value of waist-to-hip ratio as screening tool for the selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Waist-to-hip ratio was calculated as waist circumference divided by hip circumference. Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the iliac crest and the rib cage on the mid-axillary line, and hip circumference at the level of the greater trochanters was measured to the nearest millimetre using a flexible tape.</description>
