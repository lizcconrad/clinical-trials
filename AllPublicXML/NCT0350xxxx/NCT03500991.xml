  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of central nervous system (CNS) locoregional adoptive therapy with
      autologous CD4 and CD8 T cells lentivirally transduced to express a HER2-specific chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) and EGFRt, delivered by an indwelling catheter in the tumor resection
      cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with recurrent or refractory
      HER2-positive CNS tumors. A child or young adult with a refractory or recurrent CNS tumor
      will have their tumor tested for HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) at their home
      institution or at Seattle Children's Hospital. If the tumor is HER2 positive and the patient
      meets all other eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor
      resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meets none of the exclusion criteria,
      then they can be apheresed, meaning T cells will be collected. The T cells will then be
      bioengineered into a third-generation CAR T cell that targets HER2-expressing tumor cells.
      The patient's newly engineered T cells will then be administered via the indwelling CNS
      catheter for two courses. In the first course they will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells
      for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of
      weekly doses for three weeks. Following the two courses, patient's will undergo a series of
      studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity
      to continue receiving up to a total of six courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had
      adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.

      The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of HER2-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to
      complete two courses of treatment with three doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one
      week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that HER-specific CAR T cells safely can be
      administered through an indwelling CNS catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact
      with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study safely can be delivered directly
      into the brain via indwelling catheter. Secondary aims of the study will include to evaluate
      CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells
      egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples
      from multiple time points are available, also evaluate the degree of HER2 expression at
      diagnosis versus at recurrence.
