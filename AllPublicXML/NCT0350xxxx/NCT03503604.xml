  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hPV19 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF). hPV19 binds to human VEGF with unique binding site on VEGF different from that of
      Bevacizumab(Avastin) and inhibits the binding of VEGF to it's receptors, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2.
      By preventing VEGF binding to its receptors, growth of tumor blood vessels are inhibited and
      tumor growth prevented or slowed. In this study we are investigating the tolerability,
      safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of hPV19 in combination with chemotherapy in
      patients with solid tumors. hPV19 will give to patients by intravenous(i.v.) infusion with a
      single and multiple doses.

    <measure>Best Overall Response [Anti-Tumor Activity of hPV19 Plus Chemotherapy]</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to six months after 1st treatment or until progression of disease (PD)</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria.
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Progressive Disease (PD): an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition, the sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (the appearance of 1 or more new lesions was considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.</description>
