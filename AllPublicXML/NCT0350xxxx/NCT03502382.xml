    <textblock>
      To What degree total knee replacement (TKA) affects leg length discrepancy in patients with
      varus deformity? Varus deformity, the most commonly encountered deformity in patients
      undergoing TKA is associated with limb alignment and varying degrees of contractures of
      medial soft tissue structures, laxity of the lateral soft tissue structures, flexion
      deformity and medial bone erosion at the knee joint .The challenges in performing TKA in a
      varus arthritic knee include restoration of limb alignment, balancing the medial and lateral
      soft tissue tension, equalizing flexion and extension gaps and restoring medial bone loss

      Limb length discrepancy (LLD)less than 2cm is usually not noticeable and does not require
      treatment. LLD over 2cm is usually noticed by the individual affected leading to self
      compensation by walking on the ball of the foot (toe down) or by tilting the pelvis and
      curving the spine.Untreated LLD can lead to lower back pain and long leg arthritis of the hip
      LLD and its effects on patient function have been discussed in depth in the literature with
      respect to hip arthroplasty but there are few studies that have examined the effect on
      function of limb length discrepancy following TKA.

      Improved surgical techniques and rehabilitation protocols have resulted in excellent knee
      function and range of motion following TKA.

      The investigators are aiming from the study to improve functional outcome in patients with
      knee osteoarthritis undergoing TKA.
