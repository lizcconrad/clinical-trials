  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence indicates that electrical spinal cord stimulation improves motor functions
      both immediately and over the long term via modulating the excitability of spinal circuitry
      in patients with spinal cord injury. Recently, a novel, non-invasive, well-tolerated and
      painless lumbosacral transcutaneous electrical stimulation strategy was demonstrated to be
      effective for improving lower limb motor function in participants with spinal cord injury.
      Our current project, cervical transcutaneous electrical stimulation and intensive exercise
      for arms and hands, is also revealing significant improvement of upper extremity function.
      Additionally, the subject and caregiver noted that stair climbing ability has been
      substantially enhanced starting from the first week of cervical stimulation treatment and
      continues to date.

      This study is a prospective efficacy trial of combined transcutaneous cervical and
      lumbosacral electrical stimulation with intensive physical therapy for improving locomotion
      in people with incomplete tetraplegia and paraplegia.

      This experiment design consists of two to four phase intervention program including one-month
      physical therapy (PT) only (A) followed by one-month spinal stimulation with PT (B). Between
      each intervention, washout periods of up to one-month may be used to determine any
      after-effect of the interventions. The AB or BA interventions will be repeated if the
      functional improvement does not reach a plateau during the first two month of interventions.
      Sessions will last up to 2 hours/day, 2 to 5 days/week for each arm. Both immediate and
      lasting improvements in lower extremity function and autonomic function via transcutaneous
      spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy will be evaluated.

    <description>Neuromuscular recovery scale is an assessment for sitting, standing and walking functions based on a comparison to pre-injury performance criteria or how a task was performed one day prior to spinal cord injury and without use of compensation strategies. The items consists of stand retraining, stand adaptability, step retraining, step adaptability, sit, reverse sit up, trunk extension in sitting, sit to stand , stand, walking, and upper limb functions. They are score the scale of 4 based on how close to the function in the pre-injured condition.</description>
