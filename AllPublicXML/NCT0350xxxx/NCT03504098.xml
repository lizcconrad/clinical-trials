  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than two-thirds of lung cancer, which is
      the leading cause of cancer deaths in Taiwan. The overall prognosis of NSCLC is poor with low
      5-year survival rates. Recent advances suggest that malignancy NSCLC cancers are the cancer
      stem cell (CSC) diseases. The stemness potentials of CSC with epithelial-mesenchymal
      transdifferentiation ensure their invasion and disseminate to metastsis organs. The
      self-renewal property of CSC mediates intrinsic drug resistance to cytotoxicity therapy and
      promoted aggressive relapse tumour. Metabolic reprogramming on bioenergetics of malignant
      cancer cells has been proposed as the key mediator in the stemness CSC development.
      Malignancy cells uptake glucose for fermented glycolysis to produce lactate which release
      resulted in acidified microenvironment to trigger the mTOR and sonic hedgehog metabolic
      stress signaling in supporting CSC stemness potentials. The metabostemness of cancer cells is
      the new-dimensional hallmark of malignancy tumour, which may serve as the diagnostic markers
      for the early detection of malignancy cancers. Folate-mediated one carbon metabolism
      coordinates glucose into amino acid metabolism to tailor the fuel metabolites in supporting
      macromolecule synthesis and to sustain the bioenergetics requirement. Acting as the metabolic
      stressor, low folate intake is associated with increased risks of lung cancers. Folate and
      one-carbon nutrient status of NSCLC patients in Taiwan, however, has not been assessed. The
      role of low folate metabolic stress (LFMS) in metabostemness marker and metastasis potentials
      of malignancy NSCLC is unexplored. The causal effect and the working mechanisms by which LFMS
      promoted NSCLC malignancy remain elusive.
