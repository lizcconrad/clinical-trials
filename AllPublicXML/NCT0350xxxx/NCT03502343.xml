      Recently, a retrospective study reported the efficacy and safety of modified gemcitabine plus
      nab-paclitaxel (GnP), which were administered biweekly (on days 1 and 15). With 79 patients
      of metastatic pancreatic cancer, this study reported similar efficacy and improved toxicity
      profile compared with standard dose GnP (OS 10 months, PFS 5.4 months, Grade ≥3 Neutropenia
      19%, Grade ≥3 sensory neuropathy 1.6%). Also, several studies reported that dose reduction of
      nab-paclitaxel in breast or pancreatic cancer treatment was not related of decreased
      survival, or related with prolonged survival and increased treatment exposure. However, this
      finding need to be evaluated in prospective clinical trial.

      This phase II trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified GnP, which omit the day
      8 administration of nab-paclitaxel, in metastatic pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine-based combination therapy have been used to prolong survival for patient with
      pancreatic cancer. In early 2010s, gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) combination regimen
      have been introduced based on the results of randomized phase III clinical trial that showed
      survival benefit than gemcitabine monotherapy. Nab-paclitaxel is a nanoparticle albumin-bound
      paclitaxel that showed anti-tumor activity as well as synergistic effect in combination with
      gemcitabine.

      In the Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial (MPACT), the maximal tolerated
      nab-paclitaxel dose (125 mg/m2) was administrated with 1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine, on days 1,
      8 and 15 for 4 weeks cycle. This combination therapy showed favorable treatment response, but
      notable severe adverse events were also reported. Grade 3 or higher neuropathy and
      neutropenia occurred in 17% and 38% of patients, respectively. Also, dose reduction was
      required in approximately half of the patients.

      Recently, a retrospective study reported the efficacy and safety of modified GnP, which were
      administered biweekly (on days 1 and 15). With 79 patients of metastatic pancreatic cancer,
      this study reported similar efficacy and improved toxicity profile compared with standard
      dose GnP (OS 10 months, PFS 5.4 months, Grade ≥3 Neutropenia 19%, Grade ≥3 sensory neuropathy
      1.6%). Also, several studies reported that dose reduction of nab-paclitaxel in breast or
      pancreatic cancer treatment was not related of decreased survival, or related with prolonged
      survival and increased treatment exposure. However, this finding need to be evaluated in
      prospective clinical trial.

      This phase II trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified GnP, which omit the day
      8 administration of nab-paclitaxel, in metastatic pancreatic cancer.

    <description>To evaluate treatment efficacy, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDGPET) scan will be performed every 8 weeks. Treatment responses according to the RECIST criteria will be reported by designated radiologists and final disease assessment will be independently made by the attending physician. The proportion of patients with the best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) is defined as objective response rate.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive slow (over 30-40 minutes) intravenous administration of nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) on days 1 and 15, and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28- day cycle (every 4 weeks). Treatment will discontinue if disease progression or intolerable toxicity is observed, if the patient withdraws from the study, or at the physician's discretion.
Dose reduction of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or delay of administration is allowed if serious treatment-related AEs occur, according to specified guideline in study protocol (Level 1: 100% -&gt; 80%; Level 2: 80% -&gt; 60%). If dose reduction is needed more than Level 2, the patient will be dropped from the trial.</description>
