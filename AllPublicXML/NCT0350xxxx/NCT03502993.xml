  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood fever is a prevalent problem. Most febrile children who visit hospital improve
      without treatment, but a minority require treatment, and a few will have severe disease. The
      investigators want to improve the diagnosis and management of febrile children by developing
      tests to distinguish between bacterial and viral disease so that antibiotic treatment can be
      initiated promptly and only when required. Judicious and prudent use of antibiotics will
      reduce the likelihood of developing resistant organisms and save treatment costs.

      There are two parts to recruitment in this study; the first is to assess the management and
      outcome of febrile children who seek medical treatment in hospital (MOFICHE study). The data
      will be used to model management strategies for febrile children and enable a
      cost-effectiveness analysis.

      Secondly the investigators will prospectively recruit acutely febrile children presenting to
      hospital, collecting research samples for validation of biomarkers, in combination with
      clinical phenotypic markers and host genetic markers (BIVA-studies).

      Any febrile child newborn to under 18 presenting to hospital will be eligible for
      recruitment. The study will last 5 years.

  <detailed_description>

      The problem to be addressed:

      Fever is among the commonest symptoms for which parents consult health care providers
      worldwide. Distinction between life-threatening bacterial infection and viral infection is
      clinically difficult, and many children worldwide receive unnecessary antibiotic treatment,
      or undergo invasive investigations and hospitalization, whilst bacterial infection is missed
      in others.

      Objective:

      The investigators aim to validate biomarkers that will identify children with bacterial
      infection, viral infection and inflammatory syndromes, using whole-blood RNA expression,
      proteomic and metabolomics signatures. The investigators aim to assess how efficacious these
      biomarkers would be if they formed the basis of a diagnostic test.

      Design:

      The investigators will use established case-control groups of febrile children presenting to
      hospital, recruited across Europe as part of previous (and current) ethically-approved
      studies, to discover signatures of febrile illness. The investigators will validate these
      signatures in samples prospectively collected from children as part of this observational
      study.

      There are two components to the study design;

        1. MOFICHE study:

           Observe the management and outcome of children presenting to Emergency Departments (ED)
           with fever across Europe (MOFICHE study.

           STUDY SIZE: at least 50,000 febrile children

           PROCEDURES:

           Data of all febrile children will be flagged at triage and a standardised dataset will
           be collected.

        2. Biomarker Validation (BIVA studies):

      Validate biomarkers using prospectively recruited patients and patient samples (Biomarker
      Validation studies (BIVA))

      The investigators will use prospective, observational BIVA studies to recruit febrile
      children with infectious and inflammatory diseases in order to validate diagnostic
      biomarkers. The investigators will also recruit non-febrile controls in order to discover and
      validate disease-specific biomarkers and to understand their biological significance.

      STUDY SIZE at least 4000 febrile children;

      PROCEDURES;

      Informed consent using age appropriate patient/parent/guardian information sheets will be
      taken from parents (or from children aged 16 and over), assent will be taken from the child
      under the age of 16 (if appropriate).

      Routine clinical and laboratory data and research samples from three timepoints
      (presentation, 48 hours after presentation, 28 days after admission). If patients present to
      hospital with fever on subsequent occasions, clinical data will be recorded and further
      research samples will be taken at those times.

      Samples; Blood, urine, stool (in the case of gastroenteritis), nasopharyngeal/throat swab

      CONTROLS:

      The investigators will collect samples from age-matched control patients will not have had a
      febrile illness, major trauma or vaccination within the previous three weeks and who are
      having routine blood sampling for reasons other than investigation of infectious or
      inflammatory disease.

      Control children may include critically ill children without infection or those with
      healthcare associated infections).

    <description>This is an observational study assessing the management and outcome of children presenting to Emergency Departments (ED) with fever across Europe. This study will use large departmental datasets to collect information on at least 50,000 febrile episodes . This study will use large-scale, pseudo-anonymized departmental data, and will not involve consented patient recruitment; nor will it use patient samples. Data included in MOFICHE will be based on that collected as part of routine clinical care. Antibiotic prescription, hospitalisation and number/type of investigations, re-attendance at ED within 5 days of the first hospital presentation will be recorded.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>BIVA studies</arm_group_label>
    <description>A minimum of 3,000 children will be recruited to the BIVA-ED study, in order to capture sufficient children with confirmed bacterial infection. Additional children with less common febrile illnesses will also be recruited: 500 critically ill (BIVA-PIC); 200 at high-risk of bacterial illness through primary or secondary immunodeficiency (BIVA-HR); 150 with an inflammatory diagnosis, whose initial presentation is difficult to discriminate from bacterial infection (BIVA-INF). Samples collected from recruits in the BIVA studies will be used for the validation of biomarkers (clinical, proteomic and transcriptomic biomarkers) for diagnosis of febrile illness, including markers of bacterial and viral infection (confirmed by culture and/or molecular microbiology) and inflammatory conditions.</description>
