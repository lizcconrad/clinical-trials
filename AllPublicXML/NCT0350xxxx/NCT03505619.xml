  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reablement holds a potential to become a new rehabilitation model and has been implemented in
      some western countries including Norway and Denmark. At present, there is a lack of
      scientific evidence for the effectiveness of reablement and lack of an explicit theoretical
      underpinning, leading to a gap in knowledge. Trends show, however, that reablement is
      beneficial for the person and their significant others, increasing quality of life. There is
      a need for further investigation of the effects among community-dwelling adults in terms of
      clinical and economic outcomes. This research project will investigate the effectiveness of
      reablement including smart products (digitally based) (ASSIST) to facilitate and manage
      reablement services in home-dwelling adults compared with standard home help services in
      terms of daily activities, physical functioning, health-related quality of life, coping,
      mental health, use of health care services, and costs.

      Methods and analysis: This feasibility study will evaluate the perceived value and
      acceptability of ASSIST 1.0 intervention program as the fidelity, reach and dose, and
      potential outcomes by using a pre-post test design involving an intervention group and a
      control group (n=30). All participants will be living at home and with a need of home care
      services. Qualitative interviews among home care providers delivering ASSIST and older adults
      and their significant others receiving the intervention will be conducted to explore aspects
      affecting the intervention.

      Ethics and dissemination: The results will form the base for refinement of the &quot;ASSIST&quot;
      program and planning of a large-scale randomized, controlled trial investigating the effect
      of the program on quality of life as physical health, mental well-being, conditions for
      social community when focusing on supporting the older person's to meaningful everyday life.
      Dissemination will include peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and
      international conferences.

    <masking_description>The older adults will be included if they fulfil the following inclusion criteria a) ≥65 years or older and live at home, b) home care has been granted and the user is deemed not to need home rehabilitation performed by rehabilitation staff, c) two or more identified challenges in everyday activities that can benefit from everyday rehabilitation, d) are able to understand and express themselves in Swedish. One or more of the reasons will result in exclusion from the study: have cognitive limitations that make reablement unappropriate, in need of care in institutional dwelling or are terminally ill ,the older adults have had home help services more than three years.
When the older person in either the intervention or control group agrees to be involved in the study, they will be asked if they could consider involving a significant other.
The home care providers delivering ASSIST 1.0 or the ordinary home care will be included consisting of 8-10 staff from each group.</masking_description>

The GSE scale consists of ten statements such as &quot;I can solve most problems if I invest the necessary effort.&quot; Possible responses are scored 1-4, where 1 represents &quot;Not at all true&quot;, 2 &quot;Hardly true&quot;, 3 &quot;Moderately true&quot; and 4 &quot;Exactly true&quot;. This gives a total score ranging from 10-40; higher scores indicate a greater sense of general self-efficacy.

    <description>A ten-week intervention program using a person-centred approach to support the older person to set up goals to perform daily activities that he/she wants or needs to do. The activity goals will target improvements in quality of life, physical health, mental well-being, and conditions for social community. The focus will be on supporting the older person's activities in everyday life that are considered meaningful for the individual. During the intervention, a specially designed application will send reminders and feedback related to the older adults' activity goals of doing their prioritized everyday activities both to the older adults and to the home care providers via mobile phones, tablet etc. The home care providers will participate in coaching sessions supporting the intervention held by the team of researchers.</description>
