    <textblock>
      The main objective of the PROOF trial is to investigate efficacy and safety of normobaric
      hyperoxygenation (NBHO) as a neuroprotective treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke
      due to large vessel occlusion likely to receive endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (TBY) in
      a randomized controlled clinical phase IIb trial.

             their own written informed consent is not obtained prior to study inclusion but has to

          -  Any pre-existing condition that may, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, not
             allow safe participation in the study (e.g. substance abuse, co-existing disease) or
             would complicate assessment of outcomes (e.g. dementia, psychiatric disease) or would
