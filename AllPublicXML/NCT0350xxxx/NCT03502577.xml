      This phase I trial determines the side effects and best dose of B-cell maturation antigen
      (BCMA)-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells when combined with gamma-secretase inhibitor
      LY3039478 (LY3039478), cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine in treating participants with
      multiple myeloma that that has come back or remains despite treatment. Placing genes added in
      the laboratory into immune T-cells may make the T-cells recognize BCMA, a protein on the
      surface of cancer cells. LY3039478 may enhance the killing of cancer cells by increasing the
      BCMA expression on multiple myeloma cells, making the targeted BCMA CAR-T treatment more
      effective. LY3039478 also decreases the amount of BCMA found in the circulation (called
      soluble BCMA) that is not bound to the myeloma cells. LY3039478 can therefore reduce the
      potential for soluble BCMA to act as a decoy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving BCMA CAR T therapy with LY3039478, cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine may
      work better in treating participants with relapsed or persistent multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of BCMA-targeting CAR T-cells in combination with LY3039478 for
      patients with relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To identify the recommended phase 2 dose (R2PD) of BCMA CAR T cells administered in
      combination with LY3039478 in patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the peak concentration, in vivo persistence and the phenotype of transferred
      CAR T cells when administered in combination with LY3039478.

      II. To estimate the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred BCMA CAR T cells when
      administered with LY3039478.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of BCMA-specific CAR T-cells.

      Participants receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days -4 to -2. Participants then
      receive BCMA-specific CAR T-cells intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0 and
      LY3039478 orally (PO) on days 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18. Patients will also receive
      LY039478 orally before the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to evaluate the effect of this
      drug alone on multiple myeloma cell BCMA levels.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for years
      1-5 and annually for years 6-15.
