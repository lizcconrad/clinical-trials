      This study evaluates the use of advance care planning conversation tools with patients
      attending their family doctor's office. Patients complete tools about their values and
      wishes, and a health care provider uses a structured discussion tool to talk about the
      patient's health condition and future wishes. The patient's family member/substitute
      decision-maker is encouraged to attend and be part of the discussions.

      Structured tools are helpful for advance care planning. Tools have been developed to help
      with advance care planning because it is a process which has multiple steps and people
      involved. This study will help health care teams in primary care learn to use the tools with
      frail or older seriously ill patients and will evaluate the perceptions of patients, family
      members and health care providers, as well as the impact of having the discussions on
      subsequent health care interactions the patient has.
