  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of fractures and dislocations are generally organized in the hospital setting.
      However, equal care for patients with non-complex fractures or dislocations may be provided
      in general practices. While substitution of trauma care from the secondary to the primary
      care setting is stimulated by the government and insurers, it is unknown what the patient
      satisfaction level is and which determinants affect this patient satisfaction. Therefore, the
      primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of treatment in a general practice
      on patient satisfaction compared to treatment in a hospital. The secondary objectives include
      assessments in quality of life, patient-reported outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Besides,
      results will be discussed using a small focus group consisting of patients (n=15 per group)
      and healthcare providers.
