          -  Subjects must be willing to designate 2 pair of shoes with a maximum heel height of 1
             ¼ inches, of either casual, work or type of sneakers, for approval of use during the

             shoes must be of the same type. Subjects that wear shoes in the work category may
             qualify a single pair of shoes as long as the subject wears the same pair of shoes to
             work every day;

          -  Subjects must indicate that they currently have heel pain and that they experience
             heel pain at the end of the day. Subjects that have plantar fasciitis will be
             identified by the presence of acute pain in the morning upon taking their first steps;

          -  Subjects must report Heel pain of ≥20 mm to ≤90 mm at the end of their day [assessed
             on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS), where 0=no pain and 100=worst pain possible] at
             baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with heel pain due to recent heel spurs, stress fracture or other structural
             issues;

          -  Subjects with self-reported alcohol consumption that exceeds moderate consumption (&gt;2
             alcoholic beverages per day);

          -  Subjects that have received or used an Investigational New Drug in the past 30 days;

             = Subjects that have been enrolled in the last two weeks or are currently
             participating in a product performance research study or any other type of research,
             marketing, or product performance study;

          -  Subjects who are nursing, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant during the course
             of the study (self-reported);

          -  Subjects who have diabetes, circulatory problems, open wounds, and lack of sensation

             inappropriate;

          -  Subjects who wear physician-prescribed orthotic insoles or prescription shoes;

          -  Subjects who have had a traumatic injury to the lower extremity (deemed of non-overuse
             nature), which in the opinion of the examining Investigator would interfere with the
             study evaluations;

          -  Subjects whose condition requires surgery or other medical intervention or who have
             undergone foot back or knee surgery within the past 3 months or with any planned
             surgeries and/or invasive medical procedures during the course of the study;

          -  Subjects who are currently taking an opioid-based pain medication or have taken such
             medication within 2 months prior to Visit 1;

             safety;

          -  Subjects who have any condition that would make study participation inappropriate, as
             determined by the examining Investigator or designee;

          -  Subjects with a self-reported history of immunosuppression/immune deficiency disorders
             or currently using immunosuppressive medications (e.g., azathioprine, belimumab,
             cyclophosphamide, Enbrel, Imuran, Humira, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate,
             prednisone, Remicade, Stelara.), and/or radiation as determined by study
             documentation;
