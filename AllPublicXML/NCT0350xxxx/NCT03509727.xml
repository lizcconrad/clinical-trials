      A diagnostic accuracy study investigating the accuracy of procalcitonin in diagnosing
      invasive bacterial infections in your infants.

      The primary aim of this study was to report on the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin in
      the diagnosis of bacterial infections in young infants. This included invasive bacterial
      infections; defined as the isolation of a bacterial pathogen in blood or cerebrospinal fluid
      culture.

      We conducted a prospective observational diagnostic accuracy study. Young infants less than
      90 days of age presenting to the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with signs of
      possible bacterial infection were eligible for inclusion. Eligible infants underwent
      procalcitonin testing using 0.5ml of whole blood with a BRAHMS assay on the Samsung LABGEO
      IB10Â® analyser.
