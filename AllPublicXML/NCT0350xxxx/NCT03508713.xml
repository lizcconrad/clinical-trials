    <textblock>
      To focus on the real world treat-to-target rate of early rheumatoid arthritis patients who
      will be treated according to the 2015 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the
      Treatment of RA.

      To explore the factors which influence the treat-to-target outcome.

      Resent study showed that rapid progression of cartilage and bone damage could happen on the
      early state of RA patients, so the clinicians should try the best to stop the trend, such as
      early diagnosis, early treatment and treat-to-target. But only half of the RA patients could
      reach low disease activity in the whole world and about 10% in China.

      The investigators enroll early RA patients who are treated according to the 2015 American
      College of Rheumatology Guideline. The relevant data are collected and analyzed by the
      statistician including clinical data, imaging markers, blood samples and patient-reported
      outcomes every 3 months.
