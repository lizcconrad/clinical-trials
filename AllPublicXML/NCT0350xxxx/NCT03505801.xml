    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Confirm Rx SMART Registry is to collect real world data to assess the
      safety and performance of the Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) and system over a
      12 month period. A sub-set of subjects enrolled in the Confirm Rx SMART Registry will meet
      the Post Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF) requirement for CE mark.
