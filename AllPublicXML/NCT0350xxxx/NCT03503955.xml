  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With Leap Motion Controller, virtual reality exercises have been implemented more often since
      2014, and this technology has benefited more from upper extremity rehabilitation In
      literature, there are no publications investigating the effectiveness of virtual reality
      applications on upper extremity functions in cases of mental retardation with Leap Motion.

      We think that virtual reality applications with Leap Motion are effective in fine motor
      skills and grip strength in cases of mental retardation.

      The purpose of our work; To Investigation of the Effectiveness of Video Based Games on Upper
      Extremity Functions in Mild Mental Retardation Diagnosed Cases

      For the study group, in addition to fine motor skills activities, 20 min. Leap-Motion virtual
      reality games, and for the control group only fine motor skill activities will be applied.
      The study will last 8 weeks, 2 times a week for a total of 16 sessions.The games that
      Fizyosoft has built on Leap Motion equipment will be played individually and will focus on
      running hand, wrist and grip movements to improve hand and grip activities of the events.
      Each game is designed to develop a different hand movement. In this study, CatchaPet and
      LeapBall of Fizyosoft HandRom products will be used.

      &quot;LeapBall,&quot; aiming at throwing the ball in the same color as the ball, and Leap Motion sensor
      games, &quot;CatchaPet,&quot; aimed at touching the rabbits out of the holes with repeated wrist
      flexion / extensional movements, will be preferred by grasping a virtual ball with the
      fingers of all fingers.

      The demographic characteristics of all the cases participating in the study will be recorded.

      JEBSON hand function test, Manual Ability Classification System (MACS), 9 Hole Peg Test to
      measure fine hand skill. JAMAR Hand Dynamometer to measure Hand Grip Force, Pinchmeter to
      measure finger grip strength. The evaluation will be repeated before and after the treatment.
