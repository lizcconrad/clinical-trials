  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study for people who have a solid tumor that was not effectively treated
      by conventional therapy or for which there is no known effective therapy. This is a phase I
      study of a drug called nab-paclitaxel used together with gemcitabine. Gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel will be given intravenously, once a week for 3 out of 4 weeks, for a 28-day
      cycle.

      The goals of this study are:

        -  To find the highest dose of nab-paclitaxel that can be safely given in combination with
           gemcitabine without causing severe side effects

        -  To learn what kind of side effects nab-paclitaxel given in combination with gemcitabine
           can cause

        -  To learn more about the pharmacology (how the body handles the drug) of nab- paclitaxel
           given in combination with gemcitabine

        -  To evaluate tumor tissue for levels of certain proteins that may help with predicting
           who will benefit most from treatment with nab-paclitaxel

        -  To determine whether nab-paclitaxel given in combination with gemcitabine is a
           beneficial treatment for relapsed and/or refractory solid tumors

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed and refractory non-central nervous system (non-CNS) solid tumors have poor outcomes,
      and novel therapies are needed. Many relapsed/refractory solid tumor patients desire further
      therapy; however, they often wish to also preserve a high quality of life. Thus therapeutic
      strategies that offer relatively minimal treatment-related toxicities are also desirable. The
      combination of gemcitabine, a pyrimidine analog, and docetaxel, an antimitotic taxane, is an
      attractive combination because of non-overlapping toxicities. This combination has shown
      activity and tolerability in adult Phase II trials for solid tumors. Favorable experiences
      with this regimen in pediatrics have been described retrospectively by several institutions.
      Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-bound, solvent-free taxane that allows higher dosing and shorter
      infusion duration than solvent-bound taxanes (docetaxel and paclitaxel) by removing exposure
      to toxic solvent carriers. Albumin binding of the agent also increases drug delivery to
      tumors through increased albumin-initiated transcytosis, and may also increase tumoral
      accumulation of drug through binding of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC).
      The combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel has been studied extensively in adults with
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with the combination providing superior outcomes to treatment with
      gemcitabine alone. There is also preclinical evidence of potent anti-tumor activity of
      nab-paclitaxel alone and in combination with gemcitabine in pediatric solid tumor models.
      Therefore, the researchers hypothesize that the combination of nab-paclitaxel with
      gemcitabine will improve the anti-tumor efficacy observed with gemcitabine/docetaxel in
      relapsed/refractory solid tumors.

      This is a Phase 1 study of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine for children,
      adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory non-central nervous system (CNS)
      solid tumors in which the researchers will define toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and evaluate
      SPARC expression in pediatric tumors as a biomarker of disease response. Nab-paclitaxel will
      be administered intravenously (IV) once weekly on days 1,8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle. The
      starting dose of nab-paclitaxel will be 180 mg/m2/dose which is 75% of the pediatric, single
      agent MTD of 240 mg/m2/dose. The researchers will then dose escalate up to 240 mg/m2/dose.
      Participants will also receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2/dose IV once weekly on days 1, 8, and
      15. Participants may continue on therapy until there is evidence of progressive disease or
      toxicity that requires removal from therapy. Therapy may otherwise continue for up to 24
      cycles.

    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nab-paclitaxel administered intravenously weekly every 3 of 4 weeks in combination with gemcitabine in children with refractory/relapsed non-CNS solid tumors will be determined. The MTD is empirically defined as the highest dose level at which there is no more than one patient experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next higher dose level has been determined to be too toxic.

               -  Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
                  for age

               -  Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (ALT) ≤ 5 x the ULN. For the purpose
                  of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients who are pregnant are ineligible for study. Lactating females are not
             eligible unless they have agreed not to breastfeed their infants from the time of
             informed consent through the duration and at least 1 month following the study. Female
             patients of childbearing potential are not eligible unless a negative pregnancy test
             result has been obtained. Sexually active patients of reproductive potential are not
             eligible unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method from the
             time of informed consent through the duration and for 1 month following study
             participation. The definition of an effective contraceptive method will be at the
             discretion of the institutional investigator.

          -  Patients taking any the following concomitant medications are not eligible:

               -  Subjects who are currently receiving another investigational drug.

                  which metabolize nab-paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8,
                  so strong inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes should be avoided.
