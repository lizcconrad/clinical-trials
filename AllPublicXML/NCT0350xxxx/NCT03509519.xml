  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this placebo controlled clinical trial is to examine the effects of of
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) training on physical activity, muscle function,
      self-efficacy, and blood markers [e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)] in older
      adults.

      It is hypothesized that 4-weeks of NMES will increase 1) physical activity, 2) muscle
      function, 3) self-efficacy, and 4) BDNF in older adults.

      Sarcopenia is a destructive progressive cycle of impaired physical function resulting in loss
      of muscle mass, strength, and self-confidence in ability to perform physical activities,
      compounded by difficulty walking and ultimately reduced physical activity levels for many
      older adults. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a common therapeutic modality
      used to create involuntary muscle contractions as a means to increase muscle strength, and
      may be an effective treatment for improving muscle function and physical activity levels in
      older adults with sarcopenia. Thus, it is critical to explore viable and effective
      alternative therapies to increase physical activity. The goal of the investigators' is to
      determine the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) at increasing
      physical activity and related biological, psychological, and muscle function factors. This
      placebo controlled clinical trial will use a pre-test - post-test randomized experimental
      design.

      Older healthy adults (60 and older) will participate in this study. Participants will undergo
      4 weeks of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) training. Participants will be
      randomized into the one of two groups 1) NMES-millicurrent or 2) NMES microcurrent.
      Participants will undergo pre- and post-training testing for muscle function, physical
      function, and psychological variables related to physical activity. Blood samples will also
      be obtained pre- and post-training.

    <description>The NMES-microcurrent group will receive the Sham Treatment. The Sham Treatment will consist of electrode pad application for 40 mins on each leg, but electrical current will not be delivered. Otherwise all procedures will be the same as the NMES-millicurrent experimental group. Participants will be informed they are receiving microcurrent stimulation which is typically not felt by patients. Microcurrent stimulation is an actual type of electrical stimulation that is used therapeutically and is typically not felt by patients, however, participants will not receive this treatment. Participants will be informed of the actual treatment received at the study conclusion. Those in the Sham Group will be given the opportunity to receive the treatment at the conclusion of the study.</description>
