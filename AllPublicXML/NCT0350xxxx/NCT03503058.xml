  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single site, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that
      will assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy (VE) of PfSPZ
      Vaccine and PfSPZ-CVac against naturally occurring malaria in Indonesian soldiers deployed to
      eastern Indonesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 420 participants will be randomized 1.0:0.5:1.0:0.5 to 4 groups. Participants will
      be recruited from an Indonesian army battalion based in a malaria-free area. All volunteers
      will be healthy males aged 18 to 55 years. They will be immunized in a malaria-free area of
      Indonesia, and then deployed to eastern Indonesia for ~6-9 months. Standard safety,
      tolerability, and parasitology data will be collected before deployment during the
      immunization period.

      Participants will receive three doses by DVI of

        1. PfSPZ Vaccine on days 1, 8, and 29,

        2. PfSPZ Challenge with chloroquine (CQ) prophylaxis on days 1, 29, and 57,

        3. normal saline (NS) on days 1, 8, and 29, or

        4. normal saline with CQ prophylaxis on days 1, 29, and 57. The PfSPZ Vaccine dose will be
           9 x 10^5 PfSPZ. The PfSPZ Challenge dose will be 2 x 10^5 PfSPZ. CQ will first be given
           as a loading dose of 600 mg base two days before the first administration of PfSPZ
           Challenge or NS, followed by weekly 300 mg doses of CQ with the last dose 5 days after
           the last dose of PfSPZ Challenge.

          -  Any evidence of active malaria, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, confirmed by RDT,
             microscopy or PCR less than 3 weeks before first injection of PfSPZ Vaccine or
             PfSPZ-CVac.

          -  History of non-febrile seizures or atypical febrile seizures.

          -  Under treatment for tuberculosis.

          -  Subjects with &gt; 5% 5-year cardiovascular risk (fatal and non-fatal) based on the

             though they are in the 35-44 age group.

          -  History of psychiatric disorders (such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders, or
             schizophrenia) or behavioral tendencies (including active alcohol or drug abuse)
             discovered during the screening process that in the opinion of the investigator would
             make compliance with the protocol difficult.
