  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical myelopathy (CM), a chronically compressive spinal cord lesion, is the most common
      cause of non-traumatic paraparesis/quadriparesis among the elderly. Hong Kong is facing a
      heavy social economic burden from CM with the rapidly aging population. Surgical
      decompression is considered as the mainstay of the treatment for CM patients to relieve their
      symptoms and signs. Yet the surgical outcome is not always satisfactory. There is a pressing
      need for understanding the exact mechanism of surgical decompression on the recovery of
      myelopathic cord in order to improve the prognosis of CM patients in near future.This project
      will evaluate neuronal activities and axon regeneration by longitudinally monitoring at time
      zero, 3 and 6 month after the surgery in CM patients using UTE, BOLD-fMRI and DTI, and to
      investigate the relationship of preoperative neuronal activities of myelopathic cord with
      axon regeneration.

      This study aims to monitor the structural and functional changes of chronically compressed
      spinal cords longitudinally after surgical decompression in vivo. Three kinds of MRI
      techniques will be used in this study. These are (1) axial T1-weighted (T1WI) and T2-weighted
      imaging (T2WI), UTE MRI, (2) BOLD-based fMRI, and (3) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To
      quantitatively investigate the structural deficits, T1/T2 MRIs will delineate the gross
      morphology of the spinal cord, CSF, and surrounding anatomical structures, while DTI will
      quantify the fiber orientation and integrity within the spinal cord. BOLD-based functional
      MRIs will assess the local hemodynamic changes and neuron activities in response to the motor
      or sensory stimulation along the C3 to C8 spinal nerve levels. The MRI evaluations will be
      applied to the same cervical myelopathy (CM) patient before surgery and 3 and 6 months
      post-surgery, when clinical recovery reaches a plateau9. Clinical examination will include
      neurological evaluation, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring assessment, and
      clinical electrophysiological evaluation.
