  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating and degenerative disease of the
      central nervous system and, after trauma, is the most common cause of disability in young
      adults, affecting more than 400,000 individuals in the US. Of all the symptoms that can occur
      with MS, chronic fatigue is the most common and disabling, reported by at least 75% of
      patients at some point. Fatigue limits patients' daily activities, and challenges employment,
      resulting in substantial socioeconomic consequences. Despite this negative impact, fatigue
      treatments have been inconsistently studied, in part due to poorly understood underlying
      pathophysiological mechanisms. Yet to be defined biological processes and lack of clear
      treatment targets have also hampered the development of drugs for fatigue. As a result, there
      are no medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MS
      fatigue.

      The investigators recently reported that riluzole, a medication with anti-glutamatergic
      effects, increased the fatigue severity in patients with relapsing MS who had participated in
      a clinical trial evaluating potential neuroprotective effects of riluzole versus placebo.
      Three other clinic trials which examined memantine effects on cognition in patient with MS
      also reported worsening fatigue as a major side effect. Memantine main mechanism of action is
      blocking the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor. These observations prompted us
      that glutamatergic transmission probably plays an important role in fatigue pathogenesis and
      modulating these pathways could have potential therapeutic effect on MS-related fatigue. A
      recent paper reported that ketamine, an NMDA receptor blocker with different kinetics
      compared to memantine, had a strong and prolonged effect in reducing fatigue in bipolar
      patients who participated in a clinical trial, evaluating anti-depressive effects of ketamine
      versus placebo. Interestingly, the effect of ketamine on fatigue was independent of its
      antidepressant effects.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if modulating glutamatergic transmission
      with ketamine is safe and efficacious in improving MS-related fatigue. These objectives will
      be answered in a proof of concept, randomized controlled trial of ketamine versus an active
      placebo (midazolam) in patients with relapsing or progressive MS who have clinically
      significant fatigue.

      18 patients with MS and reported fatigue, will be randomized 2:1 to one infusion of ketamine
      0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes versus one infusion of midazolam 0.05 mg/kg over 40 minutes.
      Midazolam is chosen as an active placebo to keep the participants blinded to their medication
      assignment. Primary outcome of the study will be Daily Fatigue Severity measured daily from
      day one through day seven post-infusion.

      Secondary outcomes of the study include other fatigue questionnaires, depression and
      sleepiness. The length of study will be around 28 days.

    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a method of evaluating the impact of fatigue on you. The FSS is a short questionnaire that requires you to rate your level of fatigue. The FSS questionnaire contains nine statements that rate the severity of your fatigue symptoms.
Read each statement and circle a number from 1 to 7, based on how accurately it reflects your condition during the past week and the extent to which you agree or disagree that the statement applies to you.
â€¢ A low value (e.g., 1) indicates strong disagreement with the statement, whereas a high value (e.g., 7) indicates strong agreement.</description>
