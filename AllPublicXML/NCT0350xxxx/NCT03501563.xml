  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress at the cellular level and the effects of the antioxidant system on the
      anesthetic drugs make the anesthesia method more important. Hypotensive anesthesia or
      controlled hypotension is an anesthetic technique routinely used in many operations (ENT,
      orthopedic, plastic surgery, etc.) to reduce intraoperative bleeding and to provide a more
      open surgical area.

      In this study, investigators aimed to investigate the effects of hypotensive anesthesia on
      thiol / disulfide balance from oxidative stress markers.

      Hypotensive anesthesia is caused by hypoperfusion and hypoxia-induced oxidative stresses at
      the tissue level and can initiate cell damage. Many methods can be used alone or in
      combination to create hypotensive anesthesia. İnvestigators will investigate whether
      hypotensive anesthesia causes an effect on the cellular level.

      This study will be performed prospectively with 80 participants with ASA 1-2, aged 18-60
      years, undergoing hypotensive anesthesia in the operation of the septoplasty in Recep Tayyip
      Erdoğan University Medical Faculty Training and Research Hospital. Participants with
      uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, cogulopathy, morbid
      obesity (BMI ≥35) and renal disease will not be taken. Anesthesia induction and management
      will be standardized. Hypotension in the participants will be maintained by reducing the mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) by 30% or 55-65 mmHg according to the initial value. In the study,
      the heart rate (HR), MAP, peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2), ETCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide)
      values, and BIS (Bispectral index) values showing anesthesia depth are to be followed.
      Participants will receive venous blood sample of up to 2 ml before the anesthesia induction
      and 10 minutes to finish of the hypotensive anesthesia, from the untreated vein. Thiol
      disulfide levels from this blood sample will be studied in the biochemistry research
      laboratory using the method developed by Erel et al.

    <description>Participants with ASA 1-2, aged 18-60 years, undergoing hypotensive anesthesia in the operation of the septoplasty in Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University Medical Faculty Training and Research Hospital. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, cogulopathy, morbid obesity (BMI ≥35) and renal disease will not be taken.
Participants were first pre-medicated with an infusion of midazolam 0.05 mg/kg, fentanyl 1 µg/kg, lidocaine 1 mg/kg. Induction of anesthesia was achieved with an infusion of propofol 1-2 mg/kg and vecuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg and after 2 to 3 minutes participants were intubated with the appropriate tube size. Anesthesia was maintained with an infusion of remi fentanyl (0.05 - 1 µg/Kg/min), with oxygen (O2) in air with desflurane.</description>
