        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC (IIIB/IV) and extensive disease SCLC with

          -  Received inpatient treatment more than twice (inclusive) at a selected site. For
             hospitals with outpatient records, patients receiving oral TKI therapy and routinely
             (more than twice a year) followed up outpatient will be included although no inpatient
             records. For hospitals with outpatient chemotherapy center, patients will be include
             if they were prescribed with chemotherapy and routinely (more than twice a year,
             inclusive) followed up outpatient in the hospital

          -  18 years of age or older at initial diagnosis of IIIB/IV NSCLC and extensive disease
             SCLC

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have participated in or are attending clinical trials receiving active
             therapy

          -  Unknown initial diagnosis time and initial treatment time.

          -  For hospitals without outpatient chemo therapy center, patients who were prescribed
             with chemo therapy but with no inpatient records will be excluded

          -  Patients who received inpatient therapy for one time and were not routinely (more than
             twice a year, inclusive) followed up outpatient will be excluded
