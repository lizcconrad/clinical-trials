  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, controlled, within subject comparison, single dose study
      to determine the sensitization potential of SM04755 solution on normal skin under
      semi-occlusive patch conditions.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, Repeat Insult Patch Test (RIPT) study is a single-center study of topical
      SM04755 solution repetitively applied to skin of healthy volunteers. This study will assess
      the potential of the Test Materials to induce contact sensitization as measured by treatment
      emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Reaction Grade and Investigator assessment of irritation and
      sensitization.

             assessments

          -  Subject has no signs of irritation (i.e., a Reaction Grade of &quot;0&quot;) at patch
             application sites on the back prior to the initial patch application on Day 1

          -  Subject must have read, understood, and signed the informed consent form prior to any
             study-related procedure being performed

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with all scheduled study visits, urine pregnancy

             (HIV) infection as determined by an interview

          -  Participation in a clinical research trial that included the receipt of an
             investigational product or any experimental therapeutic procedure within 8 weeks prior
             to Screening, or planned participation in any such trial; the last date of
             participation in the trial, not the last date of receipt of investigational product,
