  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is planned to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a new pedicle screw
      system for the specific indication of isthmic spondylolisthesis, as this condition concerns
      relatively young patients requiring good fixation of the performed reposition to come to
      satisfactory clinical results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult Isthmic spondylolisthesis, which is associated with &quot;spondylolysis,&quot; is defined as an
      osseous discontinuity of the vertebral arch at the isthmus (the pars interarticularis), which
      usually occurs in the fifth lumbar vertebra. The prevalence of isthmic spondylosis is
      proposed to be about 6% to 26% in different studies. The European Spine Tango registry found
      15%. It is proposed to affect more men than women. Conservative treatments including braces,
      physical therapy, and medication are shown to be effective for some patients; however,
      surgical treatments are mainly the final effective treatment. There are several different
      options for surgery among which posterolateral fusion (PLF) is considered as the method of
      choice. It is shown that PLF is more effective than conservative treatments such as exercise.
      The fusion helps to fix the motion of the affected segment and therefore, might lead to pain
      reduction. Decompression, supplemental instrumentation, and supplemental anterior column
      support are also considered for treatment. These treatment strategies can be used separately
      or in any combination; however, studies trying to compare separate treatments with a
      combination of them have led to inconsistent results.

      Supplementary pedicle screws might be added to fusion methods for fixation and it is proposed
      that they have the ability to correct the deformity, reduce the listhesis, and increase the
      fusion rates, although a majority of the studies comparing instrumented PLF and
      noninstrumented PLF could not show the superiority of instrumented approaches. The literature
      has been reviewed in 2000 already, and the method has already been proved to be &quot;practical,
      safe, and effective&quot; for various spinal indications. Other authors found a better result for
      isthmic spondylolisthesis patients with posterior lumbar interbody Fusion (PLIF), vs. PLF,
      especially for high grade isthmic spondylolisthesis.

      The present study is planned to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a new pedicle screw
      system for the specific indication of isthmic spondylolisthesis, as this condition concerns
      relatively young patients requiring good fixation also in the long-term.

    <description>Leg Pain measured by Visual analogue scale (VAS) after 1 year follow-up: measured by Visual Analogue Scale: The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

    <measure>Functional Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at all timepoints; The ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire to quantify disability for low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten Topics: intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

    <description>Quality of Life measured by EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire: The 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) was introduced by the EuroQol Group in 2009 to improve the instrument's sensitivity and to reduce ceiling effects, as compared to the EQ-5D-3L. The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety / depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
