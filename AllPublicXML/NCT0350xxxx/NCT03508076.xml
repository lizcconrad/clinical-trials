  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipated patients in the participating center from February 2017 to June 2018
      (anticipated) were prospectively enrolled. Number of defecation per week，Bristol score，and
      Colon transmission experiment were compared with the constipated patients before treatment.

      Constipation affects the quality of life of patients, some patients abuse laxatives or
      repeated medical treatment, increased medical costs. At present, the main treatment of
      constipation is to adjust life style, medicine, psychotherapy, biofeedback and surgical
      treatment. However, the above methods are associated with adverse reactions, and the
      patient's satisfaction is still low. A new approach is needed to solve this clinical problem.

      Investigators have developed a vibration capsule that can be adjusted in different modes.

      Preliminary animal experiments showed that the capsule was safe and increased the number of
      defecation.

      This study is a clinical research for patients with constipation, to explore the effect in
      different vibrating modes in patients with constipation and tract emptying transmission and
      its effectiveness.
