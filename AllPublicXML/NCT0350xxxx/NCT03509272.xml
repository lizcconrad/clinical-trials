      Background:

      Multiple adaptations at the cardiovascular system occurs during pregnancy. In the pregnancy
      condition pre-eclampsia (PE), this adaptations are abnormal. Five to eight percent of all
      pregnant women worldwide will develop PE.

      PE is a pregnancy condition which is characterized with a high blood pressure (&gt;140/90 mm Hg)
      and the occurrence of proteinuria (&gt;3g/dl/24h) after 20 weeks of gestation. When untreated,
      this condition can have severe complications for both mother and child. It's important to
      monitor women with a high risk for developing PE for an early detection and treatment of this
      condition.

      For this reason, a multicenter study is set up with the following applications:

        1. NICCOMO and Maternal Venous Doppler Echography: impedance cardiograph and an echography
           of the heart and veins.

        2. Maltron: bio-electronic impedance analyze

        3. Remote monitoring of the high risk patients to become a more intensive follow-up

      Number of inclusions: 1000 pregnant women from the prenatal consultations of eight different
      hospitals:

    <description>The NICOMMO can record can record multiple haemodynamic parameters uninterrupted and reliable in an objective manner by using Impedance Cardiography. This technology is simple and non-invasive, and safe for pregnant women. The aim of this course is to describe the course of these parameters through normal pregnancies, and to examine any abnormalities in pre-eclamptic pregnancies. In view of the fact that in pre-eclampsia certain cardiovascular parameters are abnormal during several weeks before the disease becomes clinically manifest, this device might have a potential role in the prediction of pre-eclampsia in the future.</description>

    <description>In cardiology, a combined ultrasound ECG study provides important information about the functioning of the heart, especially with regard to the &quot;stiffening&quot; of the heart and blood vessel walls. It is known that in pre-eclampsia the blood vessel walls stiffen. Up to now it has never been investigated whether a combined Echo-ECG study can provide information about the degree of vascular wall stiffening. This study component checks which reference values are in normal pregnancy and whether these differ from pre-eclamptic pregnancies.</description>

    <description>Intervention Description: Patients can participate in the study when they're 10 weeks pregnant. At 10 weeks: a NICCOMO, Maternal Venous Doppler Echography and Maltron measurement will be taken. This measurement will be repeated at 20 weeks of pregnancy, and 30 weeks of pregnancy when they're aberrant.
When the measurements are abnormal, the patients will be included in the remote monitoring study. The following protocol and devices will be applied:
