  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary choices are influenced by several factors, including physiological, social or genetic
      factors. Among these, flavor is the most important determinant modulating the preferences
      versus specific foods.

      Flavor perception is the result from the sensory integration of taste and odor properties of
      food.

      Aim of the present study was to assess flavor abilities in a large population using a
      validated perceptive test.

      This protocol investigates flavor perception using the flavor test, a specific test to assess
      the retro-nasal olfactory function.

      A decrease in taste and smell abilities can result in loss of appetite, inadequate dietary
      intake and malnutrition. Several diseases and conditions have been associated with taste
      disorders and a decline in gustatory function is very common in the elderly.

      The flavor test was previously developed, validated and patented by our group. It consists of
      a series of 20 aromatic extracts, corresponding to routine dietary use flavors for Italian
      people.

      Each tastant, originally stored in a 30 mL amber bottle, is diluted in distilled water and
      stored at 4 °C, then it is kept at room temperature for 20 min before administration.

      An aliquot of approximately 0,5 mL of each tastant is administered in the oral cavity using a
      3mL Transfer Pipet and left for approximately 5 seconds; the mouth is then rinsed twice with
      distilled water before the administration of the following tastant.

      At each administration, participants are invited to identify the aromatic by making a choice
      from 5 proposed items. A total of 21 aromatics (including one blank) are administered
      sequentially. The flavor score (FS) is calculated as the sum of correctly identified
      aromatics and ranged from 0 to 21.
