      This purpose of this study is to describe the effect of Tumor Treating Fields (NovoTTF) on
      quality of life (QOL), including exercise, sleep quality, and mood, in patients with World
      Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV malignant glioma who have been prescribed and approved to
      receive Optune™. This is an observational, longitudinal study, meaning that information about
      QOL will be collected over time while the patient is using the NovoTTF device (for example,
      Optune™).

      Patients will be provided with a Fitbit Charge HR, which they will begin wearing immediately
      to collect baseline information. The study team will teach the patients how to use the Fitbit
      and the associated smart phone application. Patients will also set an account with a platform
      that will provide information from the Fitbit (number of steps, sleep behaviors, and exercise
      log) to the study team. Patients will also have blood drawn, do a 6-minute walk test, and
      complete questionnaires at clinic visits 1, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after receiving the Fitbit.
      At the end of the study, patients will return the Fitbit to the study team.

          -  Histologically proven WHO grade IV malignant glioma

          -  Completed standard-of-care treatment for newly diagnosed WHO grade IV malignant
             glioma, consisting of TMZ and RT

          -  Signed Optune™ Prescription Form indicating intention of initiating NovoTTF therapy

          -  Stable disease status

          -  Patients ≥ 18 years of age

          -  KPS ≥ 70

          -  Patient must be able to ambulate and complete the 6-minute walk test without use of a
