    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate coagulation parameters in treatment naive patients with
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Treatment naive patients with neovascular
      AMD, scheduled to undergo treatment with intravitreal injections of aflibercept will be
      enrolled in the study. Blood samples will be collected before the first intravitreal
      injection and at 7 and 30 days after aflibercept administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is one of the leading causes of severe visual
      loss in the aging population. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents constitute the mainstay in the
      treatment of neovascular AMD.

      Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein targeting vascular endothelial growth factor
      A(VEGF A) and placenta growth factor (PlGF), developed for intravitreal administration in
      conditions such as neovascular age related macular degeneration, macular edema due to retinal
      vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema or myopic choroidal neovascularization. However,
      treatment with anti-VEGFs like aflibercept, carries a potential risk of arterial
      thromboembolic events, including stroke and myocardial infarction.
