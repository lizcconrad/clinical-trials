  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients over 65 years old who are exposed to alcohol or benzodiazepines will be recruited
      through the Fragility Assessment and Addictions Prevention Day Hospital, the Addiction
      Service and the Geriatric Post-Emergency Department. Toulouse University Hospital.

      The investigators will study descriptively the frequency of substance use disorder and the
      frequency of DSM-5 criteria associated with this diagnosis in a population of elderly
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this research is that some of the DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder
      are more appropriate than others in people over 65 years of age. This study therefore aims to
      describe the frequency of the DSM-5 criteria for the substance use disorder in a population
      over 65 years of age and to link it secondarily to the severity of the addiction.

      The study is a descriptive study of a population of subjects over 65 years old. It aims to
      search for addiction criteria in this population by formulating the hypothesis of an
      addictive vulnerability relating to certain risk factors.

      To sensitize the detection of criteria, we chose among older subjects those who are most at
      risk because they are more exposed to the vulnerability factor relative to this population
      (physical disability, loss of autonomy, loneliness).

    <description>The diagnosis of depression will be made using a screening tool, the Mini-GDS, performed in routine clinical practice as part of the assessment at the day hospital for frailty and addiction prevention.
The Mini-GDS includes 4 items rated at one point depending on the answer. A higher score 1 makes it possible to suspect the existence of a depression.</description>
