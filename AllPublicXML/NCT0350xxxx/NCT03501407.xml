  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticks are the major arthropod vectors transmitting pathogenic agents to humans and domestic
      animals in Europe, and currently, the incidence of tick-borne disease is rising. The most
      common European human tick-borne disease is Lyme borreliosis, with an estimated 90 000 new
      cases every year (compared to 300 000 new cases in the United States annually). This disease
      is initially clinically diagnosed by the presence of migrating erythema following a tick
      bite, which is then subsequently confirmed by serological tests. In parallel with classic
      Lyme borreliosis cases, tick-bitten patients can also present with polymorphic and
      on-specific clinical symptoms (asthenia, fever, myalgia, etc. …) for which there is no known
      etiological diagnosis. It is extremely difficult to determine the proportion of tick-bitten
      patients with these symptoms compared to patients which have actually contracted Lyme
      disease, although it is estimated that 50% of fevers following a tick bite have an unknown
      infectious origin.

      Typical tick habitats are woodlands, prairies, pastures, and gardens. Ticks are extremely
      sensitive to environmental fluctuations, which are often brought about by human
      socio-economic changes, thus tick-borne diseases are excellent candidates for emergence.
      Consequently, it is incontestable that tickborne diseases pose a significant threat to our
      society. In addition to improving diagnostic techniques, one of the major hurdles relates to
      improving public and health professional knowledge about tick disease risk. The battle
      against tick-borne diseases is based on relatively simple prevention measures, and their
      effectiveness is immeasurably improved when citizens are more informed and
      involved.Therefore, a multidisciplinary project, bringing together veterinarians, doctors,
      scientists, and consultant sociologists has been designed to create a global &quot;One Health&quot;
      approach to tick-borne diseases. Specific scientific project objectives are to (1) detect,
      identify, and isolate new microorganisms—both unknown or unexpected—from patients or animals
      suffering from unexplainable symptoms following tick bites; (2) to demonstrate tick
      competence in their ability to transmit these agents; and (3) to generate concrete
      recommendations to improve tick-borne disease management.
