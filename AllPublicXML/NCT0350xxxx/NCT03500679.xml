    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety/reactogenicity of the ExPEC4V clinical
      trial material (CTM) after the first vaccination and to evaluate the immunogenicity of the
      ExPEC4V CTM, as measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 14 days after the
      first vaccination (on Day 15).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant with contraindication to intramuscular (IM) injections and blood draws,
             for example, bleeding disorders

             excipients

          -  Participant with abnormal function of the immune system resulting from: a) clinical
             conditions (for example, autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency); b) chronic or
             recurrent use of systemic corticosteroids; c) administration of antineoplastic and
             immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy

          -  Participant has a history of neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix that was successfully treated) within the past 1 year
             or a history of any hematological malignancy

             (uncontrolled) chronic medical condition or physical examination findings for which,
             in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of
             the participant (for example, compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit,
