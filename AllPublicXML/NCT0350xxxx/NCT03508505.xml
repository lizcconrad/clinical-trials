    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery can be not infrequently complicated by cardiac low-output syndrome due to
      critical preoperative conditions such as cardiogenic shock, poor left ventricular function
      and severe myocardial ischemia. Suboptimal myocardial protection, technical errors at graft
      anastomoses or of prosthesis implantation, and hibernating myocardium may further contribute
      to cardiac low-output syndrome occurring immediately or shortly after cardiac surgery. In
      this setting, veno-arterial extracorporeal oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is the only means to provide
      cardiopulmonary support to recovery or as bridge to transplantation.

      Data on the real benefit of VA-ECMO after cardiac surgery is limited and often derived from
      heterogeneous patient populations, which prevent conclusive results on the benefits of
      VA-ECMO in this setting. This issue will be investigated in the present retrospective
      European multicenter study.

      Data on the real benefit of VA-ECMO after cardiac surgery is limited and often derived from
      heterogeneous populations of patients who underwent different cardiac procedures. Patients
      with cardiac low-output after surgery for aortic dissection or valve surgery are expected to
      have different baseline characteristics (such as age and comorbidities) and underlying
      cardiac disease than patients undergoing isolated coronary surgery. Furthermore, available
      studies included patients operated during the nineties and this does not provide an exact
      measure of the benefits of this treatment strategy.

      this retrospective European multicenter study.

      Cardiac surgery can be not infrequently complicated by cardiac low-output syndrome due to
      critical preoperative conditions such as cardiogenic shock, poor left ventricular function
      and severe myocardial ischemia. Prolonged aortic cross-clamping, ischemia-reperfusion injury,
      suboptimal myocardial protection, technical errors at graft anastomoses or of prosthesis
      implantation, and hibernating myocardium may further contribute to cardiac low-output
      syndrome occurring immediately or shortly after cardiac surgery. In this setting,
      veno-arterial extracorporeal oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is the only means to provide
      cardiopulmonary support to recovery or as bridge to transplantation.

      Data on the real benefit of VA-ECMO after cardiac surgery is limited and often derived from
      heterogeneous and small size series of patients who underwent different cardiac surgery
      procedures. Patients with cardiac low-output after surgery for aortic dissection or valve
      surgery are expected to have different baseline characteristics (such as age and
      comorbidities) and underlying cardiac disease than patients undergoing isolated coronary
      surgery. Furthermore, available studies included patients operated during the nineties and,
      in view of the development of perfusion technology and perioperative care, this does not
      provide an exact measure of the current benefits of this treatment strategy. Importantly, the
      role of intra-aortic balloon pump, left ventricular venting, duration of VA-ECMO and hospital
      experience should be evaluated. The investigators sought to investigate these issues in a
      large multicenter study.

      Patients and methods Patients who were treated with VA-ECMO for cardiac low-output after
      adult cardiac surgery (other than heart transplantation and/or implantation of a left
      ventricular assist device) in 21 centers of cardiac surgery from January 2010 to December
      2017.

      Eligibility criteria

        -  Patients aged &gt; 18 years;

        -  Patients who required VA-ECMO after elective, urgent or emergency adult cardiac surgery
           such as coronary surgery, heart valve surgery and/or aortic root surgery because of
           postoperative low-cardiac output syndrome and/or acute respiratory failure.

      Exclusion criteria

        -  Patients aged &lt; 18 years;

        -  Any VA-ECMO implanted before index surgical procedure;

        -  Patients who underwent postoperatively veno-venous ECMO;

        -  Patients who required VA-ECMO after heart transplantation;

        -  Patients who required VA-ECMO after any left ventricular assist device.

      Definition criteria Definition criteria and units of measurements are reported beside each
      baseline, operative and postoperative variables in the electronic datasheet.

       18. Reoperation for intrathoracic bleeding

       19. Reoperation for peripheral cannulation-related bleeding

       20. Intensive care unit length of stay

       21. Death on VA-ECMO

      Analysis of clinical results

      The aim of this registry is to perform a number of analysis evaluating:

        1. Early and late survival of postcardiotomy VA-ECMO;

        2. Predictors and causes of in-hospital death after successful weaning from postcardiotomy
           VA-ECMO;

        3. Comparative analysis of peripheral versus central postcardiotomy VA-ECMO;

        4. VA-ECMO plus IAPB vs. isolated VA-ECMO;

        5. Determinants of outcome after prolonged postcardiotomy VA-ECMO (&gt;5 days).

      Publication of results The results of these studies will be submitted for publication to
      international, peer-reviewed journals in the fields of critical care, cardiology or cardiac
      surgery.
