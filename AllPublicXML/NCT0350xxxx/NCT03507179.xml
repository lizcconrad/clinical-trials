  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nineteen patients will be selected from the clinic following the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Each one of them will receive two dentures. The first denture will be a
      conventional complete denture while the second denture will be a complete denture made by
      Rapid prototyping method.

      For both groups, a preliminary impression will be made &amp; after pouring the primary
      impression, self-cured acrylic resin trial denture bases with a wax rim will be constructed
      on the primary casts for the upper &amp; lower arches for a jaw relation record. A facebow record
      will be used to mount the upper cast, while the lower cast will be mounted using a centric
      relation record. Setting of artificial teeth will be performed, then the denture will be
      tried in patient`s mouth. Functional impression will be taken during the try in stage which.

      For the first denture, the functional impression will be poured in normal way to obtain the
      master cast. Then Processing will be done in normal way and the denture will be finished and
      polished and delivered to the patient.

      But for the second denture construction CBCT scanning of the try in with the functional
      impression will be done to obtain STL file then denture base manufacturing will be done by 3D
      printing.

      For group A and group B Retention will be measured for the upper denture immediately, with a
      wash out period one month between the two dentures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heat processed denture base is the treatment of choice for most of edentulous patients and it
      is considered as the golden standard and the main comparator for the new techniques. But
      using Heat Cured Acrylic resin would require many laboratory steps which introduce several
      errors . Meanwhile, the introduction of rapid prototyping method with high accuracy which
      eliminates some of the laboratory steps was the reason for choosing it to compare it with the
      conventional method.

    <description>We will Determine the geographic center for upper denture base to measure retention then A loop will be attached to each denture base at the position of geographic center using clear self cure acrylic resin and the retention will be measured by applying the forces perpendicular to the denture using Digital Force Meter Each base will be tested 3 times and the average will be calculated. Then the loop will be removed and the denture will finished and polish. Retention will be measured immediately after denture insertion.</description>
