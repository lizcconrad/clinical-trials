      Title: Impacts of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant on leg blood flow and skeletal muscle
      mitochondrial function in peripheral artery disease patients.

      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular disease, in which narrowed
      arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs, causing pain, immobility and in some cases
      amputation or death. PAD patients have shown higher levels of systemic and skeletal muscle
      inflammation due to the impaired oxygen transfer capacity of these blood vessels. This
      attenuated oxygen transfer capacity causes hypoxic conditions in the skeletal muscle and
      results in mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). These
      harmful byproducts of cell metabolism are the major cause of intermittent claudication,
      defined as pain in the legs that results in significant functional limitations. One potential
      defensive mechanism to these negative consequences may be having higher antioxidant capacity,
      which would improve blood vessel vasodilatory function, enabling more blood to transfer to
      the skeletal muscles. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to examine the impact of
      mitochondrial targeted antioxidant (MitoQ) intake on oxygen transfer capacity of blood
      vessels, skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, leg function, and claudication in patients
      with PAD. Blood vessel oxygen transfer capacity in the leg will be assessed in the femoral
      and popliteal arteries. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and ROS levels will be
      analyzed in human skeletal muscle via near infrared spectroscopy and through blood samples.
      Leg function will be assessed by walking on a force platform embedded treadmill and
      claudication times will be assessed with the Gardner maximal walking distance treadmill test.

      Previous studies reported that atherosclerotic lesions are distributed non-uniformly in the
      leg arteries, and the resulting impaired blood flow, and concomitant reduced oxygen delivery
      to skeletal muscle results in the pathophysiology of PAD. We have recently demonstrated that
      patients with PAD have higher levels of systemic and local skeletal muscle inflammation due
      to impaired oxygen transfer capacity of leg blood vessels, which causes hypoxic conditions,
      meaning lack of oxygen, in the leg skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction
      and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent key pathological processes linked to
      atherosclerosis-mediated hypoxic and metabolic stress in PAD patients. One potential
      defensive mechanism to these negative consequences of impaired oxygen transfer
      capacity-induced hypoxic stress may be having higher levels of antioxidant capacity. MitoQ, a
      derivative of CoQ10, is a commercial antioxidant that counteracts this oxidative stress
      within the mitochondria. High ROS levels have been positively correlated with reduced NO
      bioavailability, which limits the ability of the blood vessels to dilate, thereby increasing
      the occlusion that leads to claudication in PAD patients. MitoQ should reduce these ROS
      levels and increase vasodilatory function. However, the influence of MitoQ intake on leg
      blood flow, ROS production, claudication and leg function has not yet been investigated in
      this disease population. This research project may help us to understand the beneficial
      effects of higher mitochondrial specific antioxidant capacity on oxygen transfer capacity of
      leg blood vessels, mitochondria function, leg performance and leg pain in patients with PAD.
