  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present project is to reveal, using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (fMRI) in drug users, a specific modulation of brain structures and circuits involved in
      cognitive control (and especially those of inhibitory control) and reward while subjects are
      performing under the influence of drug-associated cues and in various social contexts.

      This hypothesis, based on the animal work, is that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) should play
      a critical role in these processes. Addictive behaviour can be seen as a loss of control
      resulting from reduced inhibitory control, leading to compulsive drug use. These disorders
      are known to be associated with a hypoactivation of specific frontal regions such as the
      anterior cingulate cortex or the prefrontal cortex.

      For the present experiment, it is chosen to use a procedure well established for
      neurophysiological and behavioural assessment of inhibitory processes : the &quot; stop-signal
      reaction time task &quot;.

      This task requires to inhibit a motor response (press a button) at the onset of a stop signal
      (a tone) that occurs while the response is already engaged. In this task associated with
      fMRI, it was previously shown that the STN is involved in the control of inhibition. These
      results confirm our data in the rat, and especially those showing that STN lesions block the
      ability to stop. The stop signal task will thus be appropriate to study the effect of the
      social context on inhibitory processes in a population of cocaine users.

      In cocaine abusers, it was shown that inhibitory processes are affected. Here we aim at
      testing this population of subjects while they perform the stop task, but adding an implicit
      cognitive load induced by visual cues associated or not with cocaine intake. Since it want to
      assess the influence of a peer on both the performance and the associated cerebral
      activities, it will also control the presence of a peer observer in the procedure.

      There will thus be three experimental factors, one inter-subject factor (the experimental
      group, cocaine users or controls) and two intra-subject factors (cocaine associated or
      neutral cue; presence of a peer observer). The &quot;stop-signal&quot; task should induce increased
      activity of the STN that should be modulated by the cocaine-associated cues and by the
      presence of a peer.
