    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the extent to which the SMART NICU2HOMEapp, a
      mobile application designed for parents of premature infants to receive daily, real-time
      information about their infants and personalized education material based on parents'
      anticipated concerns and their infant's clinical status, is effective in:1) improving
      parents' competency in caring for their sick infants, 2) reducing stress, 3) supporting
      parents' social supports and 3) improving NICU outcomes (parent satisfaction, length of stay,
      readmission rates.)

      There will be two groups of participants based on when the infant is in the NICU.

      Parents of infants born from April -August 2018 (Group 1) Group 1 participants will receive
      usual care which includes 1) a welcome packet from the nursing staff, 2) access to their
      infant's medical team including doctors and nurse, 3) opportunities to ask any questions and
      understand the care their baby is receiving through participation in daily work rounds or
      through setting up family meetings with the medical team.

      At NICU admission, parents in Group 1 will be asked to complete a brief demographics form and
      several standardized surveys that measure stress and life experiences. Surveys will again be
      administered 7-10 days later, the day before discharge, two weeks after discharge and 30 days
      after discharge. These surveys will be available both via on paper or an email link.

      Parents of infants born from September 2018 - January 2019 (Group 2) At NICU admission,
      parents in Group 2 will be asked to complete a brief demographics form and several
      standardized surveys that measure stress and life experiences. Surveys will again be
      administered 7-10 days later, the day before discharge, two weeks after discharge and 30 days
      after discharge. These surveys will be available both via on paper or an email link.

      In addition to the usual care made available to Group 1 and described above, Group 2 parents
      will also be asked to download the SMART NICU2HOME app from a given website where they will
      enter MRN, DOB, name, gender, and due date of their infant into the smartphone app. In case
      there are difficulties downloading or using the app, the research team will be available to
      assist parents with any questions or concerns.

      Each participant (in both groups) will be asked to complete the surveys independently without
      sharing responses. If completed on paper, the research team will arrange either to pick the
      survey up at the NICU if the baby is still in the hospital, via a pre-paid stamped envelope
      provided, or over the phone. Online surveys will be automatically returned.

      Optional Interview:

      In addition to the intervention study, an optional qualitative interviews will be conducted
      with 25 families from group 2 for about 30-45 minutes. Patients will have the option to opt
      to participate in the interviews when consenting to the main study by signing their initials
      on the &quot;Optional Elements&quot; to be interviewed. Consenting to be interviewed also means that
      they have agreed to let us audio record the interview for research purposes. Of those who
      opted to be interviewed, only 25 families will be randomly selected to partake in the
      interviews.

      Using maximum variation sampling method, the interview will occur around 1-2 days prior to
      discharge (final thoughts, use patterns) with approximately 5 families per gestational age
      bracket: &lt;28 weeks; 28-&lt;30 weeks; 30-&lt;32 weeks; 32-&lt;34 weeks; 34-&lt;37 weeks. The interviews
      will be semi-structured, one-on-one phone on in-person interviews (option is the family's)
      designed to elicit feature feedback reasons for their level of usage. With consent, all
      interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes to improve
      further iterations. These audio recordings (either in voice or transcription) may be used in
      scholarly presentations or publications serve to help other professionals understand the
      research. No identifiers will be present when sharing the recordings to maintain anonymity,
      and recordings will be saved with a study ID number rather than name.

      NICU2HOME was created for parents of premature infants to meet their demands. The app will
      teach parents about their baby and the NICU. It will allow them to receive educational
      material every day that is specifically geared towards their baby's journey in the NICU. The
      app will also all parents to connect with their friends and family allowing them to privately
      and safely share and post among themselves.
