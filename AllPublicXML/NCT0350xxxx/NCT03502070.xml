  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the user interface of TOBI Podhaler by establishing
      that the product can support safe and effective use for the intended users

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to conduct a human factors validation study to demonstrate that the user
      interface of TOBI® Podhaler™ can support safe and effective use for the intended users. The
      human factors validation study will be conducted in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 6
      years and older under simulated yet representative of realistic use conditions where patients
      with no prior training or use of TOBI® Podhaler™ will be asked to inhale the contents of
      placebo capsules through the Podhaler device. Due to the use of placebo capsules, the study
      is considered an interventional clinical study and will be conducted accordingly. The study
      is an open label, un-blinded, non-randomized study which consists of one visit.
