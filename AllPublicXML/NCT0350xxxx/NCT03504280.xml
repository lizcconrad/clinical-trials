      A prospective, interventional study was conducted in Department of Rheumatology, BSMMU,
      Dhaka, Bangladesh from October 2015 to January 2017. One hundred and five clinically healthy
      adults of age 21-39 with serum vitamin D concentration were enrolled in the study. Serum
      vitamin D level was estimated by chemiluminescent micro particle immunoassay method at
      baseline and 3 months after the intervention. The participants were divided into three groups
      using random number table. Group A was given 6 lakh IU of cholecalciferol IM stat dose, group
      B was given 6 lakh IU of cholecalciferol orally with a glass of milk stat dose and group c
      was given 2 lakh IU of cholecalciferol orally once a month for 2 months followed by tablet
      cholecalciferol 1000 IU daily.
