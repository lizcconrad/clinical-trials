  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Getting a consultation with a psychiatrist within an appropriate time is one of the main
      issues reported by general practitioners (GP) for patients suffering from mental disorders in
      primary care. Consultation liaison in psychiatry is a system focused on general
      medicine-psychiatry collaboration. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of
      the consultation-liaison on the adequacy of the access time to a psychiatric consultation
      according to the degree of urgency evaluated by the GP.

      Faced with the saturation of the psychiatric care system, who recognizes the key role of the
      GP in mental health. Three-quarters of prescriptions for antidepressants and anxiolytics are
      performed by GPs, but less than one in four people with depression have been diagnosed and
      treated appropriately. The GPs describe difficulties in accessing psychiatric professionals
      and in particular to obtain a quick consultation with a psychiatrist. In different countries,
      psychiatric consultation-liaison (CL), centered on the collaboration of general medicine and
      psychiatry, have emerged. Two meta-analyzes and a Cochrane review were conducted on CL but no
      clinical trials were conducted in France. CL seems to improve patients' health at 3 months as
      well as their satisfaction and adherence to care. Results regarding the improvement of
      prescriptions from GP are encouraging. Better clinical trials are being requested and a need
      for medico-economic studies is also identified.

      In France, a psychiatry CL was born in Toulouse in 2017, the &quot;DSPP&quot;. The present study plans
      a 2 groups randomized clinical trial, one group of GPs having access to DSPP, the other not.
      For a period of 3 months, the GPs propose to any patient, for whom they want a psychiatric
      consultation, to participate in the study and address him/her to a psychiatrist. The DSPP is
      an evaluation center without long-term patient follow-up. Only patient referred by his/her GP
      can get into the DSPP.
