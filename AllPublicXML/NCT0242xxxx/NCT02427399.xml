  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine whether outreach to HIV-negative patients who are
      overdue for a Pap smear at a New England urban community health center can increase cervical
      cancer screening rates. It additionally seeks to determine which form of outreach - via
      letter, email, phone, or a mixture of those modalities- is most effective among these
      patients.

    <textblock>
      To the investigators' knowledge, this study will be the first to assess the efficacy of email
      in cervical cancer screening outreach in a randomized controlled trial. It will also be one
      of the few randomized controlled trials to directly compare different outreach media
      directly, as opposed to different variations within a single medium (e.g. two different types
      of letters). Lastly, given the unique patient demographic makeup at Fenway, including a
      significant number of lesbian, bisexual and transgender patients, secondary subanalyses have
      the potential to significantly add to the investigators' knowledge of what media work best in
      conducting cervical cancer screening outreach with sexual and gender minorities, who are
      disproportionately underscreened compared to heterosexual cis-gendered women.

    <description>This group will not be contacted by the study team in any way and will receive the general standard of care at Fenway. Patient charts are reviewed by the provider and medical team shortly before a scheduled visit to determine if the patient is due for a Pap, and if so, the patient is offered a Pap during the visit or the chance to schedule one for another date. Any proactive outreach occurs infrequently and at an ad-hoc basis, but should any proactive outreach occur, the study team will not interfere.</description>

    <description>The patients in this group will be mailed a letter at time 0. The letter will inform the patient that she is overdue for a Pap and will also contain an informational sheet about cervical cancer and Pap tests. If the patient does not contact Fenway within 1 month to schedule an appointment, an additional letter will be sent at 1 month, and similarly again at 2 months. These letters will be the same, except that letters two and three will mention that previous attempts have been made at contact. Based on best practices in the literature, the letters will be signed by the patient's primary care provider.</description>

The email will be sent from the provider's email account. The email will have an informational sheet attached or included in the body of the email. The emails will be sent through MyFenway, the secure, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant patient contact system at Fenway.</description>

As per HIPAA regulations, if the patient does not answer, a voicemail will be left saying that a Fenway representative has called and request that the patient calls back, but a reason will not be given. Some, but not all of the information contained in the info sheet will be provided during the call (see phone script). The script used is consistent with the scripts used currently for patient outreach. A voicemail will still count as one outreach attempt out of three. Patients will be contacted at time 0, 1, and 2 months as necessary for nonresponders.</description>

            <description>This group will not be contacted by the study team in any way and will receive the general standard of care at Fenway. Patient charts are reviewed by the provider and medical team shortly before a scheduled visit to determine if the patient is due for a Pap, and if so, the patient is offered a Pap during the visit or the chance to schedule one for another date. Any proactive outreach occurs infrequently and at an ad-hoc basis, but should any proactive outreach occur, the study team will not interfere.</description>

            <description>The patients in this group will be mailed a letter at time 0. The letter will inform the patient that she is overdue for a Pap and will also contain an informational sheet about cervical cancer and Pap tests. If the patient does not contact Fenway within 1 month to schedule an appointment, an additional letter will be sent at 1 month, and similarly again at 2 months. These letters will be the same, except that letters two and three will mention that previous attempts have been made at contact. Based on best practices in the literature, the letters will be signed by the patient’s primary care provider.

The email will be sent from the provider’s email account. The email will have an informational sheet attached or included in the body of the email. The emails will be sent through MyFenway, the secure, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant patient contact system at Fenway.

            <description>The patient will be telephoned and informed that they are due for a Pap, and given the opportunity to schedule an appointment over the phone immediately. As per HIPAA regulations, if the patient does not answer, a voicemail will be left saying that a Fenway representative has called and request that the patient calls back, but a reason will not be given. Some, but not all of the information contained in the info sheet will be provided during the call (see phone script). The script used is consistent with the scripts used currently for patient outreach. A voicemail will still count as one outreach attempt out of three. Patients will be contacted at time 0, 1, and 2 months as necessary for nonresponders.
Phone: The patient will be telephoned and informed that they are due for a Pap, and given the opportunity to schedule an appointment over the phone immediately. Patients will be contacted at time 0, 1, and 2 months as necessary for nonresponders.</description>

As per HIPAA regulations, if the patient does not answer, a voicemail will be left saying that a Fenway representative has called and request that the patient calls back, but a reason will not be given. Some, but not all of the information contained in the info sheet will be provided during the call (see phone script). The script used is consistent with the scripts used currently for patient outreach. A voicemail will still count as one outreach attempt out of three.
