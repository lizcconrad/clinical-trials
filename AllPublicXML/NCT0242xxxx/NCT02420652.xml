    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well metformin hydrochloride and aspirin work in
      treating patients with hormone-dependent prostate cancer that has progressed after surgery or
      radiation therapy. Metformin hydrochloride and aspirin may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving
      metformin hydrochloride and aspirin together can slow the growth of prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of metformin (metformin hydrochloride) and aspirin on the change
      in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in men with rising PSA after definitive
      therapy for localized prostate cancer and stable disease during a run-in period with the
      study regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of administering metformin and aspirin.

      II. To determine the effect of metformin and aspirin on PSA levels and the serum
      obesity-related prostate cancer (PCa) biomarkers (insulin, insulin-like growth factor
      [IGF]-1, interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha).

      OUTLINE:

      RUN-IN STAGE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and
      aspirin PO once daily (QD) for 4 months. Patients with disease progression (PSA increase of &gt;
      50% and minimum of 2ng/ml rise in PSA) come off study. Patients achieving disease response
      (&gt;25% decline in PSA) continue to receive study agents in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable disease. Patients with stable disease continue on to the randomized study
      regimen.

      RANDOMIZATION STAGE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride PO BID and aspirin PO QD for 6 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride placebo PO BID and aspirin placebo PO QD for
      6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12-16 weeks for 1 year.
