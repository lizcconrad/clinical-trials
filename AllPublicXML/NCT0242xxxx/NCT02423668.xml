      To study the effective lens position concept in second eye refinement (SER) cataract surgery,
      by relating inter-ocular symmetry of pseudophakic anterior chamber depth (pACD) measured in
      Pentacam and SER refractive outcomes.

    <textblock>
      A retrospective chart review was conducted, including demographics (age and gender) and
      several parameters for both the first and second eyes, including the intra-ocular lens power
      calculation using the HofferQ, SRK/T and Holladay 1 formulas. Pentacam HR was used for
      pseudophakic anterior chamber depth measurement, and manual measurement was performed by a
      single investigator tracing a line between the anterior surface of the intra-ocular lens and
      the central corneal epithelium apex. Second eye refinement in the intra-ocular lens power
      selection for the second eye was performed using a theoretical 50% partial adjustment of the
      prediction error of the first eye. To relate refractive outcomes to pACD values, the
      investigators performed subgroup analysis based in consecutive 50µm increments in
      inter-ocular asymmetry of pACD (50-600).

    <description>The prediction error for the first (PE1) and second (PE2) eyes was calculated as the difference between the observed post-operative refraction in spherical equivalent and the predicted post-operative refraction by the IOL Master for the implanted intra-ocular lens. This was obtained for the 3 formulae. Second eye refinement in the intra-ocular lens power selection for the second eye was performed using a theoretical 50% partial adjustment of the PE1. To relate refractive outcomes to pACD values, we performed subgroup analysis based in consecutive 50µm increments in inter-ocular asymmetry of pACD (50-600).</description>
