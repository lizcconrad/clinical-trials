      This is to prospectively investigate whether the chemopreventive agent, MCS, may favorably
      alter biomarker expression, whether serum carotenoids levels are associated with biomarkers
      levels, and whether the alterations of biomarker expression may reflect the cancer risk as
      shown by cancer incidence at the end of the clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many epidemiological studies have shown that nutrients or elements from tomato or other
      plants, including lycopene and multi-carotenoids, may reduce the risk of prostate cancer,
      especially those of lethal cancer. Studies have also shown that multi-carotenoids may reduce
      serum PSA levels in prostate cancer patients. MCS is a patented, multi-carotenoids-rich,
      purely botanic agent. The investigators' previous Phase II and III clinical trials (US FDA
      and TFDA, 600 subjects, studies finished, data in analysis) have shown that there were no
      MCS-related serious adverse events (SAE). MCS may relieve urinary symptoms in men with BPH
      and PSA was reduced in men with elevated PSA. So, the investigators are initiating a large
      multi-center phase II randomized study (MCS-8, N=702) in Taiwan, to study if MCS can reduce
      the risk of prostate cancer. High risk patients will be assigned to take oral daily 30, 15,
      and 0 (placebo) mg of MCS (1:1:1). The investigators will compare the cumulative prostate
      cancer incidence among groups and the change from baseline in serum carotenoids levels.
