  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamic effect of a single dose of MLN1202 in healthy Japanese male adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, phase 1 study in healthy Japanese and Caucasian male adults.

      Japanese subjects will be assigned to Cohort J1 (at a dose of 75 mg), Cohort J2 (105 mg),
      Cohort J3 (150 mg), or Cohort J4 (450 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      manner, while Caucasian subjects to Cohort C1 (at a dose of 75 mg) or Cohort C2 (150 mg) in
      an open-label manner.

      Takeda has made a business decision to terminate this study due to portfolio
      re-prioritization. There were no safety or efficacy concerns.
