      This study aims to understand how war trauma affects children's and adolescents' memory
      functions and mental health, and whether Narrative Exposure Therapy is effective in enhancing
      optimal memory functions and alleviating mental health problems. The study analyzes the
      mental health and cognitive and emotional healing mechanisms of therapeutic intervention
      among war-affected children and adolescents.
