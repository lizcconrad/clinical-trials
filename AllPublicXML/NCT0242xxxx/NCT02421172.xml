    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study in patients with moderate to severe
      chronic hidradenitis suppurativa in parallel groups, to determine the efficacy and safety of
      multiple doses of CJM112 in comparison to placebo. The study has two periods to explore
      preliminary dose effects.

             medication.

          6. Evidence of active tuberculosis at screening

          7. History of severe systemic Candida infections or evidence of Candidiasis in the last
             two weeks

          8. Active systemic or skin infections (other than common cold or HS related) during the
             two weeks before randomization/first treatment

          9. Any live vaccines (including nasal spray flu vaccine) starting from 6 weeks before
             randomization.
