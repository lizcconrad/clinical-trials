    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identification of genetic markers and predictors of
      antidepressant-induced suicidality in youth depression. Participants who take the
      standardized pharmacotherapy (bupropion or lamotrigine) for depression will be observed for 8
      weeks. They will do several scales and genetic tests at visit 1 (week 0), visit 3 (week 4)
      and visit 4 (week 8)

    <description>A composite measure consisting of Young Mania Rating Scale(YMRS). The YMRS is an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of mania in children and adolescents ages 5-17.The YMRS has been used in clinical practice since 1978. Ratings are based on child/adolescent self-reporting and clinician observation. This instrument does not assess depressed mood.</description>

    <description>The P-GBI is adapted from the General Behavior Inventory, and allows parents to rate depressive, hypomanic, manic, and alternating mood symptoms in their children and adolescents ages 5-17.</description>
