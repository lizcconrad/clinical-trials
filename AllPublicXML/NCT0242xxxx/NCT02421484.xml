  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open label dose escalation trial of human allogeneic bone marrow derived
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the treatment of septic shock. The main purpose of the
      study is to assess the safety of MSCs in patients with septic shock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is one of the most common and devastating health problems in the intensive care
      unit, with a mortality rate of approximately 40% and a staggering economic burden of
      approximately 4 billion dollars annually in Canada. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may
      provide a promising new treatment avenue, as pre-clinical research has shown that these cells
      can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to sepsis and greatly
      reduce rates of organ failure and death. This dramatic effect appears to be due to the
      ability of MSCs to modify the inflammatory cascade, augment tissue repair and enhance
      pathogen clearance. MSCs have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials including those
      with myocardial infarction, heart failure, neurological and metabolic disorders,
      hematological malignancies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no serious safety
      concerns. However, MSC therapy has not yet been evaluated in humans with septic shock. Prior
      to a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of MSCs in septic shock, an
      evaluation of safety is necessary. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial
      is an open label Phase I dose escalation trial that will evaluate the safety of MSC therapy
      in this vulnerable population.

    <description>This is a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial that constitutes 3 dose cohorts with 3 participants per cohort who will receive intravenous doses of allogeneic bone marrow derived allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells--0.3 million cells/kg, 1.0 million cells/kg, and 3.0 million cells/kg. We will proceed from the lower dose to the next higher dose if there are no safety concerns for each cohort.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A participant must meet all 5 inclusion criteria to be eligible:

          1. Admission to the Ottawa Hospital Intensive Care Unit

          2. Receipt of appropriate broad spectrum antibiotics for the suspected/confirmed
             infectious source and adequate source control according to the opinion of the treating
             critical care physician

          3. Within 24 hours of admission to the ICU, receipt of reasonable levels of fluid
             administration and resuscitation as indicated by:

               -  a central venous pressure of at least 8 mm Hg AND

               -  a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70%.

          4. Cardiovascular failure that is present within the first 24 hours of admission to the
             ICU and that is present for at least 4 consecutive hours AND

          5. Deterioration or lack of improvement in at least 1 additional organ function, or organ
             hypoperfusion, as defined by the modified Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS).
             Criteria for organ dysfunction or organ hypoperfusion must be met within the first 24
             hours of ICU admission

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Another form of shock (cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive) that is considered by
             the treating critical care physician as the dominant cause of shock

          2. History of known pulmonary hypertension with a WHO functional class of III or IV

          3. History of severe pulmonary disease requiring home oxygen

          4. History of severe cardiac disease with a New York Heart Association Functional Class
             of III or IV, or severe ischemic heart disease with a Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             angina class score of III or IV

          5. History of severe liver disease (Child class C)

          6. Malignancy in the previous 2 years (excluding resolved non-melanoma skin cancer).

          7. Chronic immune suppression

          8. History of anaphylaxis
