  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out to see if a new drug called Apatorsen in combination with
      standard gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy is effective in treating squamous cell lung
      cancer.

      This study is part of a research project for collecting information about the effectiveness
      and safety of Apatorsen when used with gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy. The main purpose
      of this study is to see if Apatorsen, when combined with gemcitabine/carboplatin, is an
      effective treatment for squamous cell lung cancer.

      Recent research has found that a protein called Hsp27 can help cancer cells protect
      themselves against the effects of cancer treatments. Hsp27 is only found in some lung cancers
      but when it is present, cancer drugs might not work as well as they would without Hsp27 being
      present. Blocking the action of Hsp27 or removing Hsp27 from cancer cells with Apatorsen may
      slow down or stop the cancer growing. This study will therefore look at the relationship
      between the Hsp27 levels in tumour and blood and the effect of the treatment.

      The development of Apatorsen is intended to provide a new treatment option for patients with
      cancer. Apatorsen may also make the cancer more sensitive to gemcitabine and carboplatin and
      so make this chemotherapy treatment more effective.

      This is an open-label, multicentre, 2-arm randomised phase II trial of
      gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen (OGX-427) versus gemcitabine/carboplatin alone in
      patients with previously untreated advanced squamous cell lung cancers. Patients will be
      randomised (1:1) to one of the two treatment arms:

        -  Gemcitabine/carboplatin

        -  Gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen (OGX-427)

      Randomisation will be stratified by the following criteria:

        -  Stage (IIIB versus IV versus recurrent disease)

        -  Performance status (0 or 1 versus 2)

      Gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy will be continued for 4-6 cycles unless there is
      evidence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or if the patient requests that study
      treatment be discontinued or to be withdrawn from the study. If chemotherapy is discontinued
      prior to disease progression, patients in the combination arm should be continued on
      Apatorsen (OGX-427) single agent therapy until disease progression unless there is evidence
      of unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent or termination of the study,
      whichever occurs first. All patients will be followed for disease progression. Tumour
      evaluations will be performed before the initiation of treatment and every 6 weeks during and
      after completion of chemotherapy. Once disease progression is documented, patients will enter
      a Survival Follow-up Period during which data will be collected every two months regarding
      further cancer therapy, secondary malignancy and survival status. The study will also assess
      the relationship between the anticipated anti-tumour activity of the treatment regimen and
      biological characteristics of patients' tumours at baseline.

    <description>Apatorsen (OGX-427) will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours.
Apatorsen (OGX-427) treatment will begin with a loading dose period prior to the initiation of chemotherapy. Patients will receive three loading doses of 400 mg within a 9-day period with at least 48 hours between infusions and between the last loading dose infusion and Day 1 of initiating chemotherapy. Chemotherapy must be initiated within 7 calendar days once the last loading dose infusion has been completed.
Following the loading dose period, Apatorsen (OGX-427) will be given weekly at a dose of 400 mg by 2 hour intravenous infusions. On days when both chemotherapy and Apatorsen (OGX-427) are given, Apatorsen (OGX-427) should be given first followed by chemotherapy.</description>
