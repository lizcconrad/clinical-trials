      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      outpatient study evaluating the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in subjects 6 to 12 years
      of age with ADHD using 2 doses of dasotraline (2 mg/day and 4 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6
      week treatment period. The study will consist of screening, treatment, and end of study

             ADHD, as judged by the investigator.

             as tumors, inflammation, seizure disorder, vascular disorder, potential CNS related
             disorders that might occur in childhood (eg, Duchenne Muscular dystrophy, myasthenia
             gravis, or other neurologic or serious neuromuscular disorders), or history of
             persistent neurological symptoms attributable to serious head injury. Past history of
             febrile seizure, drug-induced seizure, or alcohol withdrawal seizure is exclusionary.
             Subject taking anticonvulsants for seizure control currently or within the past 2

             some intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with
             specific plan and intent) for any lifetime history on the C SSRS Children's

             difficulty for collecting blood samples.

          -  Subject has a history of severe allergies to more than 1 class of medications or
             multiple adverse drug reactions or has a history of allergic reaction or has a known

             monoamine oxidase [MAO] inhibitor, tricyclic, etc) must have a minimum washout of 7
             days prior to Day 1.

          -  Subject is currently undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the treatment
             of ADHD, has initiated behavioral therapy (including school based interventions) less

             of the investigator will not be able to follow a stable routine for the duration of
             the study.

          -  Subject or subject's family anticipates a move outside the geographic range of
             investigative site during the study period, or plans extended travel inconsistent with

             screen (UDS) or breath alcohol test at screening. Note: Subjects with a positive UDS
             may be allowed to continue in the study, provided that the investigator determines
             that the positive test is as a result of taking prescription medicine(s) as
             prescribed.

          -  Subject requires treatment with any disallowed medications during the study.

          -  Subject has experienced significant blood loss within 60 days prior to screening.

          -  Subject has previously been enrolled in a clinical trial of dasotraline (SEP 225289).
