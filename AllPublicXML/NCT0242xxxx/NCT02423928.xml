  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 patients with invasive castration resistant prostate cancer and radiologically verified
      metastases will be enrolled into the Phase I Clinical Trial. The trial is a dendritic cell
      based immunotherapy. Autologous dendritic cells will be obtained by leukapheresis and
      elutriation and stimulation by cytokines. The induced dendritic cells will have to pass
      viability, immunophenotyping and sterility criteria and will be injected into a cryoablated
      region of the primary prostate cancer tumor. The treatment is supplemented by
      immunomodulatory regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study treatment dendritic cells (ACT2001) will be injected into the prostate following
      prostatic cryoablation. It is speculated that antigen from the cryoablated cancer will be
      available in the vicinity of the cryoablation field immediately following the procedure.
      Autologous, immature dendritic cells are capable of internalizing antigen, migrating to the
      lymphatic system, and presenting antigenic epitopes to T lymphocytes. In this way, dendritic
      cells are capable of initiating a cell-mediated systemic immune response.

      In concept, the cancer itself should provide a specific and potentially broad spectrum of
      cancer-related antigens. Regulatory T lymphocytes, which have been implicated in dampening or
      halting cell-mediated, antigen-specific immune responses, will be selectively depleted using
      a regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide. Low-dose cyclophosphamide has been empirically shown
      to selectively deplete the number of circulating regulatory T cells. The second half of
      patients will in addition receive treatment with the the immune checkpoint inhibitor
      ipilimumab antibody as one additional measure to avoid cancer cell immune evasion.

      Using this combination of therapies, it is thought that a clinically significant anti-cancer
      immune response might be elicited.
