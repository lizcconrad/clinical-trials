    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study (the second phase in testing a new drug or combination to see how
      effect the drug or combination is) of investigational drugs GSK2256098 and Trametinib.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the antitumor activity of GSK2256098 and Trametinib
      in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trametinib is a drug that works by binding to and blocking certain proteins called
      mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 from working. MEK1 and MEK2 are
      important proteins that contribute to the growth of cancer cells.

      GSK2256098 is a drug that blocks a protein called focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK) which is an
      important protein that contribute to the growth of cancer cells.
