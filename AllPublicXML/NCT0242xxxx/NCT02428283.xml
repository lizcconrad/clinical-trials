  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation is a common problem in children during recovery from sevoflurane
      anesthesia. Pain is considered as a cause of postoperative emergence agitation and
      compounding factor of agitation assessment in children. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the effect of scalp nerve block on the emergence agitation in children undergoing
      nevus surgery during sevoflurane anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-four children, 1-7 years old, undergoing nevus surgery on head were enrolled.
      Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium and rocuronium, and maintained with
      sevoflurane. Patients were randomly assigned two groups: the control group received IV
      remifentanil 1 μg/kg, and the block group received scalp nerve block with 0.25% ropivacaine
      2-3 ml. Time to tracheal extubation, recovery time, hemodynamic change, FLACC score, and
      Watcha behavior scale for emergence agitation were assessed.
