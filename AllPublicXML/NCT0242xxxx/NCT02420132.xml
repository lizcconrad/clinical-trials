  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate home vision testing using a mobile medical application in
      participants with diabetic macular edema (DME) or neovascular age-related macula degeneration
      (nAMD) who receive intravitreal ranibizumab therapy. In the main, decentralized study,
      participants will be recruited via digital media, advocacy groups, or through their own
      ophthalmologist. The traditional substudy will evaluate the association between visual acuity
      and anatomical markers of disease status determined using clinical &quot;gold standard&quot;
      assessments (certified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] protocol visual
      acuity and macula optical coherence tomography [OCT]) and the results of home vision testing
      using the myVisionTrack^TM (mVT) application.
