      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate disease control rate (DCR) of S-1 in combination with gemcitabine in patients
      with advanced biliary tract cancer

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate overall response rate (ORR)

        -  To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  To evaluate overall survival (OS)

        -  To assess the safety profile
