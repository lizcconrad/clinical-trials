    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single dose (200 mg), open-label, sequential group study comparing the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic
      impairment to matched, non-hepatically impaired subjects. There will be approximately 36
      total subjects, adult males and females, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive. The study will be
      conducted at 1 VTEU site, study duration is approximately 15 months, and subject
      participation duration is approximately 5 weeks (including screening). Primary objective: To
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of PA-824 in subjects with mild,
      moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (as assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to
      matched non-hepatically impaired subjects. Secondary objective: To evaluate the safety of a
      single oral dose of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (as
      assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to matched non-hepatically impaired subjects.

      This is a Phase 1, single dose (200 mg), open-label, sequential group study comparing the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic
      impairment to matched, non-hepatically impaired subjects. This study will enroll
      approximately 6 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), approximately 6
      subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), approximately 6 subjects with
      severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), and approximately 18 matched non-hepatically
      impaired subjects. Non-hepatically impaired subjects in the control group will be matched to
      subjects with hepatic impairment based on age (+/- 10 years) and body weight (+/- 20%) as
      measured at screening (Visit 00A). There will be approximately 36 total subjects, adult males
      and females, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive. The study will be conducted at 1 VTEU site,
      study duration is approximately 15 months, and subject participation duration is
      approximately 5 weeks (including screening). Primary objective: To evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of PA-824 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe
      hepatic impairment (as assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to matched non-hepatically
