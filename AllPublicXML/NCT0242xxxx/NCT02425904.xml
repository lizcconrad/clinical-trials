  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called clofarabine as a possible treatment for
      Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis( LCH )
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of an investigational intervention, to learn whether the drug works in treating
      a specific disease, in this case, clofarabine to treat LCH.

      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is still being studied. It also means that the
      FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved clofarabine for your
      disease.

      Clofarabine is a chemotherapy drug that has been used and is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of leukemia in children and adults. Information from other research studies
      suggests that this drug may also be effective in participants with LCH.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior diagnosis of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis established by standard diagnostic
             criteria and confirmed histologically

          -  Evidence of disease reactivation or progression after standard treatment against LCH
             (histological confirmation is not required)

          -  Performance Score &gt; 70% (use Lansky score for age &lt; 16 and Karnofsky score for age =
             &gt;16).

          -  Patients of all ages will be eligible.

          -  Provide signed written informed consent.

          -  Patients have failed first line treatment with prednisone and vinblastine. There is no
             limitation of amount or the type of prior therapy or drugs.

          -  Patients with clinical evidence of involvement of hematopoietic system, liver or
             spleen, have failed salvage treatment with cladribine/cytarabine or are not considered
             to be eligible for such treatment.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 14 days prior to enrollment. Male and female patients must use an effective
             contraceptive method during the study and for a minimum of 6 months after study
             treatment.

          -  Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of
             the study, and able to provide valid informed consent.

          -  Participants must have adequate marrow functions as defined below, except those with
             involvement of hematopoietic system for whom these criteria can be waived:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750/µL

               -  Platelets ≥75,000/µL

          -  Participants must have adequate organ functions as defined below:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5x institutional upper limit of normal

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal unless it is
                  related to involvement by LCH

               -  Adequate renal function defined as:

                    -  A serum creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit of normal or

                    -  Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents targeting LCH.

          -  Use of alternative medications (e.g., herbal or botanical that could interfere with
             clofarabine) is not permitted during the entire study period.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because clofarabine has potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             of adverse events in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with clofarabine.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Patients with a history of prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT),
             elevated conjugated serum bilirubin at study entry, uncontrolled systemic fungal,
             bacterial, or other infection, a history of hepatitis B or C infection or a history of
             cirrhosis.

          -  Individuals who are known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy.
