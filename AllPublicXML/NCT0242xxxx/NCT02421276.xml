  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about Down syndrome. The investigators think there is a
      different level of the AIRE gene in individuals with Down syndrome. The investigators think
      that the AIRE gene level can provide more insight about depressed immune cell function in
      individuals with Down syndrome. Patients are being asked to be in this research study because
      the investigators want to see if their blood contains more of less of the AIRE gene.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality among live-born infants.
      Through full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21, DS is associated with cognitive impairment,
      congenital malformations (particularly cardiovascular), and dysmorphic features. In addition,
      immunological abnormalities are much more prevalent in individuals with DS. For example, DS
      is associated with increased susceptibility to infection, as revealed in 2009 during the
      influenza pandemic where the likelihood of death was 300 times greater for DS patients than
      the general population. DS patients have increased frequencies of autoimmune disorders and
      leukemias, yet curiously, have a decreased risk for allergic diseases, particularly asthma.
      Perhaps the most telling statistic for immunologic abnormality in DS patients is that
      respiratory tract infections are the most important cause of mortality in DS at all ages.Our
      studies have identified AIRE as a master control gene that is aberrantly decreased in persons
      with DS, leading to autoimmunity and immunologic abnormalities. AIRE (&quot;autoimmune
      regulator&quot;), although encoded on chromosome 21, is also significantly reduced in expression
      in DS, where it may contribute to autoimmune and immune dysregulation. The investigators will
      test the hypothesis that immune dysfunction and autoimmune disease preferentially occur in DS
      as a consequence of deficient expression of AIRE in peripheral blood cells.
