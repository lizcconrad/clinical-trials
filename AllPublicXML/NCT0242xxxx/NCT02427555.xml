  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to investigate gut microflora composition in relation to
      cardiometabolic risk markers, and to investigate the effects of 3 days intervention with a
      barley kernel based product on these variables.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      100 subjects were invited to deliver faecal samples. From this cohort 40 subjects were chosen
      based on their gut microflora composition to participate in the Barley intervention.
