      The purpose of this Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to complete
      development and evaluate usability and effectiveness of the Wraparound Team Monitoring System
      (Wrap-TMS), a web-based, electronic behavioral health information system (EBHIS) for the most
      widely implemented care coordination model in children's behavioral health, the wraparound
      process. Though wraparound is now considered &quot;evidence-based,&quot; implementation in the real
      world often fails to conform to standards of fidelity and/or use objective data to guide
      management, supervision, and clinical decision making. Availability of such a system will
      support efficiency, implementation quality and fidelity, and outcomes for youths enrolled in
      wraparound. Wrap-TMS features functionality for data entry, management, and basic reporting
      for the full array of data and information elements needed to manage an integrated care
      coordination initiative for youths with serious emotional and behavioral disorder (SEBD). In
      light of our success in Phase I, subsequent partnerships with federal agencies, and inquiries
      of interest from several states and over 20 provider and managed care organizations, in this
      Phase II STTR the investigators will complete development of Wrap-TMS, followed by a
      randomized controlled effectiveness study comparing n=25 wraparound facilitators who use
      Wrap-TMS serving n=100 families to 25 non-user facilitators serving 100 families on
      practitioner, implementation, and youth/family outcomes. The evaluation will test two primary
      hypotheses:

        1. Compared to facilitators in the control group, wraparound facilitators trained to use
           Wrap-TMS will demonstrate (a) greater use of data and feedback in service delivery; (b)
           greater fidelity to the wraparound process; (c) higher self-reported teamwork, working
           alliance, and satisfaction with the intervention; and (d) more positive attitudes toward
           standardized assessment.

        2. Compared to the control group, parents of youths receiving services from facilitators
           trained to use TMS will report (a) greater goal clarity, (b) more data collection and
           use (c) greater satisfaction with services and progress, (d) better fidelity to
           wraparound, (e) more effective team functioning, (f) greater treatment alliance, and (f)
           better youth outcomes including greater progress and improved symptoms and functioning.

    <measure>parent and provider satisfaction (Parent and Child Satisfaction Scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parent and Child Satisfaction Scales reliably measure five dimensions of satisfaction, each with 1 Likert scale item, including: (1) access and convenience, (2) child's treatment process and relationship with providers, (3) parent and family services, satisfaction with progress, and (5) global satisfaction. Assessed at 4 mos post enrollment</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudes toward Standardized Assessment Scale (ASA)105. A 22-item measure of clinician perceptions and attitudes about using standardized assessments in their clinical practice. Items are scored on a 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) scale and yield 3 subscales with adequate or better reliabilities: Benefit over Clinical Judgment, Psychometric Quality, and Practicality. Administered to practitioners at baseline and 4 mos.</description>
