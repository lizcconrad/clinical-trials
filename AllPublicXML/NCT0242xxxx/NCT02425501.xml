      The objectives of this study are to investigate the safety and effectiveness of EYLEA

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, multi center post-authorization safety study that
      includes patients with a diagnosis of myopic choroidal neovascularization. The investigator
      will have made the choice of treatment (EYLEA) as well as the decision to use EYLEA according
      the Japanese Package Insert prior to enrolling the patient in this study.

      The observation period for each patient starts when therapy with EYLEA is initiated. The
      enrollment period is 2 years. Patients will be followed for a time period of 2 years or until
      it is no longer possible (e.g. lost to follow-up) within the 2 years. In total, 600 patients
      will be recruited.

      For each patient, data are collected as defined in the electronic case report form (eCRF) at
      the initial visit, follow-up visits and final visit, either by routine clinical visits (as
      per investigators routine practice).

        Female and male patients with DME diagnosis will be enrolled after the investigators have
        taken the decision for the treatment with EYLEA. Those patients who have had EYLEA
        prescribed previously will not be included in this study. Physicians should consult the
        full prescribing information for EYLEA before enrolling patients and be familiarized with
        the safety information in the product package label.
