  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the rate of recurrence of headache following a
      first blood patch where patients will be positioned in the prone position for an hour after
      each blood patch needed during this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

      A. To evaluate the number of blood patches needed for each patient during her hospital stay
      B. Assessing the intensity of all headaches every 24H C. Evaluate the complications occurring
      during the hospital stay.

    <description>The study population consists of adult women requiring an epidural blood patch for the treatment of post-dural puncture headache following vaginal delivery. Women who delivered by cesarean section are not included due to the discomfort of the prone position while there is an abdominal scar.
