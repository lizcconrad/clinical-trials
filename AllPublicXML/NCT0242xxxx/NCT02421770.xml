  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disease characterized by
      outbreaks or flares. It affects 0.2-1.9% of the population. Although the etiology is unknown,
      the pathogenesis of OLP is known to involve an immune disorder, with epithelial damage caused
      by cytotoxic CD8 + lymphocytes. Clinically, the disease is characterized by different types
      of lesions - papular, reticular and in the form of plaques - that can alternate with erosive
      and/or ulcerative areas. A variety of treatments have been proposed for OLP: topical or
      systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, retinoids, azathioprine, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus,
      photochemotherapy and surgery. Patients with symptomatic OLP often require intensive therapy
      to reduce the signs and symptoms. The disease can produce considerable morbidity and alter
      patient quality of life, particularly in the presence of ulcerative lesions.

      There is no fully resolutive and effective treatment - the management strategy focusing on
      the use of drugs that counter tissue inflammation and the underlying immunological
      mechanisms. The main inconvenience of these treatments is represented by the side effects
      they usually produce.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate that if Chamaemelum Nobile a can be used in the
      treatment of oral lichen planus. This could be useful as Chamaemelum Nobile has no reported
      side effects and hence it can used in place of steroids which are commonly used for this
      condition and have many reported adverse effects.
