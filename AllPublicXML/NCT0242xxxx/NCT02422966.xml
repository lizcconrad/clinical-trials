  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of paracetamol in comparison to
      ibuprofen in the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although patency of the ductus arteriosus is essential for fetal circulation, the postnatal
      ductal closure is critical for postnatal circulatory adaptation. In premature infants the
      circulating prostaglandin levels are higher than at term, and respiratory difficulties may
      lead to a state of hypoxia, which contribute to the failure of the ductus closure. Recently,
      an incidental finding in one preterm infant led to look at paracetamol, one of the most
      common drugs available, as an alternative therapeutic approach to ductal closure. If
      paracetamol is proven to be effective, it could become the treatment of choice for the
      management of PDA, mainly due to its more favorable safety profile.

      Although the recent results available in the literature demonstrates an highly success rate
      in ductal closure with paracetamol, all case studies are not powered to show efficacy of
      paracetamol for PDA closure. Further prospective randomized-controlled trials are needed to
      evaluate the efficacy of paracetamol versus ibuprofen for the closure of PDA.

      If paracetamol is indeed proven to be effective, it could become the treatment of choice for
      the management of PDA, mainly due to its more favorable side effect profile. In order to test
      this hypothesis, a randomized, open label, parallel groups, comparator controlled,
      multicentre, prospective study is proposed.

             which the closing flow pattern suggests a restrictive PDA.

          5. Willingness of the parents/legally authorized representative/child to sign the Consent
             Informed Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             ultrasound when the presence of a right-to-left shunt through the foramen ovale or
             ductus arteriosus is demonstrated, or when the estimated pulmonary pressure, in terms
             of the tricuspid regurgitation jet, is greater than two-thirds of the systemic
             arterial pressure.

          7. Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH).

          8. Urine output &lt;1 ml/kg of body weight/h during a 24 h collection period or urine output
             &lt;0.5 ml/kg of body weight/h in case it is measured at 24 hours of life of newborn.

          9. Serum creatinine concentration &gt; 1.5 mg/dl (132 μmol/l).

         10. Platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3.

             considered [Rosenthal, 1997]:

               -  ALT/Glutamate-pyruvate transaminase: 6-50 U/L

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase/GOT: 35-140 U/L

         13. Medical need of administering other Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug (NSAID)
             different from ibuprofen.
