  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the incremental area under the curve from 0 to 24h
      (iAUC0-24h) of plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids (sum of total and free eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) after ingestion of an emulsified product and a
      non-emulsified reference control of free flowing cod liver oil at the lowest appropriate dose
      that is practically acceptable, and as near as possible to the test products' recommended
      daily dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many dietary lipids are in the form of triglycerides, ethyl esters or phospholipids. During
      digestion these lipids are subject to hydrolysis, in particular by pancreatic triglyceride
      lipase. To facilitate the action of the enzyme, lipids are emulsified by the action of bile
      salts. By increasing the surface area of the fat globules, emulsification increases access to
      the lipids by pancreatic triglyceride lipase. This study is designed to compare iAUC0-24h of
      plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids (sum of total and free EPA and DHA) after ingestion of an
      emulsified product and a non-emulsified reference control of free flowing cod liver oil at
      the lowest appropriate dose that is practically acceptable, and as near as possible to the
      test products' recommended daily dose.

    <description>Each participant will be administered a single dose of test emulsion [30 millilitre (mL)] or reference control (5.8 mL), each followed by 300 mL apple juice. Blood samples will be taken at time points 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 and 24h. Area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) will be calculated using the trapezoidal method. AUC will be divided by total duration to represent a weighted mean incremental change over time.</description>
