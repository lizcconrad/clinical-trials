    <textblock>
      To estimate annualized total cost rates (i.e. direct medical costs from hospitalizations,
      consultations, medications, and tests) of adequately controlling a patient (i.e. INR between
      2-3 and TTR≥ 60%) diagnosed with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) or venous
      thromboembolism (VTE), and treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in Spain.

    <description>Per patient cost: direct medical costs from hospitalizations, consultations, medications, and tests; Coagulation control status: adequately controlled patients defined by INR between 2-3 and TTR≥ 60%</description>

    <measure>Demographic and clinical characteristics for all patients diagnosed with NVAF or VTE treated with VKA and according to coagulation control status based on electronic clinical records</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Variables measured: age, gender, employment status, smoking status, BMI, major co-morbidities (including CHARLSON index), CHA2DS2-VASc score, presence and frequency of INR measurement, and INR therapeutic range.</description>

    <measure>Healthcare resource rates for all patients diagnosed with NVAF or VTE treated with VKA and according to coagulation control status based on electronic clinical records</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Healthcare resources used (i.e. hospitalizations, consultations, medication, and tests) by patients will be measured according to coagulation control status. For each healthcare resource the number and percentage of patients using it and the mean, SD, median min, max and valid n will be reported; as well as the number of times that each patient uses the resource.</description>
