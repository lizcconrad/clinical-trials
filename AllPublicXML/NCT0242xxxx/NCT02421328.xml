  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized crossover study to recognize the effects of nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus heated humidified high flow nasal cannula
      (HHHFNC) on diaphragmatic dimensions and excursion (evaluated by ultrasonography) in preterm
      infants.

    <textblock>
      Preterm infants will be recruited consecutively from NICU of Mansoura University Children's
      Hospital. They will be randomized in two groups; one group will start on nasal CPAP (Fisher &amp;
      Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Z ealand) (Pressure 5 cmH2O) for 60 minutes and then will be
      switched to HHHFNC (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Z ealand) (flow of 4 l/m) for
      another 60 minutes. The other group will start on HHHFNC and then switched to nasal CPAP.

      After the 2 h study period (2×60 minutes epochs) further respiratory support will be at the
      discretion of the clinical team.

      Ultrasonographic assessment of diaphragmatic dimensions and excursion will be analyzed in
      different respiratory cycles and the average of 3 cycles will be calculated at the end of the
      60 minutes periods on nasal CPAP and HHHFNC.

    <description>Ultrasonographic assessment of (inspiratory diaphragmatic thickness, expiratory diaphragmatic thickness and delta diaphragmatic thickness will be assessed at the end of each 60 minutes epoch on nasal CPAP. Diaphragm thickness will be measured as the perpendicular distance between the pleural and peritoneal reflections. All measurements will be performed during quiet breathing. Several respiratory cycles will be recorded, and measurements will be averaged from at least three different cycles.</description>

    <description>Ultrasonographic assessment of right and left diaphragmatic excursion will be assessed at the end of each 60 minutes epoch on nasal CPAP. The displacements of the liver and spleen will be monitored in real-time. Using M-mode ultrasonography, with the probe fixed on the chest wall during respiration, ultrasonographic image of will be frozen and a mark for measurement will be placed on the image at the location of the most caudal margin of the liver or spleen at the end of expiration, and a second mark will be placed on the new location of the most caudal margin of the liver or spleen at the end of inspiration. The distance between the two marks will be then measured and defined as the displacement of the liver or the spleen (right or left diaphragmatic excursion). Several respiratory cycles will be recorded, and measurements will be averaged from at least three different cycles.</description>
