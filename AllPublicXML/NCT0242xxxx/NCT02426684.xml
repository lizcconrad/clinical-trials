  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IdeS® is an IgG-degrading enzyme of S.pyogenes that cleaves all four human subclasses of IgG
      with strict specificity. Alloantibodies are a major deterrent to access to and success of
      life-saving organ transplants. We hypothesize that the use of IdeS® pre-transplant in HS
      patients will represent a more robust and complete technique to eliminate DSA from the sera
      of HS patients. A single dose administration of IdeS® in the pre-operative period to HS
      patients with positive DSAs and flow cytometry crossmatches will durably eliminate
      circulating DSAs, allow transplantation to occur without ABMR and, in conjunction with
      standard desensitization therapy, result in a durable suppression of DSA levels thus
      eliminating the risk for ABMR.

      This is a single center phase I/II open label, dose escalating, exploratory study assessing
      safety and efficacy of IdeS® (Hansa Medical, Lund, Sweden) given immediately prior to kidney
      transplantation. We hope that IdeS® will help eliminate DSAs in HS patients who are DSA+ and
      flow cytometry (FCMX) crossmatch + at time of transplant. We plan to enroll a total of 20
      patients. Patients will be followed for 6 months post administration of IdeS®.
