      This study is a Phase 4, open-label, single group study in which at least 40 adult patients
      undergoing miltefosine treatment for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis will be assessed by digital
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for prolongation of the QTc interval. Potential subjects
      diagnosed with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis who are planning to undergo miltefosine treatment
      will be informed about the study and undergo the informed consent process. After obtaining
      informed consent, subjects will be screened over a 14-day period for eligibility by medical
      history including leishmaniasis diagnostics, physical examination, clinical laboratory
      measurements [chemistries: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, creatinine,
      magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium; hematology: white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin,
      platelet count; and a pregnancy test if female], ECG, and medication use in the 28-day period
      before starting treatment. If eligible for the study, the subject will receive miltefosine
      for 28 days at a target dose of approximately 2.5 mg/kg/day. Screening and enrollment into
      the study will continue until at least 10 females and up to 30 males complete the study and
      are considered evaluable (provide Day 28 ECGs and PK samples and complete at least 25 of 28
      days of miltefosine treatment). Vital signs will be collected weekly during treatment.
      Chemistries and hematology will be repeated at study Days 14 (mid-treatment) and 28 (end of
      treatment). A pregnancy test (if applicable) will be repeated at Day 28. ECGs (12-lead) will
      be repeated at Days 14 and 28. Blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments on
      Days 14 and 28 within 15 minutes of the final ECG. Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant
      medication use will be collected during treatment. If on Day 28, clinically significant
      abnormalities are observed by ECG, then a repeat ECG and PK blood draw will be performed at
      Day 42 (2-weeks after completing treatment). AEs and concomitant medication use will also be
      collected in any subject coming back for the Day 42 visit. Digital ECGs (12-lead) will be
      collected in triplicate at each time point over a period not to exceed 1 hour. During
      treatment, ECGs will be collected 4 hours after a dose (approximate Tmax).
