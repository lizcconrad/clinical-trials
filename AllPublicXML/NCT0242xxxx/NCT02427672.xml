  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of upregulating prefrontal cortex activity on antisocial
      and aggressive behavior and risk factors for such behavior. In the double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial, participants will undergo anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
      bilaterally to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or a sham stimulation. During and after
      stimulation, they will complete survey and laboratory measures assessing antisocial and
      aggressive behavior and risk factors for antisocial and aggressive behavior. Heart rate and
      skin conductance will also be measured.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the active stimulation group will undergo anodal bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. tDCS will be delivered by a battery-driven, constant-current stimulator connected to three saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes. Two anodal electrodes (25cm2) will be placed over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and one cathodal electrode (35cm2) will be placed at the back of the neck. Scalp electrodes will be positioned over the F3 and F4 according to the 10-20 EEG international system. A current of 1mA will be applied for 20 minutes and the current will be ramped up and down at the beginning and end of the stimulation period.</description>

    <description>The sham transcranial direct current stimulation condition will involve the same placement of the electrodes, current intensity, and ramp time as the real tDCS condition, but stimulation will only last for 30 seconds.</description>
