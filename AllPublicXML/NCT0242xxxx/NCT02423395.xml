  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle cramps are common in patients with liver disease and associated with significantly
      diminished quality of life. Patients with cirrhosis often experience muscle cramps with
      varied frequency and severity. The exact mechanisms by which they occur remain unclear,
      although a number of pathophysiological events unique to liver disease may contribute.
      Clinical studies have identified alterations in 3 areas: nerve function, energy metabolism,
      and plasma volume/electrolytes (1) Orphenadrine is an anticholinergic drug with prominent
      central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral actions used to treat painful muscle spasms and
      other similar conditions. The combination of anticholinergic effects and CNS penetration make
      orphenadrine useful for pain of all etiologies, including from: radiculopathy, muscles, and
      headaches. [3,4]

      Muscle cramps are common in patients with liver disease and associated with significantly
      diminished quality of life. Patients with cirrhosis often experience muscle cramps with
      varied frequency and severity. The exact mechanisms by which they occur remain unclear,
      although a number of pathophysiological events unique to liver disease may contribute.
      Clinical studies have identified alterations in 3 areas: nerve function, energy metabolism,
      and plasma volume/electrolytes [1].

      Although a number of mechanisms for cramps in liver disease have been postulated and have
      been targeted by medical therapies, a clear picture of the causal events has not emerged.
      Several agents as vitamin E, human albumin, zinc, taurine, eperisone hydrochloride and
      branched-chain amino acids have shown some benefit in small uncontrolled studies, although
      large randomized controlled trials are lacking [2].

      Orphenadrine is an anticholinergic drug with prominent central nervous system (CNS) and
      peripheral actions used to treat painful muscle spasms and other similar conditions. The
      combination of anticholinergic effects and CNS penetration make orphenadrine useful for pain
      of all etiologies, including from: radiculopathy, muscles, and headaches. [3,4] Orphenadrine
      is structurally related to diphenhydramine and carries relatively stronger anticholinergic
      and weaker sedative properties, It is mostly excreted through the kidneys.[5]
