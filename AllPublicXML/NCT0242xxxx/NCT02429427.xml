  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been found that the chemical changes that take place in a patient's body during the
      development of inflammation may provide an environment which stimulates cancer cells. One
      step in the development of inflammation is the production of certain chemical substances
      which are important in the formation and spread of tumours. These are called prostaglandins.
      Cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-2) is an enzyme (a substance that speeds up chemical changes in the
      body) involved in the production of these prostaglandins and although it is not usually
      present in most tissues it is made at the sites of inflammation. Celecoxib is a selective
      Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) which works by blocking the action of the COX-2
      enzyme, leading to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins and a reduction in
      inflammation.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to find out if celecoxib can be used after breast
      cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy) to reduce inflammation and thus reduce
      the ability of new tumours to grow and survive.

      2590 women with primary breast cancer will be recruited in this study from several locations
      in the United Kingdom and Germany. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated a treatment
      group, which can be celecoxib or placebo. Both treatments are taken orally (celecoxib 400mg
      daily, placebo 2 tablets daily) for a total of 2 years. In addition, hormone receptor
      positive patients will receive endocrine treatment as per local practice. Patients will
      prematurely discontinue treatment with celecoxib/placebo if disease progression is confirmed
      or if patients experience unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients will be seen every 6 months for the first 3 years and then off treatment follow-up
      is carried out annually. Participating patients will also be given the option to take part in
      the pathology sub-study by donating a sample of the tumour tissue collected at the time of
      the primary surgery.
