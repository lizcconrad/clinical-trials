    <time_frame>between baseline and after 2-month treatment of topiramate</time_frame>
    <description>Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) was performed twice in migraineurs before and after the topiramate treatment during their interictal period of headache.
Measurements: the mean flow velocity (MFV) of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). After 1 minute of adaptation period to the darkness, flashlights of 10 Hz were presented using a light source of an electroencephalography machine (PS40/R-220, Grass Technologies, West Warwick, USA). Recordings were performed for 10 cycles, and each cycle consisted of 10-second stimulation-on and 10-second stimulation-off.
Calculation: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) CVR = Δ V/Vb or Δ V/(VbxΔT) Where Vb is the baseline MFV, Δ V/Vb is the percentage MFV increase (amplitude), ΔT is the time from the onset of the stimulation to the peak MFV, and Δ V/(VbxΔT) is the slope of the MFV increase.</description>
