  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if nivolumab in combination with
      ibrutinib can help control chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or
      small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL). The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      use in melanoma patients. Its use in this study is investigational. Ibrutinib is FDA approved
      and commercially available for the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL. The use of these drugs
      in combination is considered investigational. The study doctor can explain how the drugs are
      designed to work.

      Up to 72 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      study groups, depending on if you are already taking ibrutinib or not. If you are NOT already
      taking ibrutinib, you will be assigned to Group 1. If you are already taking ibrutinib, you
      will be assigned to Group 2.

      All participants will receive nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles
      1-24.

      If you are in Group 1, starting at Cycle 2, you will also begin to take ibrutinib by mouth 1
      time each day at about the same time, about 2 hours after eating but 30 minutes before your
      next meal. You should take your dose of ibrutinib with a cup (about 8 ounces) of water. Do
      not open the capsules or dissolve them in water.

      If you are in Group 2, you will continue to take the dose of ibrutinib that you are currently
      taking.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the doctor thinks it is
           needed, you may have this blood draw performed more often.

        -  During Cycles 2-4, urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1-6:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  On Day 15 of Cycle 1 only, urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a physical exam, including a
           neurological exam. After Cycle 1, you will only have this physical exam on Day 15.

      If you are in Group 1, on Day 28 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 28 of Cycle 3 and then every 3 cycles after that for the first year (Cycles 6, 9, 12,
      and so on) and then every 6 cycles after that:

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of
           the disease.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  Every 3 cycles (Cycles 7, 10, 13, and so on), urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Every 6 weeks, if you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 tablespoon) or urine will be
      collected for a pregnancy test.

      At any time that the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have blood draws, CT/PET scans,
      and/or bone marrow aspiration/biopsies to check the status of the disease, while you are on
      study.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 24 cycles of nivolumab. You can continue to take ibrutinib as long as
      the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of
           the disease.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      About 1 month after your end-of-study visit, you will continue to have follow-up visits for
      up to 1 year.

        -  You will have a physical exam 1 time each month.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1 time each month.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for antibody testing 1 time every 3 months.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the
           status of the disease every 3-6 months.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of
           the disease every 3-6 months.

      If you start a new type of anti-CLL/SLL treatment during the follow-up period, you will stop
      having these study visits.

         20. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated
             with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere
             with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate
             for enrollment into this study.
