  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that a permissive hypercapnia during mechanical
      ventilation in children under general anaesthesia will improve cerebral perfusion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation interferes with cerebral perfusion via the changes in intrathoracic
      pressure and/or as a consequence of hypocapnia. This latter occurs frequently following
      traditional ventilation strategies with relatively high tidal volume and respiratory rate.
      New trends in anesthesia intend to promote protective lung ventilation by keeping a
      normocapnic or even mildly hypercapnic state. However, cerebral vascular vasotonicity is
      carbon dioxide (CO2)-dependent with hypocapnia potentially leading to vasoconstriction and
      subsequent decrease in cerebral blood flow. Changes in cerebral vasoreactivity can be
      assessed by the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. This monitoring evaluates the
      changes in various parameters (deoxygenated hemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, the tissue
      oxygenation index (TOI) and the tissue hemoglobin index (THI)) that act as surrogate for
      cerebral vasoconstriction.

      We, therefore designed this prospective observational comparative effectiveness study in
      order to characterize the potential beneficial effect of permissive hypercapnia on cerebral
      perfusion in infants.

    <description>The Child will be ventilated in order to achieve an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) of 5.5 kiloPascal (kPa). Measurements will be performed after steady state condition. Then the ventilation will be reduced to allow ETCO2 to reach 6.5 kPa before repeating the measurements. Finally, the child will be again ventilated to obtain a normocapnia condition.</description>
