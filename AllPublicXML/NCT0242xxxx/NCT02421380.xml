  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test a new approach to see if the test results can be
      reproduced each time the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done for an individual patient.
      The study will explore the use of an imaging agent called hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate
      (HP) with MRI scans. (MRI) is a technique that takes pictures of the body's organs using a
      magnetic field and radiofrequency waves that cannot be felt. In order to accomplish the goal
      of the study the patient will have two hyperpolarized MRI scans to assess if scans can be
      reproduced. The hyperpolarized MRI scans will be compared with the pathological results of
      the surgery to see if the hyperpolarized MRI provides additional information regarding
      disease metabolism.

    <description>This is a reproducibility study of hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate MRI in patients with solid tumors. A total of 100 patients will be enrolled, 50 of whom will be imaged using 1D MR spectroscopy and the other 50 with 3D imaging sequence.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with history of histologically-confirmed malignant solid tumor (histology
             confirmed by MSKCC Department of Pathology.) NOTE: An exception will be made for
             patients with brain lesions. Patients identified by a radiologist to have a brain
             lesion with high suspicion for neoplasm given MRI features will be enrolled, prior to
             histological confirmation.

          -  Disease measurable or evaluable as defined by RECIST 1.1, a mass of greater than 1cm
             in the long axis and/or other tumor response criteria from an MSKCC IRB-approved
             clinical research protocol. NOTE: Study patients do not need to be participating in an
             MSKCC approved clinical trial prior to study recruitment.

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing age and
             potential (as defined by MSKCC Standards &amp; Guidelines), from assays obtained &lt;2 weeks
             prior to study enrollment.

          -  This study will include only patients with sarcoma, prostate, breast, brain or
             metastatic cancer. In the future other patient groups may be included through
             amendment of this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or refusal to have at least one peripheral intravenous line for intravenous
             access (as applicable to the day of [1-13C] pyruvate injection)

          -  Breast-feeding

          -  Refusal or inability to tolerate the scanning procedure (e.g., due to claustrophobia)

          -  Hepatic: from assays obtained &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment. For each patient,
             the upper limit of normal (ULN) value for a particular assay will be defined by the
             normal reference values of the laboratory that performed the assay

          -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x (ULN)

          -  AST/ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN

          -  Albumin &lt; 3 g/dl

          -  GGT &gt; 2.5 x ULN if Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Renal: Creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min, from assays obtained
             &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  Acute major illness (e.g., unstable cardiovascular condition, etc.)

          -  Standard MRI exclusion criteria will also be applied, including pacemakers and metal
             clips located in the patient.
