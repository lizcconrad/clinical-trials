  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the brain functioning of children and adolescent with
      OCD before and after treatment with Exposure and Response Prevention (EXRP) therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The capacity to coordinate thoughts and actions to execute goal-directed behaviors (cognitive
      control) and the capacity to anticipate, respond to, and learn from reward (reward
      processing) are key processes for human behavior. Dysfunction in these processes has been
      hypothesized to contribute to repetitive thoughts and behaviors in many disorders, including
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and eating disorders. The
      investigators will use multimodal imaging to investigate neural circuits that support
      cognitive control and reward processing, using pediatric OCD as a model system. The
      short-term goal is to clarify how circuit-based abnormalities contribute to repetitive
      thoughts/behaviors; these data will inform future trans-diagnostic studies. The long-term
      goal is to identify control and reward circuit-abnormalities as targets for new
      trans-diagnostic treatments.

    <description>The goal of this study is to use multimodal MRI to assess the functioning and structure of overlapping frontostriatal circuits in a large sample of unmedicated children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD before and after CBT. The brain activity of children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD will be compared to age matched healthy controls during performance of the simon task and our virtual reality (VR)-based assessment of multiple learning and memory systems. In addition, functional connectivity within frontostriatal circuits in children and adolescents with OCD will be compared to age matched healthy control children and adolescents.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for OCD involves gradually exposing patients to anxiety provoking stimuli while having patients refrain from engaging in compulsive rituals and/or avoidance behaviors. There are three major components of CBT treatment for OCD, specifically: (1) exposure to anxiety provoking stimuli, (2) response prevention, and (3) cognitive techniques intended to decrease anxiety during the exposure and response prevention processes.</description>
