      This study is a post-market clinical follow-up study to fulfill the post-market surveillance
      obligations according to Medical Device Directive and MEDDEV 2.12-2_Rev2_January 2012. The
      data collected from this study will serve the purpose of confirming safety and performance of
      the TM Ardis implant. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that implant is effective in
      reducing patient disability.

      This study is a post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to fulfill the post-market
      surveillance obligations according to Medical Device Directive and MEDDEV 2.12-2_Rev2_January
      2012. The data collected from this study will serve the purpose of confirming safety and
      performance of the TM Ardis implant. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that implant is
      effective in reducing patient disability, which will be assessed with the ODI questionnaire.

          -  Degenerative disc disease DDD with up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis or retrolis-thesis
             at the involved level. DDD is defined as discogenic back pain with degener-ation of
             the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies.

          -  ODI 40 out of 100

          -  Back pain 4 out of 10

          -  Mono segmental or two level lumbosacral disease

          -  Six months failed conservative treatment.

          -  Gave written consent to take part in the study by signing the Ethics Committee's

             and complete required forms and adhere to the follow-up requirements of the pro-tocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior surgical procedure at the index level(s) using the desired operative approach.

          -  Severe degenerative lesions at more than two level of the lumbosacral spine.

          -  Active systemic infection and/or disease.

          -  Severe osteoporosis or insufficient bone density, which in the medical opinion of the
             physician precludes surgery or contraindicates instrumentation.

          -  Known or suspected sensitivity to the implant materials.

          -  Endocrine or metabolic disorders known to affect osteogenesis (e.g.Paget's disease,
             renal osteodystrophy, hypothyroidism)

          -  Systemic disease that requires the chronic administration of nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory or steroidal drugs.

          -  Significant mental disorder or condition that could compromise the patient's ability
             to remember and comply with preoperative and postoperative instructions (e.g. current
             treatment for a psychiatric/psychosocial disorder, senile dementia, Alzheimer's
             disease, traumatic head injury)

          -  Neuromuscular disorder that would engender unacceptable risk of instability, implant
             fixation failure, or complications in postoperative care.

          -  Pregnant.

          -  Unwilling to follow postoperative instructions, in particular with respect to athletic
             or occupational activities.

          -  Current vertebral metastatic tumors.

          -  Symptomatic cardiac disease.

          -  Severe congenital or acquired vertebral deformities.
