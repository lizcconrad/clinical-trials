      Study Treatment:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive lorvotuzumab by
      vein on Days 1 and 8 (+/- 2 days) of each cycle. It may take a few minutes or several hours
      to receive the study drug. Your doctor will discuss this with you.

      All treatments with IMGN901 must be administered at MD Anderson.

      Each cycle is 21 days (+/-6 days). However, they may be longer or shorter depending on if/how
      the disease responds to the treatment, how your bone marrow reacts to treatment, and what the
      doctor thinks is in your best interest.

      Your dose of lorvotuzumab may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the doctor thinks it is
      in your best interest.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      One (1) time each week during the first 4 cycles, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn
      for routine tests. After Cycle 4, you will have these blood draws 1 time every 2-4 weeks. If
      your doctor thinks it is needed, more blood may need to be drawn. The study doctor or study
      staff will discuss this with you if more blood is needed.

      During the first cycle, all the laboratory evaluations will be done at MD Anderson. After
      Cycle 1, you may be able to have these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic that is
      closer to your home, and the results reported to the research nurse of the study at MD
      Anderson. The study doctor or study staff will discuss this option with you. The results of
      these blood draws will be sent to the study doctor for review.

      On Day 21 of Cycle 1 (+/- 7 days), then every 1-3 cycles after that, you will have a bone
      marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the status of the disease. If the doctor thinks it is
      needed, these may be done more or less often, depending on your response to the study drug.

      You will have blood draws and/or bone marrow aspirations at any time that the doctor thinks
      it is needed while you are on study.

      If you stay on study for more than 6 months and you are not having side effects, you may have
      some of the above tests more or less frequently. For example, you may only have a bone marrow
      aspiration 1 time every 6-12 months and blood draws 1 time each cycle. The study doctor will
      discuss this with you.

      Length of Study:

      You may take up to 12 cycles of lorvotuzumab. If the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest, you may be able to continue receiving the study drug beyond Cycle 12. You will no
      longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      If you leave the study before the end of Cycle 12, within 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the last
      dose of study drug:

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check
           the status of the disease.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      If the disease appears to get better and you are responding well to the study drug, you will
      return to MD Anderson every 3-6 months for up to 5 years after your last dose of study drug
      for the study staff to check how you are doing.

      If you cannot return to MD Anderson for these visits, you may be called by a member of the
      study staff. The call should last about 10 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Lorvotuzumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      drug is designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with CD56 expressing hematological malignancy, as follows: Cohort 1: CD56
             expressing hematological malignancies including but not limited to AML, high-risk
             myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), natural-killer leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
             accelerated and blast-phase chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) who have failed prior
             therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.Cohort 2: Patients with MF (either
             primary MF, post-polycythemia MF, or post-essential thrombocythemia MF) and CD56
             expression who have been on ruxolitinib or JAK-inhibitor therapy for at least 12 weeks
             and deemed refractory or sub-optimal responders in the opinion of the treating
             physician.Cohort 3: Patients with pathological diagnosis of BPDCN with CD56 expression
             (frontline and relapsed/refractory).

          2. Any level of CD56 expression will be considered sufficient for enrollment on this
             study.

          3. Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g.
             FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is allowed.

          4. Age &gt;/=18 years

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &lt;/= 2

          6. Adequate organ function: total bilirubin &lt;/= 2 times upper limit of normal (x ULN)
             (&lt;/=3 x ULN if considered to be due to leukemic involvement or Gilbert's syndrome);
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN (&lt;/=
             5.0 x ULN if considered to be due to leukemic involvement); serum creatinine &lt;/= 2 x
             ULN, amylase and lipase &lt;/=2 x ULN .

          7. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease and after discussion with the Principal
             Investigator (PI), the interval from prior treatment to time of IMGN901 administration
             will be at least 2 weeks or at least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents.
             The half-life be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts,
             manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be
             documented in the protocol eligibility document.

          8. continuation from criteria #7: For prior monoclonal antibody therapy the interval from
             prior monoclonal antibody treatment to time of IMGN901 administration will be at least
             2 weeks. The use of chemotherapeutic or anti-leukemic agents other than hydroxyurea
             (as defined in the protocol) is not permitted during the study with the exception of
             intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled CNS leukemia at the discretion
             of the PI. Hydroxyurea is allowed prior to the initiation of IMGN901 and during the
             first 3 cycles, either prior to or concomitantly with IMGN901 administration initially
             to control Leukocytosis.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must practice contraception. Females of childbearing
             potential: Recommendation is for 2 effective contraceptive methods during the study.
             Adequate forms of contraception are double barrier methods (condoms with spermicidal
             jelly or foam and diaphragm with spermicidal jelly or foam), oral, depo provera, or
             injectable contraceptives, intrauterine devices, and tubal ligation. Male patients
             with female partners who are of childbearing potential: Recommendation is for male and
             partner to use at least 2 effective contraceptive methods, as described above, during
             the study.

         10. Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment

         11. Patients must provide written informed consent.

         12. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception
             during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the
             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception
             include: Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
             Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male sterilization (at least 6 months
             prior to screening).

         13. continued from criteria #12: For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male
             partner should be the sole partner for that patient Combination of any of the two
             following (a+b or a+c or b+c) Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of
             contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy
             (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
             contraception Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)
             Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository In case of use of oral
             contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study
             treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction
             with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction

         14. continued from criteria #13 Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child
             bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with
             an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms)
             or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
             ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.
