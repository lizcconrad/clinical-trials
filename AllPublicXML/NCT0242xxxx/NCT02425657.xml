      Specially educated trainers will be responsible for colonoscopy training of junior doctors.
      The educated trainers will have attended seminars held by Valori et al.

      The following fast track colonoscopy training program for junior doctors will consist of: 1)
      Endoscopy simulation training and theory course 2) supervised and partly supervised lower
      endoscopy. 3) Directly observed practical skills according to JAG (joint advisory group)
      guidelines.

      Initially a &quot;train the trainers&quot; program will begin with 3 sessions held by Valori et al. at
      Aalborg University Hospital. 6 Trainers are expected to be trained during the &quot;train the
      trainers&quot; program. The doctors selected for the &quot;train the trainers&quot; program are doctors
      specialized in abdominal surgery with an extensive lower GI-endoscopy experience and who is
      considered to have an excellent teaching ability to educate junior doctor.

      The training program for junior doctors consist of the following:

        -  Initial 2 day endoscopy simulation and theory at Nordsim. Endoscopy simulation scores
           will be monitored.

        -  3 days of fully supervised colonoscopies (approximately 18-20 colonoscopies). Trainer is
           present in the endoscopy room

        -  6 days of partly supervised colonoscopies. Trainer is present in the room or located
           just outside (approximately 36-40 colonoscopies).

        -  Further days with colonoscopies to complete 50 non- or partly supervised endoscopies.

        -  DOPS (directly observed practical skills) will be held on 0 (if previous colonoscopy
           experience), 20 and 50 colonoscopies according to JAG (joint advisory group) guidelines.

        -  Simulator test will be held 0, 20 and 50 colonoscopies to validate progress and compare
           simulator generated measurements with DOPS.

      The total training program for 50 colonoscopies must be completed within 8 weeks.
