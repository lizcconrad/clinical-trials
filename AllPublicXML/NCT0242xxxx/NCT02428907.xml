  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients experience a degree of pain and discomfort during endoscopic examination of the
      large bowel. Sedatives and analgesics may be administered in low doses. Excessive dosage or
      intense pain may lead to hypotension and impaired level of consciousness. The purpose of the
      present study was to determine if simulation training of endoscopy staff in preventing pain
      and handling acute complications through effective teamwork could improve the quality of
      colonoscopy from the patients' perspective.

      The study was carried out in a surgical department, where colonoscopies were performed on an
      out-patient basis under minimal sedation. The intervention consisted of a simulation based
      course for endoscopy staff. All endoscopy nurses and doctors participated (n=43). The course
      consisted of three short lectures followed by simulation training. The lectures dealt with
      technical aspects of colonoscopy, usage of medication and management of unexpected emergency
      events during the procedure, and finally with interprofessional teamwork and team
      communication. The lectures were followed by in situ simulation in an endoscopy room. For 2
      months before and after the course a questionnaire based survey was carried out. The
      respondents were consecutive patients who had undergone colonoscopy under minimal sedation or
      no sedation (according to their own preference ). The questionnaire was filled out when the
      patient was fully recovered after sedation and ready to go home. The relevant nursing staff
      and doctor for the procedure also filled out their part of the questionnaire. Patients were
      invited to participate and gave written consent after oral and written information according
      to the Helsinki declaration .

    <description>comparison of patient satisfaction aspects of colonoscopy before and after a simulation, course for staff. The patients fill out a questionnaire: Pain score on a visual analogue scale, Wiilingness to return for a repeat colonoscopy if necessary on a visual analogue scale, assessmment of doctor's and nurse's behaviour on a scale from 1 - 10 regarding empathy, quality of information. Staff answer a questionnaire where they assess the quality of teamwork on a scale from 1-10. They also assess the patients perceived pain on a visual analogue scale.</description>
