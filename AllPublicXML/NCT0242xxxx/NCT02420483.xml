      The authors to measure passive tidal volumes generated during external chest compressions in
      order to determine whether chest compressions alone without any mechanical ventilatory
      support in cardiopulmonary resuscitation can provide adequate ventilation. The authors will
      study 25 volunteers who meet the following inclusion criteria: age 18-55 years, ASA I-II,
      candidates for surgical operation, who will receive general anesthesia. Patients who will be
      operated in the chest, who present musculoskeletal diseases, cardiopulmonary or vascular
      acute or chronic diseases, who had history of pneumothorax, of thromboembolism, osteoporosis,
      menopause, history of current rib or sternal or clavicle fractures, will be excluded. All
      eligible patients will enter the study and will receive general anesthesia and intubation
      according to treating doctors' decision.

      Patients will be ventilated mechanically for 5 minutes to establish stable conditions. A
      pneumotachograph will be then connected to the ventilatory circuit so that respiratory
      efforts (volume, airway pressure and flow) can be continuously monitored at real time.

      An esophageal catheter will be then inserted to monitor esophageal pressures and to provide
      data for lung mechanics calculation. Following the above procedures and before any surgical
      procedure, chest compressions will be performed to the patient by a senior anesthesiologist
      according to ERC guidelines of 2010 for 30 seconds.

      Following chest compressions, patients will be evaluated for possible complications and after
      the establishment of stable conditions surgical procedures will follow. After the end of the
      surgical operation clinical and chest ultrasound evaluation will be performed.

      Written inform consent will be obtained by all patients before procedures.

    <description>esophageal pressures will be assessed with an esophageal balloon-catheter that will be introduced via the nares while the patients is still awake and will be positioned at 40 cm from the nares. Correct positioning will be confirmed by the demonstration of negative pressure swings against an occluded airway.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung compliance before and at the end of cardiopulmonary resuscitation</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Lung compliance will be assessed as the ratio of tidal volume change over transpulmonary pressure changes (subtracting oesophageal pressures from airway pressures) during tidal breathing (average of 10 breaths); oesophageal will be used as a measure of pleural pressures.</description>
