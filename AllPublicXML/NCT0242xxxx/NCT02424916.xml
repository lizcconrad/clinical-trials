      This study evaluates the safety as well as the potential clinical efficacy of an adoptive
      transfer of CD8+ T cells, sorted with HLA-peptide multimers and specific for Melan-A and
      MELOE-1 melanoma antigens, to patients suffering from advanced metastatic melanoma (stages
      IIIc and IV).
