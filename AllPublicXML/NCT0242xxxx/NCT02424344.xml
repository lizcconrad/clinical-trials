      The present study is planned to evaluate the effect of the aclidinium bromide/formoterol
      fumarate 400/12 μg FDC BID on the hyperinflation, exercise endurance and physical activity in
      patients with moderate to severe COPD. Additionally, the effect of the behavioural
      intervention on top of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate 400/12 μg will be assessed both
      on the exercise endurance and the physical activity.
