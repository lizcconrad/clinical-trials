    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the use of a mobile health intervention to improve
      adherence to asthma medication among adolescents. The intervention consists of an inhaler
      sensor strap to monitor asthma inhaler use and a mobile phone application to remind and
      incentivize patients to use their medication. This study will assess medication use
      throughout a 12 week study in patients who receive a mobile app with reminders, asthma
      control as measured by the ACT [asthma control test], and lung function as measured by
      spirometry.
