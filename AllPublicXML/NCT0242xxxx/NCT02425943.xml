      Study is designed to

        1. to assess the long-term safety of Sculptra Aesthetic in immune-competent subjects as a
           single regimen for correction of wrinkle assessment score (WAS) 2 to 4 nasolabial fold
           (NLF) contour deficiencies and other facial wrinkles in which deep dermal grid pattern
           (cross-hatch) injection technique is appropriate.

        2. to evaluate the time to onset, duration, severity, relationship to Sculptra Aesthetic
           and/or injection procedure, and outcome of all adverse events during the course of the
           study, by Fitzpatrick skin type.

        3. to evaluate the change in the WAS from baseline to post-treatment follow-up time points
           at Months 6, 13, and Years 2, 3, 4, and 5 in NLFs and other facial wrinkles.

        4. to evaluate Investigator/subject global assessments at Months 6, 13, and Years 2, 3, 4,
           and 5.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects seeking correction of shallow to deep NLF contour deficiencies. Subjects must
             have a score of ≥2 and ≤4 on the photo-numeric wrinkle assessment scale of both the
             right and left NLFs at entry.

             - Subjects may also have other facial wrinkles (ie, cheek lines, marionette lines, and
             chin crease/chin fold) using the Assessment Scale for Other Facial Wrinkles for which
             deep dermal grid pattern (cross-hatch) injection technique is appropriate.

          2. Subjects must sign a statement of informed consent; initial and date &quot;A Patient's
             Guide to Treatment with Sculptra® Aesthetic&quot;; and sign and date the &quot;Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization&quot;.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects seeking, at entry into the study, correction of other facial wrinkles with
             Sculptra Aesthetic in the following anatomical sites/lines: horizontal forehead lines,
             glabellar frown lines, periorbital lines, periauricular lines, upper lip lines, lower
