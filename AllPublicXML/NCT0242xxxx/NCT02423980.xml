  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, exploratory pilot study in patients with T1D. The study will involve
      two daytime clinical research center visits 7-14 days apart. Subjects will receive a single
      injection of G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) at each visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following eligibility confirmation, each study participant will undergo two episodes of
      insulin-induced hypoglycemia with plasma glucose &lt; 50 mg/dL. Both episodes will be treated
      with a single subcutaneous injection of G-Pen™ glucagon. For the first treatment visit, all
      subjects will receive a 1 mg dose of G-Pen™ glucagon. The investigator will have discretion
      to repeat this same dose at the second treatment visit or give a 0.5 mg dose of G-Pen™
      glucagon. A follow-up phone call will be conducted 3-7 days following administration of the
      final dose of study drug as a safety check.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Plasma Glucose &gt; 70 mg/dL at 30 Minutes Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>0-90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For 90 minutes following treatment, plasma glucose was measured every 5 minutes, with an increase in plasma glucose to &gt;70 mg/dL within 30 minutes of treatment being considered a positive response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Plasma Glucose &gt; 70 mg/dL</measure>
    <time_frame>0-90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Following treatment, plasma glucose was measured every 5 minutes. The first such measurement at which plasma glucose concentration was observed to be &gt;70 mg/dL was reported as the time to response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Resolution of Induced Hypoglycemia Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>0-30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Prior to and every 5 minutes after treatment, subjects were asked to rate the severity of each of 8 symptoms on a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 indicating the symptom was absent and 6 indicating the symptom was severe. The sum of the scores for the 8 individual symptoms was reported as the total hypoglycemia symptom score, which ranged from 8-48. The first time point post-treatment at which total hypoglycemia symptom score = 8 (i.e., all symptoms were absent) was considered the time to resolution. One and two subjects were unevaluable for response to the 1 mg and 0.5 mg doses of glucagon, respectively, as they reported no symptoms (i.e., total symptom score = 8) prior to treatment.</description>

        <title>Time to Resolution of Induced Hypoglycemia Symptoms</title>
        <description>Prior to and every 5 minutes after treatment, subjects were asked to rate the severity of each of 8 symptoms on a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 indicating the symptom was absent and 6 indicating the symptom was severe. The sum of the scores for the 8 individual symptoms was reported as the total hypoglycemia symptom score, which ranged from 8-48. The first time point post-treatment at which total hypoglycemia symptom score = 8 (i.e., all symptoms were absent) was considered the time to resolution. One and two subjects were unevaluable for response to the 1 mg and 0.5 mg doses of glucagon, respectively, as they reported no symptoms (i.e., total symptom score = 8) prior to treatment.</description>
