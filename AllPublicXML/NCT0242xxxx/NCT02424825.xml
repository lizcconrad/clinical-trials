  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to collect data from approximately 15 multiple sclerosis (MS)
      patients who are participating in a pilot cooking course. This online cooking training
      program is currently available to general public through the company &quot;Rouxbe&quot; for a fee. Data
      gathered from this cooking course will be used to develop novel ways of promoting healthy
      eating habits in people with MS. The investigators will use the data from blood tests,
      questionnaires, and demographics to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of this program.
      This is an outpatient program designed for people with MS that would occur regardless of
      whether participant data is collected.

      This pilot cooking course will run for approximately four weeks. The investigators intend
      start to the training course in mid-March 2015. Subjects will be followed prior to course
      initiation for baseline data gathering, at four weeks from baseline, twelve weeks from
      baseline, and twenty-four weeks from baseline.
