  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try and provide data linking the impact of increased
      inflammatory cytokines as a result of chemotherapy and their relationship with increased
      levels of CNS glutamate and related behavioral and cognitive consequences in breast cancer
      patients. The investigators will use neuropsychiatric assessments, blood sampling and
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to collect study data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70% of women with breast cancer experience behavioral and/or cognitive symptoms
      during treatment with chemotherapy and approximately 30% of women continue to experience
      these symptoms months to years after treatment completion. There is mounting data to suggest
      that inflammation may be involved and indicate that chemotherapy-treated breast cancer
      patients exhibit higher inflammatory markers than non-chemotherapy-treated patients, and
      inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR2)
      have been associated with chemotherapy-induced depression and fatigue.

    <measure>Ratio of Glutamate to Creatine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Single voxel MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) scans will be done to determine the glutamate levels in the dACC (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex), basal ganglia and hippocampus and the glutamate/ creatine (Glu/Cr) ratio will be calculated.MRS utilizes a magnetic field to look at magnetic nuclei, which absorb and re-emit electromagnetic energy in the presence of the magnetic field. By looking at the peaks in the resultant spectra the structure and concentration of metabolites can be determined.</description>
