    <textblock>
      This study will conduct a split-face and -body randomized control trial to compare lidocaine
      2.5%/prilocaine 2.5% topical anesthetic (LPTA), lidocaine 7%/tetracaine 7% topical anesthetic
      (LTTA), and placebo vechicle (PV) on patients' pain perceptions with Q-switched 532nm laser
      for the treatment of lentigines and/or photorejuvenation.Subjects will fill out a pain score
      on a visual analog scale (VAS) with 0 being no pain and 10 being most pain after each
      treatment area is completed.
