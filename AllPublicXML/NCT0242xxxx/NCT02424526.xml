  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to find the optimal dosage of home-based treadmill training needed to
      accelerate walking onset and to examine the long-term effects on the child's walking
      activity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine optimal parameters for dosing home-based treadmill
      training by comparing high-intensity (5 days/week, twice daily for 10-20 min for 6 weeks) to
      low-intensity (2 days/week, once daily for 10-20 minutes for 6 weeks) treadmill training; and
      to compare the effects of high- versus low-intensity treadmill training on walking attainment
      and overall walking activity in young children with cerebral palsy.

      Hypotheses

        -  A more intensive protocol of treadmill training will increase walking onset in young
           children with CP.

        -  A more intensive protocol of treadmill training will increase overall walking activity
           in young children with CP.

      Specific Aims

        -  To determine optimal parameters for dosing home-based treadmill training by comparing
           high-intensity to low-intensity home-based treadmill training.

        -  To compare the effects of high- versus low-intensity treadmill training on walking onset
           and overall walking activity.

      Study design •Prospective randomized controlled trial

      Study population

      •Two groups of 12 children with CP under the age of 3 years and are not walking yet will
      receive either home-based high-intensity treadmill training or low-intensity treadmill
      training. The children will be assessed before, immediately after, at 1-month and at 4-months
      following the intervention via standardized outcome measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signs of walking readiness as demonstrated by the ability to sit for 30 seconds when
             placed and to take 5 to 7 steps when supported at the trunk or arms.

                  hemiplegia)

               -  who have been identified as high-risk for a motor disability by a physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  a history of uncontrolled seizures

          -  a diagnosis of a genetic disorder
