  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children differ from adults with respect to growth and development but also immaturity of
      various pharmacological mechanisms. Dosing schemes in children are usually derived in an
      empirical manner from clinical trials in adult patient groups. All this poses neonates to an
      increased risk for therapeutic failure and adverse drug reactions.

      Medicinal products studied during this project are among the ones with the highest needs for
      research in the pediatric intensive care. This project focuses on the necessity to integrate
      subject's individual characteristics to assist clinical decision-making in drug therapy. The
      investigators explore the mechanisms defining the dose response in pediatric populations. The
      results obtained with these studies will help to find safer drug dosing regimens in this
      delicate patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Given informed consent by the guardian of an eligible patient.

          -  Patient is more than 24 weeks old and has a body weight more than 500 g.

          -  Patient needs intensive care treatment based on a clinical decision by a neonatologist
             and receives propofol or oxycodone on their therapy. Attending neonatologist makes the
             decision to prescribe propofol for scheduled short procedural sedation or oxycodone
             for analgesia as well as all other treatment related decisions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients guardian declines to give informed consent.

          -  A previous history of intolerance to the study drugs or to related compounds and
             additives.

          -  History of any kind of drug allergy.

          -  Participation in any other studies concomitantly or within one month prior to the
             entry into this study.
