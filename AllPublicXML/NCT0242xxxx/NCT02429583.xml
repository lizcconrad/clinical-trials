  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of chronic HCV infection and corresponding innate
      immune activation on the immune response to HBV vaccination. We will recruit chronic HCV
      patients and healthy control patients for HBV vaccination. We will use RNA Sequencing
      (RNA-Seq), a relatively new technology for simultaneously measuring the expression of all
      genes, to determine patients' innate immune status, and learn how this innate immune
      signature is related to HBV vaccine response. We will then explore the mechanisms by which
      chronic HCV infection affects different immune cells and functions that are known to be
      important for an effective HBV vaccine response. These studies will enhance our understanding
      of the immune effects of chronic viral infection, establish factors that determine effective
      vaccine responses, and help guide vaccination strategies for HCV patients and other
      individuals with chronic inflammatory disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines have been responsible for preventing millions of deaths and extending the average
      human lifespan. Effective vaccines stimulate the cells of the immune system to activate genes
      and associated functions that bring about protective immunity. If we can better understand
      the factors that influence vaccine success versus failure, we may be able to improve current
      vaccines and/or develop new vaccines against prevalent infectious diseases.

      Certain groups of people do not respond well to particular vaccines. For example, vaccines
      can be less effective in immunocompromised patients, elderly individuals, and people with
      chronic inflammatory diseases. Often it is these groups of people that have the greatest need
      for protection against infectious disease.

      People chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at increased risk of serious
      liver disease. As a result, they should receive the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, which
      can protect them from infection by HBV, another virus that targets the liver. However, people
      chronically infected with HCV do not respond to the HBV vaccine as effectively as healthy
      people without HCV. Chronic HCV infection is not thought to cause general problems with the
      immune system, and the reasons for this poor vaccine response are poorly understood. Previous
      work has shown that chronic HCV infection leads to production of chemical (&quot;innate immune&quot;)
      signals that can affect function of the immune system, but it is currently unknown how this
      might impact vaccination.
