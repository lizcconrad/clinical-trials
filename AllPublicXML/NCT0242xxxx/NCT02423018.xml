  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of pregabalin 300mg in patients
      receiving medications for sedative-hypnotic withdrawal symptoms will produce meaningful
      differences in measures of &quot;drug liking&quot; and &quot;drug high&quot; as compared to placebo.

      Pregabalin is currently being explored as a pharmacotherapy for substance use disorders.
      Open-labeled, uncontrolled studies indicate modest efficacy of pregabalin in benzodiazepine
      withdrawal symptom management and as a long-term benzodiazepine dependence treatment.
      Concurrently, there is increasing information from case reports and adverse drug event
      registries regarding pregabalin abuse in patients with substance use disorders.

      Given that the abuse liability of pregabalin has not been clearly established, nor its
      effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms in inpatients, this study is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, abuse liability study of a single dose of
      pregabalin 300mg, nested within a randomized,double-blind placebo-controlled, feasibility
      study evaluating pregabalin's effects on withdrawal symptoms in inpatients undergoing
      medically-assisted withdrawal from benzodiazepine, zopiclone or zolpidem.
