  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison (two
      dose levels of EMA401 versus a placebo group), of safety and efficacy in patients with
      postherpetic neuralgia.

      Screening Period (Up to Four Weeks) to confirm eligibility for the study which will be
      determined by Screening tests, physical examination/medical history and fulfillment of
      eligibility criteria including assessment of pain.

      Study Period (14 Weeks) Approximately 360 eligible male and female patients will receive
      double-blind treatment for 14 weeks. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      treatment with EMA401 100 mg BID, 300 mg BID or placebo.

      Patients will attend the study site at the end of the Baseline visit and end of Weeks 1, 3,
      5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14 for on-study assessments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be diagnosed as suffering from PHN defined as pain in the region of the rash
             persisting for more than six months after onset of herpes zoster rash.

          -  Be assessed as suffering from moderate to severe pain across the Screening Period. The
             assessment of moderate and severe pain will be made using an algorithm proprietary to
             Spinifex. The Investigator/site staff will be informed immediately as to whether the
             patient is eligible or ineligible on the ePRO website based on the patient entering
             all relevant pain scores in the eDiary device.

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and within 72 hours prior to administration of IP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients taking any topical treatment for their PHN at the time of Screening Visit 2
             will be excluded, including lidocaine plaster, capsaicin patch, and any other topical
             preparations of these or any other topical medications (e.g., aspirin, Non-Steroidal
             Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)) for their PHN.

          -  Have a blood pressure reading, after resting for at least five minutes, outside a
             systolic blood pressure range of 84-151 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg.
             If the blood pressure is outside of the range, a repeat measurement can be taken after
             the patient has rested. The repeat measurement should be used as the screening value.

          -  Have serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) levels &gt; 1.5 x
             the upper limit of normal or have total bilirubin concentrations &gt; 1.5 x the upper
             limit of normal at Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Patients who have a known diagnosis of diabetes and are stable on medication with a
             hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8%. Those who do not have a known diagnosis of diabetes with a
             hemoglobin A1c &gt; 7%.

          -  Have active herpes zoster upon physical examination at Screening (Visit 1) or during
             the study.

          -  Known history of, or positive laboratory result for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis
             C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as defined by being
             seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibodies or HIV antibodies
             respectively.
