  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on previous promising results, the next step for the validation of a multimodal MRI
      method in diagnosis and follow up of patients reached by parkinsonian syndromes is (i) to
      test whether the multimodal neuroimaging is able to discriminate at the individual level,
      patients with multiple system atrophy parkinsonism (MSA) and patients with idiopathic
      Parkinson's disease (PD) (ii) to determine whether the method is sensitive to measure changes
      over time for the two diseases, according to imaging, neuropsychological and other clinical
      data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients with PD and 30 patients with MSA will be examined in a 3Tesla MRI. The aim of our
      project is to demonstrate that our multimodal MRI method can discriminate both diseases with
      a similar clinical presentation and monitor the progress of the disease. CIC's expertise in
      recruitment and assessment of patients, and the powers of the INSERM U825 in terms of
      development and processing in neuroimaging guarantee the feasibility of the project and its
      successful completion.
