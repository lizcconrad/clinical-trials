    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine recommended Phase 2 dose [RP2D]) and the objective
      response rate of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      participants with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 amplification.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (when
      more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), 2 parts
      (First, dose escalation Phase and second, dose expansion Phase) study to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical responses of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in
      Asian participants with advanced HCC. The duration of study will be approximately 11 months
      per participant. The study consists of 2 periods: Screening (28 days before study commences
      on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (dose escalation portion of the trial [Part 1]), participants
      are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in 28 day
      treatment cycles. Part 2, the cohort expansion part of the trial, will further explore the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) as determined in Part 1; and
      follow-up Phase (up to 6 months). Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and predictive biomarkers at pre-dose and post-dose of
      study treatment. Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) will be
      evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Part 1: First, participants will receive 8 milligram (mg) (starting dose) tablet of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) orally once daily from Day 1 to 7, then Day 15 to 21 of 28 days cycle or 8 mg orally once daily from Day 1 to 21 of 28 days cycle (intermittent dosing). After recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is identified, enrollment of continuous dosing schedule will be open, starting at 8mg. In this cohort, participants will receive 8mg (starting dose) tablet of JNJ42756493 (erdafitinib) orally once daily from Day 1 to Day 28 in a 28-day cycle. Dose of the study medication will be escalated sequentially till the dose limiting toxicity is achieved to determine RP2D.
Part 2: Participants will receive RP2D JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) dose determined in Part 1. Participants who are tolerating study drug treatment and achieve clinical responses or stable disease will continue to receive study drug at the same dose until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.</description>
