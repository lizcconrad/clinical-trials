  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most consistent and distressing symptoms reported by pediatric oncology
      patients. The investigators' work has demonstrated that in the period from diagnosis through
      the initial 8 weeks of treatment, adolescents and young adults with solid tumors experience
      substantial fatigue that is not related to sleep disruption. Fatigue can contribute to many
      adverse outcomes including poor treatment adherence, reduced social activities, depressive
      symptoms, behavior problems, and poorer quality of life. Unfortunately, no definitive
      intervention to reduce fatigue has been developed for pediatric oncology patients.
      Investigators propose a study to estimate the feasibility and acceptability of bright light
      therapy as an intervention to decrease fatigue in adolescents and young adults who are newly
      diagnosed and receiving treatment for solid tumors, including lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>

      This feasibility and acceptability study will assess the rate of consent to, adherence to,
      and side effects from a therapy study in a randomized trial comparing bright white light
      (BWL) to dim red light (DRL). Four questionnaires will be distributed to patients and/or
      their parents, depending upon the questionnaire, to study the fatigue, quality of life, mood
      symptoms, and side effects of the BWL/DRL intervention in adolescents and young adults being
      treated for solid tumors, including lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the feasibility and acceptability of a BWL intervention compared to a DRL
           standard comparison group in adolescent/young adult solid tumor and lymphoma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the effect size of this intervention on measures of fatigue in order to
           design a larger clinical trial of efficacy of a randomized control trial of BWL versus
           DRL intervention for fatigue in pediatric oncology patients.

      OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the effect of participant location (inpatient, hospital-based housing, or home)
           on adherence.

        -  Estimate rates of depressive symptoms.

        -  Describe quality of life.

Fatigue will be measured by self- and parent-report with the 18-item PedsQL™ Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (MFS) that includes three subscales: (1) general fatigue (six items), (2) sleep/rest fatigue (six items), and (3) cognitive fatigue (six items).</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by self- and parent-report with the PedsQL™ Acute Version [34] that includes 4 subscales: (1) physical functioning (eight items), (2) emotional functioning (five items), (3) social functioning (five items), and (4) school functioning (five items) as well as a total score. The Likert scale and scoring method are identical to the MFS, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life. The PedsQL™ will be completed prior to initiation of the intervention, at three time points during the intervention period (14 +/- 3, 28 +/- 3 days, and 42 +/- 3 days) , and at the end of the 60 day intervention/period (days 61-68).</description>

The Litebook® is a small (6×5×1 in.) and lightweight (8 oz.) box and will be fitted with adherence monitors to record at what time and for what duration the light box is turned on. The Litebook® is designed to be placed on a table approximately 18 inches from the participant's head and within 45° of the midline of the visual field. The BWL Litebook® looks identical to the DRL and utilizes 24 white light-emitting diode (LED) lights and does not emit ultraviolet light.</description>
