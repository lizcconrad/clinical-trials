  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) was initially discovered and used as a stimulator of effector T
      lymphocytes (Teffs), but is now viewed as a very promising immunoregulatory drug having the
      capacity to stimulate regulatory T cells (Tregs). At low dose, Il-2 tips the Treg/Teff
      balance towards Tregs. Recently, it has been shown that Tregs of MS patients have reduced
      proliferative potential. MS-IL2 will assess the safety and biological efficacy of low-dose
      IL2 as a Treg inducer in a Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), with the aim to
      stimulate Treg and define potential clinical benefits
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In MS-IL2, 30 RRMS patients will be treated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      clinical trial. IL‐2 will be administered first as an induction course of IL-2 or placebo
      each day for 5 days, followed by a maintenance course at the same dose or placebo every two
      weeks over 6 months.

      The primary efficacy criteria will be the % change from baseline in Treg at day‐5, which is
      indicative of the biological response to IL‐2.

      The secondary efficacy criteria will be (i) the maintenance of regulatory T cells during the
      6 months of treatment with IL-2 vs. placebo and (ii) the stabilization or regression of the
      disease as determined by disease activity parameters assessed by MRI (cumulative number of
      new lesions in T1 enhanced by gadolinium after 6 months) in the groups treated with IL-2
      compared to placebo.

      Expected impact: MS-IL2 will define which patient respond to IL2 and which doses prevent
      relapses in RRMS. In addition, the deep phenomics studies will further provide the foundation
      for a clinical phase II to define clinical efficacy.
