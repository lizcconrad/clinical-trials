  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if a study drug called amyl nitrite can be helpful with
      diagnosing different disorders affecting the lower esophageal sphincter in patients with
      dysphagia (difficulty swallowing foods) undergoing high resolution esophageal manometry
      (HRM).

      Dysphagia may be one of the symptoms of a condition known as idiopathic achalasia. Achalasia
      is a disorder of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.
      This affects the ability of the esophagus to move food toward the stomach. Pseudoachalasia is
      a secondary form of achalasia, which has very similar symptoms but is caused by different
      reasons. Because the treatments for achalasia and pseudoachalasia are different, it is
      important to correctly diagnose each condition. At this time, there is no way to distinguish
      the two with the current tests used at Johns Hopkins.

      Amyl nitrite relaxes vascular smooth muscle and has been studied previously as a potential
      means to separate achalasia from pseudoachalasia. Amyl nitrite is approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cardiac angina. It is not approved for use in
      motility testing and its use in this study is considered investigational. Investigators hope
      that the results from the proposed study could have significant clinical implications for
      patient management by helping doctors distinguish between achalasia and pseudoachalasia and
      allow them to choose appropriate treatment.

      Patients with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing foods) undergoing routinely scheduled high
      resolution esophageal manometry (HRM) may join this study.

      A single center, prospective study at a tertiary-care referral center (JHH). All patients
      will be provided with informed consent to undergo HRM with provocation as part of routine
      care to evaluate dysphagia symptoms or evaluation of known achalasia. All procedures will be
      performed as part of routine care and therefore no procedures will be performed for the
      purposes of research specifically.

      Primary Objective: To determine the diagnostic advantage of the addition of the provocative
      amyl nitrite test in patients with dysphagia undergoing high resolution esophageal manometry
      (HRM)

      Secondary Objective:

        1. Measure change of LES pressure after amyl nitrite inhalation in patients with dysphagia
           undergoing high resolution esophageal manometry (HRM)

        2. To assess the ability of amyl nitrite inhalation to differentiate achalasia from
           pseudoachalasia

        3. To assess the ability of amyl nitrite inhalation to differentiate partial
           fundoplication-related dysphagia versus that due to recrudescence of achalasia in
           patients who have undergone a prior myotomy.

        4. To assess the ability of amyl nitrite inhalation to differentiate post-fundoplication
           dysphagia from a newly diagnosed motility disorder in patients who have undergone a
           fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

    <description>Amyl nitrite is the chemical compound with the formula C5H11ONO. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle.The method of administration is via inhalation with onset of action within of 30 seconds and ends 2-3mins. In a study by Dodds et al., amyl nitrite is used as part of radiologic esophagram test in order to distinguish patients with pseudoachalasia from those with idiopathic achalasia since amyl nitrite has transient effect on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The study revealed that the LES pressure in achalasia patient decreases substantially in response to amyl nitrite with the measurable increase in LES diameter of 3 mm to an average of 4.6m. In contrast, amyl nitrite does not relax the LES segment in pseudoachalasia and has no change in LES diameter. Thus, the investigators anticipate amyl nitrite inhalation will be beneficial at the LES during HREM.</description>
