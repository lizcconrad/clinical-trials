      This study evaluates if dabigatran etexilate is safe for use in patients with Scleroderma and
      Interstitial Lung Disease. All patients will receive 75mg of dabigatran etexilate twice a day
      for 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin and pulmonary fibrosis result in substantial morbidity in scleroderma (SSc).
      Furthermore, interstitial lung disease (ILD) culminating in pulmonary fibrosis is a major
      cause of death among scleroderma patients. Studies implicate the coagulation system, most
      notably the serine protease thrombin, in the pathogenesis of SSc-ILD. Thrombin can transform
      normal lung fibroblasts to a scleroderma fibroblast phenotype. Dabigatran etexilate is a
      selective thrombin inhibitor which is FDA-approved for the prevention of thromboembolic
      complications in patients with atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran etexilate needs to be studied
      as a potential anti-fibrotic agent for the treatment of SSc-ILD. This study is designed to
      see if dabigatran etexilate is safe for use in patients with scleroderma. If so, the long
      term goal of this study is to determine whether or not the fundamental results will translate
      to a potential clinical intervention for SSc-ILD which can be tested in a future randomized
      control trial.

    <description>Subjects taking dabigatran will undergo monthly complete blood counts (white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet), comprehensive metabolic profile (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, protein and albumin), and coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time). Women of child-bearing age will be required to have a urine pregnancy test monthly while receiving dabigatran.</description>

    <description>We will also include investigations of scleroderma skin (skin score and dermal fibroblast biology) together with studies of scleroderma lung fibroblasts, to obtain preliminary estimates of the effectiveness of dabigatran as a potential disease modifying drug for patients with SSc-ILD.</description>
