  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine in combination with
      different adjuvants. Adjuvants are substances that may boost immune responses vaccines. In
      this study, the adjuvants are Montanide ISA-51, polyICLC and cyclophosphamide. This study
      will also evaluate the effects of the combination of the peptide vaccine and the adjuvants on
      the immune system. The investigators will monitor these effects by performing tests in the
      laboratory on participants' blood, a lymph node, and tissue from the sites of vaccination.
