  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare a group of patients with our standard treatment of continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) and another group of patients with CPAP and a humidifier attached. The
      therapy cost and the successfulness of the treatment will be measured. A humidifier is a
      water chamber that is currently added to CPAP only if the patients needs it.
