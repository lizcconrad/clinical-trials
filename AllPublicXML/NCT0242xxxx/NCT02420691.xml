      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take LEE011 capsules by
      mouth 1 time on Days 1-21 of each cycle. You will take LEE011 capsules whole, at about the
      same time each morning, with or without food, with at least 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. Do not
      chew or open the capsules unless a member of the study staff tells you to do so.

      If you forget to take your dose, you can still take the study drug up to 6 hours later. If
      you are more than 6 hours late, wait until your next scheduled dose. If you vomit after
      taking a dose, do not take an extra dose. Tell the study doctor or nurse if you vomit after
      taking LEE011.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are taking drugs to
           prevent blood clots, this blood draw will also be used to check how well your blood
           clots.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG before your dose of LEE011.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG before your dose of LEE011.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are taking drugs to
           prevent blood clots, this blood draw will also be used to check how well your blood
           clots.

        -  You will have an image-guided tumor biopsy for PD testing.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 2 and Day 1 of Cycle 3, you will have an EKG before and up to 4 hours
      after your dose of LEE011.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are taking drugs to
           prevent blood clots, this blood draw will also be used to check how well your blood
           clots.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2, Day 1 of Cycle 4, and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 7, 10, 13,
      and so on), blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for tumor marker testing. If the study
      doctor thinks it is needed, you may have this blood draw performed more frequently. The study
      doctor will discuss this with you.

      Every 3 cycles (Cycles 3, 6, 9, and so on), you will have an MRI, CT, and/or Octreoscan to
      check the status of the disease.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 4-6, you will have an EKG before your dose of LEE011.

      Every 4 cycles (Cycles 4, 8, 12, and so on), blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check
      how much fat and cholesterol is in your blood. You should fast for at least 8 hours before
      this blood draw.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit, unless you
      have side effects.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 28 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG and either an ECHO or a MUGA scan.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests, including a
           test to to check how much fat and cholesterol is in your blood. You should fast for at
           least 8 hours before this blood draw. If you are taking drugs to prevent blood clots,
           this blood draw will also be used to check how well your blood clots.

      If you have any side effects or symptoms, you will either be called by a member of the study
      staff or asked to come into the clinic until the side effects or symptoms are gone or become
      stable. If you are called, each call should last about 10 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. LEE011 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes. The study doctor can explain how the study drug
      is designed to work.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>Overall response is best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Participant's response assignment depends on achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. Progressive disease (PD) defined as appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Response and progression evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (per version 1.1).</description>

    <measure>Clinic Benefit Rate of LEE011 in Participants With Foregut Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinic benefit rate defined as complete response plus partial response plus stable disease with LEE011 among patients with advanced foregut NETs. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR) nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

             magnesium, phosphorus, and total calcium (corrected for serum albumin) must be within
             clinically relevant limits (e.g., a patient can be enrolled if a lab value may be
             outside the normal laboratory range but the abnormality is not clinically relevant or
             can be repleted.)

         10. Negative pregnancy test (serum B-HCG) within 7 days of starting study treatment is
             required in women of childbearing potential. B-HCG may be secreted by a small
             percentage of NETs and be a tumor marker. Thus, NET patients with positive B-HCG are
             eligible if pregnancy can be excluded by vaginal ultrasound or lack of expected
             doubling of B-HCG.

             and/or surgery has been completed and serial evaluation by CT (with contrast
             enhancement) or MRI over a minimum of 3 months demonstrates the disease to be stable
             and if the patient remains asymptomatic, then the patient may be enrolled. Such
             patients must have no need for treatment with steroids or anti-epileptic medications.

          3. Patients with concurrent malignancies or malignancies within 3 years prior to starting

          8. Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not
             recovered from major side effects (tumor biopsy is not considered as major surgery).

          9. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of
             the following: a) History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial

             conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG
             laboratory test (greater than 5 mIU/mL).

         17. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception throughout
             the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly effective
             contraception methods include: Total abstinence when this is in line with the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception; Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
             taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

         18. (continued from above) Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For
             female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
             for that patient; Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c) a. Use
             of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of
             hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example
             hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception b. Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) c. Barrier methods of
             contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository. In case of use of oral
             contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study
             treatment.Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with
             a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.

         19. (continued from above) Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing
             potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
             appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or
             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
             ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

         20. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

         21. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

         22. Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarin-derived anticoagulant for
             treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight
             heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is allowed.
