      Sample collection in healthy subjects, IBD and IBS patients:

        -  biopsy of rectum and colon descendens

        -  blood sample collection

        -  collection of sample of nasal mucosa

        -  feces collection

        -  questionnaires

        -  rectal barostat sensitivity measurement
