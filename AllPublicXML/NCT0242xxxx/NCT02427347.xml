      This subject is a prospective, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled clinical
      trial.120 patients with abdominal obesity are allocated into two groups with a ratio of
      2:1.Randomized series was generated by computer. The allocation was concealed. Patients in
      the intervention group are received acupuncture therapy and healthy education. Patients in
      the control group are only given healthy education. The treatment in both intervention group
      and control group lasts for 8 weeks. Comparison of two groups of patients with abdominal fat
      thickness, fasting serum visfatin concentration, simple anthropometric parameters (including
      body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip radio,
      waist-to-height radio, the percentage of body fat), fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin,
      glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood lipid (total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density
      lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein), uric acid, blood pressure, insulin resistance level,
      and obesity related lifestyle survey.

    <description>Acupuncture needles of 0.3mm in diameter and 100mm in length are inserted into gallbladder-meridian(GB)26 about 25-65mm deep by an angle of 15°, following the path of Dai Meridian (towards medial and downside) . The other acupoints are inserted with needles of 0.25-0.3mm in diameter and 25-40mm in length approximately 10-30mm deep, with an angle of 90°. Electro-acupuncture is applied to both sides of GB26 and stomach-meridian(ST)25: cathode is connected to GB26; anode to ST25. Dense-disperse wave pattern and a wave frequency of 2/100 Hertz is chosen. The intensity of the electro-acupuncture is adjusted on average 4-8 milliampere. The needles are subsequently retained for 20min. The results of the study are based on 8 weeks, each week consisting of 3 sessions.</description>
