      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the highest tolerable dose of
      temsirolimus that can be combined with a stable dose of vorinostat and/or radiation therapy
      and given to patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The safety of this
      treatment combination will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be in 1
      of 2 study groups based on when participant was diagnosed with DIPG:

        -  If participant is newly diagnosed with DIPG, participant will be in Group 1. Participant
           will receive radiation therapy and vorinostat, then the combination of vorinostat and
           temsirolimus.

        -  If participant has been diagnosed with DIPG before and the disease has gotten worse
           since, participant will be in Group 2. Participant will receive the combination of
           vorinostat and temsirolimus without receiving radiation therapy.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Participant will be assigned to a dose level of temsirolimus based on when participant joined
      this study. Up to 2 dose levels of temsirolimus will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be
      enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose
      level. The second group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no
      intolerable side effects were seen.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of vorinostat, though the dose may be
      lowered if there are intolerable side effects.

      Vorinostat should be taken with food. Participant should be careful not to open or break the
      capsules of vorinostat. If a capsule breaks, participant should try to clean it up carefully
      without breathing in any of the powder. Participant should wash the spill area at least 3
      times with ethyl alcohol, and then rinse it 1 time with water. If the powder comes in contact
      with participant's skin, participant should wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and
      water.

      If participant has trouble swallowing, participant may receive vorinostat in liquid form. The
      dose amount will be based on participant's body surface area. The MD Anderson pharmacy will
      give participant the drug in liquid form. Participant should store the liquid form of the
      drug at room temperature, away from excessive heat or humidity. The liquid form of the drug
      should be taken with food.

      Participant should avoid spilling the powder from the capsules or the liquid form of the drug
      on participant's skin. If contact occurs, participant should wash the area thoroughly with
      water.

      Group 1:

      Participant will receive 30 treatments of radiation therapy over 6-7 weeks. Participant will
      sign a separate consent form for this treatment that will explain the procedure, as well as
      its risks and benefits. Participant will take capsules of vorinostat with food, every morning
      that participant has a radiation treatment (Monday - Friday) at least 1-2 hours before
      radiation.

      After participant has finished radiation therapy, participant will rest for 4 weeks in which
      participant does not receive radiation therapy or study drug.

      After this, participant will start receiving the chemotherapy combination of vorinostat and
      temsirolimus in 28-day study cycles:

        -  Participant will take capsules of vorinostat with food 1 time every day on Days 1-8 of
           each cycle.

        -  Participant will receive temsirolimus by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of
           each cycle.

      Group 2:

      Participant will receive the chemotherapy combination of vorinostat and temsirolimus in
      28-day study cycles:

        -  Participant will take capsules of vorinostat with food 1 time every day on Days 1-8 of
           each cycle.

        -  Participant will receive temsirolimus by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of
           each cycle.

      Study Visits for Group 1 during Radiation Therapy:

      Every week:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Study Visits for All Participants during Chemotherapy:

      Every week:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every week during Cycle 1, then at the beginning of every cycle after that, urine will be
      collected for routine tests.

      At the beginning of every odd-numbered cycle (1, 3, 5, and so on), participant will have an
      MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease. If the doctor thinks it is needed, this
      will also include an MRI of the spine. If participant is in Group 2, this will not need to be
      performed at Cycle 1 since participant's screening scans were recently performed.

      Length of Study:

      If participant is in Group 1, participant will receive radiation therapy and chemotherapy for
      up to 7 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of rest, followed by up to 10 cycles of chemotherapy
      alone.

      If participant isin Group 2, participant will receive up to 12 cycles of chemotherapy.

      Participant will no longer be able to receive the study treatment if the disease gets worse,
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Dosing Visi:t After participant has finished receiving chemotherapy, blood (about 1
      teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Follow-Up:

      Participant will have follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after participants' finishes
      receiving chemotherapy. The following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have an MRI of the brain and spine to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests (Month 3
           follow-up visit only).

      This is an investigational study. Vorinostat is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Temsirolimus is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of kidney cancer. The use of these drugs in
      combination is investigational. The radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and
      commercially available methods.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug(s) are designed to work.

      Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
