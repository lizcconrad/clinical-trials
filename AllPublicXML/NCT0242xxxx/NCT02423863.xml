      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of sequential intratumoral (IT) plus
      intramuscular (IM) Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and
      carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC, Hiltonol®) for treatment of study subjects with advanced
      accessible solid tumors

    <textblock>
      Cycle 1, Weeks 1 through 8

      • Weeks 1 and 2 (Days 1, 3 and 5 of each of the two weeks) study subjects receive a priming
      treatment course, which consists of a total of 6 IT injections of 0.5 mg Poly-ICLC into the
      same lesion. A pre-treatment biopsy will be on the day of the first IT injection prior to the
      injection.

      One readily accessible tumor site will be targeted for intra-tumoral injection of Poly-ICLC.

        -  Weeks 3-5, study subjects will receive a boosting treatment course, consisting of IM
           injections of Poly-ICLC twice weekly. A second biopsy will be performed prior to, or
           within 7 days following the last injection of cycle 1. The pre-designated and injected
           target lesion will be biopsied.

        -  Weeks 6-8 will be a rest period with no treatments. A third biopsy of target lesion will
           be performed prior to, or within 7 days of the last IT injection in cycle 2.

      Cycle 2, Weeks 9 through 16

        -  Weeks 9 and 10 study subjects receive a second priming treatment (IT injections thrice
           weekly 10).

        -  Weeks 11-13 study subjects receive a boosting treatment course of 1 mg Poly-ICLC IM
           injections twice weekly. The second cycle IT injections may target a different
           metastatic site at the discretion of the investigator, but a given cycle will only
           target one site with repeated injections.

        -  Weeks 14-16 will be a rest period with no treatments.

      If clinically indicated, as per standard of care, during week 16 study subjects may have a CT
      scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and extremities or neck to assess for response, using
      Immune related Response Criteria (irRC). MRI of the brain may also be obtained as part of
      clinical follow of their disease, as per standard of care. Study subjects who have possible
      progression or inflammatory pseudoprogression of disease but no significant functional
      decline will be kept on study at the discretion of the investigator.

      Cycle 3, Weeks 17 through 26

        -  Weeks 17 and 18 study subjects will receive a third priming treatment (IT injections
           thrice weekly).

        -  Weeks 19-21 study subjects receive another boosting treatment course of 1 mg Poly-ICLC
           IM injections twice weekly) The third cycle IT injections may target a different
           metastatic site at the discretion of the investigator, but a given cycle will only
           target one site with repeated injections.

        -  Weeks 22-26 will be a rest period with no treatments to allow for evaluation of response
           at week 26, in the absence of possible drug induced acute inflammation

      Maintenance Therapy Week 27 through 36 • Weeks 27 to 36 study subjects with complete response
      (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) may be offered maintenance therapy with
      administration of 1 mg IM Poly-ICLC twice weekly. At week 36 a repeat tumor assessment,
      including optional tumor biopsy, will be performed.

      Follow up Period:

      • After completion of treatment subjects may be contacted by telephone twice yearly for up to
      36 months to inquire on their health status (e.g., alive, dead, remission, progressive
      disease, on new cancer treatment). Study subjects with an initial tumor response but then
      long-term recurrence during the follow up period may be offered additional cycles of
      treatment depending on the subject's health status, costs and/or drug availability.

    <time_frame>Evaluation of response at wk 26, in the absence of possible drug induced acute inflammation</time_frame>
    <description>At wk 26 study subjects will be assessed and response determined using the irRC criteria. This will include measurement of accessible lesions as well as CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and extremities or neck to assess for response, using Immune related Response Criteria (irRC). MRI of the brain may also be obtained as part of clinical follow of their disease, if clinically indicated as per standard clinical protocol. Study subject's response will be defined as Disease Control (CR, PR, SD) or PD. If tumors are present and accessible, biopsies of the injected tumor as well as of a non-targeted/non-injected tumor will also be obtained at week 26.</description>

    <description>Study subjects with CR, PR, or SD may be offered maintenance therapy from week 27 to 36, with administration of 1 mg IM Poly-ICLC twice weekly as per below schema. At week 36 a repeat tumor assessment, including optional tumor biopsy, will be performed.</description>
