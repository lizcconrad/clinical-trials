  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new imaging method that will show lymph nodes in the lung
      during lung cancer surgery. The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:

      -- The combination of the FluoSCOPE device and Indocyanine Green
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      Indocyanine Green for your specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are interested in learning how a new
      investigational device, the FluoSCOPE, performs in the operating room. This study will also
      allow the investigators to optimize the settings of the imaging system. The investigators
      hope that this device, along with the local injection of Indocyanine Green around the tumor,
      will help find the sentinel lymph nodes in real-time during the surgery to remove lung
      cancer.

      Although this is the first time the FluoSCOPE is being used in humans, the technology of
      near-infrared fluorescence imaging has been used for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes of
      patients with breast cancer, skin cancer and lung cancer.

    <description>All study interventions will occur intraoperatively during the subject's planned surgery. No deviation from standard of care will be performed with the exception of the following specific interventions:-
Intraoperative injection of indocyanine green (ICG) around tumor and imaging with the FluoSCOPE NIR endoscopic imaging system
Treatment will be administered on an inpatient basis</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible
             to participate in the study:

          -  Participant must have histologically confirmed lung cancer and be deemed an
             appropriate surgical candidate for thoracoscopic lung resection and will have consent
             for a sentinel lymph node mapping by their oncologic surgeon. These patients will have
             invasive non-small cell lung cancers for which thoracoscopic mediastinal lymph node
             dissection at the time of thoracoscopic lung resection is standard of care. The extent
             of lung resections in potential trial patients could span from sublobar resection
             (i.e. wedge resection) to pneumonectomy, though it is anticipated that most patients
             will be undergoing the most common anatomic operation for lung cancer which is
             lobectomy.

        All stages of lung cancer that would otherwise be undergoing thoracoscopic lung resection
        and mediastinal lymph node dissection would be eligible.

          -  Age minimum: 18 years.

          -  The minimum eligible subject age for this trial is 18 years. Individuals older than
             age 18 are typically cared for in adult oncology clinics at our institutions.
             Individuals under the age of 18 are excluded because safety studies including dosing
             or adverse event data in this population are currently not available. Essentially all
             of the patients operated upon for lung cancer at the BIDMC are adult men and women.
             Because of the nature of this disease, we do not anticipate, and will not be,
             enrolling any children into the study.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study.

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to indocyanine green, including those patients with a history of iodide or
             seafood allergy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, as well as those women who are
             breastfeeding, will be excluded from this study. Pregnant women are excluded from this
             study because there is unknown risk associated with ICG (US FDA Risk Category C: there
             are no controlled studies in women, or no studies are available in either animals or
             women). Because there is an unknown, but potential, risk of adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated.

          -  Patients in whom the tumor might not be accessible for peritumoral injection of
             indocyanine green, e.g. small, central tumors.

          -  No other appropriate agent-specific exclusion criteria.
