  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of trivalent, surface
      antigen, inactivated influenza vaccine in 2 age cohorts: 18 to ≤60 years and ≥61 years.

      For the immunogenicity endpoint the antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen will
      be evaluated by means of Single Radial Hemolysis (SRH) or Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) at
      approximately 21 days post vaccination.

      The vaccine composition will be based on the WHO recommended influenza strains for the 2015
      Southern Hemisphere vaccine, and the data from this study are intended to support the use of
      this vaccine in future influenza seasons if the recommended vaccine composition remains the
      same.

    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups with SRH areas ≥25mm^2 against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after receiving one dose of TIV.
The related European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if the percentage of subjects achieving post vaccination SRH areas ≥ 25mm^2 is &gt;70% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;60% for subjects aged ≥61 years.</description>

    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase by SRH area against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after receiving one dose of TIV.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area ≤ 4mm^2 achieving a post vaccination SRH area ≥ 25mm^2. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre-vaccination SRH area &gt; 4mm^2 achieving at least 50% increase in post vaccination SRH area.

    <time_frame>Day 22 post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titers after receiving one dose of TIV.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer &lt;10 and a post vaccination titer ≥40. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer ≥10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post vaccination HI antibody titers.

        <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase by SRH area against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after receiving one dose of TIV.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area ≤ 4mm^2 achieving a post vaccination SRH area ≥ 25mm^2. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre-vaccination SRH area &gt; 4mm^2 achieving at least 50% increase in post vaccination SRH area.
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if &gt;40% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;30% for subjects aged ≥61 years achieve seroconversion or significant increase in post-vaccination SRH areas.</description>

        <title>Percentages of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in HI Antibody Titers After Receiving One Dose of TIV.</title>
        <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titers after receiving one dose of TIV.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer &lt;10 and a post vaccination titer ≥40. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer ≥10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post vaccination HI antibody titers.
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if &gt;40% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;30% for subjects aged ≥61 years achieve seroconversion or significant increase in post-vaccination HI titers.</description>
