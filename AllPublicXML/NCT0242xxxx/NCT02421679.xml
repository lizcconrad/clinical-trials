    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, multicenter, open-label extension study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of TNX-102 SL tablet taken daily at bedtime in patients with Military-Related PTSD
      or related condition. Patients recruited into this trial are those who have successfully
      completed the double-blind study, TNX-CY-P201 (AtEase Study). Patients will not be made aware
      of the therapy they received during the double-blind study.

      The study will consist of 4 clinic visits, including Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Day 0, which
      is anticipated to be the same date as the final visit in the lead-in P201 study) and visits
      after 2, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. The previous requirements in the lead-in study for
      refraining from the use of certain concomitant medications and trauma-focused psychotherapies
      will be relaxed. Patients may continue to take rescue therapy for sleep, as appropriate, or
      they may utilize other medications as needed to help them sleep, per the judgment of the
      investigator.

      Eligible patients who provide written informed consent will take one TNX-102 SL tablet daily
      at bedtime sublingually (under the tongue) for 12 weeks. All patients will be assigned to
      receive tthe same dosage of TNX-102 SL, regardless of their treatment assignment in the
      lead-in study. No patients, investigators, or study staff will know the assigned study
      treatment from the lead-in study, P201, at the time of entry into the extension study.
      Patient data collected at the Week 12 visit (Visit 9) in the lead-in P201 study will be used
      as one of the baseline values for this study.
