      This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in
      approximately 90 subjects with moderate-severe AD Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥12
      and ≤ 48 (0-72 scale). Following a run-in subjects will be randomized to receive either oral
      30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily (od) or placebo od for 8 weeks (56 days).

      This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in
      approximately 90 subjects (60:30 in the active:placebo groups respectively) with a pruritus
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of ≥5 (0-10 scale), an Investigator's Global Assessment
      (IGA) &gt; 3 (0-5 scale) and moderate-severe AD Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥12 and ≤
      48 (0-72 scale). Each subject will have a screening visit(s) to confirm suitability to enter
      the study. At a subsequent visit (start of Run In), the subject will be provided with the
      electronic diary (eDiary) to capture pruritus, sleep disturbance and emollient use, which
      must be completed on Days -7 to -1 (Run In). Subjects will then attend the clinic at Baseline
      (Day 0) when they will be reviewed to confirm they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and have
      completed the Run In diary appropriately. If appropriate, they will then be randomized to
      receive either oral 30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily (od) or placebo od for 8 weeks (56 days).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Males and females aged 18-65 years inclusive with physician documented history or diagnosis
        of atopic dermatitis for at least 12 months prior to screening. Chronic AD should be
        diagnosed by the Eichenfield revised criteria of Hanifin and Rajka (Eichenfield, 2004)

        Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) of ≥12 and &lt;48.

        An Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3 at both Screening and Day 0.

        A mean pruritus score of ≥ 5 on a 0-10 scale over the 7 day Run In (Days -7 to -1)

        Atopic dermatitis affecting ≥10% BSA

        Exclusion Criteria:

        AD of such severity (EASI &gt;48) that the subject could not comply with the demands of the
        study and/or the subject is not a suitable candidate for a placebo-controlled study

        Have concurrent skin disease (e.g. acne) of such severity in the study area that it could
        interfere with the study evaluation or presence of skin comorbidities that may interfere
        with study assessments.

        Have an active skin infection or any other clinically apparent infections.

        Hypersensitivity to mometasone or to any other ingredients contained by the topical
        corticosteroid product used as rescue medication in the study.

        Have received phototherapy (e.g. UVA, UVB), or systemic therapy (e.g. immunosuppressants,
        cytostatics) known or suspected to have an effect on AD, within 4 weeks of the start of the
        Run In.

        Have received systemic corticosteroids ([CS] e.g. oral, intravenous, intraarticular,
        rectal) within 4 weeks of the start of the Run in. Subjects on a stable maintenance dose
        (over the preceding 3 months) of inhaled or intranasal CS may participate.

        Were treated with oral antihistamines or topical calcineurin inhibitors or topical steroids
        within 7 days of starting Run In; intranasal antihistamines for the treatment of allergic
        rhinitis are acceptable.
