      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the dual transcranial direct
      current stimulation(tDCS) improves the swallowing function of stroke patients.

    <textblock>
      120 patients were recruited and randomized to receive either real or sham-tDCS. Real
      experimental groups were divided into three types; Anode-Anode dual stimulation group,
      Anode-Cathode dual stimulation group, Single stimulation group. 20-minutes session of the
      stimulation were applied 5 times a weeks for 2 weeks at pharyngeal motor cortex of affected
      or non-affected site. The patients were evaluated at baseline, immediately and 2 weeks after
      tDCS.
