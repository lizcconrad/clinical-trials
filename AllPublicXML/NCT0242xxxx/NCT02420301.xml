      Objective: To study the effects of self-administered exercises based on tuina techniques on
      the pain intensity caused by playing related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMD) of professional
      orchestra musicians, using numeric visual scale (NVS).

      Method: The investigators performed a prospective, controlled, single-blinded, randomized
      study with musicians suffering from PRMD. n= 69 musicians were randomly distributed into the
      experimental and into the control group. After an individual diagnostic assessment, specific
      tuina self-administered exercises were developed and taught to the participants. Musicians
      were instructed (educated) to repeat the exercises every day during 3 weeks. Pain intensity
      was measured by NVS before the intervention and after the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th
      days of self-exercising. The procedure was the same for the control group, however the Tuina
      exercises were executed in non-acupuncture points
