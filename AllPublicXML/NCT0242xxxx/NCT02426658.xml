  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well pemetrexed disodium works in treating patients
      with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
      performance status of 3. Performance status means how well patients are able to perform daily
      activities and care for themselves. Patients with a performance status of 3 have a limited
      ability to move around. Currently, only patients who are able to perform most of their daily
      activities may receive chemotherapy, due to the side effects it may cause. Pemetrexed
      disodium causes fewer side effects than many chemotherapy drugs and may help treat patients
      with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and a lower performance status.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of single agent pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) on tumor
      progression in ECOG performance status 3 patients with stage IV non-squamous histology
      non-small cell lung cancer in a single arm pilot study.

      II. To evaluate the effect of single agent pemetrexed on quality of life in ECOG performance
      status 3 patients with stage IV non-squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer in a single
      arm pilot study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity associated with single agent pemetrexed on tumor progression in ECOG
      performance status 3 patients with stage IV non-squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer
      in a single arm pilot study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days and then
      every 6 weeks thereafter.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>QOL will be assessed at each treatment time (i.e. every three weeks). A longitudinal mixed models analysis will be used to look at QOL over the time course. A paired t-test will also be calculated to see if the average change is more than 0 (worsening) versus a two-sided alternative that the difference is 0 or better.</description>

    <measure>Time to tumor progression</measure>
    <time_frame>The duration of time from the start of treatment to the time of progression, death, or date of last contact, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>It will be determined whether each patient has a progression (or dies) before or after 12 weeks. A 95% exact (Clopper Pearson) confidence interval will then be around the proportion with PFS greater than or equal to 12 weeks. If this confidence interval includes 50% then that would provide evidence that the therapy is potentially promising. If the upper bound of the confidence interval does not include 50% then this would indicate that the treatment may not be promising for patients. In addition, a Kaplan Meier survival curve will be constructed to describe the time to progression data.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The number and type of toxicities observed during this protocol will be estimated, focusing on unexpected grade 3 or higher toxicities. No formal statistical tests will be done on these estimates.</description>
