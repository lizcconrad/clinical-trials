  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective in this study is to collect post-marketing information on Riociguat
      safety.Thus, the information on adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that
      occur within the first 12 months and in the following 6 -year observation at most, after
      starting Riociguat treatment under the routine clinical practice will be collected.

      The secondary objectives are collecting information on Riociguat effectiveness, such as
      6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) Test. Since it is assumed that Riociguat is for long-term
      use, information on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) clinical worsening will also be
      surveyed once a year.

      This local, prospective, non-interventional, multi-center study includes patients treated
      with Riociguat for PAH. A total of 600 patients (valid for safety analysis) is planned to be
      included in 4 years. This study is performed as an &quot;all-case investigation&quot; therefore; all
      patients who receive Riociguat treatment for PAH need to be registered, in principle. The
      treatment should be performed based on the product label in Japan. The standard observation
      period will last for 12 months from starting Riociguat treatment. Safety and effectiveness
      will be evaluated at the 3rd and 12th month of treatment. In addition, the extension
      observation period will be carried out as long as Riociguat treatment continues or at most
      for more 6 years. The purpose is to collect information on safety and effectiveness, such as
      adverse events and clinical worsening of PAH, once a year. Combining the standard observation
      and the extension observation period the patient could be followed for at most 7 years. When
      Riociguat treatment is terminated, the observation of the patient ends. The investigator
      should record data for each patient, as defined in the protocol, using the Electronic Data
      Capture (EDC) system. The duration of the study is of approximately 8 years from PAH
      indication approval.

        Study population includes patients treated with Riociguat for PAH. This study is performed
        as an all-case investigation. Therefore, all patients who have been treated with Riociguat
        for PAH need to be registered in principle, until the target number of patients reached.
