  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized controlled pilot trial. The investigators will use
      wechat intervening dietary protein intake in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is highly prevalent in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and protein
      malnutrition will adversely affect outcomes. The investigators develop a dietary education
      intervention for PD patients to improve fundamental food knowledge that will increase protein
      intake to target level of 1.2 g/kg of protein intake per day. In additional the dietary
      intervention will provide information about sodium, phosphorus, calcium intake. To more
      effectively deliver the intervention, the investigators explored a technology using social
      media in China called wechat. The purpose of this study is to test whether a dietary
      intervention can be more effective when delivered using wechat compared to a traditional
      patient education intervention delivered during routing clinical visits.
