    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare ultrasound guided peripheral IV placement with and
      without the use of a guidewire. Patients in the Emergency Department with difficult
      peripheral IV access (as defined by 2 failed attempts by nursing staff) will be consented and
      randomized to standard ultrasound guided peripheral IV placement or ultrasound guided
      peripheral IV placement with modified seldinger technique using a guidewire.
