    <description>A questionnaire has been designed to record the opinion of the patient with regard to both devices, in particular how comfortable the devices were to wear. The patient will be asked to rate how comfortable the devices are to wear on a scale of 1-5, 1 being very comfortable and 5 being extremely uncomfortable</description>
