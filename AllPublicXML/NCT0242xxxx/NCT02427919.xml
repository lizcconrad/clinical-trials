  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) is now widely used after
      chemotherapy which complicates hematological toxicity involving neutropenia. As prolonged
      neutropenia leads to neutropenic fever due to bacteremia or fungal infection, the use of
      G-CSF prevents severe infectious complication in various cancer patients.

      In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leukemic blasts have been expected to have G-CSF receptor
      which may be stimulated by G-CSF, and refractory patients were not treated with G-CSF in
      salvage chemotherapy in Catholic blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) Center for a long
      time. This strategy induced prolonged neutropenia and a lot of infectious complications some
      of which led to deaths.

      Although there are some data which remind us G-CSF may proliferate leukemic blasts, the
      investigators also identified several reports which suggested that subgroup with G-CSF use
      showed acceptable CR rate and improved survival outcomes compared to a subgroup without G-CSF
      use.

      Therefore investigators are now trying to identify the effects of G-CSF for refractory AML
      patients in salvage chemotherapy setting regarding the duration of neutropenia and admission,
      incidence of infectious complications and the duration of antibiotics application.
      Furthermore, overall response rate (CR+CRi) after salvage chemotherapy and survival outcomes
      will be calculated according to G-CSF use.

      Also, investigators will detect G-CSF receptor using cluster of differentiation 114 (CD114),
      and analyze the clinical outcomes according to the subgroups with or without using G-CSF
      during neutropenic period.

      Patients will be treated with mitoxantrone and etoposide and cytarabine. Patients will be
      randomly divided according to the usage of G-CSF.

      Subgroup with G-CSF will be treated with G-CSF after 7~10 days post-chemotherapy, when blasts
      will disappear from peripheral blood.

      Subgroup without G-CSF will be observed until 25~28 days post-chemotherapy. If blood counts
      are nor recovered, the investigators can perform bone marrow biopsy to identify the status of
      the bone marrow.

      After then, G-CSF can be applied if blasts are not observed in both peripheral blood and bone
      marrow.

      When absolute neutrophil counts are recovered and there are no evidence of infectious
      complications, patients will discharge safely from hospital.
