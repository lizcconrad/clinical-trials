  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether peri-operative period in neonates and infants
      is associated with an increase in blood biomarkers, specific for neuronal injury, and to
      correlate them with clinical variables and sedative/analgesic agents. Patients, who meet
      inclusion criteria and does not meet exclusion criteria, are enrolled. Blood samples for
      measurement serum concentrations of markers (S100-B and Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE)) are
      drawn before surgery (baseline) and on the 1-st, 2-nd and 3-rd day after surgery. During
      surgery cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) monitoring is continuously applied; rSO2, hemodynamic and
      respiratory values are simultaneously recorded every 5 minutes. Anesthesia, pre and
      postoperative treatment, including analgesia and sedation, are given as per standard of care.

      Retrospective studies have shown that surgery in infancy is associated with worse
      neurodevelopmental outcome, compared to general population. The reasons may be complex, and
      patients at risk are unknown. Brain growth and central nervous system formation are extremely
      active in neonates and infants. Metabolic or circulatory derangement may have negative
      influence on the developing brain. Disease and perioperative period, both may further put
      this population at risk for physiological abnormalities. Near infrared spectroscopy was shown
      to be a convenient method for monitoring of cerebral tissue oxygenation during surgery.

      The great majority of anesthetics and sedative drugs, used in perioperative period, were
      shown to cause neuronal apoptosis in experimental animals. Some studies found that
      neurological marker S-100B increased in cerebrospinal fluid and blood immediately following
      anesthesia in animals. Several clinical studies supported this founding in children following
      cardiac and general surgery.

      The aim of this study is to assess the dynamics of S-100B protein pre- and during 72 hours
      after surgery in neonates and infants aged 1-93 days, operated for
      abdominal/thoracic/urologic malformations/disease. As S-100B in blood may have extracranial
      sources, we simultaneously assess other neuronal marker Neuron-specific Enolase.
