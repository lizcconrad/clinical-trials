  <brief_title>Effect of RNS60 on the Late Phase Asthmatic Response to Allergen Challenge</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase IIa Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Effects of Multiple Doses of Inhaled RNS60 and Budesonide on the Late Phase Asthmatic Response to Allergen Challenge in Patients With Mild Asthma. (This Study Has Been Amended to no Longer be a Cross Over Study; it Will be a Parallel (RNS60/Placebo) 1 Period Study and no Longer Involves the Administration of Budesonide)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effect of treatment with RNS60 for 21 days. Subjects' FEV1
      will be measured after an inhaled allergen challenge at baseline and again after 21 days of
      treatment.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study in approximately 32 male and female
      subjects with mild asthma. Each subject will receive either the experimental or the placebo,
      administered as a nebulized dose twice daily for 21 days.
