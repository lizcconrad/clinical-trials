    <textblock>
      Hypertension contributes to significant burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in low and
      middle-income countries; however responses to CVDs are inadequate particularly due to lack of
      conclusive evidence on population based approach to hypertension control. This is a community
      based cluster randomized trial involving family based health education through female
      community health volunteers in Nepal. People ≥25 years of age and who are listed in the voter
      list 2006 of Electoral Commission of Nepal who were either hypertensive, pre-hypertensive or
      normotensive are eligible for eligible for participation in the study. A computer generated
      random codes will be used to divide clusters into treatment and control arm. FCHVs will
      conduct family based health education and blood pressure measurements in the treatment arm vs
      not any interventions in control arm. Independent assessors will conduct the baseline and end
      line assessment of the intervention. Intention to treat analysis and per protocol analysis
      will be used in analysis to detect significant differences between treatment and control
      group participants at baseline and follow up. Student t-tests for normally distributed
      variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables will be used. In the event that
      randomization do not control for differences between the treatment and control groups on
      baseline characteristics, the investigators will statistically control for those differences
      in subsequent analysis of program effects. The final outcome will be modeled by using
      multiple linear regressions analysis. The investigators hope that if the intervention
      outcomes shows positive effects in treatment arm, this approach can be adopted into the
      existing health care delivery system in Nepal. Assessing the FCHVs' ability may further
      contribute to developing a policy that can be scaled-up to a national level. The lessons
      learned from this project may also be replicated in rural areas and similar settings
      elsewhere in the world.
