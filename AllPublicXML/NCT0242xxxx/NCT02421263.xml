  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current protocol is a pilot study of the effects and possible utility of
      psilocybin-facilitated experiences for professional religious leaders. We hypothesize that
      religious professionals, given their interests, training, and life experience, will be able
      to make nuanced discriminations of their psilocybin experiences, thus contributing to the
      scientific understanding of mystical-type experience. As we better characterize the
      phenomenology of psilocybin-induced mystical experiences, we may apply this knowledge to
      improve potential treatment studies in the future. A primary objective is to investigate
      changes in psychological functioning, spirituality, health, well-being, prosocial attitudes
      and behavior in professional religious leaders that may occur after receiving psilocybin
      under supportive conditions. A secondary objective is to determine whether participants who
      report having had the strongest mystical-type effects during psilocybin sessions will show
      the largest positive changes in the Interim Questionnaire.

      This randomized-controlled pilot study uses a wait-list control design. A wait-list design
      includes a control group that is assigned to a waiting list to receive an intervention after
      the active treatment group does. In this study, the active group will receive the psilocybin
      at weeks 5 and 9 and the wait-list control group will receive psilocybin at weeks 30 and 34.
      The wait-list control group serves the purpose of providing an untreated comparison for the
      active treatment group, while at the same time allowing the wait-list participants an
      opportunity to obtain the intervention at a later date.

      This study's procedures include screening, preparatory meetings, psilocybin sessions, and
      follow-up assessments. A large battery of behavioral and psychological measures will be
      assessed throughout. The study team will consent and enroll up to 86 subjects to obtain a
      total of 12 completer participants as well as 2-3 family members or friends per study
      participant who can assess said completers on the Observer Rating Form (COM-R). This number
      will account for screen-failures and dropouts as well. The 12 participants will be randomly
      assigned to either an immediate participation group (N=6) or a 6-month delayed participation
      group (N=6). Although statistical power calculations show that 12 participants will be
      sufficient to detect the major effects anticipated in this study, the sponsor of this study
      (The Council on Spiritual Practices) is concurrently funding Johns Hopkins University School
      of Medicine to conduct a methodologically identical study with 12 additional participants
      (IND #59009). This will permit the two sites to collaborate post study completion and combine
      the data from the two studies to provide statistical power to detect even more subtle effects
      of the psilocybin intervention. Twelve volunteers (6 from each group) will participate at
      Johns Hopkins and 12 at New York University. Randomization and data analysis will be
      conducted at New York University.

                  seeking religious/spiritual guidance or support.

               -  During the next two years there is no foreseen likelihood for a major potentially
                  life-altering event for her or himself or a close family member (e.g. retirement
                  or major career change for the volunteer; life-threatening illness of a spouse or
                  child of the volunteer)

               -  Agree to consume approximately the same amount of caffeine-containing beverage
                  (e.g., coffee, tea) that he/she consumes on a usual morning, before arriving at
                  the research unit on the mornings of psilocybin session days. If the participant

                  on session days.

               -  Agree to refrain from using any psychoactive drugs, including alcoholic beverages

                  is caffeine. Participants will be required to be either a non-smoker or a
                  non-daily smoker.

                  enrolling volunteers with no prior use. If we decide to enroll a volunteer with
                  prior use, preference will be given for those who report the fewest exposures or
                  the least enduring effects from such use.
