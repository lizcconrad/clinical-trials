  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Aysis® Cs2 ventilator offers an automated control of end-tidal inhalation anesthetic
      concentration, the EtControl® mode. A low Fresh Gas Flow (FGF) (0.5L/min) is kept during the
      maintenance of the anesthesia, decreasing the expensive consumption of halogenated agents.

      The Perseus® A 500 offers a VaporView® mode that gives the evolution of inspired (Fi) and
      end-tidal (Fe) fractions of halogenated agents for 20 minutes based on the delivered fraction
      (Fd). FGF remains adjusted manually by the practitioner. This mode also makes it possible to
      maintain a low FGF (0.5 L/min), provided the halogen Fd is set to maintain a steady Fe curve.

      The goal of this work was to compare the maniability of the intraoperative administered
      concentrations and the consumption of Desflurane between these 2 modalities of
      administration.
