  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Agility fatigue index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4h post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Agility fatigue index (FI) will be calculated from Repeat Agility Performance Test, using 'Brower equipment'. This assessment includes a 24 meter agility run, repeated on 6 occasions, with every sprint and recovery interval lasting for 65 seconds (eg. if the first agility effort takes the participant 5 seconds, they will have 55 seconds to return to start line for a 5 seconds countdown before their second agility effort). Agility FI=[100X(total agility time÷ideal agility time)]-100. Here, ideal agility time is the best agility time for each participant multiplied by number of repetitions</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Speed fatigue index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4h post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Speed fatigue index (FI) will be calculated from Repeat Sprint Performance Test, using 'Brower equipment'. This assessment includes a 30 meter sprint, repeated on 6 occasions, with every sprint and recovery interval lasting for 65 seconds (eg. if the first sprint takes the participant 5 seconds, they will have 55 seconds to return to start line for a 5 second countdown before their second sprint). Speed FI=[100X(total speed time÷ideal speed time)]-100. Here, ideal speed time is the best speed time for each participant multiplied by number of repetitions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Mean power output</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4h post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mean power output (MPO) will be calculated from Wingate Anaerobic Test, using 'Cycle ergometer'. The participant is allowed to pedal at a constant pace, without resistance and then with additional weights (resistance). This is repeated on three occasions. Overall MPO=(sum of MPO from 3 repetitions at baseline)-(sum of MPO from 3 repetitions at post treatment).</description>
