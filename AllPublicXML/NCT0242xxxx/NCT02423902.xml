    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase Ib/II study to examine the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      efficacy of one cycle of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy in women with advanced breast cancer and
      pre-study SD or PR after completion of a minimum 12 week course of standard first- or
      second-line chemotherapy. The patient population will include patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic breast cancer of all subtypes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who have PD or a CR after the standard chemotherapy are not eligible for the study.
      Following entry into the trial, patients will go on a treatment holiday from chemotherapy and
      enter an immunotherapy phase of treatment. Continuation of HER2-targeted antibody therapy is
      permitted during this immunotherapy phase for women with HER2+ disease. Scans will be
      conducted at 6 and 12 weeks after the start of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy to determine tumor
      response. Radiographic PD at week 6 must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later, either at week
      12 or earlier if clinically necessitated.
