      The study is an observational non-randomised controlled study comparing the visual acuity
      after implantation of the POD 26% FINEVISION TORIC with respect to the POD 26% TORIC This
      study includes both eyes of 24 patients implanted with the POD 26%FineVision Toric (group 1:
      12 patients) and the POD 26% Toric (group 2: 12 patients) .

      The study primary goal is to compare the near visual acuity in both groups. Distance and
      intermediate visual acuities, defocus curve, refraction and straylight will be compared.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The visual acuity at near of the POD 26% FINEVISION TORIC with respect to the POD 26% TORIC is improved of at least LogMAR 0.2.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary objective is to measure far and intermediate visual acuity, the refraction, centration, rotational stability and to determine the amount of photic phenomena for both IOLs: POD 26% FINEVISION TORIC and POD 26% TORIC.</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient older than 50 years old

          -  Regular corneal astigmatism &gt;1.0 dioptres by IOL Master (regularity determined by the
             topography of the keratometry).

          -  Regular corneal astigmatism &lt;2.5 dioptres by IOL Master (regularity determined by the
             topography of the keratometry).

          -  Group 1: patients after cataract surgery with Fine Vision toric implanted in both eyes

          -  Group 2: patients after cataract surgery with Ankoris implanted in both eyes

          -  Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • - Irregular astigmatism

          -  Difficulty for cooperation (distance from their home, general health condition)

          -  Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results
             (e.g. diabetes mellitus (with retinopathy), immunocompromised, glaucoma etc…)

          -  Any ocular comorbidity

          -  History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery including refractive procedures

          -  Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of
             the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome, chronic Uveitis, Marfan's syndrome)

          -  Pupil abnormalitis (non-reactive, tonic pupils, abnormally shaped pupils or pupils
             that do not dilate under mesopic/scotopic conditions)
