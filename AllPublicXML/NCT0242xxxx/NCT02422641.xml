    <textblock>
      Management of leptomeningeal disease (LMD) in patients with metastatic breast cancer is an
      area of unmet clinical need. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is known to have activity
      against breast cancer and in contrast to other systemic chemotherapeutics, it penetrates the
      blood brain barrier, targets areas of poor cerebrospinal fluid flow, may penetrate bulky
      leptomeningeal disease, and provide treatment to systemic disease burden. While two
      retrospective studies have suggested activity of HD-MTX in LMD in patients with breast
      cancer, no prospective data are available to inform its inclusion in treatment regimens.
      Thus, while HD-MTX is included in the NCCN Guidelines for LMD and while it is used to varying
      degrees in cancer centers across the nation, this is more representative of the lack of
      available therapies for LMD as opposed to strong evidence-based data. This phase II,
      prospective study will evaluate systemic, intravenous HD-MTX in breast cancer patients with
      leptomeningeal metastasis with or without brain parenchymal metastasis.

      BACKGROUND:

      Management of LMD in patients with metastatic breast cancer is an area of unmet clinical
      need. Increased survival in the era of hormonal and HER2 directed therapies has further
      heightened the need for more effective therapies against the late complications of metastatic
      disease. Prognosis is dismal with median survivals ranging from 6-8 weeks in untreated
      patients and with little improvement having been demonstrated over the past 20 years.

      Recently, there has been renewed interest in systemic chemotherapeutic options in these
      patients. Incorporation of systemic therapies into standard treatment algorithms has been
      limited as many agents have not been shown to adequately penetrate the blood brain barrier.
      High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), however, is unique in that it does penetrate the blood brain
      barrier. In fact, evidence suggests that it may target areas of poor cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) flow, penetrate bulk disease, and provide treatment to systemic disease burden.
      Methotrexate is a drug known to have activity against breast cancer and has been used in
      combination with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil as part of a standard adjuvant treatment
      regimen.

      Currently, HD-MTX is included in the NCCN Guidelines for LMD and is used intermittently at
      Johns Hopkins and cancer centers across the nation for LMD in breast cancer. These
      recommendations, however, are more representative of the lack of available therapies for LMD
      as opposed to strong evidence-based data. Only two retrospective studies have suggested that
      HD-MTX may be an effective option for treating central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, both
      with substantial methodological limitations.

      STUDY OBJECTIVE This phase II, prospective study will evaluate systemic, intravenous
      high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) in breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis
      (LMD). The primary objective is to determine if treatment with systemic intravenous HD-MTX
      will result in an overall survival (OS) exceeding 12 weeks among patients with triple
      negative, HER2-positive, and hormone refractory metastatic breast cancer patients with LMD
      with and without parenchymal brain involvement.

    <description>The primary endpoint is survival at 12 weeks from first date of treatment. For the primary analysis, this will be dichotomized according to whether the patient achieves an OS greater than 12 weeks (i.e. survival rate). This cutoff has been selected based on reported OS data in historical controls.</description>

    <description>Progression free survival as defined as the time from first date of treatment to the time of systemic or neurologic progression of disease whichever occurs first. Neurologic progression will be defined as the minimum of clinical or radiographic progression. Clinical neurologic progression will be defined by neurologic examination demonstrating objective, new neurologic deficit attributable to the underlying LMD. Radiographic progression (neurologic or systemic) will be defined by RECIST criteria.</description>

          -  HORMONE REFRACTORY: Patients with ER/PR-positive disease according to ASCO-CAP
             guidelines above may be considered if they have disease progression after two lines of
             hormonal therapy (administered in the adjuvant or metastatic setting), or are deemed
             clinically hormone-resistant taking into consideration the rate of progression of
             disease or a short interval of time on first line hormonal therapy before progression.
             Clinically hormone-resistant patients MUST also be discussed with the Study Chair,
             Study co-Chair or designee in advance for approval.

        at least 1% positive tumor nuclei in the sample on testing in the presence of expected
        reactivity of internal (normal epithelial elements) and external controls. HER2-positive is
        defined as HER2 IHC 3+, ISH ≥ 2.0, or average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals.

        NOTE: A patient who has a change in receptor status (e.g. PR negative to positive) may be
        stratified as triple negative or hormone positive, contrary to the most recent receptor
        testing, for the purposes of the study, based upon the clinical course at the discretion of
        the Study Chair, Study co-Chair, or designee in advance for approval.

          -  Uncontrolled or progressive systemic disease or other concurrent condition which in
             the Investigator's opinion makes HD-MTX an undesirable treatment option for the

          -  Contraindication to MRI

          -  Use of salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or sulfonamide medications

          -  Patients with significant visceral fluid collections including ascites, pericardial
             effusions, pleural effusions or others may experience delayed clearance of
             methotrexate because of third space accumulation which could result in methotrexate
             toxicity and inability tolerate the proposed study treatment. While these are not
             absolute exclusions the Study Chair or co-Chairs should be contacted to discuss
             possible enrollment. Patients with significant ascites defined as European Association
             for the Study of the Liver &gt; grade 2, or with asymptomatic pleural effusions with an
             estimated size &gt;200 mL, or with symptomatic pleural effusion of any size will be
             excluded.
