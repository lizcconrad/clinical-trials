  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are mainly caused by tobacco, alcohol
      consumption and betel nut chewing and the sixth most common cancer in the world. Despite
      significant advances in the treatment modalities involving surgery, radiotherapy, and
      concomitant chemoradiotherapy, the 5-year survival rate remained below 50% for the past 30
      years.

      The worse prognosis of these cancers must certainly be linked to the fact that HNSCCs
      strongly influence the host immune system. During this process, mesenchymal tumor-like cells
      are highly mobile and enter quickly adjacent structure (intravasation), from where they
      travel through lymphatic and blood vessels as circulating tumor cells (CTC), which are single
      cells with malignant potential detected in the peripheral bloodstream and essential for
      establishing metastasis.

      Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) play pivotal roles in regulating host immune
      responses. Substantial evidence has demonstrated that PD-L1 can deliver an inhibitory signal
      to PD-1 expressing T cells, leading to suppression of the immune response by inducing
      apoptosis, energy, unresponsiveness and functional exhaustion of T cells. However, the
      inhibitory effects of this pathway on the function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the main
      effector cells in HNSCC patients, are not well defined.

      In this study aims to solve two main problems: one is to improve and try to optimize current
      protocols of CTC isolations based on the investigator previous work, which is one of most
      challenging problems in CTC field to date; the other is to understand the status of immune
      system in HNSCC patients, especially focusing on PD-1-PD-L1 pathway and its expressions.
      After series basic experiments of immune cell analysis and conditional adjustment of CTC
      isolation protocols, the investigator are willing to isolate CTCs and immune cells at a
      single blood drawing at the same time. A prospective trial will be conducted to elucidate the
      roles of PD-1 expression lymphocytes and CTC numbers on the clinical outcomes of HNSCC
      patients.
