      Background: The use of low-dose continuous infusion of S(+)-ketamine combined with
      target-controlled intravenous anesthesia with remifentanil and propofol may be related to the
      control of postoperative pain and of opioid-induced hyperalgesia. The present study aimed to
      evaluate the efficacy of continuous infusion of S(+)-ketamine given intraoperatively in the
      control of postoperative pain compared to placebo.

      Methods: This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial with 48 patients of both genders
      aged from 18 to 65 years who underwent videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy. After venipuncture,
      patients received intravenous parecoxib sodium (40 mg). Target-controlled intravenous
      anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil associated with rocuronium and adjusted
      to maintain the bispectral index between 35 and 50. The S(+)-ketamine group (SG) group
      received a continuous infusion of S(+)-ketamine at a dose of 0.3mg.kg-1.h-1, while the
      placebo group (PG) received a continuous infusion of saline at the same dose. Postoperative
      analgesia was measured by a verbal numerical scale (VNS) from 0 to 10 during 12 hours and
      treated with morphine when VNS score was equal to or higher than 3 at a dose of 0.05 mg.kg-1
      when the patient reported pain for the first time and at a dose of 0.025mg.kg-1 on subsequent
      occasions. Pain scores were recorded in the postoperative care unit (PACU) and at 4 and 12
      hours after the end of the surgery The amount of morphine used during PACU stay, from PACU
      discharge to 4 hours after surgery, and from 4 to 12 hours after surgery, the overall dose of
      morphine used, and possible adverse effects were also assessed
