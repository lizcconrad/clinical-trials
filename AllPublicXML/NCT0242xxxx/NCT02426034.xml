  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single arm study is to assess the safety and efficacy of ATAN (Apatinib)
      in patients with Chemo-refractory Advanced or Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of Stomach or
      Gastroesophageal Junction in clinical practice. ATAN will be given to patients who had failed
      at least two lines of prior chemotherapy. Eligible patients will receive ATAN treatment (850
      mg qd p.o.) continually until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or patients
      withdrawal of consent, and the target sample size is 2000+ individuals.
