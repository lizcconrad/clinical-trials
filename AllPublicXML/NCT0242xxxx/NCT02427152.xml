  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is considered to be caused by an imbalance between energy expenditure and energy
      intake. A major determinant of our daily energy intake is the size of the meals that we
      consume. It has been suggested that decisions about portion sizes are often made in advance,
      before a meal begins. This pre-meal planning is considered to especially depend on the
      estimated 'expected satiety' and 'expected satiation' of different foods. Further, also
      factors like weight concern and palatability of the food might have their influence on meal
      size selection. In general, it is not clear how these factors are integrated during pre-meal
      planning and which brain networks are involved in these decisions/this process. Thus, the
      investigators plan to study pre-meal planning in healthy, normal-weight and overweight/obese
      individuals with functional magnetic resonance imaging under different cognitive instructions
      including pleasure, expected satiety and self-control in terms of health consequences. The
      investigators will explore the neural networks involved in pre-meal planning and expect them
      to be modulated by the before mentioned factors. Further, the investigators plan to explore
      gender differences and expect that female subjects will select smaller portion sizes
      especially in the self-control condition as they are often more concerned about their
      weight/health. Finally, the investigators will explore differences between lean and
      overweight subjects to elucidate factors that might lead to increased meal sizes in
      overweight subjects.
