    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of oral BG00012 as compared with
      placebo in pediatric subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The
      secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BG00012 and
      to compare the effect of BG00012 with placebo on additional clinical and radiological
      measures of disease activity.
