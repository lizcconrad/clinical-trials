  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tourniquets are still widely used in total knee arthroplasty, but are associated with several
      adverse effects. Most of previous studies did not randomize the participants so the baseline
      difference of the patients might have influenced the outcome. Therefore, investigators
      conducted a randomized controlled trial, in which all the patients received staged bilateral
      TKA with two different durations of tourniquet use. Investigators aimed to quantify the
      effect of tourniquet use on reducing blood loss and to evaluate the impact of tourniquet use
      on functional and clinical outcome.

      Fifty participants who underwent staged bilateral TKA were recruited in this study. On one
      side, the tourniquet was inflated immediately before incision and deflated after the
      hardening of the cement. On the other side the tourniquet was inflated immediately before
      cement application and deflated after its hardening. Blood loss, operating time, transfusion
      rate, postoperative pain, limb swelling, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence and clinical
      outcomes were monitored for comparison.
