      The primary objective is to demonstrate improved A1c in study subjects with type 1 and type 2
      diabetes using the OneTouch Verio® Flex BGM and the OneTouch Reveal® Mobile APP system over a
      period of 24 weeks, compared to subjects using the OneTouch Verio® Flex BGM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has an A1c ≥7.5 and ≤ 11.0% at screening visit;

          -  It is medically appropriate in the opinion of the investigator for the Subject to
             attempt to achieve a level of glycemic control in line with the ADA guidelines on
             glyceamic recommendations (&lt;7.0% A1c, pre-prandial capillary glucose of 3.9-7.2mmol/l
             and peak post-prandial glucose of &lt;10.0mmol/l);

          -  Diagnosed with T2DM or T1DM for ≥ 3 month prior to screening;

          -  Currently performing SMBG at home for diabetes management decisions and willing to
             test SMBG ≥ 1 per day if subject has Type 2 diabetes and is on AHA and/or non-insulin
             injectable (e.g. GLP-1) only, ≥ 2 per day if on basal insulin or premixed insulin; and
             test ≥ 3 times per day if subject has Type 2 diabetes and is on MDI or subject has
             Type 1 diabetes.

          -  Willing to send and receive SMS messages using a sponsor smartphone at 2 weekly
             intervals throughout the study (note: this inclusion applies to all subjects

             screening; (Note: the definition of stable includes subjects who routinely self-adjust
             insulin based on 'in the moment' SMBG values. Stable does not include actual diabetes
             therapy changes (e.g. new oral medications, initiating insulin or changing insulin
             regimen, insulin to carb ratio changes or basal to bolus insulin progression)

             feeding;

          -  Has unstable (rapidly progressing) retinopathy that in the opinion of the study staff
             may require surgical treatment (including laser photocoagulation) during the study

          -  Is currently on or received treatment during the past 3 months with Systemic
             corticosteroids or anti-psychotic drugs or prescription cannabinoid

          -  Is currently psychiatrically unstable in the opinion of the study staff

          -  Has known clinically significant and/or unstable medical conditions, in the opinion of
