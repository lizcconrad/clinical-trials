      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a combination of ibrutinib and
      rituximab plus the combination of 2 different intensive chemotherapy regimens can help to
      control MCL. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of patients with MCL. Rituximab is FDA approved for the treatment of
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain types of leukemia. Using these 2 drugs in combination with
      each other is investigational. All of the drugs in Part 2 are standard of care for the
      treatment of lymphoma.

      Up to 131 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      This study will have 2 Parts.

      If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will begin Part 1 of the study.

      At any time you may be given other drugs to help prevent or decrease side effects, such as
      nausea and vomiting. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are
      given and their risks.

      Part 1:

      Part 1 will last up to 12 cycles. Each cycle is 28 days.

      Every day you will take 4 ibrutinib capsules with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. You must
      take all 4 capsules at about the same time every day, at least 30 minutes before or at least
      2 hours after eating a meal. Do not open the capsules or dissolve them.

      If you miss a dose, you can take it up to 6 hours after the time you would have taken it. If
      it is later than 6 hours, you should skip the dose and start taking the capsules at the same
      time as usual the next day.

      You will need to fill out diary cards with information about when you take ibrutinib. You
      should bring the diary cards with you to appointments.

      On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, you will receive rituximab by vein. The first dose
      should take about 6-8 hours. After that, each dose should take about 4 hours.

      You will then receive rituximab by vein over 4 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 3-12. You will not
      receive the drug in Cycle 2.

      For some patients, you may receive the rituximab dose over 2 days. Your doctor will tell you
      if this is best for you.

      You will be checked every 2 cycles to learn how you may be responding. Based on your
      response, you may start Part 2 of the study.

      Part 2:

      During part 2, depending on your response in Part 1, you will receive 2 alternating
      combinations of drugs (the first combination in the first cycle, then the second combination
      in the second cycle, and so on) for 2-8 cycles. Each cycle will be 28 days.

      First combination:

      You will receive the following drugs during the odd-numbered cycles (Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7)
      of Part 2:

        -  Rituximab by vein over 6 hours on Day 1

        -  Dexamethasone either by mouth or by vein on Days 1-4 vCyclophosphamide by vein (over 3
           hours each time) 2 times each day on Days 2-4

        -  Mesna by vein non-stop on Days 2-4

        -  Doxorubicin by vein over 24 hours on Day 5

        -  Vincristine by vein over 15-30 minutes on Day 5

      To help prevent infections, you will also receive Filgrastim (G-CSF) injections just under
      your skin, starting at 24-36 hours after the end of the doxorubicin infusion. You will
      continue to receive these injections every day until your white blood cell counts recover.

      Second combination:

      You will receive the following drugs during the even-numbered cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8)
      of Part 2:

        -  Rituximab by vein over 6 hours on Day 1

        -  Methotrexate by vein over 24 hours on Day 2

        -  Cytarabine by vein (over 2 hours each time) 2 times each day on Days 3-4

      When you receive methotrexate, you will also be given leucovorin by mouth to help prevent
      side effects. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn 24 and 48 hours after the end of the
      methotrexate infusion so that the study doctor can learn when it is best to stop giving you
      leucovorin.

      You will again receive G-CSF after doxorubicin until your white blood cell counts recover.

      Study Visits in Part 1:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine
           pregnancy test.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration
           to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan to check the status
           of the disease.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam.

      On Day 1 of every odd-numbered cycle (Cycles 3, 5, 7, and so on), if the study doctor thinks
      it is needed, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      If your CT scan shows that the disease has gotten better, you will have a PET/CT scan at the
      end of Part 1.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed based on the results of your screening bone marrow biopsy
      and/or colonoscopy, these tests will be repeated at the end of Part 1.

      Study Visits in Part 2:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine
           pregnancy test.

      Up to 3 times a week from Days 8-28 of all Cycles, you will have a blood (about 2 tablespoons
      each time) drawn for routine tests.

      At the end of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, and then every 3-6 cycles after that, you will have a CT
      scan and chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs in Part 1 for up to 12 cycles. You may continue
      taking the study drugs in Part 2 for up to 8 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you finish taking the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan and/or bone marrow
           biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine
           pregnancy test.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      After your end-of-treatment visit and if the disease has not gotten worse, you will return
      for a clinic visit every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      every year after that to see how you are doing. At these visits:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  You will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

             inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel obstruction, or any other
             gastrointestinal condition that could interfere with the absorption and metabolism of
             ibrutinib.

          9. Major surgery within 4 weeks of initiation of therapy. Clearance letter from primary
             physician required.

         10. Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonist.

         11. Requires treatment with strong Cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) inhibitors

         12. Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV heart failure,
             myocardial infarction in the preceding 6 months, and significant conduction
             abnormalities, including but not limited to 2nd degree atrioventricular block (AV
             block) type II, 3rd degree block, QT prolongation (QTc &gt; 500 msec), sick sinus
             syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, symptomatic bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 bpm),
             hypotension, light headedness and syncope. Patients with persistent and uncontrolled
             atrial fibrillation will be excluded. The protocol excludes patients who have recently
             had a stent and by recommendation of their cardiologist need to stay on anticoagulants
             such as warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonist.

         13. Acute infection requiring treatment (IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals)
