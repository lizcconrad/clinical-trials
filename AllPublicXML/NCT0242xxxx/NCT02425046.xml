    <textblock>
      Low-income children and children of obese parents are at high risk of obesity. Effective
      interventions are needed to target these families to improve the health of the parents and
      prevent obesity in the children. The hypothesis is that an intervention that combines
      engagement of community organizations, motivational interviewing (MI, a technique proven to
      help people set goals that are personally meaningful), and resource mobilization will change
      diet and physical activity habits among disadvantaged families. This proposal grew from an
      established community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership between the research
      team and community organizations that serve high minority (45-55%), low-income populations.
      Partners include a community health center, a food pantry network, a work-force training
      program, and other agencies. These partners designed and implemented a successful pilot
      project on which this proposal is based. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) To
      evaluate the efficacy of a family-targeted obesity intervention based on MI and
      resource-mobilization. Hypotheses: In comparison to control families, families participating
      in the intervention will demonstrate a) a reduction in BMI for adults, b) an increase in
      minutes of moderate physical activity and decreased sedentary time for both adults and
      children accelerometer), and c) a reduction in the number of obesity risk behaviors and an
      increase in obesity prevention behaviors among children. 2) To examine the mediators of
      intervention effects. 3) Identify the types of resources needed most often by intervention
      families to support lifestyle change. This randomized controlled trial includes 260
      low-income families that contain at least one obese adult and one normal or overweight child
      between 6 and 12. The 12-month intervention has two elements. 1) A health coach will use MI
      to help families explore ambivalence toward and motivations for change and set goals for
      improving diet and physical activity. 2) To support goals, families will be connected with
      community agencies that can assist with general (e.g., financial) and goal specific resources
      (e.g., food, physical activity opportunities). Collaboration between organizations will
      streamline referrals, maximize resources, and facilitate access. Control families will get a
      basic screen for needs and information about available community resources. Outcomes are
      measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. This intervention is innovative in that it 1)
      focuses on lifestyle changes for the entire family and measures outcomes in adults and
      children, 2) combines MI focused on the entire family and community resource referrals
      specific to family needs and goals for change, 3) partners community organizations to
      coordinate resources for families, and 4) involves partners in all research phases via a CBPR
      approach. This contribution will be significant because the proposed intervention, if
      successful, can be replicated elsewhere and adapted to the local resource environment to
      address adult obesity and prevent childhood obesity in a high-risk population. The study will
      also identify the types of resources low-income families need to change diet and physical
      activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  one parent must have a BMI of 30 or above, and be parent or guardian of at least one
             child

          -  between the ages of 6 and 12. Children this age are targeted because they benefit most
             from parental involvement

          -  are old enough to participate in family goal setting and activities, but young enough
             to be heavily influenced by family environment.

          -  a child must live with the obese parent at least 80% of the time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  obese adults or index children with a medical condition or medication that
             significantly alters their

               1. ability to follow the dietary recommendations (e.g., renal diet, severe food
                  allergy, celiac disease)

               2. mobility (e.g. bed bound or unable to participate in any sort of physical
                  activity even with assistive devices), or

               3. weight

          -  additionally we will exclude those who have a significant psychiatric disease,
             substance abuse disorder or cognitive impairment that would interfere with their
             ability to participate

          -  those with controlled or mild depression would not be excluded

          -  adults with hypertension, type II diabetes, or glucose intolerance will not be
             excluded, as advocated changes are consistent with their needs

          -  no data will be collected from nonindex children who meet the exclusion criteria.

          -  obese adults who are currently pregnant at baseline will be excluded because of their
             altered weight and dietary patterns. If the obese adult becomes pregnant during the
             intervention their family will be allowed to continue in the intervention but the
             pregnant adults' anthropometric data will not be collected.

          -  the intervention will intentionally target low-income families through recruitment
             site choices but will not exclude or include families based on income requirements.

          -  pregnant women will not be targeted but may be included if not the obese adult (see
             above).

          -  weight, height, waist circumference and bioelectrical impedance will not be collected
             on pregnant women.
