    <textblock>
      Clinical social workers and other staff providing direct care to individuals experiencing
      homelessness face multiple challenges in obtaining training and implementing evidence-based
      practices in diverse community settings. Critical Time Intervention (CTI) is an increasingly
      popular evidence based practice with these agencies.

      With funding from a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National
      Institute of Mental Health, the Center for Social Innovation developed an online multi-media
      training on CTI which incorporates a Community of Practice approach to encourage peer-based
      learning.

      The primary aim of this longitudinal, randomized-control study is to compare and contrast
      this online training modality with a face-to-face training on implementation of and fidelity
      to the CTI model over time. Nearly two-hundred direct service providers from 20
      homeless-service agencies were randomly assigned to complete either an online or face-to-face
      training in CTI. Pre-post training and knowledge-retention surveys, interviews with trainers,
      agency administrators, and providers were conducted to track satisfaction with the training
      and experiences in implementing CTI. CTI-specific chart forms are used to assess fidelity to
      the CTI model, and administrative data from the agencies capture client-level outcomes.

    <textblock>
      In September 2008, the Center for Social Innovation (C4) was awarded a Small Business
      Innovation Research (SBIR) contract from the National Institute of Mental Health to test
      innovative ways to disseminate evidence-based practices (EBPs) in community settings. C4
      selected the practice of Critical Time Intervention (CTI), a focused, time-limited case
      management model designed to prevent and end homelessness among people who have experienced
      mental illness, addiction, and trauma. CTI is widely recognized as an evidence-based
      practice. During Phase 1 of the project, C4 partnered with CTI experts at the Columbia
      University Mailman School of Public Health to develop and test a prototype version of an
      instructor-led online course that brought together live (synchronous) and multimedia
      self-paced (asynchronous) elements to train community-based social workers on the CTI model.
      The pilot study showed promising results in the areas of knowledge gain, knowledge retention,
      and confidence to implement the model. Based on these preliminary findings, C4 applied for
      Phase 2 funding, which was granted in September 2010.

      Phase 2 of the study was completed in February 2013. This phase of the study included full
      product development of the online course and a randomized controlled trial comparing the
      online course with face-to-face CTI training (provided by our partners at the Center for
      Urban Community Services or CUCS). Specifically, the study included 179 service providers
      from 19 agencies across the United States and Canada. We randomly assigned each agency to one
      of two study conditions: 1) online training + community of practice, or 2) face-to-face
      training + telephone coaching. After they completed the training, we examined satisfaction
      with the training modalities, knowledge gains and knowledge retention. We then followed
      agencies' CTI implementation process and assessed CTI implementation readiness, experiences
      in implementing CTI, fidelity to the CTI model over time, and the impact of CTI
      implementation on the clients served by these agencies.

    <time_frame>Pre and post surveys (June and July, 2011; weeks 1 and 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Providers were asked to rate their confidence using a 5-point scale (1=not at all confident; 2=not really confident; 3=somewhat confident; 4=confident; 5=extremely confident) in eight key areas: 1) describing CTI as an intervention and its core principles; 2) describing who is on a CTI team and their roles; 3) describing the clinical treatment areas involved with CTI principles; 4) describing the five core skills of CTI and their purposes; 5) describing how to start a CTI program including identifying client and community needs; 6) identifying some of the challenges that might arise in trying to establish CTI in different settings; 7) how chart work differs from CTI work; and 8) describing the key indicators that CTi is implementing. Providers in both treatments were asked to complete these questions in both pre and post surveys.</description>

    <description>Providers were asked to rate their confidence in readiness to implement CTI principles in the post-survey and data were collected on a 5-point scale (1=not at all confident; 2=not very confident; 3=somewhat confident; 4=confident; and, 5= extremely confident) (see: Aarons, 2004).</description>

    <description>Providers who participated in both treatments were asked to complete a pre and post survey followed by a follow up survey in week 6 that looked for enduring effects attributable to participation in the study. Questions were posed in each of the key outcome areas listed above (1) describing CTI as an intervention and its core principles; 2) describing who is on a CTI team and their roles; 3) describing the clinical treatment areas involved with CTI principles; 4) describing the five core skills of CTI and their purposes; 5) describing how to start a CTI program including identifying client and community needs; 6) identifying some of the challenges that might arise in trying to establish CTI in different settings; 7) how chart work differs from CTI work; and 8) describing the key indicators that CTI is implementing).</description>

    <time_frame>Post implementation (March 2012, June 2012, September 2012; weeks 40, 52, and 64)</time_frame>
    <description>Providers completed modified version of CTI fidelity assessment paperwork based on that developed by CTI co-developer Sally Conover (see: da Silva, Lovisi &amp; Conover, 2014). Using the CTI forms submitted by study sites, we assigned each provider a fidelity score. This score indicated how closely the providers' implementation of CTI aligned with the original model. Providers' fidelity scores were calculated based on:
Compliance Fidelity: The degree to which providers implemented the key CTI components, including: early engagement and early linking; working in the community; using a three-phased approach; focusing on only a few areas; completing the intervention within nine months.
Competence Fidelity: Measures how well intervention was documented, including quality and thoroughness of progress notes.</description>

    <description>CTI is an empirically supported, time-limited case management model designed to prevent homelessness and other adverse outcomes in people with mental illness following discharge from hospitals, shelters, prisons and other institutions. CTI was originally developed and tested by researchers and clinicians at Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute with significant support from the National Institute of Mental Health and the New York State Office of Mental Health.</description>
