  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to find out if the results of a pre-treatment biopsy can predict
      response to cisplatin and radiation treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent
      triple negative breast cancer.

    <description>Radiation therapy to the target tumor will be delivered with external beam radiation therapy. In metastatic cases where the intent is palliative, the dose of radiation will be 3750 cGy delivered in 15 daily fractions, 4-5 days a week. In locoregionally recurrent cases where the intent is to enhance locoregional control, the dose of radiation will be 5000 cGy delivered in 25 fractions, 4-5 days a week plus an optional 10-14 Gy boost to areas of gross tumor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically-confirmed invasive triple negative breast cancer (ER &lt;1%, PR &lt;1%,
             her-2-neu 0-1+ by IHC or FISH-negative) or as determined by MD discretion

          -  Radiation to the recurrent or metastatic site is clinically indicated and would be
             considered standard care for palliation or for locoregional control

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Tumor to be irradiated is measurable by RECIST 1.1 or PRC

          -  Willingness to undergo tumor biopsy prior to initiation of treatment

          -  Life expectancy greater than 6 months

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

             target therapies, including oral or IV formulations, are permitted.

          -  Patients must be off prior targeted therapy for at least 14 days prior to study
             biopsy.

          -  Ability to comprehend and sign informed consent

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function within 14 days prior to study entry, defined as:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unmeasurable target tumor site by RECIST 1.1 or PRC (ex: lesions &lt;2 cm on CT or MR
             scan, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphangitis,
             non-FDG-avid skin lesions)

          -  Brain metastases requiring focal or whole brain radiation will be excluded, as these
             lesions cannot be biopsied and can have life expectancies &lt;6 months.

          -  Inability to obtain a biopsy of the tumor as deemed by the study Interventional
             Radiologist

          -  Prior chemotherapy completed &lt;7 days prior to planned study entry

          -  Prior RT is allowed and must have been completed more than 7 days before planned study
             entry.

               -  Note: For re-irradiation cases, standard departmental guidelines should be
                  followed so as to not exceed normal tissue

          -  Life expectancy less than 6 months

          -  Intercurrent illness or other major medical condition or comorbid condition that might
             affect study participation (uncontrolled renal, pulmonary or hepatic dysfunction or
             infection)

          -  Renal dysfunction for which cisplatin dose would be considered unsafe.

          -  Women on study must be neither pregnant nor nursing nor expected to become pregnant
             during therapy. For premenopausal women, negative pregnancy test within 14 days of RT
             is required.

          -  Concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix, unless treatment for the previous cancer was completed &gt;2 years
             prior to study entry and patient has remained disease-free.
