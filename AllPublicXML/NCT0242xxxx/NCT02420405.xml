      The objective of the study was to compare the value of routine gene testing and
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) in detecting gene mutations of small specimens obtained by
      endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and get the knowledge
      of how many EBUS-TBNA samples were adequate for NGS.

      Some gene mutations can direct individualized treatment. The routine gene testing of EGFR,
      ROS1 and ALK is direct sequencing, Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-QPCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry
      (IHC). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a new technique, which is more sensitive than
      routine techniques. So we decided to compare the value of gene testing between routine method
      and NGS in EBUS-TBNA specimens and get the knowledge of how many EBUS-TBNA samples were
      adequate for NGS.

      The study was designed as a prospective and single center study. Seventy patients will be
      enrolled into the study and the clinical data of the patients, including his smoke history,
      cancer history, occupation exposure and so on, will be collected and recorded in a case
      report form. For the patients recruited in the study, the lymph nodes suspected to be
      malignant will be obtained by EBUS-TBNA. Samples will be sent to Pathology Department of
      Shanghai Chest Hospital and will be processed with paraffin-embedded, and for those diagnosed
      with nonsquamous NSCLC, routine gene testing of EGFR, ROS1 and ALK will be performed. And the
      rest tissues will be extracted with DNA and performed gene mutations using NGS for these
      qualified DNA samples.
