    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to compare two different techniques for performing an
      injection of the sacroiliac joint. Although both techniques are safe and accurate, the goal
      of the study is to determine if one technique is better than the other with respect to
      improvement in a patient's pain, function, and his or her satisfaction. Additionally, the
      investigators want to determine if one technique is quicker and more efficient than the
      other.

    <textblock>
      Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a source of low back pain that causes significant pain and
      disability. Injection of the sacroiliac joint with a local anesthetic/corticosteroid mixture
      has shown efficacy in treating this condition, when conservative therapy fails. The use of
      fluoroscopic guidance and anatomic landmarks are traditional methods for performing this
      injection; however, ultrasound imaging has recently been utilized for performing this
      procedure. Although studies exist that describe and validate the ultrasound technique, no
      studies exist that compare the techniques with respect to short-term and long-term outcomes.
      In this study, the primary objective is to determine if a difference exists between a
      fluoroscopic-guided technique and ultrasound-guided technique with respect to pain and
      function. A secondary objective is to compare the two techniques with respect to procedural
      characteristics.

    <description>Patients referred to the Naval Medical Center-San Diego Pain Medicine Clinic. Need a history and physical showing objective findings of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction. If the patient meets inclusion / exclusion criteria, they will be presented with the study. After accepting and being consented, they will then be scheduled. The day of the appointment they will be randomised to Group A or B. In Group A : Fluoroscopy will be used to Guide Needle Placement to inject Steroid into joint. Then complete the multidimensional pain inventory (MPI) and rate their pain on the NRS from 0-11. After procedure, they will rate their pain from 0-10 in the recovery area and then be discharged to home. They will complete an MPI, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), numerical rating scale (NRS), and adverse events questionnaire 1-2 weeks post-procedure and 3 months post-procedure.</description>

    <description>Sterile preparation (with chlorhexidine) and drape
Using ultrasound guidance (SonoSite S-nerve) with a low frequency (2-5 Hz) curvilinear transducer in a sterile cover, the transducer is placed in a transverse plane over the SIJ and needle entry point is chosen at the medial end of the ultrasound transducer
3 mL of 1% lidocaine is injected subcutaneously at site of needle entry
Under ultrasound guidance, a Havel's Inc. EchoStim (facet tip) 21 Gauge 4&quot; needle is inserted in a medial to lateral direction and guided into the SIJ. (0.5-2 mL of normal saline may be injected during needle insertion to locate tip of needle and to ensure solution does not &quot;spill out&quot; onto sacrum).
After using the Doppler function to identify any surrounding vessels (to avoid intravascular injection), 20 mg of triamcinolone diluted in 4 mL of 1% lidocaine is injected.
