      Background:

      Only around 20% of all patients seen in hospital with suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome will
      have Acute Myocardial Infarction. However, several studies indicate that patients where ACS
      had been excluded by conventional methods sustain a higher cardiac morbidity and mortality
      than the background population. Not all of these patients can be identified by traditional
      risk factors such as cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes or with conventional methods
      such as ECG, troponin and clinical symptoms. Non-Contrast Cardiac-CT measures the amount of
      calcification in the coronary arteries and might be a useful addition in predicting future
      cardiac events in this patient group. The aim of this study is through a double-blinded study
      to determine whether non-contrast CT scan with calcium score can be used to identify patients
      at increased risk of death and cardiac event within the following 12 months after an acute
      admission where troponin measurements were normal.

      Methods:

      The study will investigate patients with suspected Acute Coronary syndrome who have been
      examined and subsequently sent home from an emergency- or cardiology department without ACS
      or another obvious explanation. 750 patients, age 30-70 years who are included in the study:
      &quot;Identification of risk factors in non-cardiac chest pain patients&quot; will be offered a
      non-contrast CT scan with calcium score within 14 days after the hospital contact. The
      participants will be included in a 12 months follow up, where the result of the calcium score
      is not revealed neither for the patient nor the investigator. After 12 months the results of
      the scan is compared with the rate of cardiac events. This project is a multicenter study and
      recruits patients from 6 emergency - and cardiology departments in the region of Southern
      Denmark.

      The study commences at September 2014 and results of this project are expected to contribute
      to the risk stratification of Non-cardiac chest pain patients.
