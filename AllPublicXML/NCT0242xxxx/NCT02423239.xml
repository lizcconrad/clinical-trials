    <textblock>
      This study is a trial of dexanabinol in patients with advanced tumours. The purposes of the
      protocol are to study different doses of the study drug to determine the maximum safe dose of
      the drug given in combination with standard chemotherapies and to further understand the
      safety of the study drug and to measure any reduction in size of patients' cancer tumour(s).

      Dexanabinol is a synthetic cannabinoid which has previously undergone clinical trials for
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) and in subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.
      Currently dexanabinol is under investigation for potential anti-tumour activity in patients
      with advanced tumours.

    <description>Patients will be sequentially assigned to increasing doses of dexanabinol to establish the MTD (or maximum administered dose (MAD)). 3 patients will be enrolled to a cohort to assess each dose level. Dose escalation to a cohort of 3 new patients will occur when all patients in the previous cohort have completed the first cycle i.e. the first four doses followed by observation through to day 29 and no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) has occurred.</description>
