      This is a Phase 1a/1b, multicenter, open-label, two-part study in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory MM:

        -  Phase 1a: single agent CWP232291. Dose-finding followed by cohort expansion at the
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal dose as determined by the Safety Review
           Committee (SRC).

        -  Phase 1b: CWP232291 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Dose-finding
           followed by cohort expansion at the combination therapy MTD or optimal dose as
           determined by the SRC.
