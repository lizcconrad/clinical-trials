  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a disorder that causes major harm to physical health and social life. It
      induces isolation, reduced physical and work capacity and increasing the risk of death. In
      contrast, exercise helps to maintain quality of life, also inducing improvement of cognitive
      functions, stimulation of brain plasticity and resilience, in addition to promoting
      self-esteem and social interaction. The precise mechanisms by which exercise improves
      symptoms of depression are not fully clear, but it is probably multifactorial. In this
      project, the investigators aim to investigate variables that provide additional information
      about biomarkers involved in the pathophysiology of depression and therapeutic response to
      exercise. The investigators expect to find changes in biomarkers associated with potential
      mechanisms of neuroprotection (cytokines, markers of oxidative stress, Brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cortisol) after exercise program and the role in the therapeutics
      of depression. To evaluate functional assessment indices will be used ergospirometry, a test
      that determines the respiratory, cardiovascular and metabolic activity. Overall, this project
      will help to investigate alternative adjunctive treatments for depression and their
      associated biomarkers with response.
