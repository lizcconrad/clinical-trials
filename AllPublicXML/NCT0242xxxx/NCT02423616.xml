      This study aimed to examine the possible relationship between hand grip strength (HGS) and
      maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) in healthy individuals. All individuals underwent
      assessment of inspiratory muscle strength by maximum inspiratory pressure, and evaluation of
      hand grip strength. MIP was measured using a U-type water manometer calibrated in centimetre
      of water (cmH2O), while the HGS was measured with hydraulic hand dynamometer calibrated in
      Kg.
