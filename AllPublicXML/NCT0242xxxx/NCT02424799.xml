    <textblock>
      This First Time in Human (FTIH) study, which will be performed in three parts, is designed to
      investigate the safety, local tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after
      single and repeat topical applications of up to 2 strengths of GSK2646264 and corresponding
      placebo within the same subject, in healthy adult subjects (Part A), subjects with cold
      urticaria (CU, Part B) and subjects with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CsU, Part C). The
      study will also measure short term effects of GSK2646264 on the number and size of weals in
      subjects with CsU, and in healthy subjects and subjects with CU following provocation tests.

        Inclusion criteria specific for healthy subjects (Part A)

          -  The subject is aged between 18 and 55 yrs of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 to 30 kg
             per square meter (m^2 )(inclusive).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator, in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor (MM) if required, agrees
             and documents that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Demonstration of a positive weal and flare reaction (&gt;=3 millimeter (mm) in diameter
             relative to negative control) to at least one allergen from a battery of allergens
             (mixed grass pollen, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, birch pollen and cat dander) on
             skin prick testing at SCR.

          -  Subjects must be free from any past or present benign or malignant skin conditions and
             disease, unless in the opinion of the investigator it will not compromise the
             subject's safety and quality of data.

          -  Non-smokers or if the subject is a tobacco smoke: smokes less than 5 cigarettes per
             day and commits to not smoke tobacco for the duration of the in-house stay, and
             commits to stable and moderate use (as determined by the Investigator) of tobacco or
             nicotine-containing products, including nicotine patches/gum, during the course of the
             study, as long as the patches do not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milli
             international unit [MlU]/milliliter [mL] and estradiol &lt;40 picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147
             picomoles/litre) is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods described if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation
             of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.
             Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
             during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

        Additional Inclusion criteria specific for subjects with CU (Part B)

          -  Diagnosed with CU for more than six weeks as confirmed by medical history and with a
             positive cold stimulation test assessed by TEMPTest 4.0 prior to first dose.

             informed consent.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kg and BMI within the range 19 to 35 kg/m^2 (inclusive).

          -  Other than a diagnosis of CU, the subject should have no other co-morbidities which
             would introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and cardiac monitoring.

          -  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator, in
             consultation with the GSK MM if required, agrees and documents that the finding is
             unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedure.

          -  In addition, the following criterion will apply to a minimum of 4 patients in Part B:
             Demonstration of a positive weal and flare reaction (&gt;=3 mm relative to negative
