  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test whether two different participant financial incentive
      structures are more effective and cost effective than minimal financial incentives in
      increasing weight loss among Minnesota Medicaid beneficiaries at high risk of developing
      diabetes. The incentives are tied to participation and weight loss in the evidence-based
      group-delivered YMCA diabetes prevention program (Y-DPP). The Investigators will conduct a
      group randomized trial that includes up to 150 Y-DPP classes of 10-15 participants per class
      for up to 1500 Medicaid beneficiaries participating in the Y-DPP classes. This approach, if
      successful, will (a) improve weight loss. diabetes risk, and improve cardiovascular risk
      among Medicaid beneficiaries at risk for developing diabetes and other chronic conditions,
      (b) demonstrate that prevention of chronic disease risk factors using patient incentives is
      cost-effective, and (c) provide a patient incentive model that can be widely used among
      Medicaid beneficiaries at risk for developing diabetes.

    <description>Participants receive a financial incentive every time they attend a class session and goal-based incentives for attending 75% of Core sessions, 75% of Post-Core sessions, separately achieving 5%, 7%, and 10% weight loss during the Core period (i.e. separate financial incentives for each goal reached at any point during the Core period), and 5%, 7%, or 10% weight loss by the end of Post-Core Session 8 (i.e., one financial incentive based on final weight loss).</description>

    <description>This arm receives the same routine attendance incentives as the Individual Incentive arm. Group goal-based incentives include 5% weight loss by an individual during the Core period and, separately, during the Post-Core period. Financial incentives are also received if the entire DPP group achieves 75% Core session attendance, 75% of Post-Core session attendance, 7% or 10% weight loss from baseline during the Core, and 7% or 10% weight loss from baseline at the end of the Post-Core period.</description>
