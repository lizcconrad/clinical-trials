  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a psycho-cognitive nursing intervention
      including relaxation, guided imagery, touch and music listening can improve the clinical and
      psychological outcome of critically ill patients. The investigators hypothesize that,
      patients who receive the proposed psycho-cognitive nursing intervention will report lower
      stress, less pain and have altered level of stress neuropeptides in peripheral blood, lower
      levels of inflammatory molecules, less complications and better self reported lived
      experience than patients who receive standard care alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous research on the impact of stress on physiology, it has been shown that stress and
      its molecules may contribute to derangements prevalent in critical illness, including
      systemic inflammation, cellular stress, oxidative damage, endothelial dysfunction and
      coagulopathies which precipitate high mortality and morbidity. Investigators will examine
      whether a Psycho-cognitive nursing intervention to induce relaxation can improve patients
      outcomes.

      Sixty ICU patients with or without SIRS will be randomized to receive either standard care or
      a brief Psycho-cognitive Nursing Intervention, plus standard care, up to 5 days during ICU
      stay.
