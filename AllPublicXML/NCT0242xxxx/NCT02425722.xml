    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate dose-responses of efficacy and safety of
      ASP0456 in patient with chronic constipation (diagnosed by Rome III criteria of FC, not
      including constipation due to organic diseases) compared to placebo and to investigate the
      appropriate dose range for P3 study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine optimum dose of ASP0456 for the patients with chronic constipation (not
      including constipation due to organic diseases) in Japan based on its efficacy and safety,
      multicentered, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group comparative study will be
      conducted.

      After two-week observation period, the patient who meets the primary registration criteria
      will be randomized to the one from five groups and will start treatment period. The patients
      will take once daily orally before the breakfast for two weeks.
