  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of elotuzumab and
      revlimid (also called lenalidomide) can help to prevent multiple myeloma (MM) from coming
      back after patients have had an autologous stem cell transplant (a transplant using your own
      stem cells). The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide is FDA-approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of MM and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Its use after an autologous stem cell
      transplant is investigational. Elotuzumab is FDA-approved in combination with lenalidomide
      and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will start receiving the
      study drugs after you have recovered from the stem cell transplant.

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      You will receive elotuzumab by vein over about 2-4 hours on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for the
      first 2 cycles, and then on Day 1 each cycle after that.

      You will also take lenalidomide capsules by mouth on Days 1-28. If the study doctor thinks it
      is needed, your dose of lenalidomide may increase after 3 months.

      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.
      If it is missed for the entire day, do not take another dose to make it up. If you take more
      than 1 dose of lenalidomide in 24 hours, you should get emergency medical care and contact
      the study staff right away.

      You will keep a diary to record the drugs you take. You will be asked to bring the diary, any
      unused drug, and empty drug containers to the clinic at each visit.

      Before your dose of elotuzumab, you will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of
      side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and
      their risks.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles(+/- 7 days):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease and immune testing

        -  You will complete a questionnaire that asks about symptoms you may be having. This will
           take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

        -  Every 1 to 3 cycles, urine will be collected over 24 hours to check the status of the
           disease. The study staff will give you a container and instructions on how to collect
           the urine.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for a pregnancy
           test.

      On Day 1 (+/- 7 days) of every 1-3 cycles, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be
      drawn for mandatory research tests.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 (+/- 3 days) of Cycles 1-2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12, blood (about 12 teaspoons total) will be drawn for
      immune system testing.

      If at any time during the study the doctor thinks the disease has come back, you will have a
      bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in the study will be over after you have completed the end-of-treatment
      visit.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone survey to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for a pregnancy
           test.

      Long-Term Follow up Visit:

      The study doctor and/or the study staff will contact you either by phone or at clinic visits
      every 6 months (about every 24 weeks) to ask how you are feeling and about any therapies or
      procedures you have had for multiple myeloma. If you are contacted by phone, the call may
      last about 5-10 minutes. You will continue these calls until the study ends or you leave the
      study.
