  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FDG PET-CT image acquisition in the abdominal and thoracic region is influenced by organ
      motion. Respiratory movement blurs the metabolic signal of the esophageal tumor and lymph
      nodes. The investigators hypothesize that the metabolic signal obtained with motion
      compensation results in higher SUV-max values and clearer demarcation of the esophageal tumor
      and lymph nodes.

    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a normal 3D FDG PET-CT scan. By participating in this trial, one extra
      4D CT scan will be made. For both the PET and the 4D CT acquisition, the patient gets an
      abdominal belt around the waist to register breathing motion. No extra FDG PET scan is
      required for this study. The 4D CT scan is the only intervention which increases the
      radiation dose exposure compared to the standard PET-CT scan. However, in comparison to the
      expected radiation dose delivered, if a patient will be treated with curative
      chemoradiotherapy, this increase in radiation dose is negligible and secondary risks due to
      this intervention are therefore not increased. For patients who are not eligible for curative
      treatment the extra dose is also not relevant, given the life expectancy of this group.
