    <textblock>
      This study proposes to compare the metabolism of Ampicillin and Gentamicin by pregnant women
      to that of non-pregnant women; the placental transfer over time; and the subsequent
      metabolism of the transferred drug(s) in the neonate.

      Pregnant women who present to Labor and Delivery will be identified as potential participants
      based on Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and their need to receive Ampicillin and/or Gentamicin
      therapy. The additional group of 20 non-pregnant women will also be identified based on
      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and their need to receive Ampicillin and/or Gentamicin therapy.

      Once identified, interested candidates will be fully informed of the study procedures, have
      all questions answered, and informed consent obtained.

      Pregnant participants will receive Ampicillin 2g IV loading dose followed by 1g IV every 4
      hrs until delivery; or Ampicillin 2g IV every 6hrs along with Gentamicin 5mg/kg IV every 24
      hrs. Dose times will be recorded.

      Non-pregnant participants will receive similar doses of either Ampicillin and/or Gentamicin,
      if not the same dose(s).

      Fingerstick blood collection will be drawn from both populations at the following timepoints:

        -  before the administration of Ampicillin, and/or

        -  before the administration of Gentamicin

        -  after the full initial dose of the antibiotic has infused, at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min,
           2-3hr, 4-6hr, immediately prior to the next dose of drug, and at DELIVERY (a 5 minute
           window for each timepoint will be permitted) If delivery occurs prior to the 3 or 6 hr
           timepoints, fingerstick blood collection should continue

      Samples will be obtained on filter paper via the Dry Blood Spot (DBS) method, which is
      clinically appropriate for the purposes of this study.

      Umbilical venous and arterial blood will also be drawn for sampling from the placenta after
      delivery, and cutting of the umbilical cord.
