      This research study is studying Dasatinib as a possible treatment for cancer of bile ducts.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The standard treatment for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma is combination chemotherapy with
      gemcitabine and cisplatin. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      dasatinib for your specific disease (Cholangiocarcinoma) but it has been approved for other
      uses (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia)

             intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

          -  Patients must have either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (any known mutations) based on the
             SNaPshot platform or other molecular testing platform from either archived tissue or
             fresh biopsy (tested in CLIA-certified lab)

          -  Patients with other biliary tract cancers (extrahepatic or gallbladder cancers) with
             IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are allowed

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 10
             for the evaluation of measureable disease.

          -  Participants must have received at least one prior platinum-based regimen for advanced
             cholangiocarcinoma and had progressive disease or become intolerable to the regimen

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of ≥3 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (see Appendix A).

          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,200/mcL

               -  Platelets ≥75,000/mcL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x the upper limit of normal

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  PT/PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 or GFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2

               -  Serum Albumin ≥2.8 g/dl

          -  Prior chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, or radiation to the liver is allowed
             as long as the patient has measurable disease outside of the treated area or
             measurable progression at the site of the treated area

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier
             methods of contraception (eg, male or female condom) during the course of the study
             and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are
             also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier
             method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4
             months after the last dose of study drug(s).

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.
             Women of childbearing potential include women who have experienced menarche and who
             have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal. Postmenopause is
             defined as amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months. Note: women who have been amenorrheic
             for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the
             amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, ovarian suppression
             or any other reversible reason.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study.

             adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  The subject has received radiation therapy:

               -  to bone or brain metastasis within 14 days of the first dose of study treatment

               -  to any other site(s) within 28 days of the first dose of study treatment

          -  The subject has active brain metastases or epidural disease (Note: Subjects with brain

             with epidural disease previously treated with radiation or surgery who are
             asymptomatic and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting
             study treatment are eligible. Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain
             biopsy is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment.
             (Baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans for subjects with known
             brain metastases is required to confirm eligibility.)

                         -  Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as
                            ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de
                            pointes)

                         -  Prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (&gt; 450 msec), may
                            use either the Fridericia and Bazett's correction

                         -  Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia that is not corrected prior to dasatinib
                            administration

                         -  Patients should not be taking drugs that are generally accepted to have
                            a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes. The following must be
                            discontinued at least 7 days prior to starting dasatinib to be
                            eligible:quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amiodarone, sotalol,
                            ibutilide,dofetilide, erythromycins, clarithromycin, chlorpromazine,

                            halofantrine,levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine

               -  Other clinically significant disorders such as:

                    -  active infection requiring systemic treatment within 28 days before the
                       first dose of study treatment

                    -  serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture within 28 days before the
                       first dose of study treatment

               -  Patients with known moderate/severe pleural effusions that are unrelated to
                  malignancy or established diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension

          -  Concurrent malignancy (other than adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and cervical carcinoma in
             situ) diagnosed within the past 3 years or any currently active malignancy

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets

          -  Individuals who are known to be HIV-positive are excluded from this study.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with dasatinib,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with dasatinib. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other study agents concurrently while on this study
