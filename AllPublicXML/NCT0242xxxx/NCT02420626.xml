      The Crux Vena Cava Filter (VCF) Registry is a clinical study, sponsored by Volcano
      Corporation, to evaluate the short and long term performance and clinical outcomes of the
      Crux Vena Cava Filter System.

      The Crux VCF Registry is a non-randomized clinical study, sponsored by Volcano Corporation,
      to evaluate the short and long term performance and clinical outcomes of the Crux VCF System.
      The registry includes consecutive patients treated with the Crux VCF in a post-market
      (commercial) setting with data collection at the implant procedure through 2 years post
      implant or to filter retrieval, whichever comes first. Patients may also be enrolled
      (roll-in) from a previous Crux VCF implant within the previous 6 months. Follow up assessment
      will be performed at 6, 12 and 24 months post-implant and at the time of retrieval, if
      performed.

        Patients are eligible for inclusion if they are scheduled for a vena cava filter implant
        with the Crux VCF System or have had a Crux VCF implanted within the previous 6 months for
        any of the following situations:

          1. Pulmonary thromboembolism when anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated;

          2. Failure of anticoagulation therapy in thromboembolic disease;

          3. Emergency treatment following massive pulmonary embolism where anticipated benefits of
             conventional therapy are reduced; and

          4. Chronic, recurrent pulmonary embolism where anticoagulant therapy has failed or is
             contraindicated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is scheduled for filter implant, but did not have a Crux VCF filter implanted
             due to anatomical exclusions or technical failures.

          2. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol and provide informed consent.

          3. Female patient of childbearing potential who is pregnant (she must have negative

          4. Patient is participating in another device or drug clinical trial that interferes with
             this protocol follow up schedule.
