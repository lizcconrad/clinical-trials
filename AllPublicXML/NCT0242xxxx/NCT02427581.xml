  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most important consideration in the design of this clinical trial is to ensure the safe
      translation of the personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) dictates that initial studies of biologic therapies be performed in such
      a way that there is a balance between the potential risks and benefits in individual
      patients. Consistent with these recommendations, the investigators will target patients with
      triple-negative breast cancer who do not have a pathologic complete response after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These patients typically have no gross evidence of disease
      following standard of care therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy)
      but are at extremely high-risk for disease recurrence. Targeting this patient population
      provides a window-of-opportunity to design and manufacture the personalized cancer vaccines,
      maximizes the potential benefit from the vaccine as the regulatory networks associated with
      metastatic disease are not present, and balances risk in this patient population with
      extremely high risk for disease recurrence but no other treatment options.

    <description>Each subject will receive a single synthetic long peptide vaccine on Days 1, 4, 8, 15, 22, 50, and 78.
The first five injections must take place within +/- 1 day window and the remaining injections must take place within a +/- 2 week window.
The synthetic long vaccine is reconstituted in up to four pools (A, B, C, and D). At each vaccination time point, each of the up to four pools will be administered to one of the four limbs (A - Right Arm, B - Left Arm, C - Right Leg, and D - Left Leg) by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Alternative anatomical locations for patients who are status post complete axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection or other contraindications that prevent injections to a particular extremity are the left and right midriff, respectively. The same pool should be administered to the same limb across doses.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.

          -  ER and PR less than Allred score of 3 or less than 1% positive staining cells in the
             invasive component of the tumor

          -  HER2 negative by FISH or IHC staining 0 or 1+.

          -  Consented for genome sequencing and dbGAP-based data sharing and has provided or will
             provide germline and tumor DNA samples of adequate quality for sequencing. Fresh
             tissue is preferred (from biopsy at the time of port placement) but archival tissue is
             allowed.

             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of progressive breast cancer within the last 30 days.

          -  Received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy within the last 30 days
             (neoadjuvant chemotherapy excluded).

             hives, or respiratory difficulty.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia (including sinus bradycardia), or psychiatric illness/social situation that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Prior or currently active autoimmune disease requiring management with
             immunosuppression. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis,
             Crohn's disease, systemic vasculitis, scleroderma, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis,
             hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             lupus erythematosus, Sjorgen's syndrome, sarcoidosis, or other rheumatologic disease
             or any other medical condition or use of medication (e.g., corticosteroids) which
             might make it difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or
             to generate an immune response to vaccines. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease that does not require daily systemic corticosteroids is acceptable. Any
             patients receiving steroids should be discussed with the PI to determine if eligible.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. A negative serum pregnancy test is required no more than 7
             days before study entry.

          -  The patient with a previous history of non-breast malignancy is eligible for this
             study only if the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer
             survivor is eligible provided the following criteria are met: (1) patient has
             undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies, (2) patients have
             been considered disease free for at least 1 year (with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix).

          -  Patient must have no active major medical or psychosocial problems that could be
             complicated by study participation.

          -  Known HIV-positive status. These patients are ineligible because of the potential
             inability to generate an immune response to vaccines.

          -  Subjects with a strong likelihood of non-adherence such as difficulties in adhering to
             follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the Siteman Cancer Center should
             not knowingly be registered.
