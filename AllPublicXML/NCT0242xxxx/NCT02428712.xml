      Dose Escalation (Part 1): To evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics of PLX8394
      in adult and pediatric patients with advanced BRAF- mutated tumors, and to identify the
      recommended Phase 2 Dose.

      Dose Extension (Part 2): To access objective tumor response to PLX8394 treatment in adult and
      in pediatric patients with advanced BRAF- mutated tumors, to access RECIST, and to access
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety.
