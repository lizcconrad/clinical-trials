  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a two group randomized controlled trial to compare a brief motivational
      interviewing (MI) intervention to TAU with 50 adolescents psychiatrically hospitalized for a
      suicide plan or attempt who have co-occurring alcohol use. Data will be collected via
      in-person interviews and self-administered questionnaires at baseline and 3 month follow-up
      assessments to explore outcome changes in negative alcohol expectancies, confidence in
      ability to handle situations where alcohol is present, likelihood of receiving alcohol
      treatment, frequency of alcohol use, and suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide
      attempts for adolescents receiving the intervention relative to TAU.

    <textblock>
      A two group randomized controlled trial will be used to compare the brief MI intervention to
      TAU with 50 adolescents psychiatrically hospitalized for a suicide plan or attempt who have
      co-occurring alcohol use. Adolescents admitted to the unit for a suicide plan or attempt will
      be screened by PI O'Brien or Co-I White within 24 hours of their admission to determine if
      they meet criteria for alcohol use in past month by selecting 1-6 on Question #1 of the
      Adolescent Drinking Questionnaire (ADQ). Then Co-I White (or PI O'Brien in the event Co-I
      White is unavailable) will administer the Drug Use Questionnaire (DUQ), Timeline Follow-back
      Interview (TLFB), Brief Situational Confidence Questionnaire (BSCQ), Comprehensive Effects of
      Alcohol (CEOA), Opinions About Alcohol Use (OAAU), Suicide Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ),
      Inventory of Motivations for Suicide Attempts (IMSA), and a subset of questions from the
      Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Once assessment measures are completed,
      participants will be randomized to either the experimental condition or TAU. Randomization
      will be accomplished by using an urn randomization procedure used to retain random allocation
      while balancing relative probabilities of assignment to treatment groups. Urn randomization
      in contrast to simple or block randomization is dynamic; the probability of treatment
      assignment changes dependent on the degree of treatment imbalance throughout the course of
      the trial. We will randomize by 1) ADQ score (i.e., adolescents scoring &lt;4 which indicates
      drinking at least 2-3 times per week) and 2) gender. The adolescent will receive the
      individual MI intervention in a private room on the inpatient psychiatric unit; the family
      intervention will be delivered in a private room on the unit, ideally the next day. After the
      intervention the adolescent will complete the exit interview and Session Evaluation Form
      (SEF) to assess acceptability. Once a discharge date is made for the participant, PI O'Brien
      or Co-I White will schedule a 3 month follow-up appointments with the adolescent and
      guardian; the ADQ, DUQ, TLFB, BSCQ, CEOA, SIQ, IMSA, and C-SSRS will be readministered at the
      follow-up assessment in a private room in the visitors' area of the inpatient psychiatric
      unit by RA Wigglesworth, so that the clinician conducting the assessment is blind to
      condition.

    <description>Adolescent Drinking Questionnaire (ADQ). The ADQ is a 6 item self-report measure assessing drinking frequency (days per month), quantity (drinks per occasion), frequency of high-volume drinking (≥ 5 drinks per occasion), and frequency of intoxication (feeling &quot;drunk&quot; or &quot;very, very high&quot;), over the past month.
Timeline Follow-back Interview (TLFB). The TLFB is a widely-used research and clinical assessment tool with good reliability and validity for various groups of individuals with alcohol use problems. The TLFB collects alcohol and drug consumption information using a calendar format with temporal cues to assist in recall of days when alcohol and drugs were used, and can be used to simultaneously recall other behaviors, such as suicidal ideation and attempts. The TLFB will be conducted using the prior 30 days at baseline and each follow-up.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The C-SSRS assesses the range of suicidal behavior including preparatory acts, aborted attempt and interrupted attempt, and passive and active suicidal ideation, as well as intensity of ideation. To avoid redundancies in measures, we will not administer the intensity of ideation section to the participant, as some of that construct is captured by the SIQ. At follow-up, suicidality will be assessed only since the last assessment.
Suicide Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ). The SIQ is a 30 item self-report instrument that assesses suicidal ideation in adolescents over the past month. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale (0=I never had this thought, to 6=almost every day). Coefficient alpha internal consistency measures for the SIQ have been reported at 0.97 as well as good construct validity.</description>

    <description>Drug Use Questionnaire (DUQ). The DUQ assesses the number of days adolescents used substances over the past 30 days including nicotine, marijuana, cocaine, LSD, PCP, inhalants, etc. Internal consistency in one study sample was .75 (alpha = .80 when inhalants was dropped). Test/retest for mean number of days each substance was used was .83 from 3 to 6 month follow-up and .94 from 6 to 12 month follow-up.</description>

    <description>Brief Situational Confidence Questionnaire (BSCQ). The BSCQ is an eight item self-report instrument used to assess confidence in one's ability to resist the urge to use alcohol or other substances. Responses are provided on 10-point Likert scales (i.e., 10% increments, from 0%=not at all confident to 100%=completely confident). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.85 in one study.</description>

    <description>Opinions About Alcohol Use (OAAU). The OAAU is a two item self-report measure assessing the importance and confidence in reducing alcohol use. In addition to baseline and 3 month follow-up, this measure will be administered post-intervention to all participants randomized to the intervention, to assess for within session changes.</description>
