  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two percutaneous procedures used in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia are
      analysed. The effects on pain relief, alterations in cutaneous sensibility and olfactory and
      salivatory functions are analysed as well.

    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, refractory or intolerant to medical
      treatment, are randomly assigned (after signing a consent form), to receive one of two
      percutaneous procedures. The patients are evaluated a week before and a week, a month, two
      months, three months and six months after the surgery.

      The questionnaires (Short-Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire - SF-MPQ, Douleur
      Neuropathique - DN4, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory - NPSI, Brief Pain Inventory - BPI,
      Global Clinical Impression - GCI, Hospital Anxiety and Depression - HAD, Brief World Health
      Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - WHOQOL-brief, Pain Catastrophizing Scale - PCS)
      and tests (Quantitative Sensory Testing - QST, olfactory threshold - OT - and discrimination
      - OD, taste threshold - TT, and salivatory quantification - SQ) are applied as follows:

        -  Pre-op evaluation: SF-MPQ, DN4, BPI, NPSI, HAD, WHOQOL-brief, PCS, QST, OT, OD, TT, SQ.

        -  First visit post-op: SF-MPQ, BPI, NPSI, GCI

        -  Second visit post-op: SF-MPQ, BPI, NPSI, GCI

        -  Third visit post-op: SF-MPQ, BPI, NPSI, GCI

        -  Fourth visit post-op: SF-MPQ, DN4, BPI, NPSI, GCI, WHOQOL-brief, HAD, PCS, QST, OT, TT,
           SQ.

        -  Fifth visit post-op: SF-MPQ, DN4, BPI, NPSI, GCI, WHOQOL-brief, HAD, PCS, QST, OT, OD,
           TT, SQ.

      Patients with pain recurrence are excluded after the last visit attended. An exploratory
      analysis is made with 30 patients for a proper sample size calculation during the study.
