    <textblock>
      Sunitinib is a chemotherapy approved by the FDA as a standard of care treatment for renal
      cell carcinoma (RCC). Fatigue is a very common side effect of sunitinib that frequently
      causes dose reductions. The cause of this fatigue remains unclear. This study will use a
      special type of scan to study sunitinib-induced fatigue in relation to exercise.

      Sunitinib, a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been approved by the FDA as a
      standard of care treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Fatigue is a very common side
      effect of sunitinib that frequently causes dose reductions. The cause of this fatigue remains
      unclear. It has been shown that TKIs disrupt growth factor pathways in muscles leading to
      muscle shrinkage. If sunitinib associated fatigue is due to altered muscle physiology at a
      molecular level, there will be observable changes in the uptake of 99mTc-sestamibi in
      scintigraphy scans. The study objective is to determine if sunitinib-induced fatigue as
      determined by VO2 and QOL fatigue related questionnaire responses are correlated to molecular
      changes in the muscles as evidenced by 99mTc-sestamibi uptake.

          2. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed RCC.

          3. Four weeks must have elapsed since prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted
             therapy or radiation therapy. There is no restriction on the amount of bone marrow
             previously radiated.

          4. Recovery to baseline or, at most, grade 1 of all drug-related toxicities due to prior
             chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, or molecular targeted therapy, expect for
             alopecia.

          5. Male / female subject ≥ 18 years of age

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;70%)

          7. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          8. Normal organ and marrow function as defined by :

               -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500/mcL

               -  hemoglobin (Hb) &gt; 90 g/L

               -  platelet count ≥ 1000.000/mcL,

               -  total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal range (ULN)

               -  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x ULN
                  (&lt;5 x ULN presence of liver metastases)

               -  creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN

          9. Cardiac ejection fraction by MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be &gt;50% for patients at
             baseline.
