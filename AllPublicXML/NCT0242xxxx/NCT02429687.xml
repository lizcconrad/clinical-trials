      Investigators will conduct the trial to determine whether paclitaxel and cisplatin (PT) has
      the same curative effects and less adverse effects than bleomycin, etoposide and
      cisplatin(BEP) among newly diagnosed malignant ovarian germ cell tumor patients after
      surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the activity of paclitaxel and carboplatin with respect to progression free
      survival (using bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [BEP] as a reference) for newly diagnosed
      malignant ovarian germ cell tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To estimate the toxicity of paclitaxel and carboplatin, and bleomycin, etoposide, and
           cisplatin in this patient population.

        2. To estimate overall survival for paclitaxel and carboplatin relative to that of BEP.

        3. To evaluate response rate in the subset of patients with measurable disease. OUTLINE:
           This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM 1: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients receive bleomycin IV per week, etoposide IV daily for days 1-5, cisplatin IV
      for days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 or 4* courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients who have good risk will have 3 courses and those who have poor risks will
      have 4 courses.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      laboratory biomarker analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
