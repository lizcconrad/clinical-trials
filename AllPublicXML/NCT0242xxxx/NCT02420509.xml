  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if postoperative chemotherapy in patients with
      high-grade appendix cancer after surgery improves outcomes.

      The postoperative chemotherapy will consist of 5-FU (with leucovorin) or capecitabine with
      bevacizumab. These drugs are approved for use in people with colon cancer, and they are used
      at UCSD for some patients with appendix cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of the postoperative
      chemotherapy treatment on cancer.

      This is an observational, single-cohort, prospective study of systemic chemotherapy after
      CRS/HIPEC. Subjects will be given twelve months of 5-FU or capecitabine with bevacizumab
      starting 4-16 weeks after surgery. CTRI Biostatistics Core personnel will assist in
      conducting analyses using the latest version of R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
      Vienna, Austria. http://www.R-project.org/).

      No therapy is included in this study. Subjects have already previously undergone surgery for
      their cancer. This study will observe the outcomes of the postoperative chemotherapy
      treatment the doctor chooses to treat the subject's cancer.
