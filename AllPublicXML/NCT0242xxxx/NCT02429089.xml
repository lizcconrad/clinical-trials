  <brief_summary>

      In this trial, the investigators would like to investigate the activity of LEE011 associated
      with cetuximab (standard of care for the SCCHN patients at this stade of the disease).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the mammalian cell cycle, entry into S phase is achieved by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and
      6 (CDK4/6), which activate a family of E2F transcription factors by phosphorylating and
      deactivating the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). LEE011 is an orally, highly selective small
      molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 that potently induces G1 arrest with sub-micromolar IC50's in a
      variety of pRb-positive cancer cells. A recent study showed that an inhibitor of the
      CDK4-CCND1 complex showed promising results in SCCHN pre-clinical models. There is a strong
      rationale to investigate CDK inhibitors in this disease. In phase Ib/II study as a single
      agent, the major toxicities observed were Grade 3 and 4 fatigue (53.8%), nausea (50.8%),
      neutropenia (47.7%), anemia (37.1%), leukopenia (46.2%), thrombocytopenia (34.1%), diarrhea
      (32.6%), vomiting (34.8%), lymphocytes count decreased (30.3%), anorexia (21.2%),
      hyperglycemia (21.2%), constipation (19.7%), hypoalbuminemia (18.9%), dyspnea (18.2%) and
      cough (16.7%).

         20. Participation in a prior investigational study within 30 days prior to enrollment or
             within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer

         21. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient

               -  Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c)

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal
                       suppository In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been
                       stable on the same pill before taking study treatment.

             Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier
             method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.]

         22. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug and for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

         23. Patient has a history of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant
             consent.
