      PHASE : IV TYPE OF STUDY : With direct benefit. DESCRIPTIVE : Multicentre, randomized, open
      label study. INCLUSION CRITERIA : Acute severe ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES : To compare
      the efficacy and safety of early administration of the combination therapy with infliximab
      and azathioprine with steroids and azathioprine in patients with acute severe ulcerative
      colitis treated with intravenous steroids.

      STUDY TREATMENTS : All patients :

      Intravenous steroids (0.8 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent) for 5 days.

        -  Mucosal healing (partial endoscopic Mayo subscore 0)

    <description>Intravenous steroids will be continue until day 2. Then, steroid therapy will be orally administered at a dose of 40-60 mg/day ou 1 mg/kg/day prednisolone (or equivalent) and progressively reduced by 10mg step every week to 20mg per day, and then reduced by 5mg step every week until stopped. Hydrocortisone intake to prevent steroid weaning will be authorized until supradrenal function normalization.
In patients with clinical response at day 7, Azathioprine will be introduced at day 5-7 and continued until week 52. Azathioprine dose regimen will be between 2 and 2.5 mg/kg/d, as close as possible of 2.5 mg/kg/d, or of 1.5 mg/kg/d for 6-mercaptopurine, in one daily intake.</description>
