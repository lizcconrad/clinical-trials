    <textblock>
      Diabetes( mainly type II diabetes )lead to the central nervous system (CNS) function
      impairment, especially the mild cognitive impairment that increased the risk of progression
      to dementia.The primary objectives are defined according to a hierarchical design: i) to
      tailor and apply multi-parametric, functional MRI techniques to identify cerebral
      abnormalities (cerebral biomarkers) in type 2 diabetes mellitus and prodromal diabetes
      mellitus ; ii) to assess whether these cerebral biomarkers are associated with cognitive
      decrements;iii) to follow up with the putative prediabetic condition patients to verify
      whether they can transform into diabetes.

      Diabetes ( mainly type II diabetes ) lead to the central nervous system (CNS) function
      impairment, especially the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that increased the risk of
      progression to dementia. It was regarded that neurodegeneration contributes to the diabetic
      MCI, however, recent research suggested that CNS microvascular alterations are the mechanism
      for early diabetic MCI. But there still lacks an early warning system for the CNS
      micro-structure alterations during early diabetes. Latest neuroimaging techniques enable the
      measurement of brain blood flow, local neural activity，and the nuclei deposition of iron to
      reflect CNS micro-structure alterations. But these techniques are complicated and can not
      fully reflect the alterations with one single technique.We previous observed that 44.4% of
      diabetic patients demonstrate MCI and established the comprehensive protocols of measuring
      brain blood flow, local neural activity and the nuclei deposition of iron simultaneously
      based on the multimodal MRI technique so as to reflect the microstructure alterations
      reliably and validly. Therefore, we intend to integrate psychological measurement and
      clinical biochemical examination, and to establish the early warning system for the central
      nervous system micro-structure alterations during early diabetes based on the multi-modal MRI
      technique. The reliability and validity of this system will be tested in the diabetic rat
      model. The early warning system will likely assist in screening patients with diabetic
      microstructure alterations, to perform early intervention so as to prevent or delay the
      progression from diabetic MCI to dementia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional and structural connectivity relationships of multiple brain regions and biomarkers of brain alterations, and the changes in relationships and biomarkers at 2.5 years.</measure>
    <time_frame>subjects will be assessed six times (once half a year, up to 2.5 years )</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in macro-structural and micro-structural between patients,prodromal group and healthy controls will be evaluated. These MRI measures include volumetric characteristics (e.g. hyper-intensities, white matter lesions, atrophy, cerebral microbleeds), quantitative measures (e.g. T2 relaxation times, mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, mean kurtosis), functional characteristics (e.g. activated regions, cerebral blood flow), network properties (e.g. functional and structural connectivity, graph-theoretical measures).</description>

    <time_frame>subjects will be assessed six times (once half a year, up to 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Simple evaluation of obesity will include: Body mass index will be calculated as the weight (kg) divided by the square of the height (m). Waist circumference (WC) will be taken as the minimum circumference between the umbilicus and xiphoid process and measured to the nearest 0.5 cm.</description>

    <measure>Mental health and the changes in the scores of the scales at 2.5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>subjects will be assessed six times (once half a year, up to 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the mental health, a series of psychiatric evaluation scale(e.g. mini-mental state examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment，Hamilton anxiety scale, self-rating depression scale, frontal assessment battery) will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Lifestyle and its changes at 2.5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>subjects will be assessed six times (once half a year, up to 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Lifestyle specifics, including alcohol consumption, smoking behavior and mobility and exercise habit will be obtained. At the same time, quality of life will be obtained through a questionnaire.</description>
