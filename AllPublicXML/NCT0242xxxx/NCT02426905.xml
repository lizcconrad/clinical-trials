    <description>The clinical course of neurological and hepatic disease for each available time point after initiation of treatment (6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, and at the last available time point while taking second line trientine) will be scored (Investigator's score) based on neurological and hepatic status at the time of initiating trientine as: 1 = Unchanged 2 = Improved but not normal 3 = Improved to normal 4 = Asymptomatic over duration of therapy 5 = Worsened.</description>
