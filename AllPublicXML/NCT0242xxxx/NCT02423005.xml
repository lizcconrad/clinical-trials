      A prospective, randomised, controlled, single-blind, multi-site clinical study employing
      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to stimulate the pelvic floor muscles of women
      suffering from stress urinary incontinence.

      Approximately one-hundred and eighty (180) female patients diagnosed with stress urinary
      incontinence will be enrolled in this study. All patients who are considered eligible to
      participate in the clinical study and give consent will be randomised to complete either a
      12-week treatment programme with the Neurotech Vital Compact device or a 12-week treatment
      programme with the itouch Sure Pelvic Floor Exerciser. The 12-week treatment programme will
      be completed by the subjects at home with treatment with the device in accordance with the
      device Instructions for Use.

      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-blind, multi-site clinical study to be
      conducted in the United States of America (USA) employing Neuromuscular Electrical
      Stimulation (NMES) to stimulate the pelvic floor muscles of women suffering from stress
      urinary incontinence.

      Approximately one-hundred and eighty (180) female patients diagnosed with stress urinary
      incontinence will be enrolled in this study. All patients who are considered eligible to
      participate in the clinical study and give consent will be randomised to complete either a
      12-week treatment programme with the Neurotech Vital Compact device or a 12-week treatment
      programme with the itouch Sure Pelvic Floor Exerciser. The 12-week treatment programme will
      be completed by the subjects at home with treatment with the device in accordance with the
      device Instructions for Use.

      Subjects included in the clinical study will be evaluated at screening, on enrolment into the
      study (baseline) and during the 12-week treatment programme at 4 and 12 weeks. A telephone
      call will be made at 1 week to check on the patient's progress. In addition, subjects will be
      evaluated at 26 week following their commencement of the treatment.

             exercises.

          4. Subjects who have been clinically diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence and
             demonstrate a greater than or equal to 3g urine leakage and a less than or equal to
             90g urine leakage (&gt;3g and &lt; 90g) following a bladder-filling protocol and then a
             standardised stress test (provocative pad weight test) at the baseline assessment.

             arrhythmias).

         16. Subjects with a current or active history of pelvic cancer and/or subjects with a life
             expectancy of less than 12 months.

         18. Subjects who have participated in a clinical study in the last 3 months or any
             previous clinical study with Bio-Medical Research Ltd.

         19. Subjects who have been committed to an institution by virtue of an order issued either
