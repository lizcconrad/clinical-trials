  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate whether the use of pharmacogenetic testing
      through a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program has a beneficial impact on drug therapy
      problems. More specifically, cytochrome DNA testing, which provides information with regards
      to participant specific metabolism of medications, will be used in the evaluation of
      participant medication regimens. The overall aim of the project is to evaluate if the
      addition of genetic CYP testing to a standardized MTM Program provides increased clinical
      value. To answer this question, the investigators will look at the drug therapy problems
      (DTPs) identified by the genetic test compared to those DTPs discovered without the test.

      All study participants will receive a Comprehensive Medication Review (CMR). One third will
      have standard MTM conducted. Another third of the participants will be randomized to MTM plus
      drug interaction risk analysis via YouScript software. The remaining third will be randomized
      to MTM along with drug interaction risk analysis via YouScript software and genetic testing.
      The software will identify polypharmacy patients who may benefit from pharmacogenetic testing
      based on their current medication regimen. Results of the testing will be mailed to both the
      participant and their provider. Participants who undergo testing will also receive a
      follow-up phone call. All participants, including those who receive MTM alone, will receive a
      contact 3 months later to assess quality of life.
