  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe brain-injured patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Weaning these
      patients from mechanical ventilation is challenging. During neurologic recovery, brain
      injured patients usually present satisfactory respiratory autonomy. However, the exact timing
      of extubation is unknown and is frequently delayed because of potential inhalation.

      To date, there are no clinical signs available in the current literature that can help the
      attending physician in the decision-making process of extubation in brain-injured-patients
