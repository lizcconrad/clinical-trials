    <textblock>
      The knee prosthesis is a validated treatment for end-stage of knee osteoarthritis, and this
      intervention usually provides a significant improvement in the quality of life of patients.
      However, a significant percentage of patients (up to 30%) are disappointed with the outcome
      of the intervention. One hypothesis that could explain these poor results might be the poor
      positioning of implants. Individual cutting guides are produced after a CT scan response
      planning carried out according to the CT scan anatomy of each patient, and subsequently
      adapted to its real anatomy during surgery, thus theoretically better accuracy of the
      implementation over conventional techniques. It has been shown in the past that the
      navigation has been the gold standard in measuring the three-dimensional orientation of the
      implants during surgery, and this system is systematically used in the service for over 10
      years.
