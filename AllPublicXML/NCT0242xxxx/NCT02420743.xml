  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia during third trimester will be assessed for serum
      ferritin and peak systolic value for fetal middle cerebral artery to find out their
      correlation with preterm delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm delivery, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of completed gestation (259 days), is a
      major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive research, preterm birth
      still accounts for 5-10% of all deliveries in developed countries and rates are on the
      increase, including in the UK. While mortality associated with preterm delivery has declined
      due to use of antenatal steroids and improvements in neonatal intensive care, preterm babies
      still remain at risk of major complications. These include respiratory distress syndrome,
      necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, sepsis, intraventricular haemorrhage,
      periventricular leucomalacia and long-term cognitive and sensory impairment. Two major
      determinants for the mortality and morbidity of babies born preterm are gestation at delivery
      and birthweight. Prematurity therefore carries significant cost implications to both
      healthcare services and society in general. High hemoglobin along with anemia was examined in
      an observational study. At entry to care, which ranged between 6 and 8.4 wk gestation, women
      with hemoglobin levels exceeding 130g/L had a greater than twofold increase in risk of
      preterm delivery and infant low birth weight. Neither risk was statistically significant,
      however, because of the small numbers with high hemoglobin. Similarly, a concentration of the
      iron storage protein, ferritin, that is high for the third trimester of pregnancy is also
      associated with an increased risk for preterm and very preterm delivery. Over the last twenty
      years, interest has been shown in using ultrasound parameters or Doppler studies of fetal
      blood to assess fetal anaemia. Middle cerebral artery Doppler has taken over and has replaced
      amniocentesis as a screening test for fetal anaemia in high risk pregnancies.
