  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to (1) test the benefits of a non-pharmacologic anxiety management
      approach with patients who are critically ill and/or traumatically injured during intensive
      care hospitalization and (2) test whether this approach reduces anxiety and improves
      engagement in rehabilitation therapies, shortens duration of hospitalization, and improves
      psychological and quality of life outcomes.

    <description>The AM intervention is based on a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) approach, empirically supported in other settings, though we do not know whether this approach will be effective for ICU patients. It will offer all participants core aspects of CBT including: (1) establish rapport/therapeutic alliance; (2) anxiety psychoeducation; (3) normalization of difficulties; (4) establishment of a sense of hope; (5) reflective listening; (6) supportive statements; (7) exposure to anxious thoughts/feelings; (8) directive statements; and (9) provision of coping strategies. It will consist of modules that include the aforementioned core aspects and &quot;optional&quot; modules based on each participant's anxiety experience and preference.</description>

    <description>The UC group will receive usual care as per the Harborview Medical Center usual care standard. Because this is an effectiveness trial, treatment decisions for UC participants will be left to the discretion of the primary provider and/or primary medical team and may or may not include: (1) referral to rehab psychology C&amp;L service; (2) referral to psychiatry C&amp;L service; or (3) pharmacologic management.</description>
