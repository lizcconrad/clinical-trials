    <textblock>
      In congruence with the National Cancer Institute's commitment to supporting families of
      individuals with cancer across the full disease trajectory, the investigators seek to examine
      the feasibility of a technologically-mediated problem-solving intervention designed to
      improve the quality of life and decrease the psychological distress of family caregivers of
      cancer patients receiving outpatient palliative care. Investigators involved in this mixed
      methods pilot study will collect and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data, which
      will subsequently inform a large-scale randomized clinical trial of the problem-solving
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palliative oncology providers are ideally situated to improve the cancer journey for the
      millions of family members and friends who are vital to the care of seriously ill patients.
      In recent decades, the primary setting for cancer care has shifted from the hospital
      inpatient unit to the outpatient clinic, leaving family caregivers responsible for providing
      the majority of patient care in the home, often with little support or preparation. The
      numerous stressors associated with family caregiving often give rise to caregiver anxiety,
      depression, fatigue, neglect of self-care and, for particularly strained caregivers,
      psychological symptoms that mirror those experienced by trauma survivors. In congruence with
      the National Cancer Institute's commitment to supporting families of individuals with cancer
      across the full disease trajectory, the investigators seek to examine the feasibility of a
      technologically-mediated problem-solving intervention designed to improve the quality of life
      and decrease the psychological distress of family caregivers of cancer patients receiving
      outpatient palliative care. Specifically, the investigators aim to 1) examine the feasibility
      of the intervention relative to recruitment, randomization, retention, and fidelity to core
      intervention components; 2) investigate the impact of the intervention on family caregiver
      anxiety, depression, and quality of life; and 3) explore the benefits and challenges
      associated with the intervention from the perspective of participants. To accomplish these
      aims, investigators will recruit and randomly assign 82 family caregivers of cancer patients
      receiving outpatient palliative care into two groups (usual care and intervention) and
      collect quantitative and qualitative data, which will be analyzed to inform a future
      large-scale randomized clinical trial of the problem-solving intervention.

    <description>The problem-solving approach that will be taught in the problem-solving intervention is based on the ADAPT model, which encourages participants to follow five steps when solving problems: focus on adopting a positive attitude to problem-solving, define the problem and set goals, generate a list of alternative solutions to the problem, predict consequences of the alternative solutions, and try implementing the most promising solution from among the list of alternatives. The problem-solving intervention will be delivered by a trained interventionist in three structured sessions using videoconferencing tools.</description>
