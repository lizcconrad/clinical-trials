      PHASE: IV

      TYPE OF STUDY: With direct benefit

      DESCRIPTIVE: multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled trial

      INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who failed
      corticosteroids and immunosupressive therapy, or are intolerant to immunosuppressors. All
      included patients will be naïve to anti-TNF therapy. Active disease at golimumab treatment
      initiation defined as a MAYO score ≥6 and with an endoscopic sub score ≥2.

      OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients with continued clinical response (CCR) and
      endoscopic remission at week 108, after discontinuation or de-escalation of golimumab
      treatment at year 1 in the subgroup of patients in continuous clinical response (CCR) and
      with mucosal healing (MH) (endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 54.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Induction Phase :

      Week 0: golimumab 200mg- Week 2: golimumab 100 mg- Week 6: golimumab 50 mg

      Phase I : Week 10-Week 54 • Patients with primary clinical response* : Standard regimen with
      golimumab 50 mg Q4W (or 100 mg Q4W if &gt; 80 kg)

      • Patients without primary clinical response* : Optimization to 100 mg Q4W (or combination
      therapy with azathioprine if &gt; 80 kg or switch from azathioprine to methotrexate if already
      on azathioprine at golimumab initiation or patient with known intolerance to thiopurines)

      • Early escape at Week 18: Primary non-responders who are still not responding at week 18 to
      dose optimization at Weeks 10 and 14 will be considered treatment failures and will be
      followed up (call or visit) at week 54 for safety.

        -  Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score ≥30% and ≥3
           points, accompanied by either a rectal bleeding sub score of 0 or 1 or a decrease from
           baseline in the rectal bleeding sub score ≥1

      Phase II : Week 54-Week 108

      • Patients with CCR and MH at week 54 and on golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks: Stop golimumab
      and continuation of thiopurines or methotrexate if on combination therapy

      • Patients with CCR and MH at week 54 and on golimumab 100 mg every 4 weeks: De-escalation to
      50 mg every 4 weeks and continuation of thiopurines or methotrexate if on combination therapy

      • Restart/Escalate golimumab on flare (defined in section 4 of the protocol) to the phase I
      dose; 50 mg q4wk or 100mg q4wk (similar to the phase I regimen)

      NUMBER OF PATIENTS: 200 patients

      INCLUSION PERIOD: 18-24 months

      STUDY DURATION: 48 to 54 months

      MAIN EVALUATION Primary endpoints

        -  Phase I (week 10-54): proportion of patients in continuous clinical response (CCR) and
           with mucosal healing (MH; endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 54

        -  Phase II (week 54-108): proportion of patients in CCR with mucosal healing (endoscopic
           Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 108, after discontinuation or dose de-escalation (from 100
           to 50 mg) of golimumab treatment at year 1 in the subgroup of patients in continuous
           clinical response (CCR) and with mucosal healing (endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at
           week 54

      Data base lock, data analysis and display (publication) of phase I will happen when all
      included subjects have completed the 54 week visit.

      SECONDARY

      EVALUATION For all included patients:

        -  Factors associated with treatment success (see primary endpoints)

        -  Clinical remission at week 54

        -  Clinical remission at week 108

        -  Partial MAYO score at weeks 54 and 108

        -  PRO2 (Partial Mayo minus PGA) at weeks 54 and 108

        -  Continuous clinical response between study inclusion and week 108

        -  Steroid-free clinical remission at weeks 54 and 108

        -  Mucosal healing (endoscopic score MAYO 0-1) at weeks 54 and 108

        -  Changes in faecal calprotectin levels from baseline at week 30, 54 and 108

        -  Colectomy between W0 and W108

        -  UC-related hospitalizations throughout the trial

        -  Histological remission at W54 and W108, (Geboes score)

        -  PRO: Fatigue (FACIT), IBD Disability Index, QoL (SHS-IBD VAS)

        -  PK data (golimumab trough levels and antibodies against golimumab)

        -  Proportion of pts with LOR after discontinuation or dose de-escalation in phase II

        -  Predictors of LOR after discontinuation or dose de-escalation in phase II

        -  Proportion of patients who regained response and remission after flare AND restart of
           golimumab in Phase II.

      For the subgroup of patients who are primary non-responders to golimumab at week 10, we will
      assess the efficacy of treatment optimization, including the percentage of patients achieving
      continuous clinical response and endoscopic remission at one year.
