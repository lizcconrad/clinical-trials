    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of patient educational materials (a book and DVD) to
      help patients with chronic kidney disease make early, shared, and informed decisions about
      kidney replacement therapy. Half of the participants will receive the educational materials
      and half will receive usual care from their doctors.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will study the effectiveness of patient educational materials (a book and
      DVD, called the PREPARED materials) to help patients with chronic kidney disease make early,
      shared, and informed decisions about kidney replacement therapy. Half of the participants
      will receive the PREPARED materials and half will receive usual care from their doctors.
      PREPARED materials feature patients and their families discussing the pros and cons of
      different treatment options for kidney failure. The investigators will randomly assign
      patients already under the care of a nephrologist to receive the video and book or to receive
      their usual nephrology care. They will measure the degree to which patients in either study
      arm are prepared for kidney failure treatment at follow up.

    <description>The PREPARED DVD presents patient and health care provider testimonials that characterize the pros and cons of different kidney replacement treatment options, including in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplant, and conservative management (i.e., no dialysis or transplant). The PREPARED book reinforces differences between the treatments by showing (in lay language) summaries of scientific evidence on treatment outcomes associated with each kidney replacement option.</description>
