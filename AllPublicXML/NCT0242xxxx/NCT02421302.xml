      This will be cohort study design with both qualitative and quantitative methods of data
      collection. The investigators are aiming to study 64 HIV positive children as healthy
      controls either initiating ART or already on ART and 86 malnourished HIV infected children on
      ART or naïve initiating ART and RUTF aged between 6 months to 12 years. Primary carers will
      be asked to provide informed consent whereby the children and primary carers will be enrolled
      into the study and followed up for 12 weeks.

      BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection are intimately
      linked and present a serious health challenge in Africa. Approximately 30-50% of children in
      Uganda with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) are HIV infected. Studies on nutrition as a
      determinant of immune response and drug metabolism in malnourished children are unknown.

      GAP: Clinicians have noted that certain patients deteriorate after starting ART and
      nutritional supplementation despite viralogical suppression and immunological improvement
      with a paradoxical emergence of certain opportunistic infections, electrolyte derangement and
      malnutrition hence IRIS or re-feeding syndrome (RF). There is paucity of data on nutrition as
      a determinant of immune and pharmacological response amongst HIV infected malnourished
      children despite malnutrition being common.

      HYPOTHESIS: Well-nourished HIV infected children ART naïve or experienced will have a better
      nutritional, clinical, immunological and pharmacological outcome than malnourished children
      ART naïve or experienced.

      METHODS: A cohort design studying 75 malnourished HIV infected children on ART and RUTF
      comparing them to 75 well-nourished children ART naive or experienced aged between 6 months
      to 12 years after primary carers have provided informed consent will be enrolled into the
      study and followed up for 12 weeks.

      IMPACT: This study will endeavor to provide appropriate information that will enhance the
      management of malnourished HIV infected children in the context of both ART and RUTF and
      their impact on immune response and drug metabolism. The study will also generate other
      research questions that need to be addressed in order to optimize HIV services amongst
      malnourished children.
