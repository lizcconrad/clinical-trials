      This phase 0 trial studies hydroxychloroquine in blocking autophagy in patients with prostate
      cancer who are undergoing surgery or active surveillance. Autophagy is a process in which
      cells break down some parts of themselves to stay alive during times of stress, such as
      starvation. This may allow cancer cells to survive damage from chemotherapy.
      Hydroxychloroquine may block this process from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of different doses of hydroxychloroquine on markers of autophagy
      in prostate tumor.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the distribution of autophagic activity within prostate cancer tissue.

      II. To determine the utility of beclin-1 as a marker of autophagic activity. III. To assess
      markers of apoptosis in tumor tissue. IV. To perform deep-sequencing on prostate tissue
      obtained at the time of surgery.

      V. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a biochemical endpoint of clinical activity.

      VI. To determine the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in pre- and post-treatment
      blood samples.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (PLANNING PROSTATECTOMY): Patients in Group I are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14 days and then
      undergo prostatectomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive a higher dose of hydroxychloroquine PO thrice daily (TID) for 14
      days and then undergo prostatectomy.

      GROUP II (ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE): Patients receive hydroxychloroquine PO QD. Treatment
      continues until the beginning of local therapy or for up to 1 year.
