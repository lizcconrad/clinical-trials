  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some people with advanced heart and lung disease have heart and lung transplants. But the
      organs are often rejected. When this happens, the organ recipients must have repeated
      biopsies. These are invasive and expensive. Researchers want to see if a blood test can
      predict rejection and take the place of biopsies. The test shows how much donor DNA is in a
      recipient s blood.

      Objective:

      - To see if a new blood test can be used instead of biopsies to diagnose rejection after
      transplant.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 years and older who are on the lung or heart transplant waitlist.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have about 4 teaspoons of blood drawn from the arm before having their
           transplant.

        -  Researchers will collect demographic data about participants. They will also collect
           basic medical information about their condition.

        -  After surgery, while still in the hospital, participants will have 2 teaspoons of blood
           drawn twice a week until they go home.

        -  At each biopsy visit after the transplant, participants will have 4 teaspoons of blood
           drawn for testing for up to 5 years.

      Acute rejection (AR) occurs within the first 6 months after transplantation in 20 percent of
      heart-transplant patients and in 50 percent of lung-transplant patients. Given the often
      silent clinical presentation of AR, these patients require monitoring with repeated invasive
      and costly endomyocardial (EMB) or transbronchial biopsies (TBBx). Since organ
      transplantation is essentially genomic transplantation, our prior studies leveraged the use
      of distinctive graft and recipient genotype single-nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) to barcode
      donor DNA circulating in recipient serum. We have shown that levels of donor DNA measured as
      the percentage of circulating cell-free donor-derived DNA (%ccfdDNA) correlates with AR
      diagnosis and severity as detected by biopsy. The performance receiver operator curve (ROC)
      of %ccfdDNA yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83. Using this technique, we can
      diagnose AR by measuring elevations in %ccfdDNA up to 5 months before EMB-detected pathology.
      While these findings suggest that monitoring %ccfdDNA may offer a high-performing,
      non-invasive, and early diagnostic tool of AR, further validation studies are required to
      determine its clinical utility. The ability to diagnose AR earlier than possible with a
      biopsy offers an opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis of rejection as well as to
      identify potential AR biomarkers. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to validate
      the predictive accuracy and ROC characteristics of %ccfdDNA for AR in a multicenter,
      prospective cohort study of heart- and lung-transplant patients, recruited through a
      consortium of 5 transplant centers in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The secondary
      objectives are: 1) to compare %ccfdDNA characteristics in AMR (antibody-mediated rejection)
      and ACR (acute cellular rejection), and 2) to study early immunological changes associated
      with a significant rise in %ccfdDNA, and 3) to determine the association between early graft
      injury caused by acute rejection and infecton and the development of chronic refection.
