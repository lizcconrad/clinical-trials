    <textblock>
      This study is being done because the investigators are trying to understand how feedback from
      the muscles can influence your blood pressure and breathing during exercise, and if the
      investigators can reduce this response in heart failure patients. The investigators are also
      trying to determine ways to improve tolerance to exercise in heart failure patients.

      If you are enrolled in this study the investigators will ask you to make 3 separate study
      visits.

      During study visit 1 you will be asked to get a blood draw, DEXA bone scan, perform pulmonary
      function tests, and exercise on a stationary bike at maximal exertion while breathing into a
      mouth piece.

      During study visits 2 and 3 you will be asked to again exercise at maximal exertion while
      breathing into a mouth piece. However, during these two visits you will be receiving an
      intrathecal injection of fentanyl one day and placebo the other day, randomly selected and
      you will be blinded as to which you are receiving. A catheter will also be placed in an
      artery in your arm and a vein in your leg, which will help us to measure blood flow, blood
      pressure and draw blood when need be. The investigators will also ask you to perform a brief
      chemosensitivity test, breathing in and out your own air, after you are done exercising.

    <description>During study visits 2 and 3 you will receive an intrathecal (fluid filled space surrounding the spinal cord) injection of either fentanyl or placebo (saline). Fentanyl is an opiate (narcotic) drug and a common medication, however the way fentanyl is being used in this study is considered investigational.</description>

Local anesthetic will be used to minimize discomfort. These catheters will allow us to measure blood pressure, leg blood flow and draw blood.</description>
