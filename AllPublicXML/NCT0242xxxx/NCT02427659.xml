      Using virtual reality as a form of distraction for pain during wound care. Virtual reality
      involves looking into a set of goggles and then moving through a computer-simulated world.

      This study has three different groups. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three
      groups (two treatments and one control). Treatment for Group 1 is Virtual Reality Distraction
      during wound care. Group 2 will listen to an audio recording called &quot;Sounds of Nature&quot;. Group
      3 will be the control group.

      Subjects in all three groups will receive the following questionnaires:

      Graphic Rating Scale McGill Short-Form pain questionnaire Sullivan Catastrophization scale
      (only on Day 1/Baseline) The Nurse GRS
