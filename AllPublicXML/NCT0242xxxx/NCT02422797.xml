  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if virologically suppressed, human immunodeficiency
      virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adults on an antiretroviral regimen (including 2 nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus a third agent) remain suppressed upon switching
      to a two-drug regimen with dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV). The study will primarily
      assess the non-inferiority antiviral activity of switching to DTG + RPV once daily compared
      to continuation of current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) up to Week 48 with a switch visit for
      eligible subjects in the CAR group to initiate DTG + RPV therapy at Week 52. CAR will include
      2 NRTIs plus 1 HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (INI), or 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NNRTI), or 1 protease inhibitor (PI). The study will include a 148-week open-label
      treatment phase, comprising of an Early Switch Phase (Day 1 to Week 52) and a Late Switch
      Phase (Week 52 to Week 148). The participants fulfilling the study eligibility criteria will
      participate in the Early Switch Phase where they will either switch from their CAR to DTG +
      RPV, or continue taking their CAR, until Week 52. At the end of Early Switch Phase, eligible
      participants will proceed to the Late Switch Phase where all participants in both DTG + RPV
      and CAR treatment groups will receive DTG + RPV therapy until Week 148. After Week 148,
      subjects may be eligible to continue to receive DTG +RPV in the Continuation Phase. The study
      is planned to be conducted in approximately 476 participants.

    <time_frame>Week 48.</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with plasma HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 48 using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm was assessed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG+RPV once daily compared to continuation of CAR over 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced participants. Virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment within the window of the visit of interest. Plasma samples were collected for HIV-1 RNA at Week 0 (Day 1), Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Treatment with DTG + RPV were declared non-inferior to CAR if the lower end of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two groups in response rates at Week 48 lies above -10% by Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test. The Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) population consisted of all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was a 148-week, Phase III, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority study to assess the antiviral activity and safety of a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV) compared with current antiretroviral regimen (CAR). The study was conducted in 60 centers in 11 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total 670 participants were screened (152 failed), 518 participants were randomized and 2 subjects withdrew before being exposed to study drug. The study included a Screening phase, an early switch phase, a late switch phase, and a continuation phase. The results presented are based on the interim analysis of the Early Switch Phase.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>DTG + RPV</title>
          <description>Participants received DTG 50 milligrams (mg) + RPV 25 mg together once daily at approximately the same time, with a meal, in an open-label fashion up to Week 52 during early switch phase.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Current Antiretroviral Regimen</title>
          <description>Participants continued to receive their current antiretroviral regimen (two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NRTIs] + a third agent). A third agent included either an: integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI). CAR was administered according to the approved labeling in an open-label fashion up to Week 52 during early switch phase.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 Copies/Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 48 Using Snapshot Algorithm</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with plasma HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 48 using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm was assessed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG+RPV once daily compared to continuation of CAR over 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced participants. Virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment within the window of the visit of interest. Plasma samples were collected for HIV-1 RNA at Week 0 (Day 1), Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Treatment with DTG + RPV were declared non-inferior to CAR if the lower end of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two groups in response rates at Week 48 lies above -10% by Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test. The Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) population consisted of all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with plasma HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 24 using the FDA snapshot algorithm was assessed to evaluate the antiviral activity of DTG +RPV once daily compared to continuation of CAR. Virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment within the window of the visit of interest. Plasma samples were collected for HIV-1 RNA at Baseline(Day 1), Week 4, 8, 12 and 24.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline (Day 1) and at Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 to evaluate alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, chloride, creatinine, glucose, potassium, phosphate, sodium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total carbon dioxide, lipase, creatine phosphokinase and creatinine clearance. Value obtained at Day 1 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value. Number of participants who experienced maximum grade toxicity post-baseline in clinical chemistry over 48 weeks was summarized. Participants were graded using the Division of AIDS Table for Grading Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events. Grade 1=mild; grade and grade 4=potentially life-threatening. For all laboratory parameters, one assessment out of range was sufficient to be considered a chemistry toxicity.</description>

Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). For bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, procollagen 1-N-propeptide, osteocalcin and type 1 collagen C-telopeptide, analyses of changes from Baseline were performed on log-transformed data. Results were transformed back via exponential transformation such that treatment comparisons are assessed via odds ratios.</description>

        <description>Two separate blood samples for DTG and RPV were collected pre-dose at Weeks 4, 24 and 48. Pre-dose concentrations of DTG and RPV at Weeks 4, 24 and 48 or withdrawal were summarized for the participants switching to DTG + RPV in the early switch phase. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter Population consisted of all participants who received DTG +RPV and provided at least one evaluable estimate of predose concentration (C0). Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV 1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48 Using Snapshot Algorithm by Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with plasma HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 48 using the FDA snapshot algorithm was assessed by Baseline third agent class to assess the impact of Baseline third agent class (INSTI, NNRTI, or PI) on efficacy, safety and tolerability of DTG +RPV compared to continuation of CAR. Plasma samples were collected for HIV-1 RNA at Baseline (Day 1), Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48. The analysis was done using cochran-mantel haenszel test stratified by current antiretroviral third-agent class. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any AE, AELD or AE With Grade 1, 2, 3 or 4 Toxicity Over 48 Weeks by Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Number of participants with any AE, AELD or AE with maximum grade toxicity experienced by any one participant over 48 weeks by Baseline third agent class (INSTI, NNRTI, or PI) was summarized. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Maximum Post-baseline Emergent Chemistry Toxicities Over 48 Weeks by Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline (Day 1) and at Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 to evaluate ALT, albumin, ALP, AST, total bilirubin, chloride, creatinine, glucose, potassium, phosphate, sodium, BUN, total carbon dioxide, lipase, creatine phosphokinase and creatinine clearance. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value. Number of participants who experienced maximum toxicity grade post-baseline in chemistry parameters over 48 weeks by Baseline third agent treatment class (INSTI, NNRTI, PI) was summarized.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Maximum Post-baseline Emergent Hematology Toxicities Over 48 Weeks by Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline (Day 1) and at Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 to evaluate hemoglobin, hematocrit, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, MCV, RBC count, WBC count and platelet count. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value. Number of participants who experienced maximum toxicity grade post-baseline in hematology parameters over 48 weeks by Baseline third agent treatment class (INSTI, NNRTI, PI) was summarized.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Observed Genotypic Resistance for Participants Meeting Virologic Withdrawal Criteria by Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class</title>
        <description>For all participants who meet virologic withdrawal criteria, plasma samples with HIV-1 RNA level &gt;=200 c/mL were to be analyzed in an attempt to obtain genotype data on as many samples as possible. Samples for drug resistance testing (genotypic) were to be collected at Day 1. Number of participants with genotypic resistance to CAR and to DTG or RPV for those meeting virologic withdrawal criteria in subgroups stratified based on Baseline third agent treatment class (INSTI, NNRTI, PI) were to be summarized. This outcome has not been analyzed as the number of participants was low (1 CVW per arm) and summaries by Baseline third agent were not provided. Therefore, data are not available for this outcome measure due to the insufficient number of participants with events.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pre-specified Treatment Symptoms Using the Symptom Distress Module at Weeks 4, 24 and 48 or Withdrawal From the Study</title>
        <description>The Symptom Distress Module, also called the HIV Symptom Index or Symptoms Impact Questionnaire, is a 20-item self-reported measure that addresses the presence and perceived distress linked to symptoms commonly associated with HIV or its treatment. Between and within treatment group comparisons were assessed on change from Baseline in pre-specified treatment symptoms using the Symptom Distress Module at Weeks 4, 24 and 48 or withdrawal from the study. Change from Baseline in Symptom count and symptom bother score have been summarized. The symptom bother score is based on the score for each symptom present ranging from 1 (it doesn't bother me) to 4 (it bothers me a lot). The symptom bother score ranges from 0 to 80. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used as primary method of analysis. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

A third agent included either an: integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI). CAR was administered according to the approved labeling in an open-label fashion up to Week 52 during early switch phase.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Treatment Satisfaction Using the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIV TSQ) at Weeks 4, 24 and 48 or Withdrawal From the Study</title>
        <description>The HIV TSQ is a 10-item self-reported scale that measures overall satisfaction with treatment and by specific domains e.g., convenience, flexibility. Each item is scored 0-6 where a higher score indicates the greater improvement in the past few weeks. These items are summed up to produce a treatment satisfaction total score (0 to 60) and 2 subscales: general satisfaction/clinical and lifestyle/ease subscales (0 to 30). The HIV TSQ was administered as a paper questionnaire. Between and within treatment group comparisons were assessed on change from Baseline treatment satisfaction using the HIV TSQ at Weeks 4, 24 and 48 or withdrawal from the study. Total score, lifestyle/ease score and General satisfaction/clinical sub-score (CS) have been summarized. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

A third agent included either an: integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI). CAR was administered according to the approved labeling in an open-label fashion up to Week 52 during early switch phase.</description>
