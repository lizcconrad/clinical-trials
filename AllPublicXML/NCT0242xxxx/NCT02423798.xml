  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will investigate the accuracy and performance of a new sensor for continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM), the (new generation) Enlite, CE-marked in 2013, in conjunction with
      the new Medtronic 640G system components.

      To evaluate the accuracy and performance of the new generation Enlite sensor. This is a
      postmarket, interventional, open-label, non-randomized, single center clinical research
      trial.

      The trial will adopt a prospective single-sample design using the Yellow Spring Instruments
      (YSI) plasma glucose reference sampling procedure in the clinic and self-monitoring of blood
      glucose (SMBG) plasma glucose reference sampling procedure at home.

      The trial will investigate the accuracy and performance (i.e. the life-time) of a new sensor
      for CGM, the (new generation) Enlite glucose sensor, CE-marked in 2013, in conjunction with
      the new Medtronic 640G system components. Accuracy and life-time of the sensor are important
      parameters contributing to the safety of patients and patient acceptance of this still fairly
      new technology.

      The current trial investigates the accuracy of the new sensor in conjunction with the new
      640G system components both in the clinic and at home. This enables us to assess the sensor
      accuracy in a well-controlled environment using a highly accurate laboratory glucose analyzer
      as reference as well as sensor accuracy during real-life conditions using a blood glucose
      meter as reference analyzer.

      The data gathered in this trial will help to understand the effect of technological
      advancements made and can guide future development of glucose sensor for continuous glucose
      monitoring.

    <description>The trial has an open label design with a glucose sensor intervention. Only 1 sensor system is used in the trial (no comparator).
As all subjects will receive identical devices and undergo the same experimental procedures, no randomization will be performed. Furthermore, neither subjects nor clinical staff will be blinded to the sensor readings, as knowing the sensor glucose readings will not affect the accuracy endpoint.</description>

    <description>This is a postmarket, interventional, open-label, non-randomized, single center clinical research trial. The trial will adopt a prospective single-sample design using the Yellow Spring Instruments (YSI) plasma glucose reference sampling procedure in the clinic and selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) plasma glucose reference sampling procedure at home. The trial will consist of 6 visits to the investigational site: a visit for informed consent procedures (Visit 0), a screening visit (Visit 1), 3 study visits (Visit 2-4) and a final examination (Visit 5).</description>
