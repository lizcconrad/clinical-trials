  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) has been widely studied in clinical trials and has
      probiotic, health-promoting effects in both adults and children, and is safe for human
      consumption. Animal models indicate that treatment with L. reuteri has positive effects on
      bone metabolism and bone density. In other animal models of diabetes and the metabolic
      syndrome, positive effects on blood glucose and weight have been reported. The present
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study is designed to investigate if dietary
      supplementation with L. reuteri twice daily for 12 months has any effect on bone density,
      body composition, inflammation, or metabolic and endocrine markers in elderly women with
      osteopenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of the gut microbes for human health has gained considerable interest in recent
      years. Lactobacillus reuteri (L.reuteri) is a naturally occurring bacterial species in the
      human gut. L. reuteri has been widely studied in clinical trials of adults and children and
      treatment with L. reuteri is safe and is associated with health-promoting effects in humans.
      In animal models, L. reuteri has anti-inflammatory effects and in ovariectomized mice
      supplementation with L. reuteri partly prevented the bone loss induced by estrogen
      deficiency. Furthermore, both bone density and bone formation increased in male mice in
      another mice model. In mice with medically induced diabetes mellitus, L. reuteri reduced
      blood glucose and in a mouse model mimicking the metabolic syndrome, L. reuteri prevented
      diet-induced obesity. The present study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,
      study in 90 elderly women with osteopenia recruited from the population. These women will be
      treated with L. reuteri or placebo orally twice daily for 12 months. The effects on bone will
      be investigated with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, high-resolution peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography, and bone turnover markers. Hormones and markers of
      inflammation and metabolism will be followed as well as changes in the gut microbiota
      composition.
