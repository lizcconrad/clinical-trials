      This is a multi-center, open label, pilot futility clinical trial of the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of oral salsalate in up to 10
      patients with PSP. All participants will be administered 2,250 mg daily [1,500 mg every day
      before noon (every AM) and 750 mg every night at bedtime (every HS)] for 6 months.

      If ≥3 patients experience drug limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined below, the study will be
      terminated.

      A DLT is defined as: 1) any Grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE) per National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for which there is
      reasonable possibility that salsalate caused the event, 2) any Grade 2 AE in the CTCAE system
      organ class of nervous system disorders that is considered clinically significant and for
      which there is reasonable possibility that salsalate caused the event, or 3) any Grade 2 or
      higher treatment-related adverse events during administration that do not resolve promptly
      with supportive treatment.

      An interim futility analysis will be performed after five subjects have completed 6 months of
      study drug treatment. If the criteria listed in the Statistical Methods section of this
      synopsis are met, an additional 5 subjects will be enrolled in the trial. If not, the trial
      will be terminated.
