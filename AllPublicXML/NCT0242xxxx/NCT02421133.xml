  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, it has be estimated that the hospital readmission rate within 30 days of patients
      aged 75 or older is 14% (IC95% [12.0-16.7]), nearly a quarter being avoidable. There is
      evidence that interventions &quot;bridging&quot; the transition from hospital to home involving a
      dedicated professional (usually nurses) would be most effective in reducing the risk of
      readmission, but the level of evidence of current studies is low. Our study aims to assess
      the impact of a program of transitional care from hospital to home for people of 75 years old
      or more admitted to acute care.

      The study is a stepped wedge randomized cluster study. Intervention: The transition care
      program, involving a dedicated advanced practice nurse, will include: 1) during the patient's
      stay in hospital: an individualized needs-based comprehensive discharge plan and a
      transitional care record ; the notification of the primary care physician about inpatient
      care and hospital discharge; 2) the day of the discharge: specific explanations about the
      organization of home care provided by the transition care nurse to the patient; 3) during 4
      weeks after discharge: monitoring patients and caregivers regularly through home visits
      and/or telephone contact,

    <description>During the patient's stay in hospital, the transition nurse creates a transitional care file including information about the patient (inpatient medical and nurse care plan, medications), the discharge plan, and the contact information of the relevant primary care providers. She notifies the patient's primary care physician of the date of the discharge to home, of the potential medical problems and of the discharge care plan; a primary care physician visit is planned the month following the discharge.
The day of the hospital discharge: meeting with the patient to review the follow-up recommendations. The transition nurse verifies that the medications are prescribed accordingly with the discharge plan, that the patient and his caregiver understand the prescription and are informed with the planned appointments and the biological monitoring.
During 4 weeks after the hospital discharge: follow-up by the transition nurse once a week, alternately by telephone and home visit.</description>

    <description>The patients will be discharged according to the usual care plan of each participating hospital.

The communication of information to the primary care providers (nurse, primary care physician…) is left to the discretion of the medical teams of the discharging hospitals, according to their habits of work.</description>
