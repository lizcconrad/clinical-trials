  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple ascending oral doses of ASP6282 in healthy
      male and female subjects. 1 cohort (elderly) receives also a midazolam dosing.

      This study will also explore the effect of itraconazole (another drug) on the PK of ASP6282,
      as well as to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP6282 alone and in combination with
      itraconazole in healthy male and female subjects.

      Also, this study is to evaluate the PD and PK effects of single oral doses of ASP6282 on
      pilocarpine-induced salivation and pupil diameter in healthy nonelderly male and female
      subjects.

      This study consists of three parts. Part 1 is Single Ascending Dose Including Food Effect and
      Drug-drug Interaction (DDI) with Itraconazole. There will be a washout between treatment
      period 1 and 2 in the DDI arm of Part 1; Part 2 is a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD); Part 3,
      with a treatment period 1, 2 and 3 is Proof of Pharmacology. There will be a washout between
      each treatment period

             unit on Day -1.

          -  Subject uses any inducer of metabolism (e.g., barbiturates, rifampin) within 1 month
             prior to admission to the clinical unit on Day -1.

             unit on Day -1.

          -  Subject had significant blood loss, donated 1 unit (500 mL) of blood or more, or
             received a transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days or donated plasma
             within 7 days prior to admission to the clinical unit on Day -1.

          -  Subject has a positive serology test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
             hepatitis A virus antibodies (anti-HAV) (immunoglobulin M [IgM]), hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (anti-HCV), or antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
             and/or type 2 (HIV-2) at screening.

          -  Subject participated in any clinical study or has been treated with any
             investigational drugs within 90 days prior to screening.

        Germany only:

          -  Subject has a mean pulse &lt; 50 or &gt; 90 bpm; mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 140
             mmHg; mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 90 mmHg (vital signs measurements taken in
             triplicate after subject has been resting in supine position for 5 minutes; pulse will
             be measured automatically) on admission to the clinical unit on day -1. (For elderly
             subjects the following criteria apply: SBP &gt; 160 mmHg and DBP &gt; 100 mmHg). If the mean
             blood pressure exceeds the limits above, 1 additional triplicate can be taken.

          -  Subject has a mean corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 430 ms
             (for male subjects) and &gt; 450 ms (for female subjects) at day -1. If the mean QTcF
             exceeds the limits above, 1 additional triplicate ECG can be taken at day -1.

          -  Subject has a positive serology test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
             hepatitis B core antibodies, hepatitis A virus antibodies (anti-HAV) (immunoglobulin M
             [IgM]), hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti-HCV), or antibodies to human
             immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and/or type 2 (HIV-2) at screening.

          -  Subject is unable to communicate, read and understand German, or has any other
             condition which, in the investigator's opinion, makes the subject unsuitable for
             clinical study participation.

          -  Subject is a vulnerable subject (e.g., subject kept in detention).

          -  Subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to ASP6282, itraconazole (part 1 -
             DDI only), pilocarpine (part 3 - PoP only) or midazolam (part 2 - elderly cohort only)
             or any components of the formulations used.

          -  Subject uses any prescribed or nonprescribed drugs (including vitamins, natural and
             herbal remedies, e.g., St. John's wort) in the 2 weeks prior to first study drug
             administration, except for occasional use of paracetamol (up to 2 g/day) (all parts)
             and except for use of hormone replacement therapy (except for part 1 - DDI).
