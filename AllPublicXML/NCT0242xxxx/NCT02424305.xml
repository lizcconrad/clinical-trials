      This is an open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomised multi-centre trial in which 3 parallel
      groups will be enrolled. The trial includes three active treatment groups. To be eligible for
      inclusion in this trial, subjects must have at least 15 clinically typical, visible, and
      discrete actinic keratosis (AKs) on the face, scalp or on the arm within a contiguous area of
      approximately 250 cm2 of sun-damaged skin.

      There will be 3 treatment groups: (1) once daily application of LEO43204 gel 0.018% on the
      full face for three consecutive days, (2) once daily application of LEO43204 gel 0.1% on the
      arm on a treatment area of approximately 250 cm2 for three consecutive days and , (3) once
      daily application of LEO43204 gel 0.037 % on the scalp for three consecutive days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with 15 or more clinically typical, visible and discrete AKs on either:

               -  Full face (corresponding to a treatment area of at least 250 cm2). If subjects
                  have a beard they must shave no later than the day before the first drug
                  application.

               -  A contiguous area of approximately 250 cm2 on the arm between wrist and shoulder.

               -  Balding scalp (corresponding to a treatment area of approximately 250 cm2).
                  Subjects with sparse hair on the scalp can be enrolled as long as LSR and AK
                  assessments are not compromised.

          2. Subject at least 18 years of age.

          3. Female subjects of childbearing potential* must be confirmed not pregnant by a
             negative urine pregnancy test prior to trial treatment.

          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective
             contraception at trial entry and until completion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Location of the treatment area (full face, full balding scalp, chest, trunk or
             extremities)

               -  within 5 cm of an incompletely healed wound.

               -  within 5 cm of a suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or SCC.

          2. Previously assigned treatment in this clinical trial or previously participated in a
             clinical trial in the LEO 43204 programme.

          3. Lesions in the treatment area that have: atypical clinical appearance (e.g. cutaneous
             horns)and/or, recalcitrant disease (e.g., did not respond to cryotherapy on two
             previous occasions).
