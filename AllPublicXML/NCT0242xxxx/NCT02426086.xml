  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of spleen (largest lymph organ in the
      body) response and symptom response of 2 dose regimens of imetelstat in participants with
      intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) who are relapsed after or refractory to Janus
      Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment. Key secondary endpoint includes overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), multicenter (more
      than one hospital, medical school team or medical clinic work on a medical research study)
      study of 2 dosing regimens (treatment arms) of single-agent imetelstat in participants with
      intermediate-2 or high risk myelofibrosis (MF) whose disease is relapsed after or refractory
      to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment. The main study consists of 3 parts: Screening
      Phase (21 days before randomization); single-blind Treatment Phase (from randomization until
      study drug discontinuation); and Follow up Phase (until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal
      of consent or study end, whichever occurs first). Participants in Arm 1 will receive
      imetelstat 9.4 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) intravenously (IV) for every 3 weeks until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end and Arm 2 will receive imetelstat
      4.7 mg/kg IV for every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study
      end. Participants in Arm 2 may continue with their current imetelstat dose or have it
      increased to 9.4 mg/kg at the investigator's discretion. Percentage of spleen response and
      symptom response will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study. The study is closed to further participant enrollment. Participants
      benefiting from study treatment will continue to receive imetelstat in Extension Phase for
      approximately 1 year or until loss of benefit or unacceptable toxicity. Participants entering
      to Extension phase from Follow up Phase will continue follow up for safety via serious
      adverse event collection and for survival status. The Extension Phase will end approximately
      1 year after the clinical cutoff for the final analysis of the main study, or when the
      sponsor terminates the study, whichever occurs first.
