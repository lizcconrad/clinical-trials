    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of Program SI! for Elementary in
      different times of exposure for childrens and their immediate environment (teachers and
      parents). For this purpose, 48 public schools from the Community of Madrid-South Area (Spain)
      were randomly assigned to Program SI! during 3 or 6 academic years (intervention group) or
      keep their normal curriculum (control group). The main outcome is 3-year, and 6-year changes
      from baseline of questionnaire scoring of children, their parents and teachers in regards to
      a healthy lifestyle. For children were included 3-year, and 6-year changes of cardiovascular
      markers derived from blood pressure and anthropometry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Program SI! is a multilevel school-based intervention integrating four cardiovascular
      health-related components (diet, physical activity, human body and emotions management).
      Since the Program SI! for preschoolers has shown good results in improving healthy lifestyle
      habits in children aged 3 to 5 years, the investigators have developed the Program SI! for
      Elementary addressed to children from 6 to 11 years. The objective of the study is to
      evaluate the effects of Program SI! for Elementary in different times of exposure for
      childrens and their immediate environment (teachers, parents and school). In the Community of
      Madrid-South Area (Spain), 48 public schools from were randomly assigned to Program SI! for
      Elementary during 3 or 6 academic years (intervention group) or keep their normal curriculum
      (control group). The main outcome is 3-year, and 6-year changes from baseline of
      questionnaire scoring of children, and the secondary outcome is 3-year, and 6-year changes
      from baseline of questionnaire scoring of their parents and teachers in regards to a healthy
      lifestyle, as well as changes in the school environment. For children were included 3-year,
      and 6-year changes of cardiovascular markers derived from blood pressure and anthropometry
      (weight, height, waist circumference and skinfold thickness). The Program SI! for Elementary
      is designed for different exposures in a sample of schools never intervened to asses when the
      intervention has the most effectiveness. Besides, as some schools involved in the preschool
      study continues the Program SI! for Elementary, the investigators can be able to evaluate the
      impact of the Program SI! in different school stages, concluding how children keep the
      adoption of healthy behaviors from early in life.

    <description>To evaluate children's lifestyle we use a specific questionnaire about knowledge, attitudes and habits in relation to the four components of Program SI! for Elementary (diet, physical activity, body and heart, and emotions management) (article under revision). A trained team of psychologist applies the children's questionnaires at the school.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the impact of the Program SI! for Elementary in cardiovascular health markers of children blood pressure and some anthropometric parameters are measured (height, weight, waist circumference and triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness) under standardized protocol developed in previous studies (Santos-Beneit et al. 2014).</description>

    <description>The family's habits are evaluated through a specific questionnaire related to key messages for families provided by the Program SI! for Elementary and some general questions about tobacco use and health status (article under revision) and stress perception (Remor 2006). Also in the questionnaire for families are included some questions about their son or daughter's habits (Serra-Majem et al 2004, Goodman 1997, Encuesta Nacional de Salud 2011/2012).</description>
