  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of propranolol in combination with early
      intensive behavioral intervention on social interaction, and secondarily on language,
      anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and global function in children with autism in a double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled pilot trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' specific aim is to examine the effects of serial doses of propranolol in
      combination with early intensive behavioral intervention on social interaction, and
      secondarily on language tasks, anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and global function in children
      with autism in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will also
      examine whether response to treatment can be predicted based upon markers of autonomic
      functioning, such as pupillary light reflex and heart rate variability, and whether anxiety
      predicts treatment response. The investigators' hypothesis is that propranolol will augment
      the effects of behavioral therapy on social functioning and language abilities. The
      investigators have demonstrated benefits of propranolol on social functioning and language in
      previous single-dose studies in adults and adolescents with autism. The investigators also
      predict that those with the greatest degree of autonomic dysregulation will demonstrate the
      greatest benefit from the drug.

    <measure>Change in General Social Outcome Measure (GSOM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GSOM is a brief evaluation tool that measures a participant's level of social functioning and how it changes with intervention. There GSOM includes 4 different tasks: conversational reciprocity, ability to recognize facial expressions, social problem solving, affect demonstration, and emotional perspective taking. The experimenter administers each component of the GSOM to the participant and then scores their responses according to a pre-determined scoring rubric. Each component is scored on a 1-5 or 0 - 2 scale, with higher total scores indicating better social functioning. A video camera will be used to record the participant's behavior during GSOM administration for the purposes of having two independent raters score the tasks after the study session is complete. The video camera will be turned off for the remainder of the study session. A camera will also be used during the affect demonstration task of the GSOM.</description>

    <measure>Change in Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This 65-item, parent-report measure asks questions about a participants' social awareness, social information processing, capacity for reciprocal social responses, social anxiety or avoidance, and characteristic autistic preoccupations or traits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Preschool Anxiety Scale (PAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To assess anxiety, the PAS will be completed by the parents/caregivers of participants. This self-report measure yields a total score in addition to six subscales (separation anxiety, social phobia, obsessive compulsive, panic/agoraphobia, physical injury fears, and generalized anxiety).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To assess overall changes in the participant's ASD-related clinical symptoms, the CGIC will be administered. The CGIC consists of a 7-point subjective scale assessing change from baseline, initially assessed via the the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGIS) scale (CGIS). On the CGIC scale, scores of 1, 2, and 3 represent marked, moderate, and mild improvement, respectively. A score of 4 represents no change. Scores of 5, 6, and 7 represent mild, moderate, and marked worsening, respectively. CGIC scores from both the parent/caregiver and a blinded clinician will be utilized.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGIS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To assess overall severity of a participant's ASD-related clinical symptoms, the CGIS will be administered. The CGIS consists of a 7-point subjective scale assessing symptom severity. On this scale, scores of 1, 2, and 3 represent normal, some presence of symptoms, and mild behavior, respectively. A score of 4 represents moderate behavior. Scores of 5, 6, and 7 represent marked, severe, and among the most severe behavior, respectively. CGIS scores from both the parent/caregiver and a blinded clinician will be utilized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To assess overall behavioral disturbances, a parent/caregiver of the participants will complete ABC. This 58-item questionnaire is a well validated, reliable, and widely used assessment tool for interventions for a range of cognitive disorders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To assess overall adaptive functioning, the VABS will be administered in the form of a structured interview with the parent/caregiver. The VABS is a well validated assessment used for the full range of our subjects' ages and yields standard scores in Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. VABS scores for Communication, Daily Living Skills, and Socialization will be monitored in this study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autism Impact Measure (AIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The AIM will be administered to assess the frequency and impact of a participant's ASD-related symptoms. A parent/caregiver is asked a series of 41 questions regarding the frequency and the impact, or interference resulting from, a series of autism-associated behaviors. Overall impact and frequency scores, as well as subscale scores, will be obtained from this measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Preschool Language Scale (PLS):</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate language, we will administer the PLS, which has been developed for use in younger children (birth through age 7), and is appropriate for children of all ability levels, including nonverbal children. This play-based, interactive assessment is designed to assess receptive and expressive language skills and their change over time.</description>

    <description>Propranolol will be administered in the form of a liquid dose via oral syringe by the participants' parent/caregiver an hour before each EIBI session. To minimize risk, the bodyweight adjusted minimum dose of propranolol used safely for test anxiety in healthy adults (10mg) will be used: participants weighing &gt; 30 kg will be given 4 mg, participants weighing 22.5 - 30 kg will be given 3 mg, participants weighing 15 - 22.5 kg will be given 2 mg. Participants weighing &lt; 15 kg will be excluded for safety reasons.</description>
