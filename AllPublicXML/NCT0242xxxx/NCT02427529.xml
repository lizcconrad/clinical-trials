  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are female patients, randomized to HCG group or placebo group, during a prospective
      trial, in order to determine the significance, if any, of HCG on maintaining muscle mass
      during a very low calorie diet in order to demonstrate the potential significance of HCG
      administration on preserving lean body mass while losing weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four-week clinical trials were conducted on 59 females between the ages of 20 and 55, over an
      18 month period. Exclusion criteria included thyroid conditions or prior significant medical
      history. Patients were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of either hCG
      (200-300IU) or saline (placebo). All were placed on a VLCD resembling a protein-sparing
      modified fast. The caloric intake was between 500 and 600 calories, with 50% protein and 50%
      complex carbohydrates consisting mostly of fruits and vegetables. Measured parameters:
      weight, body composition via bio-impedance, blood pressure, and blood labs. A subset also
      underwent weekly electrocardiograms (EKG).
