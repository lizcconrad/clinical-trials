  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to high injury rates in soccer, the Fédération Internationale de Football
      Association (FIFA) developed an injury prevention program called the &quot;11+&quot;. It is designed to
      replace a standard warm-up and takes about 20 minutes to complete. The program has proven
      remarkably effective in decreasing the rate of injury in soccer players. However, uptake of
      the 11+ has been less than desired. Adoption of the program may be increased if additional
      benefits can be demonstrated and the program is introduced at a younger age. The goals of
      this study are to (1)establish that young athletes can tolerate the program, and (2)measure
      the effects of the 11+ program on the physical performance of 10-12 year old girls. Three
      teams will be randomly assigned to the intervention group and carry out the 11+ program for
      the duration of the indoor soccer season. Another 3 teams will continue with their usual
      warm-up. Pre- and post-intervention, balance, agility, core strength and movement control
      will be assessed in all athletes. The investigators hypothesize that the athletes will
      tolerate the program well and that the intervention group will improve on the performance
      tests significantly more than the control group.
