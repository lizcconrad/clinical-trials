  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a brain injury (BI) , patients complain in particular about sequel fatigue. This
      symptom affects about 50 % of the patients; it is severe, with a repercussion on quality of
      life, reeducation and occupational reintegration, and persists often at a distance of the
      accident. The investigators' hypothesis is that patients who presented a severe BI could
      benefit from a treatment by withe blue enriched bright light in order to improve fatigue and
      quality of life.

      After a BI , patients complain in particular about sequel fatigue. This symptom affects about
      50 % of the patients; it is severe, with a repercussion on quality of life, reeducation and
      occupational reintegration, and persists often at a distance of the accident. The
      investigators' hypothesis is that patients who presented a severe BI could benefit from a
      treatment by blue enriched withe bright light in order to improve fatigue and quality of
      life.

      The main objective is to decrease fatigue and the secondary objectives are to improve quality
      of life,decrease daytime sleepiness and increase vigilance.

      This is a randomized clinical trial with 2 groups blue enriched withe bright light versus
      nothing) including 20 patients.The treatment will take 8 weeks with 30 minutes exposition at
      awakening to withe blue enriched bright light (Luminette, Belgium). The investigators willl
      estimate the fatigue severity scale score , the quality of life the score (SF12), the
      sleepiness Epworth score, and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) The investigators will
      included patient with severe BI more than six months after the BI.
