  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate and compared the effects of cervical and
      scapulothoracic stabilization exercises with and without connective tissue massage (CTM) for
      patients with chronic mechanical neck pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with chronic mechanical neck pain were recruited and randomly allocated into
      stabilization exercise with and without the connective tissue massage program. The study's
      inclusion criteria were as follows: 18 to 65 years of age, having neck pain for more than 3
      months, and being volunteer. The exclusion criteria were as follows: stenosis, traumatic
      injury history, previous surgery related to cervical spine, hypermobility, cancer, having
      inflammatory rheumatologic, severe psychological disorders, being pregnant, and intervention
      including exercise or physical therapy in the last 3 months.The program was carried out for
      12 sessions, 3 days/week in 4 weeks. Pain intensity with Visual Analog Scale, pressure pain
      threshold with digital algometer, the level of anxiety with the Spielberger State Trait
      Anxiety Inventory, and life quality with Short Form-36 were evaluated before and after
      treatment.
