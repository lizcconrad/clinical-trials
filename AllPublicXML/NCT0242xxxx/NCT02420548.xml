  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Safe, Healthy, Adolescent Relationships and Peers study seeks to understand some of the
      factors that contribute to the behaviors and health of teen girls, such as girl's
      friendships, their dating behaviors, their risk-taking behaviors, and their knowledge about
      how to make healthy choices. This study will inform us on ways to help teen girls engage in
      safe and healthy relationships and adjustment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initiation of drug use and participation in sexual-risk behaviors such as having multiple
      sexual partners, unprotected sexual intercourse, and intercourse with drug users are all too
      common among girls with at-risk histories, such as those who have experienced poverty, abuse,
      neglect, or been in the juvenile justice system. Studies consistently find that these girls
      have disproportionately high rates of these problems that, in addition to increasing risk for
      negative outcomes, have other costly sequelae such as drug addiction, early pregnancy,
      sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV contraction, delinquency, and early mortality
      (e.g., Santelli et al., 2001; Stueve et al., 2005). In our prior work, the investigators
      showed that the investigators could prevent early onset sexual intercourse and tobacco and
      marijuana initiation in pre-teen girls in foster care. Although this intervention, delivered
      to girls who were 11-years old and had not yet entered middle school, demonstrated efficacy,
      the investigators know very little about how to prevent the more serious and costly
      sexual-risk and illicit drug use behaviors in at-risk girls during the high school years, a
      period of risk for engagement in such behaviors. This study builds from this prior work to
      develop a new intervention for teenage girls with early adversity.
