    <textblock>
      This pilot trial seeks to obtain preliminary data on the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) (4g/d) on endothelial function measured via endopat2000 after 12 weeks of intervention
      among adults with elevated triglycerides and type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty adults aged 30-75 y will be randomized to either 4 g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid or no
      drug for 12 weeks. Endothelial function will be measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. in a
      secondary aims, we will evaluate effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on plasma levels of
      c-reactive protein, oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and endothelin-1.
