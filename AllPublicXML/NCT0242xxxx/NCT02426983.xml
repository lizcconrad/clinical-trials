  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation
      which uses a very weak constant current to temporarily excite the brain area of interest via
      small electrodes placed on the scalp. Currently, tDCS is being used as a tool to investigate
      mental processes (cognition) and motor function (movement) in healthy controls and to treat
      neurological (i.e. stroke) and psychiatric (i.e. depression and dementia) patients. tDCS has
      been found to improve motor processes and cognitive performance, including attention and
      memory functions. This study will attempt to examine the effects of tDCS on a specific aspect
      of short term memory to sounds measured from electrical activity (EEG) from the top of the
      scalp. This study will also assess the effect of a drug, dextromethorphan (DMO), commonly
      found in cough syrup, which is thought to regulate tDCS treatment through brain receptors.
      The study involves four laboratory test sessions. EEG assessments will be done in two
      sessions involving 'anodal' tDCS stimulation (to temporarily excite cortical activity
      locally), one session with DMO treatment and one with placebo treatment, and two sessions
      involving 'sham' tDCS stimulation (device is turned off), with the same DMO and placebo
      treatments. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the brain chemistry
      involved in tDCS treatment and its effects on cognitive abilities.

    <description>Electrodes will be placed on the scalp overlying the left auditory cortex (anodal electrode) and on the contralateral forehead above the orbit (reference/cathode). Stimulation will be applied using a battery-driven constant-current regulator (Oasis Pro, Edmonton). In active tDCS sessions, the DC current will be initially increased in a ramp-like fashion over 10 s until reaching 2 mA and will be similarly decreased at the end of stimulation. In active tDCS, stimulation will be maintained for a total of 20 minutes. This will occur in two separate sessions, occurring within weeks.</description>

    <description>In sham sessions, the device will have the same placement and intensity, but will only be turned on for 30 seconds.

Conductive saline-soaked rubber electrodes super-imposed on sponge plates will be placed on the scalp overlying the left auditory cortex (anodal electrode) and on the contralateral forehead above the orbit (reference/cathode).

In active tDCS sessions, the DC current will be initially increased in a ramp-like fashion over 10 s until reaching 2 mA and will be similarly decreased at the end of stimulation. In active tDCS, stimulation will be maintained for a total of 20 minutes. This will occur in two separate sessions, occurring within weeks.
