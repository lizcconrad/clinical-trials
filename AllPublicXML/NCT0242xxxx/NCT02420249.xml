  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: (1) To investigate the effects of Qigong training on upper limb oedema,
      circulatory status, shoulder flexibility and muscular strength, body balance, and quality of
      life (QOL) in community-dwelling breast cancer survivors; and (2) to explore the relationship
      between the impairment outcomes and QOL outcomes.

      Hypothesis: (1) The experimental participants will have less impairment and a better QOL
      after Qigong training compared with the no-training control group; and (2) the impairment
      parameters will be related to the QOL indexes in the Qigong participants.

      Design and subjects: This will be a prospective, randomised, single-blinded controlled trial.
      Approximately 60 breast cancer survivors will be randomly assigned to either the Qigong
      training group (n~30) or control group (n~30).

      Intervention: Participants in the Qigong group will receive 18 Forms of Tai Chi Internal
      Qigong training for 3 months with two supervised 1-hour sessions per week.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measures are upper limb circumference, arterial
      blood flow velocities and resistance index, shoulder joint passive range of motion, muscular
      strength (peak force) and body balance. The secondary outcome measure is quality of life as
      measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast scale.

      Data analysis: Data will be analysed via repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by
      post-hoc tests (α = 0.05).

      Expected results: The investigators pilot studies produced encouraging results on the
      efficacy of Qigong exercise in reducing chronic breast cancer-related symptoms in survivors.
      Therefore, the investigators expect that participants in the Qigong group will have fewer
      upper limb impairments and a better quality of life after Qigong training. If the results are
      positive, this Qigong training regime is readily transferrable to clinical practice, and
      could have positive socioeconomic effects such as reduced healthcare costs.

    <description>Participants assigned to the Qigong group will receive Qigong training. The Qigong training programme will be run for 3 months with two supervised 1-hour sessions per week. Participants will learn the 18 Forms of Tai Chi Internal Qigong. The training sessions will be conducted by a qualified Qigong instructor from the Natural Health Qigong Association. Participants in the control group will receive no Qigong training during the study period. They will receive an 18 Forms of Tai Chi Internal Qigong training package after the study.</description>
