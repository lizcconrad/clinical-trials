  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus accounts for numerous cases (epidemics) of respiratory illnesses each year
      worldwide and affects people of all ages. These epidemics typically occur in the winter
      months, and can result in substantial morbidity and mortality in persons at risk. Pregnant
      women may be more susceptible to morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection.
      This increased risk may result from several factors including increased heart rate, stroke
      volume, and oxygen consumption, decreased lung capacity, and changes in immunologic function.
      Immunization of women during pregnancy can help to prevent infection in the woman herself and
      may also offer protection to the infant in two ways: by the passage of antibodies from mother
      to the fetus during pregnancy, and by preventing infection in the mother and therefore
      decreasing the infant's exposure risk after birth. In Canada, the National Advisory Committee
      on Immunization (NACI) recommends the vaccine for pregnant women who are expected to deliver
      during influenza season because they will become household contacts of their newborn. Ideal
      timing of vaccination occurs in October or November since influenza outbreaks typically occur
      throughout the winter months. Despite the Canadian and American guidelines for influenza
      vaccination during pregnancy, it is unclear how many women are offered and/or actually
      receive the vaccine while pregnant. There is, however, evidence that women will accept the
      vaccine if offered. Specifically, in the Women's Health Care Centre at St. Michael's
      Hospital, it was found that 42% of women not only accepted but also received the influenza
      vaccination when offered. Innovative techniques will be required to continue to increase
      vaccination rates among vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. The purpose of the
      present study is to determine if the use of electronic reminders (text messages) increases
      the likelihood of receiving the influenza vaccine among pregnant women.
