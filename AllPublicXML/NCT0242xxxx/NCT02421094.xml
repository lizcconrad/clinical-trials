      A Randomized, Controlled, Double-blind, Parallel Group, Single Center Phase 2 Clinical Trial
      to Evaluate Multiple Non-Invasive Liver Fibrosis Imaging Methods in the Assessment of the
      Efficacy of GR-MD-02 for the Treatment of Liver Fibrosis in Patients with NASH with Advanced
      Fibrosis

      The primary objective is to determine the difference between placebo and GR-MD-02 treatment
      in the baseline adjusted mean change in liver fibrosis as measured by corrected T1 (cT1)
      mapping as determined from LiverMultiScan (LMS), a multi-parametric MRI protocol.

      Secondary objectives include evaluating differences between subjects treated with GR-MD-02
      versus placebo in:

        -  The baseline-adjusted change in liver stiffness as measured by MR-elastography

        -  The baseline-adjusted change in liver stiffness as measured by FibroScan® scores.

      An exploratory objective will be to evaluate the correlation of the three diagnostic
      modalities of LiverMultiScan, MR-Elastography, and FibroScan®.
