      Assessment of the improvement of the safety of the swallowing function under 3 natural
      ingredients known to be agonist of sensory receptors.

      The trial will be double-blind, randomized, monocentric, and interventional with a hybrid
      design. The subjects will be randomized to one of the three parallel active ingredient
      groups. Products will be compared versus control (Thicken Up Clear - nectar viscosity), which
      adds a part of cross over within the design.

      The total sample size is 84 enrolled subjects. Patients will be males and females aged 55+
      with mild proven dysphagia.
