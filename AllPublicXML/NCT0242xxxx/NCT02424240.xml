  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 35-month cross-sectional observational study was conducted at an outpatient university
      hospital in Amman, Jordan. We obtained a comprehensive medical and laboratory evaluation for
      134 short-statured children (64 boys and 70 girls, aged 4-16 years). Complete and partial
      growth hormone deficincy (GHD) were defined as peak forwth hormone (GH) response of 5 and 7
      ng/ml [IRMA/ DiaSorinÂ®], respectively in both clonidine stimulation and insulin tolerance
      tests. Serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio were determined for all participants.
