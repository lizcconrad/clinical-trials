        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or unresectable or
             metastatic urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter,
             or renal pelvis.

          -  Had disease progression while on a platinum containing regimen in the first-line
             setting or within 14 months after completing the first-line platinum regimen.
             Participants who received treatment with one immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen are
             eligible (for example PD-1, PDL1, or CTLA4) and may have a longer interval since prior

          -  Have received no more than one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen in the relapsed or
             metastatic setting. Prior treatment with no more than one prior immune checkpoint
             inhibitor is permitted and will not be considered as a line of systemic chemotherapy.

          -  Have measurable disease or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease as defined by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

          -  Have adequate coagulation function.

          -  Have adequate hepatic function.

               -  cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically
                  meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis

          -  Have adequate renal function as defined by creatinine clearance &gt;30
             milliliters/minute.

          -  Have urinary protein ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis.

          -  The participant is willing to provide blood, urine, and tissue samples for research
             purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             disease.

          -  Have received prior systemic taxane therapy for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of
             the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis in any setting (neoadjuvant, adjuvant,
             metastatic).

          -  Have received more than one prior antiangiogenic agent (that is, bevacizumab,

             anemia, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric
             illness, or any other serious uncontrolled medical disorders.

          -  Have experienced any arterial or venothrombotic or thromboembolic events, including,
             but not limited to myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, or
             cerebrovascular accident, within 6 months (≤6 months) prior to randomization.

          -  Have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency
             syndrome-related illness.

          -  Have undergone major surgery within 28 days (≤28 days) prior to randomization or
