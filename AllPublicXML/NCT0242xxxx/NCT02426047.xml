  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The modified Atkins diet (MAD) has been shown to be effective in treating intractable
      epilepsy. Approximately 55% of the patients started on the diet are women of childbearing age
      and women with epilepsy often have a pattern of seizures that correlates with their menstrual
      cycle, called catamenial epilepsy. The investigators have observed that despite an overall
      reduction in seizure frequency, some women on the MAD continue to have breakthrough seizures
      in a catamenial pattern. The investigators hypothesize that women with a history of
      intractable epilepsy who have been on the modified Atkins diet for at least 3 months and have
      a catamenial seizure pattern will tolerate and be compliant with the addition of a daily
      amount of betaquik® (a liquid emulsion of medium chain triglycerides) for a 10 day time
      interval starting 2 days prior to and encompassing the primary catamenial pattern.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be compliance with betaquik® (compared to published compliance of MAD and medium chain triglyceride diets) to demonstrate feasibility. The participant will be considered compliant if they drink the required amount of betaquik® on more than 80% of the prescribed days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult women ≥ 18 years

          -  Already on the modified Atkins diet for at least 3 months and compliant with treatment

          -  Catamenial seizure pattern (by Herzog criteria) for at least 2 of the past 3 months
             (as documented by calendars provided with annotations for seizures and menstrual cycle
             start and end dates)

        Exclusion Criteria (basic exclusion criteria for the modified Atkins diet, so patients
        should have already been screened for these factors):

          -  Unwilling to restrict carbohydrates

          -  Significantly underweight (BMI &lt;18.5)

          -  Kidney disease

          -  History of hypercholesterolemia (&gt;300 mg/dl) or hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;200 mg/dl)

          -  Metabolic or mitochondrial disorder

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Lactose intolerance or milk allergy

          -  Aversion to liquids or inability to eat solid food

        Exclusion Criteria (specific to this study):

          -  Men

          -  Women who are menopausal or peri-menopausal

          -  Prior use of betaquik® at any time for any duration

          -  Already using another ketogenic diet supplement on a sporadic basis (unless the
             patient is using one daily and is willing to continue doing so for the duration of
             this study)

          -  Already using coconut oil specifically for catamenial epilepsy within the month prior
             to enrollment (okay if patient only using for cooking throughout the month)

          -  Taking a hormonal contraceptive so that they do not menstruate (e.g. taking active
             instead of placebo oral contraceptive pills to avoid having a period)

          -  Anticipated need to adjust anti-epileptic medications within the next 6 months

          -  Anticipated initiation, change, or discontinuation of a hormonal contraceptive within
             the next 6 months

          -  Pregnant or anticipated pregnancy within the next 6 months
