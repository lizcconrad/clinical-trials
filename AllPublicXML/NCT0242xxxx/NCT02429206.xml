  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the general population, xerosis is often caused by external factors such as seasonal
      changes. In that case, the best way to relieve dry skin is to use a standard moisturizer.
      However, for those suffering of mobility problems due to age or paralysis (e.g., spinal cord
      injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, etc), xerosis is often severe and chronic because of
      the multiple causes (endogenous rather than exogenous ones) underlying such mobility
      impairment-related skin problems. This study is a double-blind, randomized study with
      positive control (active comparator) to assess the safety and efficacy of SQIN with CanSATs
      (Co-Activation of Natural Synergistically Acting Target-receptorS) technology on dry skin in
      patients suffering of paralysis.

      Xerosis is a medical term for dry skin. When it results in skin that is scaly and itchy, the
      condition is called pruritus. This occurs when natural moisture is drawn out of the skin. The
      skin needs moisture to protect itself. The best way to relieve dry skin normally, for those
      suffering of seasonal dry skin problems, is to use standard moisturizers. However, for those
      suffering of mobility problems due to age or paralysis (spinal cord injury, multiple
      sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, amputation, cerebral palsy, or other
      comparable disorders), xerosis becomes severe and chronic because of the multiple causes
      (endogenous metabolic problems and dysfunctions rather than exogenous ones). SQIN with
      CanSATs technology is designed to act upon multiple mechanisms for enhanced protecting,
      moisturizing, and repairing effects. Based upon preliminary evidence, SQIN with CanSATs
      technology can thus elicit significantly superior effects compared with standard,
      commercially available moisturizers.
