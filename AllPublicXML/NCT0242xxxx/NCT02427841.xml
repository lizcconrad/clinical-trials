    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride followed by
      radiation therapy before surgery work in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can be
      removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving nab-paclitaxel,
      gemcitabine hydrochloride, and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller
      and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the R0 (complete resection) resection rate for subjects with borderline
      resectable or lymph node positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with a multimodality
      neoadjuvant therapy of preoperative gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and ABRAXANE
      (nab-paclitaxel) followed by 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil) based image-guided
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) chemoradiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine 1-year relapse-free survival rate with the investigational protocol.

      II. To determine 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates. III. To assess response rate by
      imaging (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) and pathologic analysis.

      IV. To assess the toxicity and safety according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      PRE-OPERATIVE (NEOADJUVANT) CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo
      IG-IMRT 5 days a week for 28 fractions and receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-7
      for 6 weeks.

      SURGICAL RESECTION: Patients undergo surgery 4-10 weeks after the last dose of
      chemoradiation.

      POST-OPERATIVE (ADUJUVANT) CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning within 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients
      receive nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 additional courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 3 years and
      then every 24 weeks for 2 years.
