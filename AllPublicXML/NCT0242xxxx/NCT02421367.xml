             study entry

          3. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits, etc.)

          4. Subjects at WRAIR CTC must be able to pass Department of Defense (DoD) base entry
             requirements, including the possession of a valid government issued ID card.

          5. Male or non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female between 20 and 49 years of age

          6. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential (non-childbearing potential is defined
             as having had one of the following: a tubal ligation at least 3 months prior to
             enrollment, a hysterectomy, an ovariectomy, or is post-menopausal).

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if all of the
             following apply:

               -  Practiced adequate contraception (see Definition of Terms, section 5) for 30 days
                  prior to vaccination

               -  Has a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of vaccination

               -  Agrees to continue adequate contraception until two months after completion of
                  the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccines/placebo during the period starting 30 days preceding the first dose of
             study vaccine/placebo and/or planned use during the study period

          2. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting 90 days prior to the first
             vaccine/placebo dose (for corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone &gt;=5mg/day or
             equivalent; inhaled, intranasal and topical steroids are allowed)

          3. Planned administration or administration of a vaccine/product not planned in the study
             protocol during the period starting 30 days prior to the first dose of vaccine/placebo
             until 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine/placebo (routine influenza
             vaccination will be allowed as long as it is not administered within 14 days of the
             vaccine/placebo, and will not lead to study exclusion although it should be reported
             to the PI)

             (e.g., yellow fever, tick-borne-encephalitis virus [TBEV], Japanese encephalitis, and

             90 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo or planned administration
             during the study period

         17. Recent history of chronic alcohol consumption (more than 2 drinks per day and/or drug
             abuse (based on subject reported history)
