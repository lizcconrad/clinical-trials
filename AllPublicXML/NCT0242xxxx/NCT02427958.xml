      The purpose of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of leuprorelin in the
      treatment of Central Precocious Puberty (CPP).

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called leuprorelin. It is administered as a 1 month
      subcutaneous depot. Leuprorelin is being tested to treat children who have CPP. This study
      will look at the development of internal and external genital organs and appearance of
      secondary sexual characteristics in pre-pubertal children who take leuprorelin.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 patients. Participants with body weight &gt;=20 kg will
      receive the recommended dose of leuprorelin 3.75 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for
      96 weeks. Participants with body weight &lt;20 kg will receive recommended dose of 1.88 mg
      subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 96 weeks.

      This trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study is 104
      weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic, and will be followed-up by the
      physician on a long-term basis until stable puberty is reached.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who had Regression or no Progression in Tanner Staging</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Tanner assessment score is used to document the stage of development of secondary sexual characteristics. Female pubertal development staged by pubic hair development and breast size; male pubertal development staged by size of the genitalia and development of pubic hair. Rated in 5 stages: stage 1 (no development) to 5 (adult-like development in quantity and size). Regression or no progression is defined as negative change (improvement) or no change change in Tanner score at Week 96 compared to baseline.</description>

             stimulation test.
