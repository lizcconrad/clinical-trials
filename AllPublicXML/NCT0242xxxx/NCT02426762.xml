    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term effect of sealant-assisted skin
      closure in prevention of surgical site infection after laparoscopic surgery.

      -  Study design: A prospective cohort study

        -  Populations: Patients who have confirmed diagnosis of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer,
           gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), inflammatory bowel disease and diverticula decide
           to receive laparoscopic surgery.

        -  Surgical techniques: laparoscopic operations should be successfully performed with a 3-4
           cm minimal incision left for sample retrieval. In all, about five trocar-associated mini
           incisions and a sample-retrieval incision would be left prior to skin closure.

        -  Skin closure: A quick skin sealant would be applied to achieve a seal, without any
           suture made under the skin.

        -  Postoperative treatment: An enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) bundles would be
           applied for enrolled subjects. As for wound management, additional wound cares are not
           required. Patients can take shower at postoperative day 3 (POD3).

        -  Primary endpoint: The primary study endpoint is freedom from surgical site infection
           (SSI) within 30 days. The incidence of surgical site infection with the first 30 days
           after surgery would be explored.

    <description>A quick skin sealant would be applied after laparoscopic surgery. All abdominal wounds are sealed by smearing the quick sealant (skin adhesive) twice. No additional gauges should be appended on wound areas. No further wound care should be applied unless any effusion or bleeding emerged around it.</description>

    <description>Various laparoscopic operations are performed for participants. Once all surgical procedures are successfully applied, surgical wounds which are associated with laparoscopic surgery would be sealed by a quick sealant. In all, the following surgical wounds would be left:
4-5 trocar-produced incisions (5/10mm, minor incision)
1 sample-retrieval incision (4-5cm, small incision)</description>

    <description>After surgery, a quick skin sealant is applied in two layers of each wound to achieve skin closure. The sealant would be smeared twice on the wound area with 30 seconds of dry time required to form a firm seal.</description>
