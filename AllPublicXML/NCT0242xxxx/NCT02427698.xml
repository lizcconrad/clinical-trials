  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of cryolipolysis
      versus a combination of cryolipolysis and surgical subcision for the treatment of cellulite.
      The treatment sites are both outer thighs. One outer thigh will be randomized to receive one
      treatment of cryolipolysis, while the contralateral thigh will be assigned to receive the
      combination cryolipolysis plus surgical subcision. A live rating by a blinded dermatologist
      will evaluate the treatment and control areas using a cellulite severity scale at week 0
      (before treatment) and at the 3-month follow up visit.
