    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of non invasive screening in a
      population of pregnant women with and without in vitro fertilisation (IVF) concomitantly to
      regular first trimester trisomy 21 (T21) screening using maternal age, nucal fold measurement
      and serum screening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All pregnant women in 9 institutions in France will be offer both regular first trimester
      screening for trisomy 21 (T21) and cell free DNA non invasive (NI) screening test at the same
      time. Specificity and the positive and negative predictive values of the NI test will be
      analysed. The population will be divided in women who did and did not get pregnant after an
      In vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedure.
