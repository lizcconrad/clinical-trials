  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnoses and follow up of muscles diseases lack imaging. Severity assessment of masticatory
      dysfunction and follow up of treatment effectiveness is currently based only on clinical
      features. Supersonic ShearWave Imaging® is a new, non-invasive, non-irradiating and dynamic
      imaging technique that uses ultrasound and allows shear wave elastic modulus in a muscle in
      order to study its viscoelastic properties.

      In this study, the investigators study the correlation between changes of shear wave
      elastography modulus and surface electromyogram features of the masseters between rest and
      maximal voluntary contraction.
