      Background: . Bipolar disorders and tobacco use disorder are top of the causes of disability
      and mortality worldwide Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate N-acetyl-cysteine
      (NAC) as an adjunctive treatment in patients with bipolar .disorders and tobacco use disorder
      (TUD)

      , to determine whether NAC reduces alterations in biomarkers of inflammatory and oxidative
      stress Methods: This study will be conducted as a double-blind, randomized, placebo
      controlles add NAC or placebo for .bipolar disorders and tobacco use disorder at Londrina
      State University, Brazil.

      Tobacco use disorder and bipolar disorders are top of the causes of disability and mortality
      worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) as an adjunctive
      treatment in patients with Tobacco use disorder with comorbid bipolar disorder ( (N=72
      NAC/placebo ) recruited from outpatients smoking cessation unit at Londrina State University,
      Brazil.

      The design was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of 12 weeks of
      adjunctive treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), 1800mg/day. Participants will be patients
      with bipolar disorders with and without TUD, they will allocated to one of two groups at
      random to receive NAC or placebo For the evaluation of oxidative stress biomarkers will be
      assess among others malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid hydroperoxide,nitric oxide metabolites
      (NOx), antioxidant potential total plasma (TRAP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP),
      superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, the total glutathione (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG),
      paraoxonase (PON 1) activity thiol group (SH-group).For the evaluation of inflammation
      biomarkers will be analyze : BDNF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15,
      IL-17, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,IL-6R, IL-7, IL-8, Leptin, TNF-α, TNF-RI,
      TNF-RII, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), erythrocytes sedimentation rate (ESR),
      homocysteine, haptoglobin, albumin , uric acid and fibrinogen.
