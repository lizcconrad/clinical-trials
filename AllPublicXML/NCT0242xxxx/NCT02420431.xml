  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services aim to improve heart disease patients' health and
      quality of life, and reduce the risk of further cardiac events. Depression and anxiety
      (distress) are common among CR patients: 37% of patents have significant anxiety and/or
      depressive symptoms. Distressed patients are at greater risk of death, further cardiac events
      and poorer quality of life than those without distress and they use more healthcare.
      Available drug and psychological treatments have only small effects on distress and quality
      of life, and no effects on physical health. Therefore, it is essential that more effective
      treatments for depression and anxiety are integrated into CR services. Extensive evidence
      shows that a particular style of thinking dominated by rumination (dwelling on the past) and
      worry maintains emotional distress. A psychological intervention (metacognitive therapy) that
      reduces this style of thinking alleviates depression and anxiety in mental health settings.
      The investigators aim to conduct a pilot trial of the group intervention and in work stream 2
      the investigators will undertake a full-scale trial to evaluate whether adding the group
      intervention to standard CR is more effective at alleviating anxiety and depression than
      standard CR alone.
