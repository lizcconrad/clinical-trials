  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Were included 40 patients with NAFLD followed at the Ambulatory of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver
      Disease , Discipline of Clinical Gastroenterology, Clinic Hospital of the Medical School of
      the University of Sao Paulo (HC-FMUSP). Were included adults women of any race, aged 35 to 75
      years, diagnosed with NAFLD and were followed for a period of six months. All patients
      underwent anthropometric and body composition, as well as analysis of clinical, laboratory
      before and after 6 months of exercise training protocol established.

      The hypothesis of our research is that aerobic activity had a favorable impact on NAFLD. It
      is expected that the intervention of physical activity causes a decrease or no weight,
      decreased levels of aminotransferases, decreased insulin resistance assessed by homeostasis
      model assessment (HOMA) index and consequently decrease or reversal of hepatic steatosis.

    <textblock>
      The Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver diseases,
      affecting approximately 20-30% of the adult population and is more common in obese
      individuals (70-80%). The main risk factors associated with the disease are the components of
      the Metabolic syndrome. To date, there is no specific pharmacological treatment for NAFLD and
      changes in lifestyle with weight reduction and exercise are always recommended. Few data
      exist on the impact of physical activity and optimal nutritional strategy for the treatment
      of NAFLD. Seen the need to elucidate the impact of physical activity and the search for an
      ideal nutritional strategy in the treatment of NAFLD, the investigators proposed a randomized
      controlled trial evaluating the effects of a hypocaloric high-protein diet and aerobic
      exercise associated with this diet on metabolic and anthropometric parameters in sedentary
      postmenopausal women. 40 sedentary postmenopausal women with NAFLD who had liver biopsy for a
      period equal to or less than 2 (two) years were included. These patients were randomized into
      2 groups: TRAINING group (19): aerobic training with hypocaloric high-protein diet and DIET
      group (21): only hypocaloric high-protein diet, and followed for a period of six months.

      Laboratorial Assays (baseline and end of the protocol)

        -  AST, ALT, FA, GGT, albumine, Fe, fasting glucose, insulin, Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL,
           Triglycerides;

        -  TNFalfa, IL6, and adiponectin.

      Anthropometrical Evaluation (baseline and end of the protocol)

        -  BMI, waist circumference, percent body fat, body fat mass, lean body mass
