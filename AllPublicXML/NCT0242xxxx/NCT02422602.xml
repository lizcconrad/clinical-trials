      This study is multicentric, single-blind, and interventionnal with a randomization into two
      parallel arm, between a standard of care information and an additionnal information of the
      patient, with a 12 month follow up.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized information programm
      versus information provided from standard of care in patients taking Xarelto for Stroke
      Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation.

    <description>The intervention of personalized information will be made as appropriate to the patient's needs and will include: Personalized telephone information carried by a nurse trained in therapeutic education. A time will be dedicated by the IDE to answer questions of the patient. The delivery of paper documents, a list of recommended websites and phone remote monitoring will be performed by the nurse at J30 and J45 to check understanding of the information provided, the actual reading of the paper documents, or effective consultation of websites. A time will be dedicated by the IDE to answer questions at the remote monitoring of the patient to J30 and J45.</description>
