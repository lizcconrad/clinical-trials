      This study aimed to evaluate the acute effect of PLB technique on diaphragmatic mobility, the
      kinematics of the thoracoabdominal complex analysis of lung volumes and exercise tolerance in
      patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This is a study randomized
      cross-over clinical trial and blind, in subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD) according to criteria of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
      (GOLD) (FEV1 / FVC &lt;0.7 and FEV1 &lt;80% predicted) selected at the Clinical Hospital of the
      Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) and Otavio de Freitas General Hospital (HGOF). The
      investigators recruited 13 patients COPD (according to previous sample calculation) aged
      between 40 and 80 years, of both sexes. The first day was held evaluation of lung function,
      respiratory muscle strength, body composition, dyspnea index and functional capacity. On the
      second day was held evaluation of thoracoabdominal complex kinematics by plethysmography
      Optoelectronics (OEP) with Quiet Breathing (QB) or pursed-lips breathing (PLB). Lung volumes
      with 2 minutes with QB and 6 minutes PLB or only 6 minutes by QB as randomization were
      observed. Before and after performing the requested breathing pattern diaphragmatic mobility
      was observed by Ultrasonography (US) and requested the patient an Inspiratory Capacity
      maneuver (IC). The evaluator who performed the ultrasound was blinded as to the beginning of
      the breathing pattern of order performed by the patient.
