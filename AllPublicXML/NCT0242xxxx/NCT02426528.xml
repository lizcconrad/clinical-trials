  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster randomized trial will test the affect of individual participation in culturally-
      and socially-related activities on health and well-being, in comparison also with the classic
      individual determinant, in relation to urban renovation schemes. Investigators will using a
      questionnaire based on several areas such as individual psychological well-being (PGWBI),
      individual happiness positioning (Keyes Scale) and health status perception (SF-12 Health
      Survey). Secondary outcomes will be related to social capital density (relationships and
      trust), culture (participation) and religion. The survey will be undertaken in a mid-size
      Italian metropolitan area, namely the Metropolitan City of Bologna.

    <measure>MHC-SF (Mental Health Continuum - Long Form MHC-LF)</measure>
    <time_frame>after 24 months (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-administered form and represents the short version (14 items) of the Mental Health Continuum - Long Form MHC-LF (12), the original forty-item instrument. As for the long form, the short one has been designed to measure emotional, psychological and social well-being described by the two-continuum model of positive health (10). Within this framework, participants can be identified as flourishing, languishing or enjoying moderate mental health; in other words the aim is to assess positive or negative mental health as a function of emotional, psychological, and social well-being</description>

    <measure>SF-12 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>after 24 months (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-administered test that assesses global health status but from the subjective point of view. It has been divided into two principal subscales: The Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In particular, it allows us to assess concepts involving health, physical functions, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional functioning and mental health</description>

    <description>The intervention protocol will consist of 24 months of guided exposure and participation in social and cultural activities undertaken in the &quot;Casa del Popolo&quot;. The participant will be asked to register for a specific type of event (fine arts, performing arts, and social and volunteering activities), duration and date in order that this information can be supplied for further evaluation. Control group participants will be asked to carry on their lives normally and maintain regular cultural and social activity throughout the duration of the study. At twelve months from the beginning of the observation participants of both groups will be checked (intermediate phase).</description>
