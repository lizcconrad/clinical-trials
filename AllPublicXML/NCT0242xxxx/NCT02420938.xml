  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if urelumab given in combination with
      rituximab can help to control CLL or SLL. The safety of the drug combination will also be
      studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive rituximab by
      vein over 4-6 hours on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 43, and 64 of each 84 day (12 week) cycle.

      You will receive urelumab by vein over about 1 hour on Days 2, 23, 44, and 65 of each cycle.

      There will be a 2-week period between each study cycle.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 43, and 64 of each cycle:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

      On Days 2, 29, 36, 50, 57, 71, and 78 of each cycle, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be
      drawn for routine tests.

      At the end of each cycle (about Day 85):

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of the disease.

      You will have blood draws, CT scans (or PET scans) and/or bone marrow aspiration and biopsies
      at any time that the doctor thinks it is needed while you are on study.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 2 cycles of study drugs. However, your study doctor may allow you to
      receive the study drugs beyond Cycle 2. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow
      study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      If you are taken off study for any reason, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and CT or PET
           scan to check the status of the disease.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After you are no longer on study, 1 time every month:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 3 months, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and
      CT or PET scan to check the status of the disease.

      Other Testing:

      The study staff may ask you to take part in other MD Anderson clinical research study
      (PA13-0291) for additional research testing. The study doctor will discuss this with you and,
      if you decide to take part, you will sign a separate consent document.

      This is an investigational study. Urelumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      Rituximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with CLL.
      The use of these drugs in combination is investigational. The study doctor can explain how
      the drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

             study and for 31 weeks following the last dose of study drugs. Acceptable methods of
             contraception are condoms with contraceptive foam; oral, implantable or injectable
             contraceptives; contraceptive patch; intrauterine device; diaphragm with spermicidal
             gel; or a sexual partner who is surgically sterilized or post-menopausal.

             that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer,
             superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or localized
             prostate cancer. If patients have another malignancy that was treated within the last
             2 years, such patients may be enrolled if the likelihood of requiring systemic therapy
             for this other malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%, as determined by an expert
             in that particular malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center and after consultation with
             the Principal Investigator

          2. Any major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy,
             experimental therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drugs. For

             days is allowed. Note: Prior treatment with anti CD20 monoclonal antibody, anti CD52
             monoclonal antibody and lenalidomide are allowed. Prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 and
             anti-PD1 therapies is allowed after a wash-out of 5 half-lives.

          3. Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias,
             (third-degree AV block, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with rapid
             ventricular rate (HR &gt;100 bpm)),congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction
             within 2 months of screening, or any Class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the
             New York Heart Association Functional Classification.

          4. History of stroke or cerebral hemorrhage within 2 months.

          5. Patients who have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained systolic blood
             pressure &gt;/= 160 mmHg or diastolic &gt;/= 100 mmHg).

          6. Known evidence of active cerebral/meningeal CLL. Patients may have history of CNS
             leukemic involvement if definitively treated with prior therapy and no evidence of
             active disease at the time of registration.

          7. Known active, uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia
             requiring steroid therapy.

          9. Patients with previous allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) within 6 months or with
             active acute or chronic graft-versus host disease are excluded. Patients must be off
             immunosuppression for GVHD for at least 30 days before cycle 1 day 1.

         10. Patients with organ allografts (such as renal transplant) are excluded.

         12. Patients who are on high-dose steroids (doses &gt;10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent)
             or immune suppression medications. Note: Patients on high-dose steroids (doses
             &gt;10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) or immune suppression medications are eligible
             provided these drugs are discontinued at least 3 days prior to starting on the study
             drugs.

         13. Patients with uncontrolled active infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) are not
             eligible.

         14. Current or chronic hepatitis B or C infection, or known seropositivity for HIV. Note:
             Patients with previous history of Hepatitis B (who have cleared the infection and have
             natural immunity, i.e. Hep B core antibody positive cases) are excluded if prophylaxis
             against Hep B reactivation with antiviral agents (such as entecavir) is recommended,
             after consultation with gastroenterologist/hepatologist or infectious disease team.

         15. Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

         16. Concurrent use of investigational therapeutic agent.

         17. Patients may not receive other concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
             immunotherapy. Localized radiotherapy to an area not compromising bone marrow function
             does not apply.

         18. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated
             with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere
             with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate
             for enrollment into this study.

         19. Patients with Richter's transformation are not allowed in the study.
