      A Phase IIIb (Three b), Randomized Multicentre Comparative Trial to Evaluate the Long Term
      Effectiveness &amp; Safety of the use of Carglumic Acid (Carbaglu®) in Patients with Propionic
      Acidemia (PA) or Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA). Carbaglu® clinical experience in Organic
      Acidemia (OA) is limited to a non-comparative retrospective collection of data from patients
      who had received Carbaglu® for 1 to 15 days.

      There is no current evidence supporting the use of carglumic acid for the chronic management
      of patients with OA. The investigators are proposing a randomized multicentre prospective
      clinical trial to evaluate long-term effects of the use of Carbaglu® (50mg/kg/day) combined
      with standard chronic therapy in patients with PA and MMA compared to standard chronic
      therapy alone.
