  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will use the test skincare products. This is a full face, twice daily
      application study, with digital photos and expert grader evaluations at Baseline, 4 and 8
      week periods. If the subject meets the study criteria and is enrolled, they will be
      instructed at screening visit to discontinue the use of any facial products (except dry
      mineral foundation and eye make-up) for seven (7) days before beginning the study (referred
      to as the &quot;washout&quot; period). They will return to the site for the baseline visit 2 after the
      required 7 day washout period (visit can occur within 1 week after screening visit).

      After the subjects properly consent to participation and are determined eligible, the study
      coordinator will review the subjects' medical history and obtain demographics. The Principal
      Investigator (PI) or designee (expert grader) will examine the subjects to determine their
      appropriateness for study inclusion.

      At the Screening visit (Visit 1, Day -10 to -7), the subjects will be assessed by the PI or
      designee to confirm inclusion into the study. Expert grading and Canfield VISIA CR
      photographic documentation (all flash modes including RBX) will be performed at baseline
      (Visit 2, Day 0), Week 4 (Visit 3, Day 28 ± 7 days), and Week 8 (Visit 4, Day 56 ± 7 days).

      Subjects who, in the PI's or designee's opinion, appear to be experiencing product related
      adverse reactions may be discontinued at any time during the study. The subjects' home care
      treatment products (the items included in the kit) will be performed at home, at the times
      and in the manner described in the instructions provided.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Glogau Photodamage Scale: the change between the photodamage grade at Week 4 and Week 8 compared to the photodamage grade at the Baseline Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Glogau Photodamage Scale (Type I: No wrinkles, Type II: Wrinkles in motion, Type III: Wrinkles at rest, Type IV: Only wrinkles) represents a qualitative assessment to measure the severity of photodamage and wrinkles. Photodamage was graded at the Screening Visit (Day -10 to Day -7), Baseline Visit (Day 0), Week 4 Visit (Day 28), and Week 8 Visit (Day 56). The endpoint that was used to evaluate the primary objective of the study is the delta (change) between the photodamage grade at Week 4 Visit (Day 28) and Week 8 Visit (Day 56) compared to the photodamage grade at the Baseline Visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dryness and Flaking: the change between the dryness grade at Week 4 and Week 8 compared to the dryness grade at the Baseline Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter represents a visual assessment of skin dryness from normal skin (0/no dryness) to very severe dryness (5). Additionally, very marked visual flaking; very coarse scaling; cracking progressing to fissuring; marked thickening may be present.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyschromia: the change between the dyschromia grade at Week 4 and Week 8 compared to the dyschromia grade at the Baseline Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter represents a qualitative assessment of skin pigmentation from Normal (grade 0) to Severe (grade 5). Textural features likely to contribute to this grade include both red and brown patches of discoloration and other surface irregularities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stinging and Burning: the change between the stinging grade at Week 4 and Week 8 compared to the stinging grade at the Baseline Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter represents an assessment of any stinging or burning and relative duration of the sensation experienced by the subject when questioned by the Expert Grader. A scale of 0 to 5 as noted above can used to describe these findings when present.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be diagnosed by the investigator or expert grader to have moderate to
             severe lines/wrinkles (Grade 3 or higher, determined by the Glogau Scale).

          2. Subjects must be 35 - 65 years of age with no known medical conditions that, in the

             the investigator's discretion, provided that they understand the possible risks
             involved in getting pregnant during the study and are counseled to remain sexually
             inactive for the duration of the study or to practice a reliable method of
             contraception if becoming sexually active during the study.
