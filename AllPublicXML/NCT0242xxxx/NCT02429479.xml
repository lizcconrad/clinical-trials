  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the project is to improve the process and experience of surrogate
      decision-making by family caregivers. Since feeling unprepared to make surrogate decisions is
      a major contributor to caregiver stress, the primary outcome is caregiver self-efficacy
      --i.e., caregivers' assessment of how well prepared they feel to serve effectively as a
      surrogate decision-maker. Through follow-on Renewal funding, we are now also qualitatively
      examining family caregivers' experience with surrogate decision-making.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to help family caregivers of seriously ill patients be better prepared
      to serve as surrogate decision-makers when their loved ones can no longer make medical
      decisions for themselves. Research shows that family caregivers find surrogate
      decision-making highly stressful and emotionally burdensome, in part because they feel
      unprepared for surrogate decision-making. To date, no studies have determined which advance
      care planning (ACP) process best prepares caregivers for this role. The investigators' prior
      work shows that a computer-based decision aid can help patients make more informed decisions
      and communicate their wishes more effectively. The investigators now propose to determine if
      family caregivers of patients with life-threatening illnesses are better prepared for
      surrogate decision-making: 1) when they engage in a structured ACP process together with
      patients; and 2) when they use this online decision aid for ACP. This will be accomplished
      via a randomized, controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design comprising 4 groups:
      Standard ACP/Patient Alone (Group 1), Decision Aid/Patient Alone (Group 2), Standard
      ACP/Patients and Caregivers Together (Group 3), and Decision Aid/Patients and Caregivers
      Together (Group 4).

    <description>Family caregiver responses to treatment decisions hypothetical clinical vignettes will be compared to the decisions for the same vignettes made by their loved one. Each vignette has 6-8 associated treatment decisions; the family caregiver's response for each item will be compared with the loved one's (i.e., patient's) response, and a total concordance (i.e., number of items for which there is agreement) will be calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>1st study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who complete the advance care planning interventions fill out an evaluation of the intervention using a 16-item questionnaire. This instrument comprises:
Twelve 5-point Likert-style questions on how the program presented various kinds of information; helped the user clarify values, choose a spokesperson, etc.; and helped the user document or be prepared communicate their wishes to others.
Three 10-point Likert-style questions on user overall satisfaction, with the advance directive created by the intervention, and the amount of information provided.
One open-ended item asking how the intervention was helpful.</description>
