      The purpose of this study is to assess the post-vaccination neutralizing antibody response
      against each dengue serotype by treatment arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate
      (TDV). TDV is being tested to protect people against dengue fever. This study will look at
      safety and the amount of antibodies to dengue fever formed in people who are administered a
      high-dose of TDV (HD-TDV) compared to TDV.

      The study will enroll approximately 400 patients. Before being assigned to a treatment group
      participants will be screened for previous exposure to the dengue virus. Dengue naïve and
      previously exposed participants will then be randomly assigned (by chance) to one of the two
      treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the
      study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  HD-TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection

        -  TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection

      All participants will receive a single injection on Day 1. Participants will be asked to
      record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the injection site in a diary card
      for 28 days after vaccination.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Singapore. The overall time to participate in
      this study is 12 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, including a
      final visit 1 year after receiving their dose of TDV.
