  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a difficult to treat disease, mainly due to the fact that diagnosis is
      made usually in the late stage of this condition. One of the treatment methods of pain
      accompanying this neoplasm is thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy. It has been shown that it is a
      safe procedure with a small percentage of complications, nevertheless it is often use as the
      last stage in pain management what significantly decreases its effectiveness.

      The aim of this study is to determinate the effect of invasive pain treatment
      (splanchnicectomy) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer on subjective pain perception
      at rest, in movement and after meals (measured with the BPI, QLQ- C30 and FACIT
      questionnaires), and suffering (measured with PRISM projection test), the use of painkillers
      during the disease and patients' overall survival. Moreover the investigators want to check
      if early performance of splanchnicectomy (on lower steps of analgesic ladder WHO) is combined
      with better therapeutic effect of this treatment.

    <description>Patients from the first group will undergo thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy. The surgery will be performed in general anaesthesia, with tracheal intubation in prone position. The greater splanchnic nerve will be identified at its origin in sympathetic trunk, dissected together with all collaterals all the way down to the diaphragm and excised. Additional splanchnic nerves (smaller, minimus) will be incised or excised if connected to the greater splanchnic nerve. Single sutures will be applied to the skin. Then the procedure will be repeated on the contralateral side.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Conservative Treatment</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients from the second group will be offered best available conservative pain treatment. The list of medication on stage 1 will include: paracetamol, ibuprofen, diclofenac. On stage 2: stage 1 + codeine and tramadol. On stage 3: stage 2 + morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, pethidine. Oral and transcutaneous routes will be preferred to intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous. A need for elevation to the next step of analgesic ladder will be considered when the pain will be stronger than 6 points in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and will be present for more than 5 days.</description>
