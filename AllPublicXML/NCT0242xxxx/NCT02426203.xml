  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension causes progressive right heart hypertrophy,
      dilatation and dysfunction. Surgical treatment is pulmonary endarterectomy, which although
      only carried out in a single UK centre, provides an excellent model for assessing right
      ventricular function. Right heart function is most commonly assessed using echocardiography,
      either transthoracic pre- and post-operatively, or transoesophageal intra-operatively.
      Measurement of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is the best validated and most
      commonly performed measurement for right heart function, however it may be inaccurate after
      sternotomy and pericardial opening, making accurate assessment difficult immediately after
      surgery. Therefore, we aim to compare established methods of assessing right heart function
      with 3-dimensional echocardiographic reconstruction of the ventricle, using a novel
      reconstruction mechanism. Right ventricular function will be assessed in 51 patients who
      undergo pulmonary endarterectomy surgery at baseline, after the pericardium has been opened,
      following the surgical procedure, using transoesophageal echocardiography, and at six-month
      outpatient followup using transthoracic echocardiography, as 3D-reconstruction is valid using
      both modalities. This comparison should allow the investigators to determine whether such a
      method could replace current measurement parameters for assessment of right ventricular
      function, which is important for clinical management of patients in a variety of settings.
