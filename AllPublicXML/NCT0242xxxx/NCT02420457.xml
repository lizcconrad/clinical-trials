      The investigators are assessing the validity of fitness devices as surrogate measures of
      chronic pain survey outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are attempting to validate the usage of personal fitness trackers against
      the classical survey tools used. These devices are known to be of use in measuring activity
      and sleep in healthy patients but their use in chronic pain patients has not been assessed.
      This study will follow participants with chronic back pain undergoing treatment to see if
      changes in clinical course can be captured with these fitness devices.

    <measure>Association of percent improvement in pain and number of steps.</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up assessment approximately 2-4 weeks following epidural procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Linear regression will be used to determine the association of change in percent improvement of pain (assessed at baseline and follow-up) and number of steps taken on average the week of the assessment. Increased beta-coefficient from linear regression demonstrates that increased improvement in pain is related to an increased number of steps indicating improved mobility. If the beta coefficient from the linear regression is negative, this indicates that percent improvement in pain is associated with decreased number of steps and reduced mobility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain severity following procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up timepoint approximately 2-4 weeks following procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed by using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) where scores range from 0 = no pain to 100 = worst possible pain. An increase in pain scores from baseline represent disease progression and decrease represent clinical response to treatment. VAS will be assessed prior to treatment and then at a followup assessment.</description>
