    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe and to compare the motion analysis parameters, i.e.
      motion and stability of proximal interphalangeal joints, which were treated with a
      CapFlex-PIP© implant or silicone implant and to generate basic knowledge about motion
      analysis of untreated healthy hands.
