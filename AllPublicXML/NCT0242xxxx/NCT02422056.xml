      Randomized study evaluating the role of tranexamic acid in reducing intraoperative bleeding
      in palatoplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind randomized study comparing intraoperative bleeding in palatoplasty between
      patients who received tranexamic acid at a dose of 10mg / kg bolus followed by continuous
      infusion of 1 mg / kg / h until the end of the procedure and patients receiving placebo in
      similar arrangements.

      Besides the impact on the volume of intraoperative bleeding the incidence of postoperative
      wound dehiscence in the first week and the incidence of oronasal fistulas after 1 month were
      evaluated.

    <description>Intraoperative bleeding volume defined as the sum of the volume of aspirated blood during the procedure and the volume of blood retained in the used gauze. The volume retained in the gauze was estimated by the difference between the dry weight and the weight after using them.</description>

    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of dehiscence of the surgical wound in partial or total plan of any extension, verified by clinical examination in the first postoperative return and photographic record. The existence of dehiscence was observed by the break in the suture line or extensive presence of fibrin in the wound bed (indicating open area at its base).</description>
