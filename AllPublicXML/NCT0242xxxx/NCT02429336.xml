      The purpose of this study is to collect data that will be generated during an office visit.
      The data will be gathered and analyzed in research studies that will help with the
      investigators understanding of various medical conditions.

      About 200 subjects will be participating in this study. Participation in this study will not
      require a patient's time or presence. The medical information contained in a patient's chart
      from the office visit, including the results of any tests that were ordered at that time,
      will be transferred to an anonymous database and analyzed together with data from other
      patients who have similar condition/s.

      No follow-up information will be collected. The following information will be collected from
      a patient's medical record: the medical history and a list of the current medications.
