  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and the preliminary efficacy of a single
      infusion of stimulated autologous CD4+ T cells in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis.

      The study duration for the patients (from start of baseline to end of follow-up) is 270 days.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    study ended prior enrollment of the first patient because of unexpected issues in the
    manufacturing process prevented production of adequate clinical batches

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females 18 to 60 years of age

          -  Patients closely followed up for at least one year prior to inclusion (i.e. prior to
             the start of the baseline phase) if the diagnosis of the disease was made more than
             one year ago, to ensure that all possible episodes of clinical relapses which occurred
             during this interval of time were recorded and documented

          -  Multiple sclerosis that meets the 2010 revised McDonald criteria

          -  Relapsing/remitting type of multiple sclerosis (which includes clinically isolated
             syndromes if imaging shows brain lesions disseminated in space and time)

          -  Radiologically active disease defined by at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion on a
             T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain scan performed recently (i.e. within 3
             months prior to inclusion)

          -  Disease-modifying drug naïve patients or patients with stable and adequately taken
             disease-modifying therapy (interferon β-1, glatiramer acetate, or dimethyl fumarate)
             for at least six months before inclusion (NOTE: Other disease modifying drugs might be
             added at a later date, depending on the results of current investigations)

          -  EDSS Score &lt;= 5.5

          -  Positive predictive test in vitro for patient's CD4+ cell reactivity to immunogenic
             peptide

          -  Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test and must use adequate
             contraception during the treatment and follow-up phase of the study (three pregnancy
             tests will be required prior to and during the study: (1) during the screening phase,
             (2) about one week prior to leukapheresis, and (3) about one week prior to re-infusion
             of autologous cells)

          -  Fully informed written consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive only for the HLA DRB1*0101, DRB1*0102, DRB1*0401, DRB1*0426 alleles or for
             the combination of the previous alleles.

          -  Evidence of clinical relapse and use of intravenous or oral corticosteroids within 30
             days prior to inclusion

          -  Therapeutic escalation anticipated (including change of disease modifying drug), other
             than the cell-based immunotherapy of this study, within the next six months

          -  Significant coexisting systemic disease including renal insufficiency

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B and C, AIDS and syphilis

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical study, currently or during the past
             three months
