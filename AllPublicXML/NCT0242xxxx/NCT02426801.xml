  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using a mobile health intervention
      to improve adherence to asthma medication among adolescents in an urban clinic setting. The
      intervention consists of an inhaler sensor strap to monitor asthma inhaler use and a mobile
      phone application to remind and incentivize patients to use their medication. This study will
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention to patients.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in this arm were given no intervention. Their self-reported medication adherence was assessed at the baseline (week 0) and follow-up (week 12) visits but during the study period they did not receive any intervention.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Medication Sensor Only</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>These patients received the medication use sensor (sham intervention) and downloaded a sham version of the mobile app. Thus, the medication use from these patients was able to be recorded but the patients did not receive reminders or incentives or the ability to see their medication use via the real mobile app.
