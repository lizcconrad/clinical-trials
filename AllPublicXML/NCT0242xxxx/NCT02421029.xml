  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers propose to investigate the prevalence of gadolinium in the urine of patients
      with a prior gadolinium-enhanced MRI before and after a edetate calcium disodium challenge.
      Moreover, will investigate if there is any correlation of gadolinium urine levels with levels
      of endogenous (e.g zinc) and xenobiotic metals.

      The investigators propose to enroll 20 volunteers in this pilot study, including males older
      than 20 years and postmenopausal women in two groups: Group 1: Individuals who had a
      gadolinium-enhanced MRI study within 1-4 weeks before participation and Group 2: Individuals
      who had gadolinium-enhanced MRI study within 3-6 months before enrollment. The results will
      inform future analyses of gadolinium retention, excretion, and potential symptoms associated
      with same.

      Thus, the specific aims of this cross sectional study are to:

        1. Evaluate levels of gadolinium in the urine of adults with normal kidney function and a
           prior MRI performed within 6 months at baseline, and after a single dose of edetate
           calcium disodium .

        2. Evaluate levels of endogenous and xenobiotic metal levels and their relationship with
           gadolinium levels.

        3. Evaluate for symptoms of gadolinium toxicity.
