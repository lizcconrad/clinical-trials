  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PI developed a self-directed program to treat late-life anxiety called Breathing,
      Relaxation, and Education for Anxiety Treatment in the Home Environment (BREATHE). This
      program consists of weekly video lessons that participants watch on digital video disc (DVD)
      along with weekly telephone check-ins. In BREATHE participants will learn two behavioral
      interventions: diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). The purpose
      of the study is to examine whether the self-directed BREATHE program is superior to a wait
      list control in reducing anxiety in older adults with anxiety disorders. For those assigned
      to wait list control, they will be offered opportunity to participate in BREATHE treatment
      after 8 weeks of wait list.

    <description>The Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) is a 30-item measure of somatic, cognitive, and affective symptoms of anxiety. The first 25 items of the measure are used to compute the total score; the last 5 items provide information about the content of worries or fears. Participants provide severity ratings for items using on a four-point Likert-type scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in Activity Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Activity Card Sort contains 80 photographs that depict the performance of instrumental activities, low-physical-demand leisure activities, high-physical-demand leisure activities, and social activities. This measure will be used to assess engagement in activities.</description>

    <measure>change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) is a 9-item depression assessment rated on a four-point Likert-type scale with scores ranging from 0 to 27. It includes one item that inquires about suicide ideation. Validity and reliability have been established with primary care patients.</description>

    <description>Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8). The SSS-8 is an 8-item somatic symptom assessment rated on a five-point Likert-type scale with scores ranging from 0 to 32. The SSS-8 is administered to characterize participants' somatic symptoms.</description>
