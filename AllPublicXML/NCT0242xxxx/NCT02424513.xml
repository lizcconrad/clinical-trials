  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study evaluating the ability
      of [89]Zr-Df-IAb2M to detect local, regional and metastatic prostate cancer confirmed by
      pathology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IAB2M is an approximately 80 kDA molecular weight antibody fragment (a &quot;Minibody&quot;) chelated
      with Desferroxamine and radiolabeled with [89]Zr. [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M targets the extracellular
      domain of Prostate Membrane Specific Antigen (PSMA) expressed on most primary and metastatic
      prostate cancer lesions.

      This is a phase 2, prospective, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized study evaluating the
      ability of [89]Zr-Df-IAb2M to detect local, regional and metastatic prostate cancer confirmed
      by pathology in patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer thought to be candidates for
      radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection who are at high-risk for pelvic lymph
      node metastasis. These patients may have identified lymphadenopathy on conventional imaging
      but are considered eligible if still judged to be candidates for radical prostatectomy and
      lymph node dissection.

             investigational therapy between the time of conventional imaging, [89]Zr-Df-IAB2M
             PET/CT and the surgical resection or biopsy procedures used for the study evaluation.

          2. Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol.

          3. Other cancers that might potentially interfere with the reading and interpretation of
             [89]Zr-Df-IAB2M PET/CT scans.

          4. Patients who are currently receiving any other investigational agent.

          5. Patients who have had or are currently receiving androgen deprivation therapy
