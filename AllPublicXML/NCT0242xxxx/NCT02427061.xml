  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual violence (SV) and adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) are prevalent among adolescents
      and associated with poor health. Global health organizations highlight engaging men and boys
      in preventing violence against women as a potentially impactful public health strategy. This
      study aims to test, via a two arm cluster randomized controlled trial, a &quot;gender
      transformative&quot; SV/ARA perpetration prevention program among African American adolescent
      males ages 13-19 (target is high school age) implemented in a community-based setting.
      &quot;Gender transformative&quot; refers to a theory- and evidence-based approach to alter gender norms
      that foster SV/ARA while promoting bystander intervention (i.e., giving boys skills to
      interrupt abusive behaviors they witness among peers) to reduce SV/ARA perpetration. As the
      acceptance of SV and involvement in unhealthy sexual behaviors are associated with SV/ARA
      perpetration, this program integrates analysis of social norms that condone violence against
      women, sexual health promotion, and skills in bystander intervention -- an approach that has
      been implemented in multiple non-U.S. settings among young adult males with reductions in
      violence, development of more equitable gender attitudes, and less risky sexual behaviors.
      This will be the first test of such a gender transformative program among adolescent males in
      the U.S. Via a 2-arm cluster-randomized trial in youth-serving agencies (16 clusters, N=840
      adolescent males ages 14-19), this study will assess the effectiveness of &quot;Manhood 2.0&quot;
      (proposed name for this gender transformative program) compared to a job skills curriculum.
      Three months after the end of the program (Time 2), compared to controls, youth will
      demonstrate increased positive bystander intervention behaviors (secondary outcome).
      Intermediate outcomes are: condom use self-efficacy; contraception use attitudes; recognition
      of abusive behaviors; gender-equitable attitudes; and intentions to intervene with peers.
      Nine months after intervention completion (Time 3), youth will report less perpetration of SV
      and ARA toward females (Primary Outcome) compared to controls. This study will provide
      urgently needed information about the effectiveness of a gender transformative program that
      combines healthy sexuality skills, gender norms change, and bystander skills to interrupt
      peers' disrespectful and harmful behaviors to reduce SV/ARA perpetration among adolescent
      males.

    <description>Curricular Content: The 18 hour content will be spread over 3 to 6 sessions (3 weeks duration up to a 2 month period). Youth are guided to explore social constructions of masculinity, describe healthy relationships, discuss healthy sexual behaviors, identify coercive and disrespectful behaviors, and practice skills to intervene when witnessing peers' disrespectful and harmful behaviors, with repeated reflection on gender norms throughout these sessions.
Module One focuses on themes of gender and masculinity. Module Two focuses on themes of violence and sexual consent. Module Three focuses on themes of sexual health and decision making.</description>
