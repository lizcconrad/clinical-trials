  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized controlled single-blind trial will test the hypotheses that a 6-
      week intervention that combines treadmill training (TT) with virtual reality (VR)
      significantly improves real-life, functional mobility and cognitive abilities, keys to
      health-related quality of life in patients with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single blinded,randomized controlled trial with 6 month follow-up will be
      employed to investigate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on
      patients with MS. The study will include 200 participants. Participants will be randomized to
      either the intervention or active comparator. The intervention group will receive 18 sessions
      of Treadmill Training with Virtual Reality (TT+VR) and the active control comparison will
      receive 18 training sessions of treadmill training alone (TT) without the VR simulation All
      interventions will be delivered by therapists trained in the standard protocols. All subjects
      will be trained 3 times a week for 6 weeks, each session will last approximately 45
      minutes.Training progression will be based on increasing both motor and cognitive challenges,
      individualized to the participant's level of performance.

    <measure>Time to complete the Trail Making Test Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>One week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A measure that reflects executive function and cognitive abilities associated with MS and functional independence. The Trail Making test (TMT) is a widely used test of visual scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, attention and executive function21. It consists of two parts. In Part A, the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as fast as possible while still maintaining accuracy. In Part B, the subject connects the dots alternating between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The goal of the test is to perform the tasks as quickly and accurately as possible. Errors are tracked, while the time taken to complete the test is used as the main performance metric. Part B is used to examine executive functioning and is the primary cognitive outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The 25 feet walk test (25FWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>One week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The T25-FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. It is the first component of the MSFC to be administered at each visit. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task.</description>

    <description>The TT+VR patients (i.e., the experimental arm) will receive 18 sessions (3 times per week x 6 weeks) of training that will consist of walking on a treadmill while wearing a safety harness (without body weight support, recall Figure 1), and while being provided with feedback from the system.</description>

    <description>VR is defined in general as a &quot;high-end-computer interface that involves real time simulation and interactions through multiple sensorial channels&quot;. The VR system to be used requires subjects to negotiate virtual obstacles while walking on a treadmill, in a safe environment. This dual task activity has large cognitive components such as information processing, planning, and attention while allowing for training in a more stimulating and enriching environment that includes both cognitive and motor components.</description>
