  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, nonrandomized, phase 1b study of TRC105 in combination
      with standard dose treatment in patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung
      cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced non-small cell lung cancer has been historically difficult to treat, and novel
      agents are in dire need.TRC105 has been shown to enhance the anti-angiogenic effect of
      bevacizumab and may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical
      efficacy when combined with bevacizumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin. Participants will be
      treated with the combination drugs for 6 cycles of therapy (3 weeks per cycle) and may or may
      not be placed on maintenance therapy depending upon the induction response. Maintenance
      therapy will continue until there is disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient
      withdrawal. Blood collections and tumor assessments will be performed throughout the study.

    <description>In addition to standard treatment of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab, dosing of TRC105 will begin at 8 mg/kg. However a lower dose level has also been included (6 mg/kg) and will be enrolled if 8 mg/kg is found to exceed the maximum tolerated dose. Following the appropriate pre-medication regimen, the first weekly TRC105 dose (cycle 1 day 8) will be split into two doses whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on cycle 1 day 8 and the balance (e.g., 5 mg/kg for Dose Level 1) is administered on cycle 1 day 11. Beginning with cycle 1 day 15 and thereafter, the full TRC105 dose will be administered intravenously each week during the 21-day cycle. Intra-patient dose reductions are allowed beginning in cycle 2.</description>
