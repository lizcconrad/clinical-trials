    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to collect anatomical data in an ambulatory healthy population
      to aid in the development of a novel non-invasive technology to assess changes in lung
      hydration status. It will also help in developing reference ranges of lung hydration status
      in healthy subjects and their associated changes with time.

        Subjects will be recruited from the general population using various media advertising as
        well as through a site database. Potential subjects aged older than 30 will be recruited
        for a telephone interview. If they qualify based on a very brief screening interview
        regarding their suitability as a participant, and they are interested in participating,
        they will be scheduled to visit the Intersection Medical, Inc., corporate office. If they
        decline to participate, no further contact will be initiated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects &gt; 30 years of age

          -  Subjects who are ambulatory not requiring assistance for ambulation

          -  Subjects who have been informed of the nature of the study and agree to its provisions
             and have provided written informed consent as approved by the IRB

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with an active implantable medical device not cleared for use with the IMED-4
             in the IMED- 4 Investigators Brochure.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating or who have been pregnant within the past three
             months

          -  Subjects who have a measured temperature of &gt;38Â° C at the time of screening

          -  Subjects who have tattoos and/or non-intact skin on the back in the electrode patch
             placement region

          -  Subjects who have had a past serious allergic reaction to adhesives

          -  Patients who decline to have their backs photographed with the IMED-4 device in
             position

          -  Subjects who have poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate (i.e. other
             disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse, incarceration, shortened life
             expectance, etc.)
