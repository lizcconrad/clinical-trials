  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In comparison to previous implants, the Femoral neck system (FNS) is an approved implant by
      the competent authorities (CE mark). It is designated to stabilize medial femoral neck
      fractures in a minimal invasive technique. The implant combines an angular stable device with
      screw in screw technology for rotational stability. Therefore the purpose of this focused
      registry is to investigate how the newly developed and approved implant called FNS is
      performing clinically and radiologically in terms of surgical technique, intra- and
      postoperative complications and short term outcome.

      All patients included are treated as per standard or care and followed up from the time point
      of enrollment until at least three months after surgery as described below. Data of a visit
      after 6 months and 12 months are collected if bone union according to the RUSH score is not
      complete after 3 or 6 months respectively or if the patient has persistent or increasing pain
      on the operated site.

      Preoperative:

        -  Patient details

        -  Fracture Classification and comminution based on CT

        -  Pre-fracture HHS and EQ5D

        -  X-rays

      Intraoperative:

        -  Surgery details

        -  Defined intraoperative complications

        -  Intraoperative fluoroscopy: hip ap (with leg 15° internally rotated) and lateral after
           reduction and after implant placement

      Postoperative:

        -  X-ray prior to any mechanical load: hip ap (with leg 15° internally rotated) and lateral

           6 weeks and 3 months FU:

        -  Defined postoperative complications

        -  HSS and EQ5D

        -  X-rays
