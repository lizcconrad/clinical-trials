  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent focus groups at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) revealed several
      limitations in our understanding of how parents' relationships with care staff help and
      hinder their grief experience. Additionally, there is a gap in the bereavement literature
      regarding the psychological effects professional caregiver relationships have on parents
      whose children died of cancer. To bolster our knowledge base and benefit Bereavement Care
      Services at SJCRH, as well as benefit other professionals by filling the gap in the
      literature, we have designed a qualitative study that will conduct individual interviews with
      bereaved parents whose children died at SJCRH.

      Validation of the preliminary analyses of the initial 30 interviews will occur through new
      focus groups involving two separate sets of bereaved parents who will validate the findings
      and/or suggest additional avenues of inquiry needed to gain a more complete understanding of
      parental grief/bereavement experience. Additionally, focus groups with hematology/oncology
      fellows will obtain provider feedback on the value of these findings in their training and
      future role as physicians.

      Participants who consent will engage with the principal investigator in a one-time
      voice-recorded interview consisting of demographic and open-ended questions. Participants can
      choose to conduct the interview face-to-face or over-the-phone. Completion of the interview
      is expected to take between 60-90 minutes. Validation focus groups are expected to take
      between 60-90 minutes, as well.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To conduct qualitative interviews in order to understand what helps and what hinders
           bereavement processes among St. Jude parents, with particular attention to how
           relationships with St. Jude professional care staff affect parental bereavement
           processes. Focus groups will provide additional groups of bereaved parents with an
           opportunity to validate initial findings and/or suggest additional avenues of inquiry to
           expand our understanding of the grief/bereavement experience, and gain provider insight
           into how these findings should be used to improve the training of hematology/oncology
           Fellows.

    <description>Qualitative data will be collected using standard questionnaires. Thematic saturation will occur when a minimum of 3 consecutive interviews fail to produce novel information in each of 3 diagnostic categories (Solid Tumor, Hematologic, Brain).
After all diagnostic subcategories have reached thematic saturation, and the PI and his collaborating team member have finalized their code definitions, two additional individuals will serve as independent raters and analyze the interviews. Inter-coder reliability will be calculated using Kappa coefficients. The frequency of each code will be tallied and the number of themes by type of help or hindrance will be reported.
Follow-up focus groups will serve to validate the preliminary findings of the initial 30 interviews, and provide input on the applicability of these findings to the future training of hematology/oncology Fellows.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective study with a semi-structured in-depth qualitative interview. Interviews will be solely conducted by the study PI. However, in order to ensure that the interviews are conducted sensitively, the first 10 interviews will be observed and supervised by a clinically credentialed St. Jude faculty member, and an additional 10% of the interviews will be observed after that.
In order to ensure that the PI does not lead the participant, or in turn, that the participant does not feel limited in regards to what they believe is an appropriate or desired response, the semi-structured interview questions are general and intended to produce broad responses in regards to participant experiences.</description>

With bereaved parents: to validate the findings of the preliminary analyses of the initial interviews &amp;/or to suggest avenues of further inquiry to expand and more deeply define the grief journey of bereaved parents.
With Hematology/oncology Fellows: to receive input regarding the applicability and use of the findings during the training and future careers of these medical providers.</description>
