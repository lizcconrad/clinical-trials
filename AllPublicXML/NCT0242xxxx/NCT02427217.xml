  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non interventional, retrospective cohort study with a prospective,
      observational follow-up component to investigate the safety and efficacy of FCH use in
      subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency. Data will be collected on the safety and
      efficacy of FCH as used for the treatment of acute bleeding episodes, routine prophylaxis and
      perioperative bleeding in these subjects. All subjects have received FCH and may continue to
      receive FCH at the discretion of the treating physician / Primary Investigator according to
      the standard of care at the participating study site.
