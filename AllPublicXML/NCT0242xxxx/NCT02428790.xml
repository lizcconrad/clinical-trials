      Empirically patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) are often constipated. This is a major
      clinical issue. Nevertheless, this has only been sparsely studied.

      The investigators will measure gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) in 30 patients with ABI,
      and compare this to healthy controls. Secondly heart rate variability (HRV) is measured in
      these patients, and associations between HRV and GITT are investigated.
