  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of Herceptin as treatment for
      patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive metastatic breast
      cancer. Frequency, characteristics and severity of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse
      events (SAE) were followed to evaluate the safety of Herceptin in patients with HER2 positive
      metastatic breast cancer.
