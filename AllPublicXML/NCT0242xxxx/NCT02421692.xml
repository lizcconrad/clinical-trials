  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year Medicare spends approximately $31.3 billion on 2.4 million skilled nursing facility
      (SNF) episodes of care. SNFs rely on interdisciplinary approaches to patient care to maximize
      rehabilitation potential for return to prior level of function and reduce the risk of adverse
      events in older adults. However despite a substantial increase in spending on SNF services
      and minimal change in complexity of the caseload, 68% of patients are below their
      pre-hospitalization level of function at discharge, 25% return to the community, and 18% are
      hospitalized. This may be partially explained by current SNF approaches to patient care which
      foster inactivity and participation in low intensity rehabilitation interventions
      (preliminary data). Both inactivity and low-intensity interventions may perpetuate further
      functional decline or impede maximal recovery. The serious implication of risk with
      functional decline is exemplified by studies which have shown declines in physical function
      can increase the risk of being re-hospitalized six-fold and may infer other long term effects
      such as increased risk for mortality, morbidity, and institutionalization. Muscle weakness,
      reduced cardiorespiratory reserve, and neuromuscular deficits have been attributed to this
      acute decline in function. However current rehabilitation strategies in SNFs do not promote
      adequate dose and mode of interventions to induce beneficial systemic adaptations, perhaps
      due to the lack of evidence on effective rehabilitation protocols for this medically-complex
      population. Therefore, the investigators have designed an rehabilitation program, which
      uniquely integrates principles of physiologic tissue overload with strengthening and
      functional interventions for greater gains in physical function. Data will be collected on
      the first cohort of patients who cycle through a SNF during Stage 1, in which usual care
      occurs (5 months). Then, staff training on progressive rehabilitation interventions will
      occur over 2 months. Finally, data will be collected on a second cohort of patients who cycle
      through a SNF during Stage 2, in which progressive rehabilitation is implemented by SNF staff
      (5 months). Given the high turnover of patients in SNFs (average length of stay ~21 days), 2
      different cohorts of patients will be studied and the analysis will consist of independent
      2-sample t-tests. During Stage 1 and 2, measures of physical function will be assessed on all
      eligible patients at admission and discharge from SNF. Therapists will be assessed on
      adherence to the protocol through documentation audits and use of on-site observational
      checklist. Acceptability of the intervention by the patients will be assessed by a patient
      satisfaction survey. Any adverse events will be obtained from the medical record and
      documented. The discharge location of all patients will be documented.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults older ≥55 years of age who are admitted to a skilled nursing facility following
             hospitalization

          2. Qualify to receive at least physical therapy services.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with primary diagnoses related to neurological disorders will be excluded as
             patient needs require more of a motor-control approach versus the proposed
             high-intensity approach. Such patient populations include:

               1. Parkinson's Disease

               2. Traumatic Brain Injury

               4. Alzheimer's

          2. Patients on hospice care will be excluded as the approach is based on palliative
             principles. Other patients to be excluded will include those with conditions where
             strength training is contraindicated (as indicated by the American College of Sports
             Medicine Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription):
