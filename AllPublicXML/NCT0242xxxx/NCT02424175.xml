    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single-arm pilot study to measure the microbiological and clinical
      impacts of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in patients with Primary Sclerosing
      Cholangitis (PSC). The investigators will prospectively enroll 10 PSC patients Stage 1 and 2
      who also have concurrent inflammatory bowel disease Donor Stool from one healthy donor will
      be obtained from OpenBiome. OpenBiome is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that provides
      hospitals with screened, filtered, and frozen material ready for clinical use

    <description>The investigators will analyze and compare the microbiome (bacterial populations) present pre- and post- transplant of the recipient. The investigators will also analyze the microbiome of the donor and compare it to the donor microbiome pre- and post-FMT.</description>

Treatment success was defined as an improvement in serum alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by 50 % or greater.</description>
