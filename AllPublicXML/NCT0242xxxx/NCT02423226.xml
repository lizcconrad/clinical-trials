      The primary aim of this study is to determined the safety and efficacy of CT guided 125I
      seeds implant plus systemic chemotherapy for locally recurrent rectum cancer.The patients
      with recurrence in pelvic or on pelvic wall after rectal resection were treated with 125I
      seeds implant plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. The side-effect, tumor response and
      survival data were recorded.
