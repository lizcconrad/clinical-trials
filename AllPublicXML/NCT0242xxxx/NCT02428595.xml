    <description>The Eclipse System is a vaginal bowel control (VBC) therapy intended to provide bowel control for women with fecal incontinence. It is comprised of a non-surgical device placed in the vagina (referred to as the &quot;Eclipse Insert&quot;) and a pressure-regulated pump which is used to inflate and deflate the Insert. A Sizing Kit, for use during the fitting process, and an evaluation Insert (referred to as the Trial Insert) are also part of the Eclipse System.</description>
