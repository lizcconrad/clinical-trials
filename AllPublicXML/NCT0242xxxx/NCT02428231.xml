    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess whether a 6-week titration (compared with a
      1-week titration) is effective in reducing the incidence of dimethyl fumarate (DMF
      [Tecfidera])-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) in participants with multiple
      sclerosis (MS). The secondary objective of this study is to assess whether a 6-week titration
      (compared with a 1-week titration) is effective in reducing the average severity and duration
      of GI symptoms over 12 weeks of DMF treatment in this study population.

    <time_frame>from Week 2 (Baseline) to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS is a weekly recall scale to rate the severity of GI symptoms in participants. It was modified for daily recall in this study. GSRS is a rating scale consisting of 15 items for assessment of GI symptoms (see Appendix 1). Items are scored for intensity on a 7-grade Likert scale, defined by descriptive anchors such that 0 = none, 1 = minor, 2 = mild, 3 =moderate, 4 = moderately severe, 5 = severe, and 6 = very severe discomfort. The overall GSRS score is the mean of these 15 items, varying from 0 to 6; a score of 0 indicates that no symptoms are present, and a score of 6 indicates the worst possible degree of all symptoms. A higher score relative to Baseline indicates worsening of severity.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With a Worsening in Severity of Gastrointestinal (GI) Adverse Events (AEs) on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)</title>
        <description>The GSRS is a weekly recall scale to rate the severity of GI symptoms in participants. It was modified for daily recall in this study. GSRS is a rating scale consisting of 15 items for assessment of GI symptoms (see Appendix 1). Items are scored for intensity on a 7-grade Likert scale, defined by descriptive anchors such that 0 = none, 1 = minor, 2 = mild, 3 =moderate, 4 = moderately severe, 5 = severe, and 6 = very severe discomfort. The overall GSRS score is the mean of these 15 items, varying from 0 to 6; a score of 0 indicates that no symptoms are present, and a score of 6 indicates the worst possible degree of all symptoms. A higher score relative to Baseline indicates worsening of severity.</description>
