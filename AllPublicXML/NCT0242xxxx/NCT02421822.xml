      The purpose of this study is to test the Fitwits office tool and games with 6-9 year old
      children and their parents to: 1) assist parent-child dyad with correct BMI status
      identification and understanding; 2) address nutrition, portion size, and activity cues; and,
      3) track BMI trajectory over 12-month period.

      The investigators will study parents' perceptions of their child's BMI before and after the
      Fitwits intervention with a primary goal of improving parents' ability to identify their
      child's actual BMI status (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese). Secondary
      goals are to measure changes in behaviors and BMI trajectories with repetitive use of the
      Fitwits office tool.

      The study design is a longitudinal non-randomized intervention study with four time points
      (baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months). The investigators will recruit family medicine residents,
      fellows, and faculty at the investigators' three family health centers and enroll 150
      parent/guardians and children aged 6-9 years at well child visits, regardless of initial BMI.

      The investigators will use electronic health record-generated BMI percentages, the
      physician-led Fitwits Office Tool as the intervention, and self-reported surveys for the
      parent-child dyad. Surveys will record the BMI understanding -pre- and post-Fitwits
      intervention at each visit.

      The investigators will compare the intervention to a control group residency-based family
      health center with usual care for child/parent dyads presenting at well child care and 12
      months later. At this site the investigators will survey for correct parent identification of
      the child's BMI category.
