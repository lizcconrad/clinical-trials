  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial of several behavioral
      interventions for smoking cessation among a sample of employees at large workplaces in the
      Bangkok metropolitan area. The study aims to test the impacts of different incentive
      structures for smoking cessation on take-up, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. The
      interventions are designed to elucidate certain principles from the field of behavioral
      economics.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Urine test for cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure of smoking cessation is the 7-day point prevalence of abstinence measured 12 months after enrollment using a urine cotinine test. The urine test results will also be used to determine prolonged abstinence for 12 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urine test for cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The urine test results will be used to calculate the 7-day point prevalence of abstinence at 3, 6, and 12 months and prolonged abstinence for 3, 6, and 12 months. The urine test results will also be used to calculate the relapse rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion participating</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 months (at enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure captures the proportion of eligible smokers who consent to participate in the main intervention. This will be a primary outcome measure for the study of the correlates of participation and a secondary outcome measure for the study of the intervention's main effects.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive in-person group counseling from a trained smoking cessation counselor. Participants will learn about reasons to quit smoking, strategies for quitting smoking, and additional resources available to support the quit attempt. Participants will also complete a quit plan.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Same as Usual Care, plus participants will have to deposit a certain amount of their own money as an incentive to quit smoking. Participants will be able to make additional voluntary deposits above the minimum amount. The participant will be refunded all deposits if he quits smoking at 3 months, as verified by a urine cotinine test. The participant will forfeit all deposits if he continues to smoke at 3 months, as verified by a urine cotinine test.</description>

    <description>Same as Usual Care, plus each participant will be randomly assigned one teammate to provide social support during the quit attempt. If the participant and assigned teammate both quit smoking at 3 months, as verified by a urine cotinine test, then each will receive a monetary bonus. The team bonus is equal in value to that in the Large Individual Bonus group.</description>
