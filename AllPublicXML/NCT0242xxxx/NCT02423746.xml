      Purpose:

      This study is a feasibility trial of an existing evidence-based behavioral parent training
      program with parents of preschool-aged children who were born deaf or hard of hearing (DHH).

      The hypotheses of this study are (a) that a randomized control trial of the Family Check Up
      with this population will be feasible, (b) parents will rate the intervention as acceptable,
      and (c) a signal of effect will be observable among intervention group parents compared to
      controls for the following outcome variables: child behaviors, parenting behaviors, and
      parenting sense of competence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 participants, comprising 6 parents and their preschool-aged child with a cochlear implant
      (CI; n=12) and 6 parents and their preschool-aged child with a hearing aid (HA; n=12) will be
      identified and recruited at routine clinic visits through university-affiliated hearing
      clinics. A dyad will consist of the child and his or her primary caregiver. Eligible
      participants will include children with clinically elevated behavior problems, as determined
      by having scored between the 70th and 90th percentiles on the Child Behavioral
      Checklist/1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5).

      3 HA and 3 CI dyads will be randomized to the intervention group, and 3 HA and 3 CI dyads
      will be randomized to the control group. The intervention will consist of 3 Family Check-Up
      sessions within one month of baseline assessment. The control condition will consist of 3
      behavioral placebo session within the same time frame, in which general information about
      healthy lifestyles will be presented. All intervention and control sessions will be delivered
      in the patients' usual hearing clinics. Each session will last between 60 and 90 minutes. One
      month post-intervention, all parent participants will complete post-test measures repeating
      baseline measures, plus acceptability ratings of the intervention.

      Feasibility data will be collected via process measures of recruitment, retention, and
      session attendance. Acceptability will be measured with a parent-completed satisfaction
      survey. Measures of parenting behaviors, parent self-efficacy, parent-satisfaction, parent
      competence, child disruptive behaviors, parenting stress, and parental depression will also
      be piloted in preparation for a future study.
