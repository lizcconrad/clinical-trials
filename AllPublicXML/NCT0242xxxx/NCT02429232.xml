      Diabetes mellitus is a common disease with much impact on human's health and is related to
      osteoporosis. But the mechanism remains unclear. The foreign researches revealed
      thiazolidinedione (TZD) would increase the risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture, specially
      elderly women. However, it is still controversial in terms of the youth and men. In
      Taiwan,there is few related study to analyze the relationship between TZD and steoporosis.

      This is a multicenter randomized controlled study.

      Diabetes mellitus is a common disease with much impact on human's health and is related to
      osteoporosis. But the mechanism remains unclear. The foreign researches revealed
      thiazolidinedione (TZD) would increase the risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture, especially
      elderly women. However, it is still controversial in terms of the youth and men. In Taiwan,
      there is few related study to analyze the relationship between TZD and osteoporosis.

      This is a multicenter randomized controlled study.This study will recruit adult (age ³40
      years) type 2 diabetes patients who is on metformin (³1500mg/day) currently with recent HbA1c
      between 7.0~8.5%.Patient who has history of macular edema, congestive heart failure (NYHA Fc
      III, IV), chronic renal failure (stage IV, V), AST or ALT above 2.5 times upper limit,
      Medical history of endocrinopathies, osteoporosis with bone fracture, cancer will be
      excluded. Current bone fracture undergoing treatment, pregnancy, breast feeder will also be
      excluded.

      This is a 3-year project and will enroll 160 eligible volunteers who are to randomized into
      group A and B (80 in each). During the next 48 weeks group A and B will receive
      metformin+pioglitazone and metformin+linagliptin respectively. Blood sugar, renal, and liver
      functions will be examined every 12 weeks. Calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D level, and bone
      turnover markers (N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen, bone-specific alkaline
      phosphatase, osteocalcin, serum C- telopeptide, type 5 tartrate resistant acid phosphatase
      (TRAP), pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline crosslinks) will be checked each 6 months.

      All the blood samples will be sent to one core laboratory center. The within-group
      differences will be examined by repeated-measure ANOVA. The between-group differences will be
      examined by Student's t test.
