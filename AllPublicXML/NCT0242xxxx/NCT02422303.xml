  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine has been shown to have an antidepressant effect when given intravenously in doses of
      2mg/kg. Ketamine is used as a standard induction drug during general anesthesia. It is known
      in this instance to decrease postoperative pain. No one has studied whether or not ketamine
      when given in doses used during general anesthesia (0.5mg/kg intravenous) has an
      antidepressant effect on surgical patients who suffer from depression. The study is designed
      to determine whether or not a small dose of ketamine when given at the induction of
      anesthesia could have an antidepressant effect on surgical patients with depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-pregnant females between the ages of 18-65 who are being admitted for gynecological
      surgery will be given a bedside Goldberg depression screen as part of their routine
      preanesthetic assessment. If the patient scores five or above on the Goldberg depression
      screening, they will be asked if they would like to enroll in the study. Exclusion criteria
      include uncontrolled hypertension, pregnancy, or allergy to ketamine.

      Once the patient is consented they will be randomized to one of two groups. Every patient
      will receive an antianxiety medication Midazolam and a narcotic fentanyl prior to going to
      the operating room. Group A will receive ketamine 0.5mg/kg intravenous as part of their
      induction for general anesthesia. Group B will not receive ketamine as part of their
      anesthetic. All other induction drugs will be at the discretion of the anesthesiologist
      performing the anesthetic.

      The patients will be seen by a separate anesthesia provider (who is blinded to the group the
      patient is in) and the results of the depression screening will be added to the patient's
      data sheet.

      The patients will be followed again one week after their surgery either in their hospital
      room (if still hospitalized) or by phone. They will again be given the Goldberg Depression
      screen and the data will again be added to their data sheet.

      Several times during the study and at its conclusion the data will be matched with the
      patients group in order to assess for adverse events such as suicidal ideations, nausea and
      vomiting. If adverse events are noted, the study design will be altered to take into account
      the adverse events.

    <description>The Goldberg screening test consists of 18 questions which are answered based upon the previous 10-14 days to assess depression:
0-not at all
just a little
somewhat
moderately
quite a lot

The scores are summed, and the ranges are assessed:
0 - 9 No depression likely 10 - 21 Possible symptoms that may be due to depression or other medical issues.
22 - 35 Mild to Moderate Depression. 36 - 53 Moderate to Severe Depression 54 and up Severely Depressed The higher the score, the more severe you depression is likely to be.</description>
