      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of standardized patient education on
      asthma control. In collaboration with two health insurance companies, pharmacists and
      pneumologists, patients with asthma were recruited. They completed the &quot;Asthma Control Test
      (ACT)&quot; and the &quot;Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC 5A)&quot; questionnaire to
      assess asthma control and patients' satisfaction with the health care service they received.
      Additionally, patients were offered the possibility to participate in a patient education
      seminar run by the Swiss lung leagues or the Swiss allergy centre (aha!). After one year,
      patients were asked to complete the questionnaires again. Comparisons of intraindividual
      changes and differences regarding ACT and PACIC 5A between patients with and without patient
      education were made.
