    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational cohort study. The study will be conducted in
      routine clinical practice settings. It is planned to enroll 870 patients with endometriosis
      for whom a decision has been made by the physician to treat with dienogest according to local
      health authority approved label. It is the aim of this observational cohort study to further
      characterize the effectiveness of dienogest in improving quality of life and long-term safety
      in routine clinical practice setting. Endometriosis is chronic and progressive disease and
      there is unmet need for long-term treatment. Visanne® with proven efficacy and safety, can be
      good option for long-term treatment, however, experience with Visanne® beyond 15 month is
      limited. And long-term up to 24 months data on effectiveness and safety of Visanne would
      support the long-term treatment strategy for Endometriosis management in the clinical
      practice.
