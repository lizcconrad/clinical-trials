  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching elderly
      participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) from a prior antidepressant treatment
      (to which they have not responded) to either intranasal esketamine plus a new oral
      antidepressant or switching to a new oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what
      treatment the participant is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter study (more than 1
      study site) in elderly participants with TRD to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of flexible doses of intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant
      compared with a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal
      placebo. The study will consist of 3 phases: Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4 to
      7 weeks), Double-blind induction Phase (4 weeks), Follow up Phase (2 weeks). Participants who
      rollover into a long-term open-label safety study will not participate in the Follow-up
      Phase. At the start of the Screening/Prospective observational Phase, participant must have
      had documented nonresponse to at least one antidepressant treatment (based on Massachusetts
      General Hospital - Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [MGH-ATRQ] criteria) in
      the current episode of depression, and the participant is taking a different oral
      antidepressant treatment on the MGH-ATRQ for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the
      minimum therapeutic dose. This antidepressant treatment will be discontinued prior to the
      double-blind induction Phase. Participants taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or
      less than the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep
      medications (example, zolpidem, zaleplon) during the screening/prospective observational
      phase can continue these medications. All participants will start with first dose (Day 1 as
      28 milligram [mg]); second dose (Day 4) is either 28 or 56 mg. All subsequent doses may be
      28, 56 or 84 mg. After the first dose, all dosing decisions are determined by the
      investigator based on efficacy and tolerability. In addition, each participant will be
      assigned to receive 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medications from 2 different classes of
      antidepressant treatments, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) (escitalopram or
      sertraline) or a Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) [duloxetine or
      venlafaxine extended release (XR)], initiated on Day 1 and continued through the double-blind
      induction Phase. Participants will be primarily evaluated for improvement in depressive
      symptoms as assessed by change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total
      score at Week 4. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at end of Double-Blind Induction Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Double-blind Induction Phase (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Score at end of Double-Blind Induction Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Double-blind Induction Phase (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S evaluates the severity of psychopathology on a scale of 0 to 7. Considering total clinical experience, a participant is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating according to: 0=not assessed; 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill participants. The CGI-S permits a global evaluation of the participant's condition at a given time.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Double-blind Induction Phase (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome, primarily designed for self-completion by respondents. It consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems (Level 1 indicating no problem, Level 2 indicating slight problems, Level 3 indicating moderate problems, Level 4 indicating severe problems, and Level 5 indicating extreme problems). The participant selects an answer for each of the 5 dimensions considering the response that best matches his or her health &quot;today.&quot; The descriptive system can be represented as a health state. The EQ-VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his or her overall health status at the time of completion, on a scale of 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (at risk of death at the time of the event); persistent or significant disability/incapacity (is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product); congenital anomaly (is medically important based on medical and scientific judgment).</description>
