      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive nivolumab by
      vein over 60 minutes, every 2 weeks (+/- 2 days). After 8 doses (4 cycles), nivolumab will be
      given once every 12 weeks after that.

      Study Visits:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      On Days 1, 7, and 14 of Cycle 1; Days 1 and 14 of Cycles 2-4; Day 1 of Cycle 5 and then Day 1
      of every third cycle after that (Cycles 8, 11, 14, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests. Some of these
           blood samples may also be used for tests of your pancreatic function and blood sugar
           levels.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

      Before each dose of the study drug, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your
      immune system.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 5, and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 8, 11, 14 and so on),
      blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for a pregnancy test, if you can become pregnant

      On Day 1 of Cycle 5, and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 8, 11, 14, and so on) if the
      doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the
      disease and for cytogenetic and genetic testing.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 4 years. You will no longer be able to take
      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you are finished receiving the study drug, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to
      check your immune system.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30, 60, and 100 days after your last dose of the study drug, if you are not receiving
      another treatment for MF, a member of the study staff will call you to ask about any side
      effects you may be having. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      If you can become pregnant, you will need to return to the clinic about 30 and 100 days after
      your last dose of the study drug for a pregnancy test.

      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab is FDA-approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of certain kinds of melanoma. Nivolumab is not FDA approved or commercially
      available for the treatment of MF. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The
      study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
