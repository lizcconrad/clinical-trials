    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine whether treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) improves kidney function. Half of the
      participants will receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for their OSA
      in addition to their regular CKD treatment, while the other half will only receive their
      regular CKD treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and associated hypoxemia during sleep have been associated with
      a decline in kidney function. The abnormalities in kidney function associated with OSA have
      been improved by treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is a
      common and effective therapy for OSA. Up to now, clinical research on the impact of OSA on
      kidney function has been performed on patients without CKD. This study will examine the
      impact of CPAP therapy on kidney function in patients with CKD.

      CKD patients with OSA and nocturnal hypoxemia will be randomized into one of two groups where
      half will receive treatment of their OSA with CPAP and the other half will not. All
      participants will have kidney function monitored every 3 months for a year by measurement of
      serum creatinine and proteinuria. The change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
      and proteinuria between the two groups will be assessed to determine whether treatment of OSA
      improves kidney function in patients with CKD.
