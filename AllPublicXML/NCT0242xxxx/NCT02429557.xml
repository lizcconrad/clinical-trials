  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compression garments have been shown to be effective in the treatment of orthostatic
      hypotension in autonomic failure patients. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      hemodynamic mechanisms by which abdominal compression (up to 40 mm Hg) improve the standing
      blood pressure and orthostatic tolerance in these patients, and to compare them with those of
      the standard of care midodrine. The investigators will test the hypothesis that abdominal
      compression will blunt the exaggerated fall in stroke volume and the increase in abdominal
      vascular volume during head up tilt.

      Patients with autonomic failure are characterized by disabling orthostatic hypotension (low
      blood pressure on standing) due to severe impairment of the autonomic nervous system.
      Compression garments such as waist-high stockings and abdominal binders have been shown to
      improve orthostatic hypotension in these patients. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the hemodynamic mechanisms by which abdominal compression (up to 40 mm Hg) improve the
      standing blood pressure and orthostatic tolerance in these patients, and to compare them with
      those of the standard of care midodrine. The investigators will test the hypothesis that
      abdominal compression will blunt the exaggerated fall in stroke volume and the increase in
      abdominal vascular volume during head up tilt. This study will help us better understand the
      contribution of the abdominal veins to orthostatic hypotension and the mechanisms underlying
      this non-pharmacological therapeutic approach.

      Participants will be studied in a tilt table in two separate days in a randomized, crossover
      fashion with sham abdominal compression (~5 mmHg) and active compression (~40 mmHg).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients,

          -  between 18-80 yrs.,

          -  with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension associated with primary autonomic failure
             (Parkinson Disease, Multiple System Atrophy and Pure Autonomic Failure). Orthostatic
             hypotension will be defined as ≥20 mmHg decrease in systolic BP or ≥10 mmHg of
             diastolic BP within 3 minutes on standing associated with impaired autonomic reflexes
             determined by autonomic testing in the absence of other identifiable causes (Freeman
             et al., 2011).

          -  Patients able and willing to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Significant cardiac, renal or hepatic illness, or with contraindications to
             administration of pressor agents or external abdominal compression will be excluded.

          -  Clinically unstable coronary artery disease, or major cardiovascular or neurological
             event in the past 6 months, and; other factors which in the investigator's opinion
             would prevent the subject from completing the protocol including clinically
             significant abnormalities in clinical, mental or laboratory testing
