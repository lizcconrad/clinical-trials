  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of VX-745 on markers of disease in the central nervous
      system of patients with MCI due to AD or with mild AD. The study will also evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of VX-745 in these patients during 6 weeks of dosing, as well as the
      plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of VX-745 during dosing.
