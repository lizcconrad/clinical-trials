    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is due to neurodegeneration of upper and lower motor
      neurons, leading to muscle atrophy, paralysis and death. However, there is growing evidence
      that interneurons involved in the gain regulation of spinal motoneuron (lower motor neurons)
      and in sensorimotor integration may participate in the pathogenesis of ALS. While sensory
      afferents in the peripheral nerve are traditionally thought to be unaffected at the beginning
      of the disease, diffusion MRI has revealed degeneration and demyelination of the posterior
      columns in the spinal cord of patients recently diagnosed with ALS, and there are sporadic
      reports of sensory involvement. Early alteration of the sensorimotor integration could
      participate to the degeneration of motor neurons and interneurons. The goal of the project is
      to further investigate sensorimotor integration at spinal level in human patients recently
      diagnosed with ALS, and to study whether an interneuron pathology could participate in ALS
      pathogenesis.

      Our project has first an interest for the fundamental research aiming at increasing basic
      knowledge of pathophysiology of ALS, and specifically on the functional effects of the
      underlying neurodegenerative mechanisms. By testing the excitability of spinal interneurons
      in patients recently diagnosed, and by doing so for clinically uninvolved muscles, we will be
      able to evaluate whether an interneuron pathology could be involved in ALS. Our results will
      help to understand better the chain reactions in the neurodegenerative processes that
      dramatically evolve until the death of all motor neurons. Our project has also an interest
      for the development of therapeutic approaches for ALS. Indeed, our methods will help to
      determine specific electrophysiological biomarkers that will help to evaluate quantitatively
      spinal and corticospinal neural processes: their changes during the course of the disease
      (follow-up study), the effect of therapeutic agents and/or rehabilitation methods on their
      excitability, and their repercussions on motor neuron activity (evaluation of therapeutics).
      Lastly, our methods could be tested in other neuromuscular diseases to determine possible
      differences in spinal neural activity. Indeed, the motor dysfunction common to several
      neuromuscular diseases can make it difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. The development
      of specific biomarkers is crucial for an early diagnosis, and to evaluate the best treatment
      for the patients as rapidly as possible.

      Given the all-or-none properties of neuromuscular junctions, the electromyogram (EMG)
      reflects the activity of spinal motoneurons. These neurons are the last order neurons in all
      neural pathways involved in motor control. Modification of the afferent neural activity,
      whatever its level (spinal or supraspinal), will affect the excitability of spinal
      motoneurons and thus EMG activity. Combined with electrical and/or magnetic stimulation of
      peripheral nerve and/or cortical structures, it is possible to test indirectly the
      excitability of corticospinal and spinal reflex pathways involved in human motor control. One
      of the novelties is that we will investigate the interneurons that are activated by motor
      axons or afferents inputs from affected muscles (distal musculature: hand/wrist or foot/ankle
      muscles), which control clinically unaffected muscles (proximal musculature: elbow or knee
      muscles). This has a threefold interest i) functional exploration of clinically unaffected
      muscles that are never evaluated in ALS patients, ii) to better interpret the EMG signal and
      to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the change in EMG activity,
      and iii) to determine if interneuron pathology manifests before detectable change in the
      motoneuron. The conditioned EMG and threshold tracking methods will be used to evaluate the
      excitability of spinal interneurons in ALS patients, as compared to sex and age-matched
      healthy subjects.

    <description>Electromyogram (EMG) reflects the activity of spinal motoneurons which is controlled by several spinal interneurons. EMG recordings will be conditioned by electrical, magnetic or mechanical stimuli to activate spinal interneurons that controlled motoneurons and thus influence the EMG recordings. The resulting changes in EMG activity will be quantified by calculating the EMG surface area or the change in peak-to-peak amplitude of evoked potentials. 2 visits will be devoted to cervical interneurons controlling upper limbs and the 2 other visits, to lumbar interneurons controlling lower limbs. Surface areas and amplitude in ALS patients will be compared to controls</description>
