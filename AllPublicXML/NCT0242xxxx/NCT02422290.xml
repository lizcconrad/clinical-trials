      This pilot study is proposed to determine the acceptability, feasibility and potential
      efficacy of ketamine, a medication that modulates glutamate in the brain, as a rapid
      treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms in adolescents and young adults
      with OCD. This study will recruit 6 youth (ages 14-22) who are diagnosed with clinically
      significant OCD and have failed at least one adequate trial of a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor
      (SRI) medication and a course of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (unless unable to access
      or tolerate) for OCD in the past. Participants will receive a single infusion of intravenous
      ketamine and be assessed at regular intervals post-infusion for up to 14 days. At the end of
      the 14-day treatment phase, all participants will be offered three months of open treatment
      for OCD with medication and/or CBT.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The CYBOCS is a semi-structured measure of OCD severity with excellent inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. It is validated in those starting at age 7 and used in studies up to age 20. The CYBOCS differs from the adult YBOCS only in its use of simpler language.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions scale is a clinician rated instrument providing a single score for severity and improvement (from a 7-point scale) comparing the patient's condition throughout the study to the condition at baseline (before the ketamine infusion).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant must be 14-22 years of age at the time of consent (post-pubertal)

          2. Participant and a parent/guardian must be able to read and understand English

          3. Participant must be physically healthy and weigh at least 25kg. If female, must not be
             pregnant.

          4. Participant must fulfill DSM-V criteria for OCD, OCD being the principal disorder
             (i.e., currently the most severe and in need of treatment) and have had OCD for at
             least six months.

          5. Participant must score ≥ 16 on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale
             (CYBOCS) prior to entering the study, report at least moderate severity of obsessions
             and/or compulsions..

          6. Participant must have tried and failed at least one adequate trial of SRI medications
             or clomipramine and a course of CBT unless the participant is unable to access or
             tolerate CBT treatment.

               -  In order to meet criteria for having had at least one adequate trial of SRI
                  medication, participants must have been on a stable and minimal adequate dose of
                  at least one SRI medication or clomipramine as defined by the literature for at
                  least 12 weeks, and have a documented history of intolerable adverse effects at a
                  higher dose as evaluated by the study psychiatrist and are therefore unable to
                  increase the dose or complete the full 12 weeks, or have refused further SRI
                  trials.

             Congruent with the literature, the range of minimally adequate doses to treat OCD are
             as follows: Clomipramine (Anafranil) 75-100 mg/day; Fluoxetine (Prozac) 20-60 mg/day;
             Paroxetine or Paroxetine CR (Paxil) 20-40 mg/day; Sertraline (Zoloft) 50-100 mg/day;
             Fluvoxamine (Luvox) 100-200 mg/day; Citalopram (Celexa) 20-40 mg; Escitalopram
             (Lexapro) 10-20 mg/day for a minimum of 12 weeks.

               -  In order to meet criteria for having had an adequate course of CBT for OCD,
                  patients should have received at least 8 sessions of Exposure and Response
                  Prevention Therapy (EX/RP) by a licensed clinician trained in doing CBT for OCD.
                  A CBT expert on our team will ensure that the clinician administering these
                  exposures has had adequate training and experience in providing this treatment.

          7. Participant is off all psychotropic and other types of drugs likely to interact with
             glutamate for at least 14 days before starting the study. The exceptions are SRI
             medications and short acting benzodiazepines for distressing anxiety or insomnia
             (which can be taken up to 24 hours prior to ketamine infusion). Participants will be
             off neuroleptics for 1 month and off fluoxetine for 6 weeks prior to the study.

          8. For participants younger than 18, written informed assent by the participant and
             consent by the parent. For participants 19 and older, written consent by the
             participant and permission for legal guardian/parent to provide information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Family history of psychosis or substance abuse/dependence.

          2. History of violence

          3. Presence of psychotic symptoms or lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia including any
             auditory or visual hallucinations or presence of delusional thinking, bipolar
             disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder, psychosis due to general medical
             condition.

          4. Severely depressed patients with the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) ≥ 60 or
             judged clinically to be at risk of suicide.

          5. Current diagnosis of an eating disorder.

          6. Current or past history of PTSD or significant trauma.

          7. Current or past diagnosis of substance abuse/dependence.

          8. Current or past diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders
             associated with streptococcus (PANDAS). This will be defined by the following
             criteria: abrupt onset of OCD symptoms (often with comorbid tics) with a
             relapsing-remitting symptom course, a temporal association between symptom
             exacerbations and a Group-A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection, association
             with neurological abnormalities during exacerbations (adventitious movements, motoric
             hyperactivity, urinary hesitancy), and prepubertal age of onset.

          9. Participants planning to commence cognitive-behavioral therapy during the period of
             the study or those who have begun CBT within 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

         10. Documented history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to ketamine.

         11. Female participants who are either pregnant or nursing or female participants of child

         12. History of significant medical condition that might increase the risk of
             participation. This would include hypertension (BP &gt; 140/90), chronic congestive heart
             failure, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, intracranial mass lesions, head
             injury, globe injuries, or hydrocephalus.

         13. Concurrent use of any medications that might increase the risk of participation. This
             would include: St. John's Wort, Tramadol or atracurium, due to potential adverse
             drug-drug interactions.

         14. Positive urine screen for illicit drugs

         15. Inability of participant or parent/guardian to read or understand English.

         16. Documented history of adverse reaction to anesthesia.
