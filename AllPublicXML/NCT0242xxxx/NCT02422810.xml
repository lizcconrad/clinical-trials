  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize a new test to assess the rate and time it takes
      to form a blood clot in people who either do or do not take aspirin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that approximately 25% of people are resistant to aspirin, or do not respond
      to its effect. These individuals have a four fold higher risk of a heart attack or stroke
      compared to those who respond to aspirin. Current tests for determining those who are aspirin
      resistant are not reliable. This study is assessing the effectiveness of a new assay in
      determining the rate and time it takes for people who are or are not on aspirin in forming a
      blood clot.

    <description>A microfluidic assay will be used to assess thrombus formation induced by exposed collagen within a stenosis that induces high shear rates. The amount of time taken to completely occlude an aperture is called the thrombotic occlusion time.</description>
