  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the issues that have greatest impact on QOL for
      patients with Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) Disease. Patients who have -registered in the
      Inherited Neuropathies Consortium Contact Registry will be invited to participate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol consists of two anonymous surveys. The first large scale survey is designed to
      identify items that best reflect the issues and symptoms with high impact upon QOL in CMT. A
      second brief survey focuses on the frequency and impact of muscle cramps on QOL in adult CMT.
      The surveys will be distributed via an online link to all adult CMT patients self-registered
      with the RDCRN contact registry. Those who complete the first two surveys will be requested
      to complete only the second brief survey on muscle cramps again 3 weeks after completing it
      the first time. Those who complete the brief muscle cramps survey a second time will be
      requested to complete it again 5 weeks later to assess variability in occurrence of muscle
      cramps.

      The first large scale survey to identify items that best reflect the issues and symptoms with
      high impact upon QOL in CMT will be sent out in a second wave. This second wave will only
      contain the QOL survey and not the muscle cramp survey. The QOL survey will be distributed
      via an online link to three populations: adult CMT patients self-registered with the INC
      (RDCRN) Contact Registry who had not been registered at the time of the first enrollment
      period, adult patients who had been registered at the time of the first enrollment period and
      had received the survey, but had not returned it, and patients who were registered, but were
      under age 18 at the time of the first enrollment period and have turned 18 by the time of the
      second enrollment period.
