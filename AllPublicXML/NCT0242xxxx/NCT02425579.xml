  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a syndrome of severe acute lung
      inflammation and hypoxemic respiratory failure with an incidence of 180,000 cases annually in
      the U.S.Despite decades of research and recent advances in lung protective ventilator
      strategies, morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. Furthermore, no specific
      effective pharmacologic therapies currently exist. The lack of specific effective therapies
      for sepsis-related ARDS indicates a need for new treatments that target novel pathways.
      Carbon monoxide (CO) represents a novel therapeutic modality in ARDS based on data obtained
      in experimental models of ARDS and sepsis over the past decade.

      CO has been shown to be protective in experimental models of Acute Lung Injury (ALI),
      including hyperoxia and endotoxin exposure, bleomycin, ischemia/reperfusion, and
      ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). At low doses, CO has been shown to confer tissue
      protective effects in these ALI models. In addition, CO has been shown to decrease
      inflammation, enhance phagocytosis, and improve mortality in models of sepsis including
      endotoxemia, hemorrhagic shock, and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CO has also been shown
      to have beneficial therapeutic effects in pre-clinical models of disease including pulmonary
      hypertension, vascular injury, and transplantation. Furthermore, multiple human studies have
      demonstrated that experimental administration of several different concentrations of CO is
      well tolerated and that low dose inhaled CO can be safely administered to subjects in a
      controlled research environment.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of inhaled CO therapy in mechanically
      ventilated patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with sepsis are defined as those with suspected or documented infection:

             Suspected or proven infection: Sites of infection include thorax, urinary tract,
             abdomen, skin, sinuses, central venous catheters, and central nervous system

             All eligible patients meet the new definition of sepsis (suspected or proven infection
             and a SOFA ≥ 2) as PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 300 = 2 SOFA points.

          2. ARDS is defined when all four of the following criteria are met:

               -  A PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 with at least 5 cm H2O positive end-expiratory airway
                  pressure (PEEP)

               -  Bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on frontal chest radiograph

               -  A need for positive pressure ventilation by an endotracheal or tracheal tube

               -  No clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension for bilateral pulmonary
                  infiltrates.

          3. ARDS onset is defined as the time the last of criteria 1-4 are met. ARDS must persist
             through the enrollment time window of 120 hours.

          4. Infiltrates considered &quot;consistent with pulmonary edema&quot; include any infiltrates not
             fully explained by mass, atelectasis, or effusion or opacities known to be chronic
             (greater than 1 week). Vascular redistribution, indistinct vessels, and indistinct
             heart borders alone are not considered &quot;consistent with pulmonary edema&quot; and thus
             would not count as qualifying opacities for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 18 years

          2. Greater than 120 hours since ARDS onset

          3. Pregnant or breast-feeding

          4. Prisoner

          5. Patient, surrogate, or physician not committed to full support (exception: a patient
             will not be excluded if he/she would receive all supportive care except for attempts
             at resuscitation from cardiac arrest)

          6. No consent/inability to obtain consent

          7. Physician refusal to allow enrollment in the trial

          8. Moribund patient not expected to survive 24 hours

          9. No arterial line/no intent to place an arterial line

         10. No intent/unwillingness to follow lung protective ventilation strategy

         11. Severe hypoxemia defined as SpO2 &lt;95 or PaO2 &lt;80 on FiO2 ≥0.8

         12. Hemoglobin &lt; 7.5 g/dl or hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl and actively bleeding

             blood transfusions during hospitalization

         14. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within the last 90
             days

         15. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery within 30 days

         16. Angina pectoris or use of nitrates with activities of daily living

         17. Cardiopulmonary disease classified as NYHA class IV

         18. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) within the prior 3 months

         19. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage from vasculitis

         20. Use of high frequency ventilation

         21. Participation in other interventional studies involving investigational agents

         22. Burns &gt; 40% total body surface area

         23. Use of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator therapy (eg. NO or prostaglandins)
