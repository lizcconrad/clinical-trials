    <textblock>
      The WHISH trial applies state-of-the science behavioral principles and currently available
      technologies to deliver a physical activity intervention without face-to-face contact to
      ~25,000 older U.S. women expected to consent. It includes an algorithm-driven interactive
      voice response (IVR) system, built to complement the National Institute of Aging (NIA)
      Go4LifeÂ® Exercise &amp; Physical Activity materials 3, which provides tailored advice on how to
      achieve nationally recommended levels of PA and overcome barriers to exercise, with a means
      for self-monitoring and setting personal goals. The intervention builds upon evidence-based
      behavioral science principles and intervention components that have proven to be effective in
      increasing PA in older women, with innovative adaptive approaches to tailoring the delivery
      to meet individual (personal) needs.

    <description>The Physical Activity Intervention Group will receive guidance on being physically active, including aerobics, flexibility, balance, strength, and decreased sedentary time. The primary resource is the National Institute of Aging Go4Life exercise and physical activity materials. The materials are based on the United States national guidelines for physical activity for older adults</description>

    <description>The PA intervention will consist of a multimodal activity program of aerobics, balance, strength, flexibility. The intervention will involve encouraging participants to increase all forms of PA throughout the day and to decrease sedentary time, such as sitting. This may include activities such as leisure sports, gardening, use of stairs instead of escalators, leisurely walks with friends, and less use of remote control devices.An interactive voice response (IVR) coach will be available. The intervention is conducted primarily by mail and optionally by phone and the IVR.</description>
