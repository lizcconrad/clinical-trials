  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In colorectal cancer therapy anti-angiogenic strategies have become a cornerstone of
      treatment regimens in the metastatic setting. Addition of bevacizumab to conventional
      chemotherapeutic combination regimens has improved the median overall survival of advanced
      colorectal cancer patients by approximately 5 months. Selecting patients, who will benefit
      from anti-angiogenic approaches, would be highly desirable in order to optimize treatment
      strategies. Changes in ocular blood flow may be an attractive biomarker for predicting
      treatment response. In light of the given alternative first line treatment options such a
      predictive biomarker would be of clinical benefit. In the proposed study the investigators
      will assess potential changes in the ocular blood flow of mCRC patients after treatment with
      standard of care anti-angiogenic/cytotoxic therapy as an early predictive marker of treatment
      response as assessed by standard CT-scan
