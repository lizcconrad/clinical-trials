    <textblock>
      A Phase I/2 multi-center open-label study of BGB324 in combination with erlotinib in patients
      with Stage IIIb or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. BGB324 is a potent selective small
      molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein kinase receptor which is connected with
      poor prognosis and acquired resistance to therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, multi-arm open-label Phase I/2 study that will be conducted at up to
      11 clinical sites in the US.

      Up to approximately 66 patients with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed Stage IIIb or
      Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer will receive BGB324 as a single agent (Run-in Cohort(mono
      therapy)) or in combination with erlotinib (Arms A, B, C).

      Run-in Arm to establish the safety and tolerability of BGB324 administered as a single agent.
      BGB324 will be administered at a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1,
      followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. After 6 patients have been dosed and safety established
      Arm A ( dose escalation arm) will be opened to confirm the BGB324 to be used in combination
      with erlotinib.

      In Arm A the dose of BGB324 will be escalated in a standard 3+3 fashion until an MTD of the
      combination ( BGB324+ erlotinib) is established. The dose of BGB324 to be investigated in arm
      B and C will be confirmed upon recommendation of a Safety Review Committee.

      Arm B and C will open in parallel and will investigate BGB324 in combination with erlotinib.

    <description>designed to determine the maximum dose of BGB324 that can be safely administered in combination with erlotinib administered at the approved oral dose level of 150 mg daily. It is anticipated that a maximum of three BGB324 dose levels will be evaluated, with up to approximately 18 patients enrolled. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients will be allowed to continue receiving BGB324 in combination with erlotinib until disease progression.- (Arm completed)</description>

    <description>The primary goal of the Run-in Cohort is to establish the safety and tolerability of BGB324 administered as a single agent. Eligible patients will have either exhausted existing licensed therapies or be unsuitable for treatment with existing licensed therapies for NSCLC. BGB324 will be administered at a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1, followed by 200 mg daily thereafter (Arm completed)</description>
