      Primary Objective:

      To assess the safety and tolerability of ascending single intraarticular doses of GZ389988 in
      patients with painful osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ascending single intraarticular doses of
      GZ389988 in patients with painful OA of the knee.

      To obtain preliminary pharmacodynamic evaluation of ascending single intraarticular doses of
      GZ389988 in patients with painful OA of the knee.

      Screening will be performed within 28 days of dosing. Following the single dose of study
      medication, the study period for each patient will be 84 Â± 7 days up to the end-of-study
      visit.

      Total duration for one patient will be up to 17 weeks (up to the end-of-study visit), not
      including the long term observational safety follow-up by phone call for 12 additional weeks.

               -  X-ray evidence within the last 6 months for Kellgren and Lawrence classification
                  II to IV.

               -  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) A1 Pain
                  subscore (walking pain) between 50 and 90 using the 100-mm visual analog scale
                  (VAS), corresponding to moderate to severe pain in the index knee, at both
                  screening and baseline assessments at least 48 hours apart.

          -  Symptomatic for more than 6 months (if both symptomatic knees, at least for the most
             painful knee that will receive the study drug).

          -  Having given written informed consent prior to any procedure related to the study.

          -  Positive result on any of the following tests: hepatitis B surface (HBsAg) antigen,
             anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibodies, anti-human immunodeficiency virus 1 and

          -  Secondary OA.

          -  Ipsilateral hip OA.

          -  Symptomatic contralateral knee OA with WOMAC A1 pain subscore (walking pain) &gt;30 on

          -  Prior history of osteonecrosis and/or rapidly progressive OA.

          -  Intraarticular injection within 3 months prior to inclusion.

          -  Unable to be maintained for at least 2 weeks prior to entry into study on paracetamol

             after the end-of-study visit [Day 84 Â± 7] patients may be given an NSAID if necessary
             to provide better control of OA symptoms).

          -  Any IMP within 3 months prior to the study.

          -  Any knee MRI contraindication.
