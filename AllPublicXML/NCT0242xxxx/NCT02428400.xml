      Methodology:

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-cohort Phase 1/1b study in
      patients that are currently being treated for chronic HBV infection. For all cohorts,
      patients must be receiving antiviral treatment with either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF) or entecavir (ENT) for at least two years, and have their HBV infection well-controlled

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 through 65 years of age, inclusive

          -  Patients must be undetectable for neutralizing antibodies to Adenovirus serotype 5
             (Ad5) (PART A ONLY)

          -  Negative serum β-HCG (for women of childbearing potential only; women of
             non-childbearing potential are defined as a woman who has been postmenopausal for ≥ 2
             years or who had had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or medically documented
             ovarian failure)

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use double effective
             methods of contraception (e.g. two of the following: hormonal contraception, condom or
             occlusive cap, intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), male
             sterilisation, or true abstinence) through 3 months after the last IMP administration;
             male patients must agree to use a double effective method of contraception (e.g. two
             of the following: hormonal contraception, condom or occlusive cap, IUD or IUS, male
             sterilisation, or true abstinence) during heterosexual intercourse with a partner
             capable of becoming pregnant throughout 3 months after the last IMP administration

          -  Currently on treatment for HBV monoinfection (any HBV genotypes) for at least 2 years
             with either the nucleos(t)ide analogue TDF or ENT

          -  A history of HBV DNA &lt; 20 IU/mL for at least 6 months before entry and HBV DNA &lt; 20
             IU/mL at screening.

          -  HBsAg positive

          -  HBeAg positive or HBeAg negative patients with HBV infection

          -  Compensated liver disease; defined as direct or conjugated bilirubin ≤ 1.2 × ULN,
             PT/INR ≤ 1.2 × ULN, platelets ≥ 150,000/mm3, serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/L, and no prior
             history of clinical hepatic decompensation (eg, ascites, jaundice, encephalopathy,
             variceal hemorrhage)

          -  ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN. Due to its biological variability, a re-test of the ALT parameter is
             allowed if the ALT value at screening does not exceed 10% of the 1.5 x ULN value and
             all other eligibility criteria are met. In this case, the ALT re-test can be performed
             no more than one month after the initial ALT screening assay and has to be confirmed
             within 2 weeks. Values of the two ALT assays re-tests have to be below 1.5 x ULN to
             include the patient. In case of re-test of the ALT parameter, all hematology and
             biochemistry parameters will be reassessed in parallel of the second ALT re-test to
             ensure that they are still matching TG1050.02 eligibility criteria.• Hemoglobin ≥ 10
             g/L

          -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 50mL/min

          -  Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/mm3

          -  Patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             or hepatitis Delta virus (HDV)

          -  Patients with either a) medical history or evidence of cirrhosis who had any biopsy
             showing cirrhosis or any approved non-invasive test indicative of cirrhosis as
             documented in the medical source documents; OR b) either of the following at
             screening: transient elastography score ≥ 10.5 kPa OR a Fibrotest® Fibrosure® score of
             ≥ 0.48 and an aspartate aminotransferase platelet ratio Index (APRI) of ≥1. Note: If a
             biopsy or non-invasive test has never been performed or if a biopsy or non-invasive
             test has been performed but showed no cirrhosis, then b) must be followed at screening

          -  Patients with a history of uncontrolled thyroid disease or abnormal thyroid
             stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at screening (defined as &lt; 0.8 × lower limit of
             normal [LLN] or &gt; 1.2 × ULN; patients are eligible with abnormal TSH levels if the
             free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) are within normal limits)

          -  Significant concomitant medical disorder including active systemic infection or proven
             or suspected immunosuppressive disorder

          -  History of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease (including autoimmune hepatitis, or
             preexisting autoimmune or antibody-mediated disease)

          -  Current or history of clinically significant oncologic, pulmonary, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic
             illness, major organ transplantation, or any other major medical disorder that, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would interfere with patient treatment, or preclude
             patient participation in this study; should be discussed case by case with the Sponsor

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Prior treatment with an experimental gene therapy product or a gene therapy product

          -  Prior participation in another research protocol involving an investigation medicinal
             product (IMP) within 4 months prior to TG1050/placebo injection

          -  History of substance abuse, including alcohol abuse that in the judgment of the
             investigator would deem the patient as not be suitable for participation in the study

          -  Patients unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol requirements

        All key inclusion and exclusion criteria remain the same for patients in Part A, MD Cohort
        and in Part B of the study except for the following:

        Patients with detectable or undetectable anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibodies are eligible
        (i.e. regardless of their pre-immunity to Ad5 nAb).
