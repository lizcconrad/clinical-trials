      The purpose of this open-label, dose-ranging, exploratory study is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, compliance, mechanism of action and efficacy of QBECO site specific
      immunomodulation for the induction of clinical response and remission in subjects with
      moderate to severe ulcerative colitis
