    <textblock>
      This clinical research study will be done in two parts.

      The goal of the first part is to find the highest tolerable dose of ONC201 that can be given
      to patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, DLBCL, and TLCL. Groups of subjects will receive
      increasing doses of ONC201 by mouth on day 1 of each 21 day cycle or on Day 1 of every week
      until there are side effects that are not tolerated or a maximum of 625 mg has been found to
      be tolerable.

      As a result of new information, it has been decided that subjects in Arm A will continue
      receiving their dosing every 3 weeks. All other subjects will be dosed weekly.

      The dose you receive may be too low to have an effect or so high it causes bad side effects.

      In the second part of this study the highest dose of NC201 will be given to learn if ONC201
      can help to control the disease.

      Please note that this is the first time ONC201 will be given to human subjects.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take your assigned dose
      of ONC201 capsules by mouth on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle or on Day 1 of every week. You
      will take the study drug in the clinic during Cycle 1.

      You should take ONC201 at about the same time each day and food should not be consumed either
      2 hours before or 2 hours after you take it. ONC201 should be taken with a glass of water as
      quickly as possible.

      The capsules should be swallowed whole. Do not attempt to open capsules or dissolve them in
      water.

      Your study doctor will give you further instructions on how to take the study drug.

      If you miss a dose, you can take it up to 6 hours after the time you would have taken it. If
      it is later than 6 hours, you should skip the dose.

      If you vomit a dose and can see all of the capsules you took, you can retake the dose. If you
      vomited and cannot see all of the capsules, do not retake the dose.

      You will need to fill out diary cards with information about when you take ONC201. You should
      bring the diary cards with you to every visit.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  You will have an EKG 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours after you take the study drug.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing
           before you take your study drug, 30 minutes after, 2 hours after, 4 hours after, and 6
           hours after you take it. PK testing measures the level of study drug in your blood at
           different time points.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing before you take
           your study drug. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect
           the disease.

      On Day 2 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and PD testing.

      On Day 3 of Cycle 1, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and PD testing.

      On Days 4 and 5 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing.

      On Day 8 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine, PK, and PD testing.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, PK, and PD testing.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a GI endoscopy.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Days 2, 9, and 16 of Cycles 1-3 and on Day 2 of Cycles 4 and beyond, you will be asked to
      complete the survey about your symptoms.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, and every odd cycle after that, you will have a CT scan and/or a
      PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you
      will have a tumor biopsy to check the status of the disease. To collect this biopsy, the
      affected area is numbed with anesthetic and tissue is removed with a cutting tool.

      If the study doctor thinks the disease has completely responded to the study treatment, the
      following tests and procedures will be performed to confirm the status of the disease:

        -  You will have a colonoscopy, including a biopsy of any abnormal growths. To collect this
           biopsy, small amounts of tissue are removed with a cutting tool.

        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan or a CT scan. The tests
           may be repeated any time the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the long-term follow-up
      phone calls.

      End-of-Dosing Visit:

      Within about 30 days after you finish taking the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  You will be asked to complete the survey about your symptoms.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  Blood (about 4-6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check how well your
           blood clots, and for PK and PD testing.

        -  You will have a PET scan, CT scan, and chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration
           to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a colonoscopy and GI endoscopy to look
           for abnormal areas.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      After your end-of-dosing visit, the study staff will call you every 3 months for 1 year to
      ask how you are doing, to find out about any other treatments you have received, and to have
      you complete the survey about your symptoms. These calls should take about 10-15 minutes. In
      addition to the phone calls, your medical records may be reviewed during this time as well.

      This is an investigational study. ONC201 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
