  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this long-term observational study is the documentation of the use of PASCORBIN®
      7.5 g in patients with vitamin C deficiency. Regarding the vitamin C deficiency, the
      investigators focus on the acquisition of data of the underlying diseases and the reduction
      of symptoms, that are related to oxidative stress and vitamin-C-deficiency. Next to this,
      exact assessment of medical tolerance and details of treatment requirements are further aims.
      Here the investigators take into account acute and chronic underlying medical conditions.
      Further health economic data are collected.

    <textblock>
      The observational study began on 01 November 2012 and is scheduled for a period of 10 years
      continued (until 01 November 2022). The duration of the observational study for each patient
      is not fixed corresponding to the character of a non-interventional study. According to the
      underlying disease, characterized either acute or chronic, there are 2 and 3 observations
      within the treatment period, respectively. Documentation comprises the course of the
      underlying diseases (by tracking of general and diseases-specific symptoms), drug
      compatibility (by ADR assessment), concomitant medication or other treatment, health economic
      data, details of treatment regimen and standard epidemiological data.

    <description>The main aim was to measure the success of the treatment with Pascorbin® 7.5 g by the documentation of the change in general and disease-specific symptoms.
The symptoms are measured by a score:
0 = not present, 1 = slightly, 2 = moderate and 3 = strong
The change of the symptoms is measured in change groups:
number of patients with improved symptoms
number of patients with unchanged symptoms
number of patients with worsened symptoms</description>

    <description>Global assessment of efficacy is measured by a score:
Very good efficacy (complete regression of symptoms)
Good efficacy (symptoms was much improved)
Moderate efficacy (symptoms was slightly improved)
No efficacy (symptoms remained unchanged)
No efficacy (symptoms worsened)</description>
