  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to test whether an activity monitor with an online
      motivational rewards component will increase physical activity levels of middle school-aged
      students. The secondary objective is to learn about the functionality and utilization of the
      activity meter device among this age group.

      The goal of this pilot study is to find out whether an activity meter linked to web-based
      rewards will increase physical activity levels in middle school aged students who use it over
      6 weeks. To test this, students who participate in the study will be assigned to 1 of 3
      groups: the meter with web-based rewards group, the Dance Dance Revolution group, or the
      control group. The physical activity of participants in all 3 groups will be tracked using
      the an activity meter that participants will be asked to carry daily for the 6 weeks of the
      study. Participants given the activity meter with web-based rewards or Dance Dance Revolution
      will be instructed to use them at their own will, as much or as little as they like. Before
      beginning the study, all participating students will be asked background questions about
      themselves (such as their gender, age, and ethnic group) and about the kinds of computer and
      video game consoles they have access to at home. All participants will also complete short
      questionnaires at enrollment, week 1, week 3 and week 6. These questions will ask
      participants about their experiences using the assigned devices, their physical activity
      levels, and their thoughts about their ability to be physically active. At the end of 6
      weeks, all participants will finish the study and return their assigned devices to the study
      coordinator. Height and weight will be measured at baseline and at the end of the study.

    <description>This group is provided an activity meter that tracks the amount and intensity of one's physical activity and is linked to a motivational website. On the website, activity data from the activity meter can be viewed after uploading information from the meter to the website. The reward website allots points for participants based on the amount and intensity of physical activity. Points can be redeemed for rewards on the website, such as gift cards and digital badges.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group is provided an activity meter that tracks the amount and intensity of one's physical activity and a copy of the game Dance Dance Revolution (DDR). The activity meter will upload data to a secure server but will not be linked to the motivational website used by the intervention group. DDR is a dancing video game in which players view arrows timed to music on a TV screen and gain points by stepping on the corresponding arrows on a floor mat. Players obtain points in the game by stepping on the correct arrows at the right time to the beat of the music. The points earned with DDR cannot be redeemed for rewards.</description>

    <description>This group is provided with an activity meter and will be asked to carry it with them as they go about their normal daily activities. Like in the Active Control group, participants in the Passive Control group will not have access to the motivational website. For this group, the activity meter functions solely as a monitor to track their activity levels. No other product or intervention will be introduced to the control group.</description>

    <intervention_name>Intervention Group (motivational website, activity meter)</intervention_name>
    <description>The activity meter linked to a motivational website is designed to motivate middle school-aged children to increase their rates of physical activity by providing feedback on the amount of activity, and rewards based on the amount and duration of activity.</description>

    <description>The active video game, Dance Dance Revolution, requires physical movement as part of game play and may motivate users to engage in more activity. The same activity meter used in the Intervention Group is provided to this group to track physical activity but does not link to the motivational website nor does it provide any feedback on levels or duration of activity.</description>

    <description>Participants are provided the same activity meter used in the other study groups to track physical activity but it does not link to the motivational website nor does it provide any feedback on levels or duration of activity. Participants are asked to go about their normal activities.</description>
