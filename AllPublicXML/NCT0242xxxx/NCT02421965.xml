  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a three year research project whose aims are to evaluate the willingness of
      individuals with serious mental illness to initiate the two illness self-management
      interventions- WRAP or FOCUS, to examine and compare participant engagement, satisfaction,
      and outcomes (symptoms, recovery, quality of life) in the two interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare two illness self-management interventions for SMI: a
      clinic-based group protocol (Wellness Recovery Action Planning or WRAP) and an mHealth
      smartphone intervention (FOCUS). The study is structured as a randomized controlled trial,
      and data will be collected using a comprehensive mixed-methods quantitative /qualitative
      approach. This study will evaluate patients willingness to enroll in one of the two
      illness-self management interventions, patient satisfaction, engagement, symptoms, recovery
      and quality of life.

      The specific aims of the study are to: 1) Evaluate and compare the willingness and ability of
      individuals with SMI to enroll in the two illness self-management interventions; 2) Examine
      and compare participant engagement and satisfaction with both treatments; and 3) Examine and
      compare patient outcomes following participation in the interventions.

      Participants will be randomized to receive 12-weeks of WRAP or FOCUS. Participants allocated
      to the WRAP group will be provided all other materials (i.e. WRAP binder, handouts) in their
      first session and will meet weekly in groups with trained facilitators. Participants in the
      FOCUS group will be given a study smartphone device with FOCUS application and trained by the
      mHealth support specialist on how to use the functions of the smartphone (i.e. using a
      touchscreen, call, text) and different features of the FOCUS intervention.

    <description>Patient willingness to enroll will be measured by proportion of individuals in each arm who commence the intervention after allocation. It is an important indicator of whether patients find the intervention appealing. Data will be obtained from electronic tracking records / FOCUS software.</description>

    <measure>Patient Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient engagement will be measured by weeks of WRAP sessions attended / weeks FOCUS was used, during the 12-week intervention period. Data for WRAP sessions will be obtained from Thresholds electronic tracking record. Data for FOCUS usage will be captured automatically on FOCUS software.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Severity of Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months (post-treatment), 6 months (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the Severity of Symptoms will measured using Symptom Checklist-9 scale, Beck Depression Inventory-2 (BDI-2) scale and Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS). Symptom Checklist-9 (SCL-9) is a nine-item questionnaire to assess psychiatric functioning. BDI-2 is a widely used 21-item self-report scale to measure depressive symptom severity. PSYRATS is a fine-grained measure of psychotic symptoms that consists of 17 self-report items that evaluate dimensional symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months (post-treatment), 6 months (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Recovery of patient will be measured using the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS). RAS has 24 items that assess 5 factors related to recovery including Hope, Goal Directedness, and Domination by Symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months (post-treatment), 6 months (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed using a 6-item Quality of Life scale of general wellbeing, interpersonal relations, participation in activities, and role functioning. Patients respond on a 7-point scale.</description>
