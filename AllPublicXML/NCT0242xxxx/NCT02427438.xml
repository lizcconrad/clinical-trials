    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect size of the change in Oswestry
      Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) score over the 8 week follow-up period between the video based
      instruction or standard of care hand-out with pictures and written instructions for subjects
      meeting the clinical prediction rule for lumbar stabilization.

      The second purpose will be to determine if there is a subset of physical examination and
      self-reported variables that are associated with having a successful result (ODQ improvement
      by at least 6 points) and if the subset of variables are affected by whether or not the
      subject was in the intervention (video) or control (handout) group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately fifty percent of patients seeking help in outpatient orthopedic clinics and
      roughly thirty percent of people will experience some low back pain (LBP) at some time in
      their life.(1) LBP is the second leading cause of missed days of work per year and results in
      around ninety billion dollars per year in medical costs. (1) Physical therapy interventions
      for LBP could include manual therapy, exercise, traction, range of motion, modalities,
      postural education, or a combination of these interventions.(2-5) Medical treatment for LBP
      could include medications, imaging, laboratory studies, injections, surgery, or counseling
      through pain psychology.(6-7) Many research studies are inconclusive regarding effective
      treatment.

      In 1995 a treatment based classification system for patients with acute low back pain was
      published.(8) Patients were categorized into one of four categories: manipulation,
      directional exercises (flexion, extension, lateral shift correction), immobilization, or
      traction. (8)This classification system led to further validation of the categories and
      clinical prediction rules (CPR) related to best treatment outcomes.(9-11) In 2005, Hicks
      built upon the initial classification system for immobilization when he published a
      preliminary CPR identifying which patients were most likely to benefit from lumbar
      stabilization.(10) Hicks identified the following predictors for patient response to
      stabilization exercises: individuals younger than age forty, straight leg raise greater than
      ninety-one degrees, and aberrant motions or a positive prone instability test.(10) Hicks
      reported a presence of three or more of these variables had a positive likelihood ratio of
      4.0 for a 95% confidence interval.(10) However, no studies to date have confirmed such
      results nor validated this clinical prediction rule.

      Home program prescription background Evidence for using video for home program prescription
      is limited. However, video based home programs have been successfully used for patients with
      Huntington's disease, traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury, brachial plexus
      injuries, and general shoulder strengthening.(12-15) Medical studies demonstrate that
      patients comprehend information better when communicated via educational videos as opposed to
      educational pamphlets about various disorders.(16-18)

      Problem Statement:

      Currently, there is no literature evaluating the use of video home programs for patients with
      LBP or identifying who may benefit from this form of clinical education. Home program
      handouts frequently depict photographs or figures with incorrect form or instructions. Video
      based home programs demonstrating the stabilization techniques for patients may provide
      correct form and accurate instructions. With such programs, patient comprehension and
      technical reproduction of the exercises may improve. Video-based home programs could lead to
      fewer clinic visits and decreased cost per episode of care.

      Given the numerous factors that contribute to limited clinic visits in LBP patients, more
      effective communication should be beneficial during treatment. We do not know if patient
      learning styles may influence compliance with varying modes of home exercise program
      prescriptions. Video based home exercise programs may also be a better fit for patients who
      are more auditory or visual learners as defined by the Visual, Auditory, Reading, Kinesthetic
      (VARK) learning inventory. (19) Auditory learners prefer information being transferred by
      listening. Visual learners prefer maps, charts, and perhaps videos over written charts or
      instructions.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ODQ measures level of disability with patients presenting with low back pain. It is also reliable and has excellent construct validity.(10, 34-36) The ODQ will be assessed at baseline and after eight weeks of therapy to determine the overall success of stabilization based treatment on patient function.(10) The Oswestry has ten sections, one to assess pain and the remaining which assesses functional activities. Each section is scored from 0 to 5 which indicates the level of limitation with that given activity. Each score is then totaled and then doubled to give a percentage of disability. Higher scores on the Oswestry indicate greater levels of disability. A five to six point improvement on the Oswestry is considered the minimum clinically important difference with a fifty percent improvement being defined as &quot;success&quot; by Hicks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects will complete a numeric pain rating using the traditional eleven point VAS scale. This will be assessed at every clinic visit. The VAS consists of a 100 mm line in which patients mark their pain on a scale from No Pain to Worst Pain Imaginable. This has been shown to be reliable and valid in prior research studies for low back pain. The VAS also is sensitive in detecting small amounts of change. 24 Prior research demonstrates that the repeatability of the VAS is good with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.97 to 0.99.(25) According to Jenson, the VAS also has greater levels of discrimination when using a 101 point scale.(26) Majority of research articles using the VAS define a statistically significant reduction as 50%.(26)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Fear and Avoidant Behaviors Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fear and Avoidant Behaviors Questionnaire (FABQ) will be used to screen for psychosocial contributions to a participants pain and function. The FABQ will be assessed at baseline and 8 weeks/discharge. Two subscales within this questionnaire assess physical activity and work. Responses are marked on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from completely disagree to completely agree. Higher scores indicate higher levels or fear-avoidance beliefs on both subscales. The FABQ is reliable and valid for use with LBP patients.27-29 Test retest reliability of the physical activity subscale has been shown to be acceptable at ICC=0.72 to 0.90. (30, 31) Fritz demonstrated that the FABQ work subscale can be used to identify which patients are at risk of not returning to work after four weeks of work-related injury. (32) A clinically important change level has not yet been determined for use of the FABQ. Woby however, demonstrated that changes in the FABQ have been correlated with changes in disability</description>
