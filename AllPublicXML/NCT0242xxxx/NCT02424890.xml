  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized trial is to study the effect of stress on performance and
      the effect of repetition of simulation sessions on performance and stress. This study is a
      randomized controlled trial including 48 participants who composed 12 multidisciplinary teams
      (MDTs). Each MDT was made up of 4 persons: an emergency physician, a resident, a nurse, and
      an ambulance driver who usually compose an emergency team of the French Emergency Medical
      Service (EMS). 6 MDTs underwent 9 simulation sessions over 1 year (Repetitive SIm Group). 6
      MDTs underwent 3 simulation sessions over 1 year (Control Group). Evidence of the existence
      of stress was assessed in 3 ways: salivary cortisol, Holter parameters, and psychological
      stress questionnaires. The impact of stress on overall team performance, on technical
      procedure, and on teamwork, is evaluated by specific validated scales. Detection of
      post-traumatic stress (PTSD) is performed by self-evaluation on the 7th day and after one
      month. The perspective is to concomitantly evaluate technical and non-technical performance,
      and the impact of stress on both. This is the first randomized trial studying repetition of
      simulation sessions and its impact on both clinical performance and stress as explored by
      objective and subjective assessments. The investigators expect that stress decreases team
      performance and that repeated simulation increases team performance. The investigators expect
      no variation of stress parameters regardless of level of performance.
