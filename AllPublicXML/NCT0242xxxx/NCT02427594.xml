      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in urine net acid excretion, blood pressure
      and body chemistry that occur when the dietary acid load is lowered by using a drug/dietary
      supplement similar to baking soda. This may be important for patients with kidney disease
      because they may have difficulty removing all of the dietary acid load from the body in the
      urine. Participants with and without kidney disease will be recruited. Each participant will
      be fed a controlled diet for one week with sodium bicarbonate and for one week without sodium
      bicarbonate to evaluate these changes. The investigators will also determine if the effect of
      dietary acid load reduction is different in patients with kidney disease compared to those
      without kidney disease.

    <description>In this arm participants will first consume a controlled diet plus added table salt (sodium chloride) for one week. They will then consume an identical controlled diet plus sodium bicarbonate for one week. Sodium bicarbonate will be dosed as 2,600 mg divided three times daily if ideal body weight is &lt;70 kg or 3,250 mg divided three times daily if ideal body weight is ≥70 kg. Added table salt will match the sodium content of the sodium bicarbonate dose (i.e. 31 or 39 mEq/day).</description>
