    <textblock>
      Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV) treatment is routinely prescribed in France. In order to be
      reimbursed according to the French Social Security rules, the patient treated with an ASV
      needs to be examined each year. In this observational transversal single-visit study, the
      investigators aim to describe the clinical characteristics of patients treated with ASV and
      the associated device settings.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in &quot;real life conditions&quot; the use of Adaptative
      Servo-Ventilation (ASV) treatment. ASV treatment is routinely prescribed in France in
      patients with various sleep disorders breathing (Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) and Central
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome (CSAS), CHF and central and obstructive sleep apnea (COSA), Obstructive
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and complex sleep apnea syndrome (compSAS), idiopathic or drug
      induced periodic breathing.

      In order to be reimbursed according to the French Social Security rules, the patient treated
      with an ASV needs to be examined each year. In this observational transversal single-visit
      study, the aim is to describe the clinical characteristics of patients treated with ASV and
      the associated device settings. The aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy issues in real
      life conditions of the ASV prescription.Depending of the data, data are obtained after
      analysis of the six latest months data of the ASV device, after questioning the patient,
      after analysis of the polygraphy/oximetry (if prescribed by the doctor for the renewal
      consultation of the ASV care and reimbursement by the French Social Security). All the data
      are obtained during the annual consultation required by the French Social Security.
