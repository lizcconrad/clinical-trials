      This study is designed to investigate whether complement C3 depletion is associated with poor
      short-term outcomes in postoperative patients with gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The complement system plays an important role in the development of digestive malignancies.
      The complement C3 is the point of convergence for the three complement activation pathways.
      However, the concrete effect of C3 in the development of gastric cancer is still obscured.
      This study is designed to explore whether complement C3 can be regarded as a predictive
      factor of postoperative outcomes for postoperative patients with gastric cancer.

      This study is designed as a prospective cohort study and included consecutively treated
      patients. The perioperative plasma value of complement components, such as C3, C4, and CH50,
      are detected to explore the incidence rate of complement depletion. All enrolled patients are
      divided into two groups mainly according to the levels of preoperative C3 levels (C3
      depletion and Non-C3 depletion groups). The primary endpoints are the 1-year overall survival
      and disease-free survival, while the secondary endpoints are postoperative complications,
      length of hospital stay, and hospital charges.

      This study would be helpful to confirm the role of complement depletion in anticipated
      outcomes of postoperative patients with gastric cancer.

    <description>Patients with persistent low-level of complement C3 within the perioperative period would be assigned into this main observational group. After a careful multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) discussion, a radical operation with gastrectomy plus D2 lymphadenectomy would be performed, followed by an adjuvant chemotherapy if required. Generally, SOX chemo regimen (S-1+Oxaliplatin) would be first considered for the candidates.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Non-C3 depletion</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients with normal plasma values of complement C3 within the perioperative period would be assigned into this control group. Those patients would undergo the same decision making process to determine the final treatment plan.</description>

    <description>A classic total or subtotal gastrectomy plus D2 lymph nodes dissection would be performed for all enrolled patients. Patients in both groups would undergo the identical therapeutic approach for gastric cancer, mainly decided by a multidisciplinary treatment group in our center.</description>

    <description>A postoperative systemic chemotherapy would be performed for some subjects who have advanced gastric cancer. The concrete chemo regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy is also determined by a MDT group. Generally, SOX chemo regimen is the first-line treatment in our center, as following described:
S-1: 40~60mg bid，po, Day1~14 （S-1：BSA &lt;1.25m2, 40mg bid, 1.25m2≤BSA≤1.5m2,50mg bid, BSA&gt;1.5m2, 60mg bid）
Oxaliplatin: 130mg/m2，iv drip for 2h，Day1</description>

        Patients who have a confirmed pathological diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma would be
        selected for further observation. Those patients who subsequently underwent a radical tumor
        resection can be included for final analysis.
