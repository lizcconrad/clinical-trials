  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the
      efficacy and safety of apremilast in subjects with moderate plaque psoriasis. 221
      participants were randomized 2 (apremilast):1 (placebo) at approximately 25 sites in the
      United States. Those randomized to the apremilast treatment group received apremilast 30 mg
      tablets orally twice daily for 52 weeks. Those randomized to the placebo treatment group
      received placebo tablets (identical in appearance to the apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally
      twice daily (BID) for 16 weeks. Beginning Week 16, those initially randomized to placebo were
      switched to receive apremilast 30 mg BID for an additional 36 weeks (52 weeks total).

      Study enrolled adult patients with stable moderate plaque psoriasis, who are na√Øve to
      systemic psoriasis treatments.

    <measure>Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in the Product of BSA (%) and the sPGA Which is Considered as the Total Psoriasis Severity Index at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16 (end of phase)</time_frame>
    <description>BSA is a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), 5 (very severe) incorporating a separate assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the plaques of all involved areas: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation with an overall sPGA calculated as (E + I + D)/3. Scores for each assessment are rounded to the nearest whole number to result in the final score. The range of BSA*sPGA mean percentage change from baseline to week 16 (end of phase) were -100 to 344.4 and -100 to 100 for the placebo and apremilast groups respectively. Higher scores represented worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16 (end of phase)</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the participant is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a sPGA Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) at Week 16 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16 (end of phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 6-point scale, ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe), with an overall sPGA calculated as (E + I + D)/3. Scores for each assessment are averaged and rounded to the nearest whole number to result in the final sPGA score.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Weeks 1 and 16 (end of phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus VAS assessment was conducted at the baseline visit and each post-baseline visit. The participant was asked to place a vertical stroke on a 100 mm VAS on which the left-hand boundary (0) represents no itch, and the right-hand boundary (100) represents itch as severe as can be imagined. The distance from the mark to the left-hand boundary will be recorded. The Pruritus VAS score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to more severe symptom.</description>

          <description>The Static Physician‚Äôs Global Assessment (sPGA) is the assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. The National Psoriasis Foundation Psoriasis Score version of a static PGA is calculated by averaging the total body erythema, induration, and desquamation scores. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 6-point scale, ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe), with an overall sPGA calculated as (E + I + D)/3. Scores for each assessment are rounded to the nearest whole number to result in the final score.</description>

          <description>For each participant, the product of BSA and sPGA were calculated as BSA value multiplied by the sPGA score (BSA*sPGA), measured as the total psoriasis severity index. The ranges for BSA* sPGA scores were from 15 to 40% for the placebo and apremilast arms respectively. Those in the study who had a baseline BSA in the range of 5-10% and a sPGA score of 3 or 4 were enrolled. Those with a higher psoriasis severity index represented worse outcomes. The difference between participants enrolled (148) in the apremilast group and treated (147) lies in one participant, who was randomized in error.</description>

        <title>Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in the Product of BSA (%) and the sPGA Which is Considered as the Total Psoriasis Severity Index at Week 16</title>
        <description>BSA is a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), 5 (very severe) incorporating a separate assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the plaques of all involved areas: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation with an overall sPGA calculated as (E + I + D)/3. Scores for each assessment are rounded to the nearest whole number to result in the final score. The range of BSA*sPGA mean percentage change from baseline to week 16 (end of phase) were -100 to 344.4 and -100 to 100 for the placebo and apremilast groups respectively. Higher scores represented worse outcomes.</description>

The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), 5 (very severe) incorporating a separate assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the plaques of all involved areas: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation with an overall sPGA calculated as (E + I + D)/3. Scores for each assessment are rounded to the nearest whole number to result in the final score. The range of BSA*sPGA mean percentage change from baseline to week 16 (end of phase) were -100 to 344.4 and -100 to 100 for the placebo and apremilast groups respectively. Higher scores represented worse outcomes.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the participant is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

        <title>Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area Severity Index Score (PASI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI score is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity.</description>

        <population>The ITT population consisted of all participants who were randomized. Participants with a baseline value and at least one post-baseline value are included. A missing value at Week 16 (end of phase) was imputed by LOCF.</population>

        <description>BSA is a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), 5 (very severe) incorporating a separate assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the plaques of all involved areas: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation with an overall sPGA calculated as (E + I + D)/3. Scores for each assessment are rounded to the nearest whole number to result in the final score.</description>

        <description>Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) are defined as any AEs that begin or worsen on or after the start of study drug through 28 days after the last dose of study drug or study treatment discontinuation date, whichever was later. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
