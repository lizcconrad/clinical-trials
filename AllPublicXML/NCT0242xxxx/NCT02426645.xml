    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate associations between early structural cellular injury
      and microvascular alteration with progression of septic organ dysfunction according to total
      SOFA-Score (an ICU-scoring system - the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score). Patients
      will be monitored for renal (TIMP-2, IGFBP7), and intestinal biomarkers (plasma i-FABP) in
      conjunction with kidney and muscle vascular bed microvascular perfusion analysis assessed by
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS). In parallel, a comprehensive analysis of patients'
      immunological status will be conducted using an established, on-site immune monitoring panel.

      The ultimate goal of this study is an early identification of septic patients developing
      multiorgan dysfunction which may facilitate a timely novel intervention in the future to
      improve outcome.
