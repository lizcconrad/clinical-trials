  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of ceritinib on the
      CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of the probe drugs midazolam and warfarin,
      respectively, when administered simultaneously as a cocktail. The results obtained from this
      drug interaction study will provide guidance that will enable an update to the ceritinib
      labeling and will help guide recommendations for administration of co-medications in future
      clinical trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB (and is not a
             candidate for definitive multimodality therapy) or stage IV NSCLC demonstrated
             ALK-positive or an advanced tumor, other than NSCLC, that carries an ALK genetic
             alteration (mutation, translocation or amplification) and/or ALK overexpression that
             has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy
             exists.

          -  The test to confirm ALK-positivity may be performed in archival tumor (obtained at or
             since the time of diagnosis), or in a newly obtained tumor sample taken prior to the
             first day of study drug. Results confirming ALK-positive status must be available
             before initiating treatment with ceritinib.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy, other ALK inhibitors, biologic therapy,
             or other investigational agents, must have recovered from all toxicities related to
             prior anticancer therapies to grade ≤ 1 (CTCAE v 4.03) prior to starting study drug.
             Patients with grade ≤ 2 peripheral neuropathy or any grade of alopecia, nail changes
             or skin changes are allowed to enter the study.

          -  Patients who have been treated with chemotherapy, with biological therapy or other
             investigational agent must have discontinued the treatment at least 2 weeks (14 days)
             prior to starting the study drug on Study Day -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ceritinib

             magnesium stearate), midazolam and warfarin as described in the local product
             information.

          -  History of carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Presence or history of a malignant disease other than an ALK-positive advanced tumor

             this exclusion include the following: completely resected basal cell and squamous cell
             skin cancers, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.

          -  Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent cardiac event (within
             6 months

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mmHg and/or
             Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mmHg, with or without anti-hypertensive
             medication.

          -  Patient has history of interstitial lung disease or interstitial pneumonitis,
             including clinically significant radiation pneumonitis (i.e., affecting activities of

          -  Other Protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion may apply.
