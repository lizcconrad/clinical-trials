        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Participants participating in the designated perampanel study as below, and who in the
             opinion of the investigator continue to benefit from treatment with perampanel
             Designated perampanel study: E2007-G000-332 (NCT01393743) (with at least 52 weeks of
             total exposure to perampanel).

          2. Provide written informed consent/assent signed by participant or legal guardian prior
             to entering the study or undergoing any study procedures. If the written informed
             consent is provided by the legal guardian because the participant is unable to do so,
             a written or verbal assent from the participant must also be obtained.

          3. Female participants of childbearing potential must agree for the duration of the study
             and for a period of at least 1 month following the last dose of perampanel to be
             abstinent or to commit to the consistent and correct use of a medically acceptable
             method of birth control (eg, a double-barrier method [condom plus spermicide, condom
             plus diaphragm with spermicide]).

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Participants residing in countries where perampanel is commercially available with
             respect to the indication or formulation of the designated perampanel study.

          2. Female participants who are nursing, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant.
