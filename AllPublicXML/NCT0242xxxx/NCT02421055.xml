    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that bacteria within the gut play an important role in diabetes
      improvement after bariatric (weight-loss) surgery. Bariatric surgery fundamentally changes
      the environment within the gut, which results in changes to the makeup of the trillions of
      bacteria living within it. These changes in the gut bacteria can affect the body in a number
      of complex ways, which we are only just beginning to understand. For example, gut bacteria
      breakdown food we are unable to absorb ourselves, leading to altered sugar levels and can
      release molecules that act to reduce appetite.

      In this study we aim to find out how bariatric surgery changes the gut bacteria and how this
      leads to weight loss and improvement of diabetes. With this understanding we hope to discover
      potential targets for future treatments, such as identifying beneficial bacteria that could
      be supplemented with probiotics in patients.

      Additionally, although highly successful, up to 30% of obese patients do not undergo
      improvement of their diabetes after bariatric surgery. We aim to identify molecules within
      the patient's blood or urine that are able to predict the likely chance a patient will
      undergo improvement in their diabetes after bariatric surgery to help clinicians select
      patients most likely to benefit.

      In this study we aim to assess how the gut microbiome affects the host phenotype following
      bariatric surgery through altered gut microbiome-host co-metabolism. The secondary objective
      is to identify novel biomarkers for the preoperative prognostication of T2DM remission
      following bariatric surgery.

      We will longitudinally phenotype 130 obese diabetics undergoing Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or
      Sleeve Gastrectomy surgery. Patients will be assessed preoperatively and at 3 months and 1
      year postoperatively. The primary clinical outcome will be diabetes remission. Other clinical
      measures recorded will include; 1) anthropometric &amp; physiological measurements, 2)
      demographic details, 3) biochemical parameters, 4) anti-hyperglycaemic and other medication
      use, 5) co-morbidity status and 6) dietary choices through 24hr dietary recall
      questionnaires.

      Blood, urine and stool samples will be collected at the above time points. Changes to the
      microbiome will be assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing and qPCR. Selected responders and
      non-responders will undergo full shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis. Global
      metabonomic profiles of serum, urine and faecal water will be generated using 1H-NMR. Further
      targeted analyses of bile acid and short-chain fatty acid profiles will be performed using
      LC-MS / GC-MS.

      We will utilise multivariate statistical analysis techniques to identify metabolic pathways
      altered following intervention, and novel host-microbiome co-metabolism pathways that impact
      upon phenotype. A supervised multivariate analysis, mapping T2DM outcomes to metagenomic and
      metabonomic data will be performed with the aim of identifying novel preoperative biomarkers
      that are able to prognosticate T2DM resolution following bariatric surgery.
