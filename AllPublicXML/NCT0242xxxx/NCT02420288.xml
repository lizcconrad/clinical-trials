    <description>Supervised physical conditioning program of three 55—60 minute sessions per week during whole pregnancy (before week 16 to 38). Each session consists of 25-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise,10 minutes of specific exercises (strength and balance exercises), and 10 minutes of pelvic floor muscles training.
Aerobic activity was prescribed at light to moderate intensity, aiming for 55-60% of heart rate reserve. All subjects wore a heart rate (HR) monitor (Polar FT7) during the training sessions to ensure that exercise intensity was light to moderate.</description>
