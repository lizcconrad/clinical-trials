  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a chronic irritating eye condition that affects many people, caused by poor tear
      quality and insufficient quantity. Treatments are traditionally in the form of artificial
      tears applied to the ocular surface. However, there is little evidence in the scientific
      literature that demonstrates their efficacy relative compared to each other, nor how to
      decide which one might be most effective for an individual patient. Therefore the
      investigators aim to examine the efficacy of different classes of artificial tears (those
      designed to increase viscosity, reduce evaporation or to mimic the component balance of the
      natural tears). In addition, the investigators also aim to determine how the treatment
      preferred by an individual could potentially have been predicted from their baseline
      condition.

      The efficacy of different classes of artificial tears (non-pharmaceutical) will be examined
      in patients that report dry eyes by prescribing each category of treatment [0.40% Sodium
      Hyaluronate (Clinitas Soothe), 0.15% Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyabak), 0.25%
      Carboxymethylcellulose, electrolyte balanced (Theratears), and Phospholipid liposomal spray
      (Tears Again)] for a month in turn following a short wash-out period and to examine their
      tear film and ocular surface after each one.
