      The study aim to capture key quality indicators and patient satisfaction for at least 500
      patients referred for a colonoscopy at Aalborg University Hospital. The patient population is
      mix of screening and non-screening colonoscopies seen at our out-patient clinic.

      Each Colonoscopy is registered using a specially designed registration form and a more
      detailed form relating to the colonoscopy itself. The data collected includes: Endoscopy
      experience and education, Medicine use, Colonoscopy duration, Caecum Intubations rate and
      documentation, Polyp detection rate, Polyps removed, Cancer detection rate and Nurse assisted
      Gloucester Comfort score. Each patient were given a questionaire with 6 questions answering
      satisfaction, pain, discomfort etc on a 10 cm analog scale.

      The above study is a part of the complete Colonoscopy program which has begun April 2015. The
      full program are as follows:

      Colonoscopy in North Jutland Surgical Departments

      A quality assurance research project with focus on key quality indicators, patient
      satisfaction and colonoscopy training.

      Introduction Population screening for colorectal cancer was introduced in Denmark in 2014
      leading to a substantially increased demand on the endoscopy units, which are typically based
      in the surgical departments. Colonoscopy can be effective in detecting cancers at an early
      stage or even preventing cancer by removal of premalignant polyps. A prerequisite for this
      effect is a high quality endoscopy service with a very low incidence of complications and
      missed cancers. Another important aspect is compliance within the target population. This is
      also largely dependent on the quality of colonoscopy including minimal discomfort and the
      perception of endoscopy staff as competent, knowledgeable, friendly and courteous.

      In reality little is known about the quality of colonoscopy in Denmark or in our region of
      North Jutland. There is no systematic collection of quality data on the national or regional
      level, endoscopy unit level or individual surgeon level. Data from the population screening
      programme will cover a few of the potential points, but a much more detailed data acquisition
      is necessary in order to ascertain if our service is up to international standards. This is
      not only of theoretical interest, as the endoscopy service quality or lack thereof will
      determine if the screening programme is effective or whether it is actually detrimental to
      the population.

      Prior to the implementation of population screening in the United Kingdom a colonoscopy
      quality survey was carried out. The results were appalling, with low completion rates and too
      many complications, and this led to a nationwide quality improvement programme, which
      includes systematic data monitoring and a very comprehensive training effort. All NHS
      endoscopy providers are invited to participate and there is regular feedback on quality data
      both at the endoscopy service level and at the individual colonoscopist's level. This has led
      to a marked improvement in the overall quality.

      In our region the investigators have an intuitive belief that our general endoscopy quality
      is good, although some endoscopists would be preferable to others in case any of us where
      referred for a colonoscopy. The investigators also perceive some endoscopists as better
      teachers than others, but in reality there are no evidence for any of these assumptions.

      Traditionally little attention has been paid to colonoscopy training in our country as
      opposed to teach-ing other types of surgical skills. Colonoscopy is a potentially unpleasant
      procedure usually carried out under minimal sedation, and it carries the risk of rare but
      serious complications and even death. There is ample evidence that part of the learning curve
      can be moved away from the patient by training on virtual reality simulators, but this is not
      mandatory in surgical education in Denmark. In this region there are two endoscopy simulators
      and courses are provided free of charge. Some of the training, how-ever, must necessarily be
      undertaken in the clinical setting. The literature suggests that competency is not achieved
      until the trainee has performed more than 200 procedures. In the Danish surgical curriculum,
      there is no demand for a specified number of procedures with or without supervision, but the
      colonoscopy competency must be vouched for by the supervisor or programme director at the end
      of specialty training.

      Teaching colonoscopy is difficult and time consuming. Most experienced colonoscopists are
      unable to give detailed guidance without actually taking over the procedure from the trainee
      as their perform-ance of colonoscopy has become largely &quot;automated&quot; or &quot;unconsciously
      competent&quot; over the years. It follows that a necessary foundation for effective and high
      quality training is a faculty of trainers (experienced colonoscopists) who have themselves
      received training as trainers, are aware of the quality of their own performance, and agree
      on the criteria for a high quality colonoscopy.

      In this educational and quality assurance research project the investigators wish to focus on
      quality data and quality training and wherever possible take the patients' perspective into
      account by inquiry into patient satisfaction aspects.

      Method

        1. Quality of colonoscopy Quality data acquisition

             -  The investigators wish to implement a nurse assessed patient comfort score

             -  The investigators wish to explore patient satisfaction with the colonoscopy service
                through questionnaires and if possible link the results to other quality parameters

             -  The investigators wish to gather retrospective epidemiological data regarding
                missed cancers and serious complications as a basis for future comparison. This
                will be a cooperation with the clinical epidemiology service

             -  The investigators wish to implement an IT system that enables automated capture of
                selected quality parameters directly from the colonoscopy notes. This will
                facilitate regular feedback on unit and individual level if this should be decided
                on at a later date. It will also provide a reliable basis for research Quality
                parameters for colonoscopy that can be registered on site include completeness
                (percentage of examinations where the coecum is reached), adenoma detection rate,
                use of sedatives and analgesics, time per colonoscopy and a patient comfort score.
                In a previous but not yet published study, one of the investigators have validated
                a patient questionnaire with more detailed information about the colonoscopy
                experience, which may also be used. Serious complications such as bleeding and
                perforation must also be noted, but are fortunately very rare. Ultimately a close
                to zero rate of missed cancers (cancers that occur from 6 to 36 months after
                colonoscopy) is an important quality indicator, but this information can only be
                obtained by searching national register data.

        2. Quality of teaching and learning

           • Determining base line technical quality of colonoscopy. In order to establish a
           baseline to inform further educational activities the investigators wish to assess all
           surgeons and nurse colonoscopists on their technical performance (Miller's level 3 and 4
           - shows how and does) and basic knowledge (Miller's level 1). The technical performance
           will be assessed in two ways. One, by performing 3 cases on the endoscopy simulator
           utilizing both the inbuilt feedback data and direct observation (with the aid of the
           DOPS assessment tool developed by The Joint Advisory Group of GI Endoscopy, Royal
           College of Physicians of Great Britain). Two, by performing two live colonoscopies being
           assessed by two faculty using the DOPS assessment tool.

           The basic knowledge will be tested by a MCQ originally developed for nurse
           colonoscopists.

           On the basis of these assessments benchmarks for novice, intermediate, proficient and
           expert will be decided.

           If possible the investigators also wish to use a novel assessment tool based on an
           automatic registration of time and movements on the scope-guide system and compare this
           with the DOPS and simulator data.

           It may also be possible to correlate the technical data with the patients' feedback.

           • Train the trainers As described in the introduction a local faculty of colonoscopy
           educators who have themselves received training as trainers, are aware of the quality of
           their own performance, and agree on the criteria for a high quality colonoscopy is a
           prerequisite for a successful training programme.

           Some of the trainers who have been key movers behind the highly successful British
           quality improvement process have agreed to teach our faculty. They already have some
           knowledge of colonoscopy training (or lack of same) in the Scandinavian countries
           through teaching courses in Oslo and in the Mid Jutland Region of Denmark.

           The course will consist of three separate days each preceded by an evening theoretical
           session. Day one will deal with basic technical aspects of colonoscopy. Day two will
           deal with polypectomy and day three with teaching aspects i.e. how to teach trainees and
           peers.

           There will be three teachers on each day for 6 participants, who will be experienced
           colonoscopists from the three surgical departments in our region.

           The course will consist mainly on hands on teaching and training, but there will also be
           a video-linked teaching session led by one of the teachers.

           The participants will be asked to register their own quality data before and after the
           course.

           The participants will function as colonoscopy supervisors for the intervention training
           programme

           • Training programme Other studies have demonstrated a marked improvement in the
           acquisition of surgical skills by a module based programme, where theoretical aspects
           and simulated skills training is delivered shortly prior to an intensive training period
           over for example 6 to 8 weeks where the trainees is scheduled to perform a high number
           of supervised similar procedures i.e. herniotomies or laparoscopic cholecystectomies.
           (CG Carlsen, PhD dissertation: Fast-track training improves surgical skills compared to
           traditional training, 2013). Intuitively this will also be effective in colonoscopy
           training.

           The investigators wish to deliver a module based colonoscopy training programme to
           surgical trainees (PGY1, 2 and 3 - Danish equivalents: introduktionsstilling,
           hoveduddannelse 1, 2). The programme will consist of a theoretical session, a two day
           simulator course aimed at basic scope handling and a number of days' clinical training.
           3 days' supervised training (supervisor present in the colonoscopy room) - approximately
           twenty colonoscopies. And 6 days' with the possibility of supervision at short notice -
           approximately 50 colonoscopies.

           The supervisors have participated in the train the trainers programme. All trainees will
           give information about prior experience with colonoscopy.

           The investigators will determine learning curves by DOPS assessment after 20 and 50
           colonoscopies and ranking in the previously agreed benchmarking framework. The
           investigators will be interested in noting if learning curves differ according to the
           trainees starting point. I.e. if a high initial score will indicate that the training
           programme is unnecessary.

        3. The patients' perspective The investigators wish to explore the patients' perception of
           colonoscopy further through the nurse assessed comfort score and by questionnaires
           dealing with aspects of communication, safety, comfort, and ultimately the patients'
           willingness to return for a repeat colonoscopy if this were deemed necessary. The
           investigators would like to see if some of these parameters correlate to the observed
           technical quality.

        4. Epidemiological data The investigators wish to collaborate with the clinical
           epidemiology service in providing retrospective data about missed cancers (colorectal
           cancers diagnosed from 6 to 36 months after colonoscopy) and serious adverse events,
           readmissions and death.
