      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, single-dose, sequential-cohort study in
      subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, classified according to the Child-Pugh
      system, who will be matched with normal healthy subjects as controls. The study will be
      conducted in two phases: Pretreatment and Treatment. The Pretreatment Phase will have two
      periods: Screening and Baseline. The study will enroll a sufficient number of subjects so
      that at least 24 subjects complete the study. This will include six subjects with mild
      hepatic impairment (Group 1), six subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Group 2), four
      to six subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Group 3), and eight subjects with normal
      hepatic function (Group 4). Potential study subjects with hepatic impairment (Groups 1, 2,
      and 3) and those with normal hepatic function (Group 4) will first be screened for study
      entry. Group 1, 2, and 3 subjects will be enrolled sequentially into the study first. The
      Group 4 normal healthy subjects will be enrolled following enrollment of all of the hepatic
      impairment subjects. Subjects determined to be eligible for the protocol will receive either
      a 5- or 10-mg single oral dose of lenvatinib on Day 1, depending on their hepatic status.
      Subjects will be discharged from the unit on Day 17 (+/- 2 days) after all study discharge
      procedures have been completed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:

          1. Male or female subjects aged 18 to 70, inclusive

          2. BMI greater than or equal to 18 to lesser than or equal to 35 kg/m2, inclusive

          3. Non-smokers and smokers who smoke no more than 10 cigarettes per day

          4. All females must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) test
             result and a negative urine pregnancy test result at Screening and Baseline. Females
             of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception
             (e.g., abstinence, an intrauterine device [IUD], a barrier method such as a condom
             plus spermicide or condom plus diaphragm with spermicide, a contraceptive implant, an
             oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)
             throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.
             The only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement are postmenopausal females
             (defined as at least 12 months' consecutive amenorrhea, in the appropriate age group,
             without other known or suspected primary cause) or subjects who have been sterilized
             surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation with
             surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with
             surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing). All women who are of reproductive potential
             and who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same
             hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue
             to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation.

          5. Male subjects who are not abstinent or have not undergone a successful vasectomy, who
             are partners of women of childbearing potential, must use, or their partners must use,
             a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., condom plus spermicide, condom plus
             diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to
             starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer
             if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug.

          6. Voluntarily provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures

          7. Are willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol for the duration of
             the study.

        Additionally, for subjects with hepatic impairment (based on the Child-Pugh classification
        system), the following key inclusion criteria will apply:

          1. Subjects must have a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis that has been stable, without any
             change in disease status, for 60 days prior to study screening, as determined by the
             investigator.

          2. Subjects must have a platelet count greater than 30,000 cells/mm3; if platelet count
             is lesser than 30,000 cells/mm3, the subject may be enrolled with joint approval of
             the principal investigator (PI) and medical monitor based on subject history and
             stability.

          3. Subjects must have no history of clinically relevant disease or condition (e.g.,
             significant cardiac or renal dysfunction, diseases of the gastrointestinal tract or
             conditions which may impact drug absorption), as determined by the investigator.

          4. Subjects must have a total score on the Child-Pugh classification system between 5 and
             6 (Group 1, mild impairment), 7 to 9 (Group 2, moderate impairment), and 10 to 15
             (Group 3, severe impairment).

          5. Subjects with a history of Type I or Type II diabetes are permissible, providing that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, they have stable disease. Subjects receiving
             insulin therapy are permissible provided that they have been on a stable treatment for
             at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment and continuing through the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in
        the study:

          1. Use of any new medication, including multi-vitamins, or an investigational drug within
             14 days prior to the drug administration, or within five times the elimination
             half-life, whichever is longest, except combined oral contraceptives and occasional
             use of paracetamol or ibuprofen within 14 days and Vitamin K supplements and thiamine
             for hepatic impairment subjects; any local anesthetic within 3 days before study drug
             administration. Current over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medication use is
             permitted, but must be stable and consistent for at least 14 days prior to screening
             and throughout the study treatment period.

          2. Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening test

          3. QTc interval calculated by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) greater than 480 ms at
             screening or baseline

          4. Presence of acute active liver disease or acute liver injury as indicated by (1) an
             abnormal liver function test, or (2) clinical and/or laboratory signs of acute, active
             hepatitis A, B, and/or C. Subjects with stable, chronic, active hepatitis B or C may
             be enrolled if the investigator deems them to be appropriate.

        Additionally normal healthy subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be
        excluded from participation in the study:

          1. Presence of clinically significant illness requiring treatment

          2. History of gastrointestinal surgery (cholecystectomy and appendectomy are, however,
             permitted)

          3. History of significant drug, food, or seasonal allergies

          4. Weight change during the Pretreatment Phase

          5. Significant findings revealed by the history, physical or clinical laboratory testing

          6. Alcohol misuse

          7. Caffeine intake within 72 hours of lenvatinib administration

          8. Participation in another clinical trial within 4 weeks of lenvatinib administration

          9. Receipt or donation of blood or blood products within 4 to 8 weeks of lenvatinib
             administration

         10. Engagement in strenuous exercise

         11. Unwillingness to abide by the study requirements, or, in the opinion of the
             investigator, unlikely to complete the study.

        Additionally subjects with hepatic impairment who meet any of the following criteria will
        be excluded from participation in the study:

          1. Subjects who have a history of hepatic transplant, systemic lupus erythematosus, or
             hepatic coma within 2 months prior to the Screening Period

          2. Subjects who are receiving or have received treatment with interferon or pegylated
             interferon within the past 60 days

          3. Subjects who have encephalopathy greater than Grade 2, sepsis, or gastrointestinal
             bleeding within 1 month before the Screening Period; esophageal varices greater than
             Grade 2, acute hepatic failure of any etiology, history of surgical portosystemic
             shunt, renal impairment (creatinine clearance lesser than 50 mL/min according to the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula), and rapidly deteriorating hepatic function indicated
             recently by clinical/laboratory signs of hepatic impairment within 2 months prior to
             the Screening Period.

          4. Subjects who have significant acute, new onset illness within 2 weeks prior to study

          5. In addition to the Key Exclusion Criteria above for all subjects, standard exclusion
             criteria for subjects with hepatic impairment in Phase 1 studies will be used. These
             include the presence of clinically significant illness requiring treatment where said
             illness is unrelated to their hepatitis, history of gastrointestinal surgery
             (cholecystectomy and appendectomy are, however, permitted); history of significant
             drug, food, or seasonal allergies; weight change during the PreTreatment Phase;
             significant findings revealed by the history, physical, or clinical laboratory testing
             where said findings are unrelated to the subject's hepatitis, alcohol misuse, or
             caffeine intake within 72 hours of E7080 administration; participation in another
             clinical trial within 4 weeks of lenvatinib administration; receipt or donation of
             blood or blood products within 4 to 8 weeks of lenvatinib administration; engagement
             in strenuous exercise; unwillingness to abide by the study requirements; or, in the
             opinion of the investigator, unlikely to complete the study.
