  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a common and fatal malignancy. It is the eighth most common incident
      cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the world. In Taiwan, esophageal cancer
      was newly diagnosed in 2199 patients and was the cause of 1507 deaths in 2011. Squamous cell
      carcinoma is the predominant histological tumor type, accounting for about 90% of the cases.
      Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive disease, characterized with
      extensive local growth and frequent metastases. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or
      without surgery is the treatment option for locally advanced ESCC. Further, target therapy is
      used in conjunction with CCRT and surgery in ESCC since several years ago. However, the
      therapeutic outcomes are not satisfactory due to the emergence of chemo-radioresistance. It
      is imperative to investigate new biomarkers and to find novel treatment targets in ESCC.

      A small population of tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) possess some
      biological functions like normal stem cells, including self-renewal, asymmetric cell
      division, slowly proliferation rate and drug-resistance. CSCs from many primary tumors and
      cell lines express specific stem cell markers, including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, CD133
      (promimin-1), Nestin, CD44 ,CD24, ALDH (Aldehyde dehydrogenase) and c-Kit. There are many
      evidences that CSCs are responsible for tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. CSCs
      are also believed to have important roles in cancer recurrence due to their resistance to
      anti-cancer drugs and radiation. CSCs express high levels of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporters. ABC transporter can pump cytotoxic drugs out of cells and is one important
      mechanism of multidrug resistance in CSCs. In addition, CSCs have high reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) scavenger expression to remove ROS produced from irradiation therapy.

      Fursultiamine (also known as thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide, TTFD) is a derivative of
      vitamin B and currently used for nutrition supplement. The investigators have identified that
      Fursultiamine suppressed OCT-4, SOX-2, NANOG expression and decreased ABCB1 and ABCG2 in
      tumor sphere of ESCC cell lines. In this project, the investigators will conduct a
      prospective phase II study to investigate the effect of Fursultiamine combined with CCRT in
      ESCC patients. Stem cell markers in clinical specimens collected before and after CCRT will
      be evaluated.
