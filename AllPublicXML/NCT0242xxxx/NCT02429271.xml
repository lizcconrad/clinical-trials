      This is a prospective randomized study, which investigates the coronary microvascular
      function as assessed by coronary angiography after administration of ticagrelor compared with
      clopidogrel in patients with myocardial infarction and ST segment elevation after
      thrombolysis.

             primary PCI lasting more than two hours

          5. Ability of transportation in 3-24 hours after thrombolysis in order to perform
             coronary angiography and PCI. This period may be extended for reasons of extreme
             importance up to 72 hours at the latest.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to give informed consent.
