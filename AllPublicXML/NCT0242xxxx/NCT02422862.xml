  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frequently, headache is associated with disorders of the cervical spine, specially on the
      upper cervical spine. Therefore, restoration of the upper cervical mobility is considered
      fundamental for the treatment of headache.

      Manual therapy interventions seek to restore upper cervical mobility through a wide range of
      therapeutic procedures, including mobilization or manipulation techniques. Previous
      systematic reviews reported preliminary evidence for the application of upper cervical manual
      therapy techniques for the management of headache.

      The objective of this study is to study the effects of upper cervical translatoric spinal
      mobilization (UC-TSM) on headache intensity, cervical mobility and pressure pain threshold in
      subjects with headache. For this purpose, the investigators will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial. Volunteers with headache will participate in the study and will be randomly
      divided into control or treatment group. Treatment group will receive UC-TSM and the control
      group will receive no treatment.

      Headache intensity, cervical mobility, temporomandibular mobility and pressure pain
      thresholds (PPT) will be measured before and immediately after each treatment session (3
      treatment sessions in one week period) and after one month follow-up. At this moment, global
      perceived effect will be assessed.

    <description>Upper cervical translatoric spinal mobilization: a 30 minutes treatment consisting of 30&quot; series of translatoric mobilizations of the upper cervical spine with 10&quot; rest between sets. For that purpose, the patient is positioned in supine, with the cervical spine in neutral position. The therapist place a hand dorsally at the level of the vertebral arch of C1 with the metacarpophalangeal and radial border of the index finger. The other hand is placed posteriorly under the occiput, with the shoulder positioned anteriorly on the patient's forehead. The mobilization force is directed dorsally from the shoulder until the therapist feel a marked resistance and then apply slightly more pressure in order to perform a stretching mobilization.</description>
