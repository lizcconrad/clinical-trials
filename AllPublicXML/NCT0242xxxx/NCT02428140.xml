      The overall aim of this trial is to determine the most cost effective approach to diagnose
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) following transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke.

      A summary of the rationale for this study is as follows:

        1. Recently completed randomized trials of cardiac monitoring following stroke have
           established that PAF is more common than previously recognized in cryptogenic stroke.

        2. The majority of TIA/stroke patients will have at least one potential stroke mechanism
           identified by the time etiologic investigations completed.

        3. Detecting PAF in patients with strokes with known causes (eg. lacunar and large vessel
           atherosclerosis) is clinically important since appropriate anticoagulation for AF
           reduces stroke recurrence in all patients with prior TIA/stroke not just cryptogenic
           strokes.

        4. There are competing technologies for evaluating cardiac rhythm and diagnosing AF but no
           cost effectiveness data

        5. The rates of PAF in strokes with known causes (SKC) have not been well characterized.

      PER-DIEM is a pilot study to compare two different cardiac monitoring technologies as first
      line investigations to detect PAF in patients with recent stroke and TIA. The study will also
      assess whether a pivotal trial is feasible and warranted.

      The principal research questions to be addressed in this study will be:

        1. What is the relative cost-effectiveness as a first line investigation of long-term
           implantable ECG (ILR) coupled with remote monitoring for 12 months compared to external
           event-triggered ECG loop recorder (ELR) for 30 days in the diagnosis clinically
           actionable AF in following TIA/stroke.

        2. What is the feasibility, patient compliance, diagnostic accuracy and rates of AF
           detection (&gt;30 seconds) of ILR compared to the ELR strategies.

          -  Diagnosis of the index event* made by a stroke specialist of an acute ischemic stroke
             or TIA occurring within the previous 90 days. The event must be either:

             atrial flutter

          -  The patient is being actively investigated for the etiology of the stroke/TIA event
             and additional cardiac monitoring is desired to screen further for the possibility of

          -  Informed consent from the patient

          -  The patient is expected to survive at least 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previously documented atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, i.e. a past history
             of atrial fibrillation/flutter or atrial fibrillation/flutter detected on ECG, Holter,
             or telemetry following the index stroke/TIA event (a remote history of transient
             perioperative atrial fibrillation is not exclusionary)

          -  Planned carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting within 90 days

          -  Any condition for which there is already an indication for long term anticoagulation
             Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator device

          -  Work-up for stroke that has already included extended (&gt;48 hour) external ECG
             (excluding telemetry)

          -  Stroke and/or comorbid illness will prevent completion of planned follow-up
             assessments
