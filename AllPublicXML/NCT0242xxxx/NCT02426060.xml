      The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Imrecoxib, an
      anti-infiammatory/analgesic agent that primarily inhibits COX-2 and not COX-1 at therapeutic
      doses, on the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile and hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin
      in healthy volunteers.

      This is a single center open label study to assess the effect of Imrecoxib on the PK of
      Warfarin in Healthy Volunteers. The goals of this study are as follows: assess the PK of
      warfarin when administered alone ,and with Imrecoxib ; assess INR of warfarin when
      administered alone, and with Imrecoxib; to assess the effect of Imrecoxib on the PK/PD of
      warfarin, to assess the safety and tolerability of warfarin administered with Imrecoxib.
