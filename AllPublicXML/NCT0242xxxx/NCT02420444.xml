    <textblock>
      70 subjects received BCG intradermally at Study Day -42, then at Study Day 0 were randomized
      to receive AERAS-404 50 mcg H4/500 nmol IC31 intramuscularly as a 3-dose (N=30) or 2-dose
      (N=30) regimen, or placebo (N=10). Subjects were vaccinated on Study Days 0, 56, and 231, and
      followed through Study Day 259.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 70 subjects who had received BCG at Study Day -42 were randomized on Study Day 0
      to receive 3 doses of placebo (N=10); 1 dose of placebo followed by 2 doses of AERAS-404
      (N=30; AERAS-404 2 dose regimen); or 3 doses of AERAS-404 (N=30; AERAS-404 3 dose regimen). A
      total of 69 (98.6%) subjects completed the study; the remaining subject, in the AERAS-404 2
      dose regimen, withdrew consent. All 70 subjects received the first and second vaccinations
      with placebo or AERAS-404 on Study Days 0 and 56, and 67 (95.7%) subjects received the third
      vaccination on Study Day 231. Three subjects did not receive the Study Day 231 vaccination (2
      in the AERAS-404 2 dose regimen, 1 due to withdrawal of consent and 1 due to pregnancy [the
      subject delivered a healthy boy without complications and was followed to study completion];
      and 1 in the AERAS-404 3 dose regimen, due to inability to discontinue daily isotretinoin
      started after the second vaccination [the subject was followed to study completion]).

         27. History or evidence of dermatologic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may have interfered with the assessment of injection site reactions.

         28. History or evidence of any other acute or chronic disease that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may have interfered with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity
             of the vaccine or compromise the safety of the subject.

         29. Medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in the opinion
