      Pediatric research in the management of nausea has been limited by the absence of a reliable
      method to quantify the intensity of this subjective symptom. In adults, the visual analog
      scale (VAS) is an accurate tool, but this has not been shown to be reliable in young
      children. By default the most common objective outcome measure used in pediatric studies has
      been the incidence and number of emetic episodes. This measure, however, correlates poorly
      with the somatic subjective symptom of nausea.

      Pediatric research in the management of nausea has been limited by the absence of a reliable
      method to quantify the intensity of this subjective symptom. In adults, the visual analog
      scale (VAS) is an accurate tool, but this has not been shown to be reliable in young
      children. By default the most common objective outcome measure used in pediatric studies has
      been the incidence and number of emetic episodes. This measure, however, correlates poorly
      with the somatic subjective symptom of nausea.

      Apfel et al have shown that 30-40% of adult patients undergoing surgery have post discharge
      nausea and / or vomiting while 12% have vomiting. These data on nausea in adults were based
      on a visual analog scale for nausea. There are no data on the incidence of postoperative
      nausea in children since the severity of symptoms are difficult to measure as younger
      children are known to be unable to use the VAS reliably.

      Recently a pictorial scale for measuring nausea, the Baxter Animated Retching Faces (BARF)
      scale, has been developed and shown to have construct, content and convergent validity as an
      instrument to measure nausea in children. The clinical usefulness of this scale in
      determining the incidence of postoperative and post-discharge nausea in children has yet to
      be determined including the lowest age where it can be used reliably, the score associated
      with a patient's perception of a need for treatment, the minimum change in the scores of
      clinical relevance and the test-retest reliability when nausea is rated as not having
      changed.

    <description>The study design is a cross sectional study of patients undergoing surgery. There will be no group assignment, no placebo group and each patient will be his or her own control. All patients will be asked to assess their pain and nausea using the visual analogue scales, the modified faces scale and the BARF scale as described below in the preoperative and postoperative areas. However, the order in which the scales are presented to the patient for assessment will be randomized to reduce the potential for an order effect where the patient choice of a response on one scale may influence the response on other scales. For example, having chosen a response two-thirds of the way up one scale, there will be a tendency to choose a response two-thirds of the way up the next scale.</description>
