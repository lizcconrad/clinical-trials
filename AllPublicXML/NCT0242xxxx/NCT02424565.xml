  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to map out changes in temperature distribution brought about
      by topical application of our test product, and use this physiological phenomenon to
      visualize the onset of action involved in overall mechanism of action of the product.

    <measure>Time to Significant Increase in Local Surface Temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Every minute from baseline to 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Local surface temperature was measured by the spectral order of colour after application of product. Infra-red camera was used to take 11 images with one just before application of product and remaining 10 images at every minute for first 10 minutes after application of product. IR camera converted the IR energy radiated by the body into electrical impulses, which were then digitally indicated on a spatial temperature map. IR camera represents the temperature distribution in a so-called rainbow or spectral order of colors. The predominant colour will be determined on a 5 point scale based on Thermal Images produced using Infra-Red Thermography (IRT) technique and recorded as either Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange or Deep Orange/Red (In increasing order of temperature). There was an approximate temperature difference of 0.5°C between adjacent colours on the map which was supposed to brought about by application of the product and considered significant.</description>

IR camera represents the temperature distribution in a so-called rainbow or spectral order of colors. The predominant colour will be determined on a 5 point scale based on Thermal Images produced using Infra-Red Thermography (IRT) technique and recorded as either Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange or Deep Orange/Red (In increasing order of temperature). There was an approximate temperature difference of 0.5°C between adjacent colours on the map which was supposed to brought about by application of the product and considered significant.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all participants of safety population with any post-treatment assessment. Since no significant increase in surface temperature was observed in subjects for either treatment, therefore, number of subjects analyzed for this outcome is zero.</population>

          <title>Time to Significant Increase in Local Surface Temperature</title>
          <description>Local surface temperature was measured by the spectral order of colour after application of product. Infra-red camera was used to take 11 images with one just before application of product and remaining 10 images at every minute for first 10 minutes after application of product. IR camera converted the IR energy radiated by the body into electrical impulses, which were then digitally indicated on a spatial temperature map. IR camera represents the temperature distribution in a so-called rainbow or spectral order of colors. The predominant colour will be determined on a 5 point scale based on Thermal Images produced using Infra-Red Thermography (IRT) technique and recorded as either Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange or Deep Orange/Red (In increasing order of temperature).
