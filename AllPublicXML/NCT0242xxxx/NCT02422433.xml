      The purpose of this research is to test the feasibility, sensitivity, and specificity of the
      marking Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) capsule for diagnosing Barrett's Esophagus
      (BE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 130 subjects scheduled to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be asked
      to swallow the OFDI capsule while being unsedated. The capsule is attached to a tether that
      allows the capsule operator to navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using
      natural propulsion called peristalsis as well as to bring it back up to pulled out of the
      mouth when the procedure is done.

      OFDI real-time images will be used for targeting of the region to be marked. Once in
      position, two cautery marks will be made to only the superficial layers of the esophageal
      mucosa. Following cautery marking, the capsule will be lowered in the esophagus and marked
      regions of interest will be reimaged for confirmation of the placement of potential cautery
      marks.

      Immediately following the completion of the experimental procedure, the standard of care with
      the performance of the surveillance endoscopy will be performed. Images obtained by the OFDI
      capsule will be compared to the images obtained by the clinical endoscopy and histology.
