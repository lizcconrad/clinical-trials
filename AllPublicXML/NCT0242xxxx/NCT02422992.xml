  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a case/control epidemiology study to identify what are the iron-metabolism
      abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and risk factors relevant to PD
      predisposition.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 342 participants, 100 PD patients and 242 age- and gender matched controls, were
      included in the study. All study participants were seen for one study visit in the morning at
      one of two Bastyr University Clinics in the Seattle area. Study participants were fasting at
      the time of the visit. During the study visit, participants donated a blood sample for the
      blood tests and complete an epidemiology questionnaire.

      A subset of 51 of the study participant who were seen for the visit at Bastyr University,
      underwent brain scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), at the University of Washington
      Department of Radiology. The MRI part of the study aims at estimating brain iron levels.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Iron metabolism differences between PD patients and controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Iron metabolism will be measured by testing for serum iron and iron-binding proteins, and by estimating brain iron by MRI. Serum iron parameters that will be measured include total serum iron, iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin, and tests related to iron metabolism: transferrin % saturation, unsaturated iron binding capacity, soluble transferrin receptor, complete blood count, hemoglobin, uric acid, haptoglobin, haptoglobin phenotype. Differences in serum iron parameters, and brain iron levels, between PD patients and controls will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Environmental factors affecting PD risk and gene-environment interactions</measure>
    <time_frame>recruitment until January 2016</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire data will be analyzed to identify risk factors for PD by comparing lifestyle and dietary patterns from questionnaire between PD cases and controls. Interaction between haptoglobin phenotype and tobacco smoking on PD risk will be calculated, as well as interaction between haptoglobin phenotype and environmental factors such as tobacco smoking and diet on serum iron and brain iron levels.</description>

        Parkinson's disease patients will be included in the study if they received a diagnosis of
        Parkinson's disease that meets the United Kingdom Brain Bank (UKBB) clinical criteria of
        Parkinson's disease diagnosis.

        Control participants will be included in the study if free of neurodegenerative diseases.

        A subset of the study participants (60 total) receive Magnetic Resonance Imaging to
