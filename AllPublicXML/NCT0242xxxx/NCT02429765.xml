  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have documented poor sleep quality and troublesome symptoms
      (breathlessness, cough and sputum production) upon awakening in patients with COPD. However,
      the investigators know very little about measurements of respiratory mechanics (i.e., lung
      volumes, respiratory pressures, diaphragm function, etc) during sleep in these patients. The
      investigators also know little about how modern bronchodilator therapies, or the timing of
      when they are taken, affect respiratory mechanics during sleep or the severity of early
      morning respiratory symptoms. COPD is often treated with inhaled bronchodilator medications
      which are used to open up airways and make it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs.
      The investigators are studying the effects of a new inhaler that contains two different types
      of long-acting bronchodilator: formoterol [a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA)] and aclidinium
      bromide [a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or anticholinergic]. Initial studies have
      shown that this combination therapy taken twice daily can improve some lung function
      measurements and respiratory symptoms in patients with moderate to severe COPD. There are
      also reports that evening administration of this medication may provide important advantages
      in patients with dominant nighttime and early morning symptoms. It is thought that sustained
      bronchodilation and lung deflation during the night may improve respiratory mechanics,
      diaphragmatic function, pulmonary gas exchange, sleep quality, and reduce severity of morning
      symptoms. This study will be the first to explore the effects of a nighttime dose of
      aclidinium/formoterol combination therapy on detailed measurements of respiratory mechanics
      and early morning symptoms in COPD. This study will also give us a better understanding of
      the mechanisms of early morning respiratory symptoms and their improvement with
      bronchodilators.

      STUDY DESIGN: This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study where patients
      will receive an evening dose of either aclidinium/formoterol (ACL/FOR) or placebo after
      steady-state conditions on twice-daily ACL/FOR have been established. Patients will continue
      to take the same dosage of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as they did prior to study entry.
      Subjects will complete 4 visits as part of the study, with a fifth follow-up visit if
      required to ensure return to pre-study health status. After an initial screening visit (Visit
      1) to confirm eligibility and a 1-week run-in period on stable triple therapy [long-acting
      beta2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS) + long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)],
      subjects will complete baseline testing (Visit 2) which includes: full pulmonary function
      tests, sleep/symptom questionnaires, and polysomnography which will include periodic
      measurements of overnight spirometry (sitting and supine). Subjects will then receive 2-week
      treatment with twice-daily ACL/FOR and continue on the same ICS as during the baseline
      run-in. Once stability on treatment with ACL/FOR and ICS is established, there will be two
      overnight treatment visits (Visits 3 and 4), conducted 3-7 days apart to allow for return to
      normal sleep status between. For these visits, the evening dose of ACL/FOR versus placebo
      will be randomized to treatment order. Treatment visits will be similar to visit 2 but will
      include overnight measurements of respiratory mechanics (diaphragm electromyography and
      respiratory pressures). Short-acting bronchodilators will be withheld for at least 8 hours
      prior to visits.

      SAMPLE SIZE: This is an exploratory physiological study with the primary outcome being an
      improvement in morning pre-dose trough inspiratory capacity (IC) by 200 ml. A sample size of
      20 will provide at least 80% to detect this treatment difference based on a standard
      deviation (SD) of approximately 0.2 L for a response difference in trough IC (vanNoord,
      2006), a two-tailed test and a p&lt;0.05. The investigators anticipate that all patients will
      not consent to instrumentation; however, the investigators are hoping for n=12 with
      respiratory mechanical measurements. Due to the complexity of the study and its measurements,
      an interim analysis will be conducted after 10 subjects have been completed.
