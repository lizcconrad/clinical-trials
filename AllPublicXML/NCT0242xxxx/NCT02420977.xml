  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if an investigational radioactive imaging agent
      (radiotracer) called 18F-DCFPyL can help us find prostate cancer at its original site in the
      prostate gland and in distant sites (bone, lymph nodes) in men diagnosed with prostate cancer
      before surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of using a novel small molecule PET
      radiotracer, DCFPyL to target prostate cancer prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA
      is a well studied cell surface marker of prostate cancer with increased expression associated
      with higher tumor grade and advanced metastatic tumors. More specifically it is associated
      with a higher Gleason score and there is evidence it can serve as a potential marker for
      prostate tumor carcinogenesis, progression and as a AR signaling surrogate marker of ADT
      response. This small molecule PET radiotracer specifically targeting an important prostate
      specific marker of AR signaling dynamics following ADT, tumor progression and metastatic
      potential warrants validation as an in-vivo non-invasive imaging biomarker for PSMA
      expression and prostate cancer detection.
