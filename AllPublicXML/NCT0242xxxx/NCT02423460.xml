  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The daily requirement of threonine, an essential amino acid, will be evaluated in healthy
      adult males and in adult males with Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis using the indicator
      amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method. Participants will consume specially formulated diets with
      varying levels of threonine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Threonine is an essential amino acid which must be obtained from the diet. It is a component
      of mucin. Mucin, in turn, is a key protein in the mucous membrane that protects the lining of
      the intestine.

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions that affect the colon
      and small intestine. IBD primarily includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
      In UC, the inflammation is usually in the colon whereas in CD inflammation may occur anywhere
      along the digestive tract. Studies in animals have shown that more threonine is used when
      there is inflammation in the intestine.

      The threonine requirement in healthy participants and in IBD patients will be determined
      using the indicator amino acid oxidation method. The requirement derived in healthy
      participants will be compared to that derived in patients with IBD.

      Each participant will take part in two x 3 day study periods. The first two days are called
      adaptation days where the subjects will consume a liquid diet specially designed for him. The
      diet will be consumed at home. It contains all vitamins, minerals, protein and all other
      nutrients required. On the third day, the participant will come to the Hospital for Sick
      Children in Toronto. Subjects will consume hourly meals for a total of 8 meals and a stable
      isotope 13C-phenylalanine. Breath and urine samples will be collected to measure the
      oxidation of phenylalanine from which the threonine requirement will be determined.
