  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous experience with antibody therapy in both NHL and CLL warrants further exploration of
      new antibody treatments for these diseases.

      Immunomedics has developed hLL1 (previously designated EPB-1), which is a CDR-grafted, fully
      humanized monoclonal antibody specifically targeting CD74.38 The human IgG1 backbone for hLL1
      is the same as hLL2 (epratuzumab), a monoclonal antibody whose safety has been demonstrated
      in clinical trials of patients with B-cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, study conducted in patients with recurrent non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have progressed after at least one
      prior standard treatment. All patients will receive hLL1 administered intravenously once
      daily Monday through Friday of each of 2 consecutive weeks (10 total doses.) Patients will be
      assigned to a cohort for hLL1 treatment dose assignment (escalating doses of hLL1 per
      statistical plan) in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for this
      administration schedule.
