  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is an acquired, symmetric, irregular hypermelanosis on sun-exposed areas of the face,
      commonly seen in Latin American women. It is a very frequent disease, although its true
      incidence is unknown.

      Melasma has historically been difficult to treat and therapy remains a challenge for this
      chronic condition.

      Melasma being a relapsing disease, there is a real need to address how to maintain efficacy
      achieved after acute treatment. A previous 12-month trial has shown that Tri-Luma® applied
      once daily over a long-term period is safe and tolerable. However, there are no robust data
      available either on the efficacy of Tri-Luma® in long-term treatment or guidance for a
      maintenance dosage regimen with this product.

      Investigations have been made through a feasibility work among Dermatologists from USA and
      Latin America to assess their current practice in terms of Maintenance Therapy. Two regimens
      appear to be prescribed frequently and will be compared in this study.

      The expectation is that Tri-Luma® will be effective, in one of the two regimens explored, in
      maintaining the Melasma improvement achieved with a previous treatment of Tri-Luma®.
