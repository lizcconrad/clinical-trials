    <textblock>
      Standard treatment of patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction consist
      of acute re-opening of the occluded coronary artery (primary PCI). Despite successful
      treatment of the epicardial vessel reperfusion is sometimes inadequate leading to large final
      infarct sizes. This phenomenon is known as the reperfusion injury. Several animal studies
      have indicated that graded re-opening of the artery may limit tissue damage. Generally this
      is referred to as mechanical postconditioning.

      The study investigates the effect on final infarct size evaluated by magnetic resonance scan
      of postconditioning of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions. Mechanical
      postconditioning is performed by means of several balloon inflations in the injured vessel
      following its acute re-opening.
