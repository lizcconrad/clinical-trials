  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of single intravenous
      (through a vein) doses of trodusquemine. Different amounts of trodusquemine will be given to
      each volunteer group throughout the study. Another purpose is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK - the study of the way the drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues
      over time) of trodusquemine. Finally, this study will also determine whether trodusquemine
      has any effect on appetite, mood or behavior, and selective biomarkers (substances in your
      blood that may change in response to the study drug).
