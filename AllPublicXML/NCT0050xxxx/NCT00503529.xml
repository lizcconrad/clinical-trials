      The purpose of this study is to assess:

        -  TBE antibody persistence 24, 34, 46 and 58 months (as applicable) after the first
           booster TBE vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml given in Study 223, by means of ELISA
           (IMMUNOZYM FSME IgG) and Neutralization test (NT),

        -  TBE antibody response to a second booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml in the
           present study, by means of ELISA and NT,

        -  Safety of FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml after the second booster vaccination.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who participated in Study 223 will be eligible for participation in this
             study if:

          -  they understand the nature of the study, agree to its provisions and provide written
             informed consent

          -  they received the first booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml during the course of
             study 223

          -  blood was drawn after their first booster vaccination in Study 223.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they:

          -  received any TBE vaccination since their first booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN
             0.5ml

          -  have a history of infection with or vaccination against other flaviviruses (e.g.
             dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese B-encephalitis) since their first booster
             vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml

          -  are known to be HIV positive (a special HIV test is not required for the purpose of
             the study) since their first booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml

          -  have a known or suspected problem with drug or alcohol abuse (&gt; 4 liters wine / week
             or equivalent level of other alcoholic beverages).

        Subjects will not be eligible for booster vaccination if they:

          -  are not clinically healthy, (i. e. the physician would have reservations vaccinating
             with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml outside the scope of a clinical trial)

          -  suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment
             (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence immunological
             functions

          -  are females of childbearing potential and are pregnant or breastfeeding before the
             booster vaccination (positive pregnancy test result at the medical examination before
             the booster vaccination)

          -  have shown an allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine since their
             first booster vaccination in Study 223

          -  are simultaneously participating in another clinical trial including administration of
             an investigational product within six weeks prior to the booster vaccination until the
             end of the study

          -  do not agree to keep a Subject Diary.

          -  Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria, but have a febrile illness (body
             temperature &gt;= 38.0Â°C, measured orally) at the scheduled time of vaccination, will not
             be vaccinated until their body temperature returns to normal.

          -  Subjects who have been administered any vaccination within 2 weeks prior to the
             booster vaccination will not be vaccinated until an interval of two weeks has passed.

          -  If subjects have received antipyretics within 4 hours prior to the scheduled time of
             vaccination, the vaccination should be performed at a later time.

          -  If a subject had a tick-bite within 4 weeks of the scheduled booster vaccination, the
             vaccination shall be delayed such that an interval of 4 weeks has passed since the
             tick-bite in order to avoid any interference with diagnostic assays in the event of a
             TBE infection.

          -  If a subject has donated blood or plasma or has received a blood transfusion or
             immunoglobulins within 4 weeks of the scheduled booster vaccination, the vaccination
             shall be delayed until an interval of 4 weeks has passed.
