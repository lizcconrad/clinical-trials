    <textblock>
      Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormone, which is necessary for many metabolic
      processes as well as the maturation of the CNS. Deficiencies of iodine have deleterious
      effects on both pregnant women and infants. The iodine status of the population after
      implementation of the universal salt iodization program in Zhejiang province has not been
      known. This study was to determine whether pregnant women show evidence of iodine deficiency,
      and to examine the correlation between maternal urine iodine concentration and newborn
      thyroid function.

      Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormone, which is necessary for many metabolic
      processes as well as the maturation of the CNS. Deficiencies of iodine have deleterious
      effects on both pregnant women and infants. The iodine status of the population after
      implementation of the universal salt iodization program in Zhejiang province has not been
      known. This study was to determine whether pregnant women show evidence of iodine deficiency,
      and to examine the correlation between maternal urine iodine concentration and newborn
      thyroid function.

      Healthy women at 12 weeks’ gestation and over from four different areas in Zhejiang province
      were enrolled to participate this program from May 2007 to May 2010. Women consented to
      provide urine samples and salt samples during pregnancy (12, 16, 24 weeks’ gestation and
      before delivery), and give permission to access their newborn’s TSH value. Urinary iodine
      concentration (UIC) was determined by ammonium persulfate digestion microplate method, and
      TSH was determined by a time resolved fluoro-immunoassay (TRFIA). The diagnostic standard for
      congenital hypothyroidism was: TSH ≥ 20 mU/L and declined FT4 levels. Compare the correlation
      to effects with different level of iodine content in salt, maternal UIC and neonatal TSH.
      Investigate the optimal level of iodine content in salt in different areas in ZheJiang
      province.
