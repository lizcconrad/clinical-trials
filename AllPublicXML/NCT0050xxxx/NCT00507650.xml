    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing extra fluid to nursing home
      residents will help prevent or heal pressure ulcers. We hypothesize that providing extra
      fluid to nursing home residents will increase their skin blood flow and oxygen to support
      healing and maintaining healthy skin. Participants are enrolled who have a pressure ulcer or
      who are at-risk for an ulcer (determined by looking at risk factors). The study is divided
      into two 10 day phases. In Phase 1, we examine participant's usual status, including fluid
      intake and baseline healing potential. In Phase 2, participants are randomly placed in groups
      to receive either their usually prescribed fluid intake or additional fluid. A study nurse
      provides the fluid to the residents. We measure their actual intake, their body water, how
      well their kidneys are working, their potential to heal, and also monitor them for the
      development of fluid overload. This study is important because it helps us understand the
      role of a basic nursing intervention in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.

    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers are prevalent in nursing homes. They heal slowly, cause pain, impair quality
      of life, and are expensive to treat. Dehydration is a problem in some nursing home residents
      and under-perfusion a problem in others. Theoretically, providing supplemental fluid to
      under-hydrated residents should increase fluid in the various fluid compartments of the body,
      increase subcutaneous oxygen, support skin integrity, enhance pressure ulcer blood flow and
      pressure ulcer healing, including collagen production. This proposition has not been examined
      in nursing home residents with pressure ulcers.

      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which subjects serve as their own
      control is to determine whether administration of supplemental fluid to nursing home
      residents with or at risk for pressure ulcers enhances collagen deposition. Specifically,
      this study will determine whether oral administration of supplemental fluid given daily for
      five days to persons with or at risk for pressure ulcers enhances collagen deposition,
      increases total body water, augments subcutaneous tissue oxygen, increases pressure ulcer
      oxygenation, and is safe.

      The sample will be nursing home residents at risk for or with pressure ulcers. After consent,
      baseline measures of collagen deposition, pressure ulcer oxygen, fluid intake, and body water
      in the various fluid compartments are measured. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)
      tubes are used to measure collagen deposition. Bioelectrical impedance is used to measure
      body water. In the treatment phase, subjects are randomized to one of the two supplemental
      fluid regimes. Supplemental fluid is administered for five days and collagen deposition,
      subcutaneous tissue oxygen, pressure ulcer oxygen, and body water in the various compartments
      again measured. Subjects are monitored for fluid overload. Data are analyzed with RMANOVA and
      logistic regression techniques.
