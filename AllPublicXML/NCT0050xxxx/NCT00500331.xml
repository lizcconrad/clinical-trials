    <measure>Change From Baseline (Week 0) in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) (%) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fasted blood samples for HbA1c were collected at Baseline and Week 12. Participants were required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to laboratory samples and were told not to take the morning dose of study medication on these visit days and to refrain from eating until instructed to do so by study personnel in the clinic. When the participant had not fasted, the participant was rescheduled to return to the clinic to have a fasted sample taken. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values. Only those participants with a value at Baseline and at Week 12 (after Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]) were used for this analysis. Adjusted mean is presented as least square mean.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With On-therapy Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With On-therapy Hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycemia is low blood glucose or low blood sugar. Hypoglycemic events were collected separately and reported separately from AE, including supplemental data which were not collected for AE. However, any hypoglycemic event which met the criteria for a SAE was included in the SAE summaries. The number of participants in each group that experienced a hypoglycemic event was summarized by frequency of the events.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline Vital Signs of Potential Clinical Concern</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs included heart rate and blood pressure. Heart rate and blood pressure were taken before blood draws were performed. Participants were asked to refrain from smoking for at least 30 minutes prior to vital sign measurements. Heart rate and blood pressure was measured pre-dose in duplicate at the specified visits, after the participant had been lying quietly for 5 minutes, and then in duplicate 3 minutes after standing up. Heart rate was measured at the same time as blood pressure using the standardized blood pressure equipment that was provided. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Electrocardiogram (ECG) Values of Potential Clinical Concern</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Early withdrawal (Between Week 12 and Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Full 12-lead ECGs were recorded at screening, Baseline (Week 0), Week 4, Week 12 or early withdrawal, and Week 14 (Follow-up) using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured the PR, QRS, QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals. All 12-lead ECGs were read locally by the Investigator or his/her designate and were forwarded electronically to the central reader for interpretation. If the QTc was &gt;500 milliseconds (msec) on the locally read ECG recording, an additional 2 ECG recordings at 10 minute intervals were made at that visit. If the average QTc for the 3 recordings was &gt;500 msec, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Standard Laboratory Parameters of Potential Clinical Concern</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were instructed to fast for at least 8 hours prior to all study visits for the collection of laboratory samples. An additional fasting blood sample (serum and plasma) was drawn at Week 0, Week 4, Week 6 and Week 12 or at early withdrawal (up to 14 weeks) and kept in long-term storage for future testing of biomarkers for diabetes and complications of the disease. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Week 0) in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) (%) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Fasted blood samples for HbA1c were collected at Baseline and Week 12. Participants were required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to laboratory samples and were told not to take the morning dose of study medication on these visit days and to refrain from eating until instructed to do so by study personnel in the clinic. When the participant had not fasted, the participant was rescheduled to return to the clinic to have a fasted sample taken. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values. Only those participants with a value at Baseline and at Week 12 (after Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]) were used for this analysis.

          <description>Fasted blood samples for HbA1c were collected at Baseline and Week 12. Participants were required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to laboratory samples and were told not to take the morning dose of study medication on these visit days and to refrain from eating until instructed to do so by study personnel in the clinic. When the participant had not fasted, the participant was rescheduled to return to the clinic to have a fasted sample taken. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values. Only those participants with a value at Baseline and at Week 12 (after Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]) were used for this analysis.

          <description>Fasted blood samples for HbA1c were collected at Baseline and Weeks 4 and 8. Participants were required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to laboratory samples and were told not to take the morning dose of study medication on these visit days and to refrain from eating until instructed to do so by study personnel in the clinic. When the participant had not fasted, the participant was rescheduled to return to the clinic to have a fasted sample taken. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Fasting Insulin</title>
        <description>Fasted blood samples for insulin were collected up to Week 12. Participants were required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to laboratory samples and were told not to take the morning dose of study medication on these visit days and to refrain from eating until instructed to do so by study personnel in the clinic. When the participant had not fasted, the participant was rescheduled to return to the clinic to have a fasted sample taken. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <description>Fasted samples for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG were collected at Week 12. When the participant had not fasted, the participant was rescheduled to return to the clinic to have a fasted sample taken. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.

        <title>Change From Baseline in 24-hour Percent of Filtered Glucose Excreted in Urine</title>
        <description>A 24-hour urine collection was obtained from all participants at Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12 to measure glucose. Participants were provided with urine collection bottles and cooler prior to these visits and instructed that the urine collections must be kept cold and dropped off at the clinic prior to or at the scheduled visits. Site staff queried participants to determine whether the sample represented a full 24-hour collection. The total volume and the sample date and time were recorded. The entire 24-hour urine collection was well mixed in one container and a urine aliquot obtained. Samples were assayed for glucose. The 24-hour collections were used to derive 24-hour urine glucose excretion corrected for filtered load. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Plasma Glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC) During a 2-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)</title>
        <description>Post-prandial assessments of glucose were performed at Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 12 using a 2-hour OGTT in a subgroup of participants at selected sites who agreed to participate. Participants were required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to the test. Seventy-five (75) g of standard oral glucose solution was administered 15 minutes after the morning administration of study medication (Week 12) and in the place of breakfast at Week 0 (i.e., at Week 0 the OGTT was completed prior to administration of study medication). Time “0” started when the participants drank the glucose solution. Blood samples were collected at the following times relative to the administration of oral glucose: -30 min (pre-glucose), -20 min (pre-glucose), 20 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 1.5 hour and 2 hour post glucose administration. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Plasma Glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC) During a 2-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)</title>
          <description>Post-prandial assessments of glucose were performed at Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 12 using a 2-hour OGTT in a subgroup of participants at selected sites who agreed to participate. Participants were required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to the test. Seventy-five (75) g of standard oral glucose solution was administered 15 minutes after the morning administration of study medication (Week 12) and in the place of breakfast at Week 0 (i.e., at Week 0 the OGTT was completed prior to administration of study medication). Time “0” started when the participants drank the glucose solution. Blood samples were collected at the following times relative to the administration of oral glucose: -30 min (pre-glucose), -20 min (pre-glucose), 20 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 1.5 hour and 2 hour post glucose administration. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With On-therapy Hypoglycemia</title>
        <description>Hypoglycemia is low blood glucose or low blood sugar. Hypoglycemic events were collected separately and reported separately from AE, including supplemental data which were not collected for AE. However, any hypoglycemic event which met the criteria for a SAE was included in the SAE summaries. The number of participants in each group that experienced a hypoglycemic event was summarized by frequency of the events.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline Vital Signs of Potential Clinical Concern</title>
        <description>Vital signs included heart rate and blood pressure. Heart rate and blood pressure were taken before blood draws were performed. Participants were asked to refrain from smoking for at least 30 minutes prior to vital sign measurements. Heart rate and blood pressure was measured pre-dose in duplicate at the specified visits, after the participant had been lying quietly for 5 minutes, and then in duplicate 3 minutes after standing up. Heart rate was measured at the same time as blood pressure using the standardized blood pressure equipment that was provided. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <description>Full 12-lead ECGs were recorded at screening, Baseline (Week 0), Week 4, Week 12 or early withdrawal, and Week 14 (Follow-up) using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured the PR, QRS, QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals. All 12-lead ECGs were read locally by the Investigator or his/her designate and were forwarded electronically to the central reader for interpretation. If the QTc was &gt;500 milliseconds (msec) on the locally read ECG recording, an additional 2 ECG recordings at 10 minute intervals were made at that visit. If the average QTc for the 3 recordings was &gt;500 msec, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>
