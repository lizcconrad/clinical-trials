  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to look at the role of nutrition in the healing of pressure
      ulcers. The purpose of this study is to test whether the rate of healing of pressure ulcers
      is increased in those patients receiving a nutritional supplement of amino acids and the
      leucine metabolite, B-hydroxy-B-methylbutyrate is enhanced when compared to control patients
      receiving a supplement containing only one of the proteins in the experimental supplement

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have pressure ulcers Stage II or greater will be randomized to receiving one of
      two nutritional supplements. One supplement contains arginine and the other contains both
      arginine,glutamine and leucine metabolites. Pressure ulcers will be measured at study entry
      and measured biweekly using a standardized tool (PUSH) until the trial is completed or the
      pressure ulcer has healed.

      Inclusion criteria include:

        -  Stage II or greater pressure ulcer

        -  Patient consent

        -  Patients who can drink supplement or receive it by tube

        -  Patients who are 21 years old or greater

      Exclusion criteria include:

        -  Patients with infected wounds

        -  Patients with cellulitis, sepsis or osteomyelitis

        -  Patients with end-organ failure

        -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1C&gt;10)

        -  Patients who cannot tolerate oral or tube feeding

    <description>The PUSH tool measures the healing of a pressure ulcer by actually measuring the depth and width, in 2 dimensions, of a wound. A wound heals from the wound bed and closes from the inside to the outside if healthy pink granulation tissue can be seen. This tool contributes to the consistency of measurement of a healing wound.</description>
