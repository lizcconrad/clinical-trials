      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of bavituximab administered as multiple
           intravenous (IV) infusions to patients co-infected with HCV and HIV

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile and viral kinetics after multiple
           intravenous infusions of bavituximab to patients infected with HCV and HIV

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum effective dose (MED) of
           bavituximab administered as multiple infusions to patients infected with chronic HCV
           infection and HIV

          -  Absolute CD4+ &gt; 300 cells/mm3

          -  Chronic hepatitis C infection based on history and detectable serum HCV RNA

          -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) above normal limits and/or historical biopsy
             consistent with hepatitis C

             contraception or agree not to become pregnant while taking study medications and for
             30 days after study completion. Female patients must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test at prestudy (not applicable to patients with bilateral oophorectomy and/or
             hysterectomy or to those patients who are postmenopausal)

          -  Serious non-healing wound (including wound healing by secondary intention, ulcer, or
             bone fracture)

          -  Requirement for chronic daily treatment with NSAIDs, antiplatelet drugs (e.g.,
             phosphodiesterase inhibitors, adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists), or steroids

          -  Cancer, autoimmune disease or any disease or concurrent therapy known to cause
             significant alteration in immunologic function. Corticosteroids administered as
             pre-treatment, or to treat an adverse event, are allowed.
