  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive and emotional symptoms are often seen in the acute phase of a stroke. The
      prevalence of such symptoms later and the mechanisms explaining the symptoms are not fully
      known. The causes of poststroke dementia are likely to be multifactorial (Cerebrovascular
      Diseases 2006). The investigators want to include all patients with first ever stroke without
      significant cognitive decline prior to the stroke (IQCODE cut-off 3,7) and follow them up for
      one year. At baseline we will make stroke classifications, measure neurological deficits
      according to NIHSS, evaluate cognitive and emotional function and make registrations of
      vascular risk factors, including precerebral color duplex scan with measurement of IMT in
      CCA. The investigators will then randomize the patients into multifactorial
      vascular-risk-factor-intervention in the hospital or care as usual in the primary health
      care. 8-12 months after stroke onset, survivors will undergo new examinations to evaluate
      neurological, cognitive and emotional functions, as well as MRI and SPECT.
