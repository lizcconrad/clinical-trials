      Background: Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff may cause chronic pain at the shoulder.
      Sometimes the pain can lead to a serious impairment in the daily life.

      One of the most efficient treatments is percutaneous needle aspiration using ultrasound
      guidance.

      This treatment includes identification the tendonitis with US or screening , local anesthesia
      and then puncturing the calcium in the rotator cuff many times. The treatment is short 5-10
      minutes, relatively cheap ,safe and usually with good outcomes. However in the literature
      there is a lack of controlled prospective trials.

      Our goal is to set a study that will evaluate this treatment between two groups:

        1. Puncturing the calcium in the rotator cuff 15 times (the experiment group)

        2. Puncturing the calcium in the rotator cuff twice (the controlled group)
