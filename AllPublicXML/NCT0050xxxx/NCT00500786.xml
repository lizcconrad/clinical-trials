  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, time-lagged, parallel-group study in
      healthy and hypertensive subjects to evaluate safety and tolerability of the vaccine
      CYT006-AngQb. The trial is double-blind for active vs. placebo within each treatment arm, but
      open with respect to AngQb dose escalation.

      In the first arm, 16 healthy normotensive volunteers are treated with a one dose regimen
      consisting of a single s.c. injection of 100µg of AngQb or placebo. Upon satisfying safety
      and tolerability profile, as judged by the independent safety monitoring board, arm two is
      enrolled.

      In arm two 36 patients with mild to moderate hypertension receive three s.c. injections of
      100µg CYT006-AngQb (24 patients) or placebo (12 patients). The second and third injections
      are given 4 and 12 weeks after the first injection, respectively. Upon satisfying safety and
      tolerability profile, as judged by the independent safety monitoring board, arm three is
      enrolled.

      In arm three 36 patients with mild to moderate hypertension receive three s.c. injections of
      300µg CYT006-AngQb (24 patients) or placebo (12 patients). The second and third injections
      are given 4 and 12 weeks after the first injection, respectively.

      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate safety / tolerability of 3 dose regimens of
      CYT006-AngQb in healthy volunteers and patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
      Secondary objectives include the assessment of pharmacodynamic effects and their
      dose-response (immunogenicity and biomarkers of the renin-angiotensin system), and the
      exploration of clinical efficacy (effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure)
