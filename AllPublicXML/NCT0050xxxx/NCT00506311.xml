      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine whether the use of a fibrin sealant applied to superficial groin soft tissues
      following node dissection can result in decreased cumulative postoperative drainage, earlier
      drain removal, and lower incidence of seroma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the postoperative morbidity rate using fibrin sealant following superficial
           groin dissection.

        2. To assess patient-valuation of outcome by performing a cost-benefit analysis using a
           willingness-to-pay model.

        3. To determine if serum levels, lymphatic fluids level, or cutaneous expression of
           vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D), vascular endothelial growth factor-C
           (VEGF-C) or their receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3)
           correlates with nodal tumor burden or development of lymphedema in patients with
           melanoma.

      Patients in this study are scheduled to have groin dissection as part of their surgery for
      treatment of their melanoma.

      Within 2 weeks before entry into the study, patients will have a complete physical exam and
      medical history.

      These patients will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two groups.
      Patients in one group will receive TISSEEL applied externally to the dissected groin area.
      Patients in the other group will receive no fibrin sealant.

      For patients who are admitted to the hospital, the surgical site will be monitored by the
      surgeon for evidence of wound complications in the first 24 hours after surgery. At the time
      of discharge from the hospital, patients will be instructed in drain care and how to measure
      the drainage each day until the drain is removed.

      The contents of the drain will be collected from patients during the first day after surgery,
      during the first return follow-up visit to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and during drain
      removal.

      Follow-up wound exams will be performed by the local primary physician or in the M.D.
      Anderson Melanoma Clinic between 1-4 weeks and 6 weeks after surgery. Participation will be
      over after the 6-week follow-up.

      This is an investigational study. The sealant is FDA approved, though its use in this study
      is experimental. About 58 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.
      D. Anderson.
