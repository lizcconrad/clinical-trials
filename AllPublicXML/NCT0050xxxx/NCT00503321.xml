  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study is conducted on unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma and
      recurrent gastric carcinoma to compare TS-1 therapy with TS-1 + PSK therapy. The primary
      endpoint of this study is progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints of
      anticancer effect, time to treatment failure (TTF), QOL (FACT-BRM), compliance, adverse drug
      reactions and immunological factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tegafur / gimeracil / oteracil potassium (TS-1) is widely used as a first-line drug for
      unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma and recurrent gastric carcinoma in Japan and the
      response rate of TS-1 against gastric carcinoma was reported to be excellent at 46.5% in a
      phase II study. However, since adverse drug reactions tend to occur in patients treated with
      standard regimen of TS-1, drug reduction or discontinuation is often required, which is one
      drawback of this drug. On the other hand, although Krestin (PSK) has been reported to show
      survival effects in postoperative immunochemotherapy against gastric carcinoma, the efficacy
      of PSK has not been established in patients with unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma and
      recurrent gastric carcinoma. Since the main effect of PSK was to recover physiological
      functions, including immune function of the host, it was expected that PSK would improve the
      compliance of TS-1 by alleviating adverse drug reactions of TS-1 therapy and the concomitant
      use of TS-1 with PSK would result in the improvement of treatment results. Therefore, we
      decided to conduct a randomized phase II study on patients with unresectable advanced gastric
      carcinoma and recurrent gastric carcinoma to compare TS-1 therapy with TS-1+PSK therapy.

          -  Patients with unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma and recurrent gastric carcinoma.

          -  Patients who are 20 years old or older at the time of obtaining consent.

          -  Patients who have not received prior treatment, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy
             and immunotherapy, before the start of treatment (however, patients are excluded when
             six months or more have passed since they received postoperative adjuvant
             chemotherapy.)

             marrow function and who maintain the major organ functions which meet all requirements
             as described below (laboratory values are values measured before the start of protocol
             treatment and should be updated ones which are measured within two weeks before
             protocol treatment is started.) WBC counts: &gt;= 3,000 /mm3 and &lt; 12,000 /mm3 Neutrophil
