    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nighttime positioning
      hand splint in patients with RA in terms of pain, grip and pinch strength, upper limb
      function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. The hypothesis is that the stabilization
      of hand during nighttime could decrease pain and consequently improve quality of life.

      The involvment of wrist and fingers is very common in RA and it could affect hand function
      and, consequently, affect activities of daily living (ADL). Some authors suggest that the
      rest of hand could decrease pain and inflammation. Splints are external appliances that used
      in a specific body part provides the best alignment and rest in correct functional position.
      The goal of a hand, fingers and thumb in RA is stabilize the hand while the patients are not
      making theirs ADL and try to decrease the pain.
