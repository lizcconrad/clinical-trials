      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of ceftobiprole versus a
      comparator in hospitalized patients with bacteremia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ceftobiprole medocaril is a cephalosporin antibiotic with anti-MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus) activity. Ceftobiprole medocaril in not approved for the treatment of
      bacterial blood stream infections. S. aureus is a major human pathogen. It causes a wide
      range of serious infections, including skin and skin structure infections, infections of
      vascular devices and catheters, and infections of the heart and lungs, bones and joints, and
      deep tissues. Particularly challenging and difficult to treat are blood-borne infections
      (bacteremia). Bacteremic infections are prone to relapse and they are often complicated by
      metastatic seeding of sites throughout the body. MRSA strains are increasing in prevalence,
      incidence, and virulence. Moreover, the frequency of patients presenting with persistent MRSA
      bacteremia appears to be rising. The objective of the open label trial is to compare the
      effectiveness and safety of ceftobiprole versus a comparator in patients with MRSA and MSSA
      (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus) in bacteremic patients. Patients who meet
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study will be randomly
      assigned to either ceftobiprole or comparator. The primary end point is time to bloodstream
      clearance of MRSA and MSSA in patients. Patients will be randomized to either ceftobiprole or
      comparator for 7 days.
