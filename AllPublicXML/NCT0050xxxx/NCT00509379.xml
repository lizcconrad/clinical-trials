  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The promising activity of Bortezomib as single agent in low grade lymphoma patients in small
      studies has led to a number of larger multicenter trials with Bortezomib in combination with
      Rituximab in mantle-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a open label, non randomized, phase II , multicenter, prospective trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of the combination of bortezomib and rituximab in patients with
      relapsed or refractory rituximab naïve or sensitive indolent non-follicular and mantle cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite of the availability of treatment for this disease, this study
      is justified because no known therapies are really curative and it is necessary to look for
      new treatment options to improve the clinical outcome and prognosis of relapsed indolent
      lymphoma. This study is designed for patients not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and
      autologous stem cells transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with naïve or sensitive rituximab indolent non-follicular and mantle cell
             non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma disease that had failed to respond or relapsed after primary
             therapy. There is a demonstrated progressive disease requiring further treatment.
             Histological subtype included into the study are are as follows Small
             lymphocytic/lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma; Nodal marginal zone Lymphoma (MALT lymphoma
             are excluded) Splenic marginal zone lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma A lymphnode biopsy
             is advisable if it is not harmful for the patients, before enrollment of the patient
             into the study in order to confirm diagnosis and to rule out histologic
             transformation. Lymphnode biopsy should be performed within 6 months before study
             entry.
