    <textblock>
      This is a phase-I, double-blind, randomized study with hLF1-11 to study the tolerability and
      early efficacy of hLF1-11 compared to standard fluconazole therapy in hospitalized patients
      with invasive Candida infection.

      RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY

      Choice of Drug

      Fluconazole is considered &quot;standard care&quot; for the treatment of Candida infections, including
      candidaemia in hospitalized patients.

      Preclinical data has demonstrated that hLF1-11 possesses potent antimycotic effects against
      Candida sp and, importantly, to be synergistic with fluconazole, whereby Candida strains that
      are fluconazole-resistant become sensitive through the addition of hLF1-11

      Choice of Patient Population

      Based on preclinical data hLF1-11 has been shown to possess potent effects on Candida
      albicans models in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, candidaemia (bloodstream Candida
      infection) is one of the most likely settings to elicit a therapeutic response since the
      product is presented as an intravenous formulation

      As previously mentioned, fluconazole and hLF1-11 exhibit a synergistic effect in preclinical
      studies, whereby the effect of fluconazole is enhanced by the addition of hLF1-11.

             have started such administration within 48 hours prior to entry.

          -  Patients who have hepatic and renal parameters within 2X ULN (upper level of
             normality) at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to fluconazole or hLF1-11.
