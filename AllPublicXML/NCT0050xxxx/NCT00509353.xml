      RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIGB), may carry
      radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as irinotecan and vincristine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving iodine I 131 MIGB
      together with irinotecan and vincristine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 MIGB
      when given together with irinotecan and vincristine in treating young patients with resistant
      or relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
           when given in combination with fixed-dose irinotecan hydrochloride and vincristine in
           young patients with refractory or relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine when
           combined with fixed-dose irinotecan hydrochloride and vincristine.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if there is a therapeutic response to this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
      (^131I-MIBG).

      Patients receive ^131I-MIBG IV over 1½-2 hours on day 1, vincristine IV on days 0 and 7, and
      irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 0-4 and 7-11. Treatment repeats every 56 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.
