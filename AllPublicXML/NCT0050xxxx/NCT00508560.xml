    <textblock>
      This study examines the use of contingent incentives to increase attendance at smoking
      cessation treatment sessions by smokers with schizophrenia and other psychoses who want to
      quit smoking. We hypothesize that participants randomized to receive contingent rewards for
      group attendance will attend more treatment sessions than those in the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are highly prevalent in the VA population and are
      associated with high rates of smoking. Although smoking cessations approaches that work for
      non-schizophrenic patients such as behavioral counseling and medications appear to be
      efficacious for schizophrenic smokers, a major obstacle in providing adequate treatment is
      poor attendance at treatment sessions. Contingency management has been shown to shape
      treatment behavior in non-schizophrenic smokers and to shape other behaviors such as cocaine
      use and exercise in schizophrenics.

      The intention of this project is to examine the use of contingent incentives to increase
      attendance at smoking cessation treatment sessions by smokers with schizophrenia and other
      psychoses and to compare two different approaches to providing contingent incentives in this
      context. Subjects in the experimental condition draw from a fishbowl to obtain tokens when
      they attend a smoking cessation treatment session. The number of draws will be based upon
      attendance at consecutive sessions. Subjects in the experimental condition receive a set
      reward that will not change regardless of attendance at consecutive sessions. We hypothesize
      that the participants in the experimental condition will attend more smoking cessation group
      therapy sessions than those in the control condition because they will have the possibility,
      although not the likelihood, to obtain contingent reinforcement of greater value.
