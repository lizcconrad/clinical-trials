      The purpose of this study is to examine the the effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
      Rosuvastatin on left ventricular remodeling in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

      -  Chronic heart failure (HF) is one of the most important public health problems in
           cardiovascular medicine.

        -  Idioatic dilated cardiomyopathy (CMP) represents the final common expression of primary
           myocardial damage produced by a variety of as yet undefined myocardial insults,
           producing areas of interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, particularly of the left
           ventricle. Chronic HF, including CMP, is a progressive disease with high morbidity and
           mortality, suggesting that important pathogenic mechanisms remain active and unmodified
           by the present treatment modalities. The presence of chronic inflammation in patients
           with chronic heart failure has been widely recognized and coupled with persistent immune
           activation may represent such unmodified mechanisms.

      The effect of statin therapy on lipids are well known, but recent studies suggest that the
      beneficial effects of statins also may be related to their anti-inflammatory properties.

      To further elucidate this issue we want to study the potent new statin Rosuvastatin on
      myocardial function and remodeling and their relation to inflammatory markers in patients
      with IDCM. As hyperlipidemia is not involved in the pathogenesis of IDCM, as opposed to HF
      secondary to CAD, such studies will also be an interesting approach in separating the lipid
      lowering from other effects of these medications in HF.
