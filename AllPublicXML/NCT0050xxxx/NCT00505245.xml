  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try to learn more about common symptoms that may occur in
      patients due to cancer and its treatment. We also want to learn more about the impact of
      symptoms on your quality of life. Another goal is to learn how to better measure symptoms
      systematically when caring for patients.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 5,500 participants will participate in this
      multicenter study. Up to 5,000 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      You may be asked to provide some personal information. You will also be asked to complete
      surveys that measure your mood and quality of life. You will be asked to complete one or more
      symptom surveys. Completing these surveys takes 10-25 minutes.

      In order to understand symptoms that are specific to a particular cancer, cancer stage, or
      treatment, the research staff may ask you questions about symptoms you have had since you
      were diagnosed. The interviewer may ask follow-up questions to get more complete information
      about your symptoms. Interviews are digitally recorded and then transcribed (written out in
      text) later. Completing the interview along with other surveys takes about 45 minutes total.

      During your treatment, you may be asked to complete the symptom survey using the paper and
      pencil method, or a secure electronic method, or you may be asked to complete it over the
      telephone. If you are asked to use the phone method, we will use an interactive voice
      response (IVR) telephone system to contact you to find out about symptoms you may be
      experiencing. The research study staff will ask you for a convenient time for the system to
      call.

      How often the system will call you during your treatment depends on the type of treatment you
      are receiving. The research study staff will give you more information about the schedule of
      calls to expect for the study and the times you will be asked to complete the mood and
      quality of life surveys over the course of your treatment.

      Information about your symptoms in this study is collected for research purposes only. If you
      are experiencing severe or troublesome symptoms, you should report them to your doctor or
      nurse as well as rating them on the symptom assessment questionnaire. If the data collector
      notices that you have rated a symptom as severe, the data collector will ask you if your
      doctor or nurse is aware of the symptom or if you intend to report the symptom to your doctor
      or nurse. If you have not or do not intend to report the symptom, the data collector will let
      you know that he or she will report the symptom to your doctor or nurse.
