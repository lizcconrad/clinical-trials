      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether thermal imaging (recording
      body temperature) can be used to check the body's response to cancer therapy.

      Primary Objective:

        -  The primary objective of this study is to establish techniques and methodologies of
           quantifying thermal signatures and their changes for cancer patients undergoing
           chemoradiation therapy.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  The secondary objective is to evaluate correspondence between changes of thermal
           signature of a normal organ, e.g. lung or esophagus, versus the toxicity of that organ
           from chemoradiation therapy.

      For Patients:

      THERMAL IMAGER:

      A thermal imager (a camera similar to a digital camera) takes pictures of skin surfaces. The
      imager is able to view temperature distribution of the skin surface.

      STUDY PARTICIPATION:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your body temperature will be measured with thermal
      imaging.

      You will have thermal imaging sessions several times before the cancer treatment starts and
      during the therapy course. You will be given detailed instructions on how to prepare for the
      imaging sessions ahead of time as well as what to expect during the imaging sessions.

      Before beginning thermal imaging, your temperature will be measured with a thermometer. To
      perform thermal imaging, you will be asked to take off all of your clothes in a private room
      and stand still in front of a thermal imaging camera. No one will be present while you
      disrobe. When you have finished taking off your clothes a radiation oncologist or other
      medical doctor will record several pictures from a computer stationed outside the room.
      Pictures of your front, back, and side views will be taken. These pictures will look like a
      silhouette (body outline) with thermal coloring. The entire imaging session should take about
      10 minutes to complete each time.

      LENGTH OF STUDY:

      Your participation will be over in this study after the thermal images have been recorded.

      This is an investigational study. Thermal imaging is FDA approved and commercially available
      for breast cancer screening. Its use in this study is investigational. Up to 35 patients will
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

      For Volunteers:

      THERMAL IMAGER:

      A thermal imager (a camera similar to a digital camera) takes pictures of skin surfaces. The
      imager is able to view temperature distribution of the skin surface.

      STUDY PARTICIPATION:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your body temperature will be measured with thermal
      imaging.

      You will have thermal imaging sessions several times during the course of this study. You
      will be given detailed instructions on how to prepare for the imaging sessions ahead of time
      as well as what to expect during the imaging sessions.

      Before beginning thermal imaging, your temperature will be measured with a thermometer. To
      perform thermal imaging, you will be asked to take off all of your clothes in a private room
      and stand still in front of a thermal imaging camera. No one will be present while you
      disrobe. When you have finished taking off your clothes a radiation oncologist or other
      medical doctor will record several pictures from a computer stationed outside the room.
      Pictures of your front, back, and side views will be taken. These pictures will look like a
      silhouette (body outline) with thermal coloring. The entire imaging session should take about
      10 minutes to complete each time.

      Volunteers will not participate in any part of cancer treatment, diagnostic imaging tests
      (CT, PET, etc), or any other clinical procedures in MD Anderson. Volunteers will not need to
      see physicians at MD Anderson or elsewhere. Thermal images will be taken 4 times during one
      day for a volunteer (morning, midmorning, earlier afternoon, late afternoon). Volunteers
      should not take any medications or perform any other medical procedures from morning to late
      afternoon until the thermal imaging is completed.

      LENGTH OF STUDY:

      Your participation will be over in this study after the thermal images have been recorded.

      This is an investigational study. Thermal imaging is FDA approved and commercially available
      for breast cancer screening. Its use in this study is investigational. Up to 10 volunteers
      without cancer (5 males and 5 non-pregnant females) will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

    <time_frame>Imaging session takes about 10 minutes to complete each time, imaging beginning at baseline and continuing till 12 months post therapy, up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body temperature at the time of the thermal imaging taken using a commercial infrared camera; thermal imaging sessions several times before the cancer treatment starts, during and after the radiotherapy courses. Using thermal images taken from multiple sessions, both the absolute and relative changes of the temperature distribution will be calculated and analyzed. The location of the regions will be guided by the diagnostic computed tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT images for temperatures at multiple angles of body, site of radiation for skin reaction, primary cancer site and critical normal organs.</description>
