  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the safety of MabThera plus methotrexate in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis who have had a lack of response to 1-5 DMARDs or biological agents.
      Patients will receive MabThera (1g i.v.) on days 1 and 15, concomitantly with methotrexate
      &gt;=15mg p.o./week. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target
      sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <description>An Adverse event (AE) was considered any unfavorable medical event in a participant of clinical research who received the study drug and that not necessarily had a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could, therefore, being any unfavorable sign and non-intentional, symptom or disease temporarily related with the use of a medicinal product, considered or not related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions that worsened during the study were reported as AEs. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any experience that suggested a significant risk, contraindication, caution, and at any dose fulfills at least one of the following criteria: adverse event considered as fatal (resulting in death), life threatening, defect of birth/congenital abnormality, required hospitalization or extension of hospital length of stay, significant medical intervention, resulted in significant disability/impairment.</description>

    <description>An AE is any unfavorable sign and non-intentional, symptom or disease temporarily related with the use of a medicinal product, considered or not related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions that worsened during the study were reported as AEs. The Intensity of AEs was classified as Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 and Grade 4. Grade 1: Discomfort was noticed, but the normal daily activity was not interrupted. Grade 2: Discomfort was enough to reduce the normal daily activity. Grade 3: There was disability for work or develop normal daily activities. Grade 4: It represented an immediate threat to life (these events were reported as SAEs).</description>

Relationship between AEs and medication under investigation was evaluated through the classification &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;. A relationship classified as &quot;Yes&quot; implied a significant causal relationship with the medication under investigation which was evaluated based on enough evidences, facts or arguments.</description>

        <description>An AE is any unfavorable sign and non-intentional, symptom or disease temporarily related with the use of a medicinal product, considered or not related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions that worsened during the study were reported as AEs. A SAE is any experience that suggested a significant risk, contraindication, caution, and at any dose, fulfills, at least, one of the following criteria: adverse event considered as fatal (resulting in death), life threatening, defect of birth/congenital abnormality, required hospitalization or extension of hospital length of stay, significant medical intervention, resulted in significant disability/impairment. Relationship between AEs and medication under investigation was evaluated through the classification &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;. A relationship classified as &quot;Yes&quot; implied a significant causal relationship with the medication under investigation which was evaluated based on enough evidences, facts or arguments.</description>
