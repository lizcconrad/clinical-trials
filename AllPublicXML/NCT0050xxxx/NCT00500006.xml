    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia
             chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL)

          -  Patients must be at least 3 months from the start of dasatinib therapy and are
             currently receiving dasatinib therapy for CML or Ph+ ALL and be evaluable for
             hematologic response prior to entering the study

          -  Patient is able to be treated with a 70 mg bid dose of dasatinib without significant
             toxicity at the time of study entry

          -  Patients with active CNS disease are included and may be treated concurrently with
             intrathecal therapy as per institutional standards

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has had treatment with any anti-leukemia therapy (investigational or approved)
             other than dasatinib during the preceding 3 months. Pheresis or hydroxyurea treatment
             in the preceding 3 months will not exclude patients from eligibility

          -  Patient has unresolved more than or equal to grade 2 clinically significant toxicity
             attributed to dasatinib at the time of study entry

          -  Patient has known hypersensitivity to the components of study drug or its analogs

          -  Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected
             duration of the study

          -  Patient has symptomatic ascites, pericardial or pleural effusion. A patient who is
             clinically stable following treatment for these conditions is eligible

          -  Patient has had prior radiation therapy to more than 10% of the bone marrow; patients
             must have recovered for at least 3 weeks from the hematologic toxicity of prior
             radiotherapy

          -  Patient has a LVEF &lt;40% by multigated radionucleotide angiography (MUGA) or
             echocardiography
