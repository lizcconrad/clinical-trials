      The goal of this research is to identify genes that may be related to the risk of developing
      CLL.

      Objectives:

      The objective of this study to investigate possible candidate susceptibility genes for
      familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by identifying and recruiting high-risk families.
      Through our ongoing study of familial aggregation in CLL kindreds (protocol 2003-0498
      'Genetic Study of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia'), we have identified CLL patients who have
      one or more living or dead relative(s) affected with CLL or other leukemias or lymphomas. We
      will also identify patients in high-risk families from referrals from leukemia clinicians and
      from self-referrals from patients who learn about our study from the ClinicalTrials.gov
      website. We plan to invite probands (patients diagnosed with CLL) and their family members
      with other leukemias and lymphomas and a sample of unaffected relatives to participate in a
      genetic/linkage study. We will obtain demographic and clinical information along with
      specimens (blood or buccal samples) from all participants. These families will be part of the
      Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium, a multicenter, multidisciplinary consortium, based at
      the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center under the direction of Susan Slager, PhD. This is funded from
      NCI through a subcontract with Mayo Clinic.

      Genotypic data will be analyzed at Mayo Clinic, and coded, de-identified data will be shared
      with the NIH Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data repository.

      This study does not involve taking any medications.

      You will be asked to provide study personnel with authorization to request medical records
      from your physician, the hospital, and/or from other health care facilities where you were
      diagnosed with cancer. The information gathered will be used to help verify the diagnosis.
      Study personnel may also need to contact you in the future by phone, mail, or e-mail in order
      to ask questions about the status of your health.

      For this research study, you will be asked to have around 4 tablespoons of blood drawn from a
      vein in your arm or you will also be asked to provide a sample of cheek cells by spitting
      into a collection container. The blood and cheek cell samples will be used for special tests
      to look for genes that may play a role in the development of CLL. You will also be asked to
      complete a family history questionnaire and a risk factor questionnaire. The family history
      questionnaire and the risk factor questionnaire will each take 60 minutes to complete. You
      will need to contact your family members before you send the completed family history
      questionnaire back to the study staff. You must ask for their permission to send the study
      staff their contact information. Family members with CLL or other leukemias or lymphomas, as
      well as a sample of your unaffected family members, will then be contacted by study personnel
      about participating in the study.

      If you live in Houston, or the surrounding area, study personnel can arrange to collect the
      samples at the time and place of your convenience. If you do not live in the Houston area,
      sample collection instructions and supplies will be mailed to you. The blood sample may be
      drawn at your doctor's office, or at a clinic or hospital of your choice. All mailing costs
      will be paid by the study. No travel to M. D. Anderson will be required.

      All blood and cheek cells collected will only be used by researchers involved in this study.
      Genetic information from the analysis of your blood and cheek cells will be included in a
      repository of genetic information at the National Institutes of Health, but no personal
      identifying information will be sent. All information will be kept confidential. Neither you
      nor your doctor will receive the results of these tests and they will NOT be put in your
      medical record.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 450 participants will be enrolled by M. D. Anderson
      researchers. A total of 4000 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.
