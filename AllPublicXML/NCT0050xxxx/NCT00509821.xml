    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to induce a novel radiochemotherapy with enzastaurin as
      first-line treatment regimen in glioblastoma: Patients with active, unmethylated MGMT
      promoter will be treated with enzastaurin before, concomitant, and after radiotherapy to
      determine safety and PFS at 6 months (PFS-6) in phase II.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Tumor tissue specimens (paraffin-embedded and/or frozen) from the GBM surgery or
             biopsy must be available for central pathology review and exploratory analysis of
             PKC-beta targets (for example, GSK3beta).

          -  Disease evaluated by Gd-MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) within 72 hours
             postoperatively

          -  Interval of greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4 weeks since surgery
             or biopsy

          -  adequate bone marrow reserve: white blood cell (WBC) count greater than or equal to
             3.0 X 109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 X 109/L,
             platelet count greater than or equal to 75.0 X 109/L, and hemoglobin greater than or
             equal to 10.0 g/dL (greater than or equal to 6.2 mmol/L).

             alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase
             (ALT) less than or equal to 2.5 X ULN, or less than or equal to 5 X ULN with liver

             situ of the cervix, or nonmelanoma skin cancer), unless that prior malignancy was
