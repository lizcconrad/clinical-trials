  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is considered as an invading disorder of the development. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a
      particular form of autism and is difficult to diagnose. The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) has
      been developed in order to measure the degree of autistic traits in autistic adolescent with
      normal intelligence (Baron-Cohen et al. 2001, 2006). AQ comprises 50 questions, with 5 groups
      of 10 questions assessing imagination, social skills, attention switching, attention to
      detail and communication skills. Each of these items scores 1 point if the respondent records
      abnormal or autistic like behaviour. The minimum score on the AQ is 0 and the maximum 50.

      The principal objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the French version of
      Autism Spectrum Quotient questionnaire.

      Secondary objectives are to:

      Evaluate if EQ and SQ can distinguish adolescents without psychiatric syndromes from those
      with classical autism or AS.

      Evaluate if AQ, EQ and SQ can distinguish adolescents with psychiatric disorders from
      autistic adolescents.

      Define the threshold of positivity for the 3 questionnaires.

      4 groups of participants will be screened with the questionnaires: Group 1: 50 adolescents
      with AS or high functioning autism (HFS) diagnosed by psychiatrists using established
      criteria and with an IQ &gt;85.

      Group 2: 50 adolescents with AS or classical autism diagnosed by psychiatrists using
      established criteria 70&lt;IQ&lt;84.

      Group 3: 50 adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Group 4: Sample of 50 healthy adolescents
      selected randomly from 200. The questionnaires are given to the parents of adolescents during
      the first meeting. Parents are invited to send them back to the clinical investigation centre
      of Lyon (France).
