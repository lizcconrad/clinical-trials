  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study where researchers are collecting blood to evaluate the genetic
      characteristics of individuals with chronic lung diseases, including asthma, COPD (chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and lung cancer.
      The investigators hope to be able to identify an association between a genetic make-up in the
      blood samples and the risks of developing a particular lung disease, or severity of a lung
      disease. The findings of this study might be important to develop future preventative methods
      and potential treatments for the management of lung disease.

      This protocol is designed to collect a small amount of blood for extraction of DNA (genetic
      material) for the study of the genetic basis of lung disease. The study population will
      include individuals with known lung diseases and controls without lung disease. Individuals
      in the study population will be individuals at the Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar (HMC), as
      well as other individuals recruited for this study. In this protocol, researchers will survey
      medical records of patients with chronic lung disease, in order to study the clinical
      characteristics of these individuals, and the researchers will collect blood to evaluate the
      genetic characteristics of individuals with chronic lung diseases including asthma, and COPD
      (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer. The researchers
      will also collect blood samples of individuals without lung disease to serve as control.

      This protocol, to be carried out at Weill Cornell Medical College - Qatar and Hamad Medical
      Corporation, Qatar, parallels a similar approved protocol IRB #0508008095, entitled,
      &quot;Collection of Blood for Gene Expression/Genomic Studies in Individuals with Chronic Lung
      Diseases&quot;, ongoing at Weill Cornell Medical College - New York.

      This protocol is designed to collect a small amount of blood for extraction of DNA (genetic
      material) for the study of the genetic basis of lung disease. Genomic DNA will be extracted,
      and genome wide SNP analysis and promoter sequences for genes will be obtained. The goal is
      to find single nucleotide polymorphims (SNP), small changes in single genes that affect
      disease risk, to see if they correlate with lung disease.

        Individuals visiting the Medicine Department at the Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar for
        standard clinical care will be recruited.

        Controls will be obtained from volunteers without a history of lung disease. Family members
