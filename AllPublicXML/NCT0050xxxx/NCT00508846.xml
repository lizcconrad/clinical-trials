      Among women with HNPCC, this study will assess:

        1. Knowledge of screening recommendations for endometrial and ovarian cancers.

        2. Perceived risk and cancer worries regarding endometrial, ovarian and colorectal cancers.

        3. Adherence to screening recommendations for endometrial, ovarian and colon cancers.

        4. Perceived benefits,supports and barriers to endometrial and ovarian cancer screening.

        5. Patterns of communication about endometrial and ovarian cancer risk within families with
           HNPCC and with health care providers.

        6. Patient preferences for potential cancer screening and cancer prevention strategies
           related to HNPCC-associated cancers.

      Women who are at risk for HNPCC will be recruited to participate in this pilot study.

      Women will be invited to participate in the study either through a mailed invitation or
      during a visit to M.D. Anderson for clinical services or for research purposes.

      Women who wish to participate in the study will complete an informed consent, and will
      subsequently schedule an appointment with a research coordinator to complete the study
      questionnaire by telephone.
