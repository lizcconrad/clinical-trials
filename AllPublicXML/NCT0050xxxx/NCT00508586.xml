  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in metastatic
      breast cancer. It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many women with
      metastatic breast cancer. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the
      tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease
      production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299
      administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood
      vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in
      research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than
      those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers
      indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active
      in animal models of human cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that
      PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction and antitumor activity when
      administered orally in combination with anastrozole (Arimidex®), letrozole (Femara®), or
      exemestane (Aromasin®) to women with metastatic breast cancer.

      The study will be conducted in 2 stages. In Stage 1 of the study, successive groups of 3 to 6
      patients will receive progressively higher PTC299 dose levels; in this stage, treatment will
      be given in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of 4 weeks of oral PTC299 twice per day
      followed by a 2-week, no-drug period. During Stage 2, study candidates must be women with
      natural or induced suppression of ovarian function to post-menopausal levels who are
      receiving or are candidates for hormonal therapy. These subjects will receive continuous
      administration of PTC299, 100 mg/dose BID, in repeated 6-week cycles in combination with
      continuous administration of one of 3 hormonal agents. All planned PTC299 dose levels in all
      stages are expected to achieve circulating blood levels of PTC299 known to be active in
      animal models of human cancer. Treatment for each patient can continue as long as the therapy
      appears to be safely offering tumor control to that patient. Up to 36 evaluable patients will
      be accrued across both stages.
