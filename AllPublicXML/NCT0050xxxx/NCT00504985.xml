      1. To describe fatigue severity and its related symptom clusters in cancer patients who are
           seeking emergency care for fever, pain, shortness of breath, or cancer therapy-related
           gastrointestinal toxicities.

        2. To describe inflammatory cytokine profiles in cancer patients who are seeking emergency
           care for fever, pain, shortness of breath, or cancer therapy-related gastrointestinal
           toxicities.

        3. To determine the type of cytokines that are associated with fatigue severity in cancer
           patients, with or without cancer treatment, in the early phase of infection, as well as
           in patients with pain, shortness of breath, or cancer therapy-related gastrointestinal
           toxicities.

      One of the ways to learn about the symptoms of cancer and the effect of cancer treatment is
      by rating how severe symptoms are and how they interfere with daily activity. Researchers can
      also compare these ratings to the levels of certain proteins called cytokines that are found
      in the blood while the patient is experiencing symptoms.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete 2 surveys during your
      Emergency Center visit. One survey will measure physical and mental symptoms (such as sadness
      or distress). The other survey will ask you for personal &quot;demographic&quot; information (such as
      your age and marital status). Completing the questionnaires will take about 10-15 minutes.
      During the Emergency Center visit, about 1 tablespoon of blood will be drawn for cytokine
      testing.

      Research staff will also collect other information from your medical record, clinical
      information, and lab results. This information may include cancer diagnosis, cancer
      treatment, performance status (your ability to perform daily activities), disease status, and
      any medications you are taking at that time.

      This is an investigational study. About 520 patients will participate in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Cancer patients admitted to the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center Emergency Center who are
        seeking emergency care for fever, pain, shortness of breath, or cancer therapy-related
        gastrointestinal toxicities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be admitted to the Emergency Center with a diagnosis of cancer confirmed
             by pathology (either hematologic malignancies or solid tumors).

          2. Patients with either hematologic malignancies or solid tumors must either be currently
             undergoing active cancer treatment (received chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
             chemoradiotherapy, blood or bone morrow transplant, surgery, immunotherapy anytime
             during the past month) or not receiving any cancer treatments in past month.

          3. Patient's chief complaint upon admission to the EC must be one or more of the
             following four conditions: a. fever (38.3°C or higher) in past 24 hours b. pain c.any
             chemotherapy-related GI toxicities (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or
             constipation) d.shortness of breath

          4. Patients must be able to read and write English

          5. Patients must agree to participate and must sign the Informed Consent

          6. Patients must be 18 years or older (minimal numbers of children are evaluated in the
             EC)

          7. Patients must be able to complete the survey tool independently (without input or
             influence from their caregivers).

          8. Patients whose performance status allows them to complete the survey (i.e., patients
             who do not have altered mental/cognitive status, and patients without emergent illness
             and hemodynamic instability---for example, status epilepticus, sepsis, cardiac arrest,
             and any life-threatening condition).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Patients who were already enrolled on this protocol in a previous visit to this EC will
        not be enrolled again, regardless of their reasons for the current EC visit (same or
        different reason).
