  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 multicenter, open label, randomized study of AMG 951 (rhApo2L/TRAIL) in
      subjects with previously untreated stage IIIb/IV NSCLC treated with chemotherapy with or
      without bevacizumab.

      Subjects will be assigned to a set of treatment groups depending on their eligibility to
      receive bevacizumab. Subjects with squamous NSCLC and/or CNS metastases will not be eligible
      to receive bevacizumab and will be assigned to either cohort A or B (provided all other
      eligibility criteria are met). Subjects who are eligible to receive bevacizumab will be
      assigned to cohort C, D or E. Cohorts are defined as follows:

      Subjects with squamous NSCLC or CNS mets:

      Cohort A: Chemotherapy alone Cohort B: Chemotherapy plus 8 mg/kg AMG 951 for 5 days

      Subjects without squamous NSCLC and without CNS mets:

      Cohort C: Chemotherapy and bevacizumab Cohort D: Chemotherapy, bevacizumab plus 8 mg/kg AMG
      951 for 5 days Cohort E: Chemotherapy, bevacizumab plus up to 20 mg/kg AMG 951 for 2 days
      Approximately forty subjects will be recruited to each cohort.
