  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves 90 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 50 recruited from the general
      community. It involves doing a set of simple memory tests while inside a fMRI machine. The
      subject is given a very low dose of an anesthetic drug intravenously while in the scanner.
      The subject then sees a sequence of pictures on a screen, and presses a button if they
      remember seeing the picture before. While this is happening, the scanner will be capturing
      images that tell us what parts of the brain are active. Hypothesis: patterns of hippocampal
      and amygdala activation during the encoding and retrieval of memory,as measured by fMRI, will
      be altered by intravenous anesthetics such that suppression of hippocampal and amygdala
      activities will be dissociable. This dissociation pattern will be different between the drugs
      propofol and thiopental.

      Background: Subclinical doses of propofol produce anterograde amnesia, characterized by an
      early failure of memory consolidation. It is unknown how propofol affects the
      amygdala-dependent emotional memory system, which modulates consolidation in the hippocampus
      in response to emotional arousal and neurohumoral stress. We present an event-related
      functional magnetic resonance imaging study of the effects of propofol on the emotional
      memory system in human subjects.

      Methods: Thirty-five healthy subjectswere randomized to receive propofol, at an estimated
      brain concentration of 0.90 μgml−1, or placebo. During drug infusion, emotionally arousing
      and neutral images were presented in a continuous recognition task, while
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation responses were acquired. After a drug-free interval
      of 2 h, subsequent memory for successfully encoded items was assessed. Imaging analysis was
      performed using statistical parametric mapping and behavioural analysis using signal
      detection models.

    <description>The encoding task was performed in the scanner. Subjects viewed a pseudorandom sequence of 160 images, made up of the 40 negative-arousing targets and 40 neutral targets, each presented twice (mean interval between first and second presentations 9.1 images). The task was to indicate with the buttonpress device whether the image they were seeing was being presented for the first time ('new') or whether it had been presented earlier in the sequence ('old'). The sequence was divided into eight blocks of 20 images, with a short break in between blocks. The interstimulus interval was jittered to an average of 12 s (range 6-18 s). Images were presented for 3000 ms and separated by a white fixation cross. For counterbalancing, four versions of the sequence were randomly assigned. The entire encoding task took ∼35 min, after which the drug was stopped and the subject removed from the scanner.</description>
