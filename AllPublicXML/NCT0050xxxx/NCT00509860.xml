      Primary Objectives:

        1. To determine the efficacy of the topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor irinotecan,
           delivered via a low-dose protracted schedule to patients with advanced sarcoma.

        2. To determine the toxicity profile of irinotecan, using a protracted schedule, in this
           pretreated patient population.

      Irinotecan is a chemotherapy drug that fights cancer by interfering with the cancer cells'
      ability to divide and grow.

      Before treatment starts, you will be asked questions about your health and have a complete
      physical exam. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical
      activity of the heart). You will have computed tomography (CT) scans and x-rays to check on
      the status of the disease. If your doctor feels it is necessary, you may also have a magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood or
      urine pregnancy test.

      During treatment, you will receive irinotecan by vein over one hour, once a day for 5 days in
      a row. This will be followed by 2 days of no study drug treatment, then 5 more days of
      treatment with irinotecan. This 12-day period will be followed by 9 days of rest (no study
      drug). This 21-day period is called a cycle of therapy. You will continue to receive
      treatment (cycles repeated) as long as the disease does not get worse or until maximal
      shrinkage of the cancer. Treatment may be taken on an outpatient basis.

      During treatment, you will have blood collected (1-2 teaspoons) once a week for routine
      tests. At least once every cycle of treatment (3 weeks) you will have a physical exam and be
      asked questions about you health.

      After the first 2 cycles, the disease will be re-evaluated. You will have blood tests (1-2
      teaspoons), x-rays, and CT scans. If your doctor feels it is necessary, you may also have a
      MRI. This re-evaluation will be repeated every 4 cycles.

      If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken
      off the study and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

      Your doctor may choose to follow up with long-term exams at his/her discretion.

      This is an investigational study. Irinotecan is FDA approved and is commercially available.
      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of all ages.

          2. Patients must have histologic proof of a sarcoma.

          3. Patients must have locally advanced / metastatic disease that is inoperable or
             incurable with surgery.

          4. If patient has a history of prior malignancy, there must be histologic documentation
             that metastatic disease is sarcoma.

          5. Patients must have received or refused standard chemotherapy for disease.

          6. Patients must have at least one lesion that is clearly defined, measurable or
             objectively evaluable. This lesion cannot have been previously irradiated unless
             progression has been demonstrated after radiation.

          7. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks and a Zubrod performance
             status of &lt; 2.

          8. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of this hospital.
             The only approved consent form is appended to this protocol.

             limit of normal, and Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &lt; 3 times the upper
             limit of normal determined within 2 weeks prior to the first treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:
