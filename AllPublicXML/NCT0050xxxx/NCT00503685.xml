      Patients with mCRC who have progressed on a prior Anti-EGFr regimen randomized to receive
      IMC-A12 monotherapy or combination therapy with cetuximab to assess response, survival,
      durations of response, safety and tolerability as well as pharmacodynamics of IMC-A12 and
      cetuximab

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          -  The patient has histologically or cytologically-confirmed colorectal cancer with
             metastatic disease documented on diagnostic imaging studies

          -  The patient has measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded),
             measuring ≥ 2 cm on conventional measurement techniques or ≥ 1 cm on spiral computed
             tomography (CT) scan

          -  The patient has clinical documentation of disease progression during treatment or
             within 6 weeks after receiving the last dose of a therapeutic regimen for metastatic
             disease containing an anti-EGFR-component (cetuximab or panitumumab). Toxicity or
             planned treatment break will not be regarded as adequate evidence of disease
             progression and such patients will not be eligible for this trial

          -  The patient has received at least one prior standard and/or investigational regimen
             for metastatic disease

          -  The patient is age ≥ 18 years

          -  The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of
             0-1 (Karnofsky ≥ 80%)

          -  The patient has adequate hematologic function as defined by an absolute neutrophil
             count ≥ 1500/μL, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and a platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL

          -  The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the
             upper limit of normal (ULN),* and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine
             transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3 x the ULN (or ≤ 5 x the ULN in the presence of known liver
             metastases)

          -  The patient has adequate coagulation function as defined by international normalized
             ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 x the ULN. Patients on
             full-dose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or low
             molecular weight heparin, and if on warfarin must have an INR between 2 and 3 and have
             no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (eg,
             tumor involving major vessels or invading the rectal lumen, or known varices)

          -  The patient has adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the
             institutional ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine
             levels above the ULN, as well as urine protein ≤ 1+ on urine dipstick or routine
             urinalysis (if urine dipstick/routine UA indicates ≥ 2+ protein, a 24-hour urine
             collection for protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow
             participation in the study)

          -  The patient has fasting serum glucose &lt; 120 mg/dL or below the ULN

          -  The patient has a life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          -  Because the teratogenicity of IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) is not known, women of
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation

          -  The patient has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document

          -  The patient has a tumor that is KRAS wild-type (absence of mutations at codon 12 or
             13, as determined by the DxS K-RAS Mutation Kit [PCR-based analysis]).

          -  The patient experienced either a confirmed partial response or stable disease of ≥ 24
             weeks duration during prior treatment with a cetuximab- or panitumumab-containing
             regimen *Except for patients with UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism, ie, Gilbert syndrome,
             confirmed by genotyping or Invader®UGT1A1 Molecular Assay prior to enrollment.
             Patients enrolled with Gilbert Syndrome must have a total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN. If the
             patient has liver metastases, total bilirubin must be ≤ 3 x ULN.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The patient has received chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or has not recovered from
             adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Neurotoxicity, if
             present, must have recovered to NCI-CTCAE Version 3.0 grade ≤ 2.

          -  The patient is receiving any other investigational agent(s).

          -  The patient has a history of treatment with other agents targeting the IGFR.

          -  The patient has known brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  The patient has a history of primary central nervous system tumors, seizures not well
             controlled with standard medical therapy, or history of stroke within 6 months prior
             to randomization.

          -  The patient has a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of chemical or
             biologic composition similar to those of cetuximab or IMC-A12 (cixutumumab).

          -  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with a history of
             diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate, provided that their blood glucose is
             within normal range (fasting glucose &lt; 120 mg/dL or below ULN) and that they are on a
             stable dietary or therapeutic regimen for this condition.

          -  The patient has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  The patient is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The patient is known to be positive for infection with the human immunodeficiency
             virus.

          -  The patient is receiving therapy with immune modulators such as cyclosporine or
             tacrolimus.

          -  The patient has a history of another primary cancer, with the exception of: a)
             curatively resected nonmelanomatous skin cancer; b) curatively treated cervical
             carcinoma in-situ; or c) other primary solid tumor curatively resected treated with no
             known active disease present and no treatment administered for the last 3 years.
