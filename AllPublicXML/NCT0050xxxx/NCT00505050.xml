    <textblock>
      Recent meta-analysis reported reduction in mortality and hospitalization of HF
      patients.However, important issues in DMP for HF remain to be resolved. DMP are not
      homogeneous concerning methodology and in general included only elderly patients; most were
      tested in high-risk HF patients discharged from hospital; quality of life results are
      controversial; few reports included long-term results; some protocols had limited enrollment
      of screened patients, and it was suggested that could be less effective when patients are
      already followed by HF specialist.Improved survival was associated with cardiologist care as
      well with multidisciplinary teams providing specialized follow-up.Whether both together could
      benefits HF is not well defined. Also, no studies reported the long-term effects of a cyclic
      repetitive reeducation program.We tested whether a DMP that consisted of a long-term
      repetitive education program associated with a telephone monitoring could benefit HF
      outpatients in usual ambulatory care already under care of cardiologist with experience in HF

    <description>This DMP inclused intervention content with education for out patients and caregivers; medication management with optimized therapy based on guidelines, and remote monitoring; delivery personnel with nurses, cardiologists, pharmacists, social workers, dietitians, physical therapists, psychologists; face-to-face individual/group communication, and telephone in-person; the intensity/complexity was long-term follow-up with 6 months interval repetitive education; the environment was hospital out-patient; and the outcomes measured were clinical, quality of life, and adherence.
After randomization patients undergone our multidisciplinary education sessions 60-minute long that covered the basic principles related to heart failure. Telephone calls were used to reinforce the contents of the sessions of the ambulatory education activity, and monitoring of the compliance/adherence, symptoms/signs of worsening heart failure, and self-control mechanisms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients on ambulatory care were aged 18 years or older with irreversible
             chronic heart .failure with at least 6 months duration, and non planned surgical
             procedure or other procedure that could influence the follow-up in the next 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  impossibility for attendance of education sessions and monitoring based on non
             corrected limitations of transport, or unfavorable distance, or social, or of
             communication; myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months before
             randomization; cardiac surgery or angioplasty within 6 months randomization;
             hospitalized patients or recent discharged patients; severe
             renal/hepatic/neurological/pulmonary or any systemic disease that could confuse the
             interpretation of results and impair expected survival; and pregnant women or women of
             childbearing potential.
