      Many stroke survivors exhibit persistent upper limb motor deficits and a non-functional upper
      limb. There is some promising information that suggests motor learning (ML) in conjunction
      with functional electrical stimulation (FES; surface FES; nothing implanted; use of a
      commercially available system) of wrist/finger muscles can significantly enhance the
      functional level of the upper limb. There have been promising studies showing that some
      subjects in the chronic phase (greater than 6 months after stroke) responded favorably to
      combination FES and ML (FES ML). In our pilot studies, FES ML for those in the chronic phase
      (&gt;12 months) produced statistically significant functional recovery. FES was applied using a
      commercially available, two-channel FES system, with electrodes applied to the surface of the
      skin (non-invasive). But if upper limb dysfunction is not immediately treated, that is within
      the sub-acute phase (less than 6 months) following stroke, the following problems can
      develop: contractures and other soft tissue changes; chronic pain; and ingrained, abnormal,
      non-functional movement patterns. The more long-standing these symptoms are, the more
      resistant to treatment they become. Therefore, it is important to provide promising
      interventions prior to the onset of chronic symptoms and dysfunction. Those in the sub-acute
      phase after stroke should be provided with FES ML, in order to more completely restore
      function for a greater number of stroke survivors.

      Specific Aims and Hypotheses The goal of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of the
      proposed treatment in the sub acute phase following stroke.

      HYPOTHESIS. FES ML for 3hrs/day, five days/week, for 12 weeks will be feasible to implement
      in the sub-acute phase following stroke (2 -24 weeks).

      Study Design

      a. Specific Procedures This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of using FES ML for
      upper extremity rehabilitation in a sub-acute stroke population. It is a randomized,
      controlled, single-blind design. Subjects will be 2 - 24 weeks after a single stroke. The
      control group will receive standard care for upper limb rehabilitation consisting of passive
      and active exercise, stretching, bracing, and use of adaptive devices. The experimental group
      will receive the experimental intervention in addition to their standard care.

      CONTROL GROUP INTERVENTION. The control group will receive the standard medical care
      prescribed by the primary physician and covered by the subject's health care policy. Standard
      care will include: soft tissue mobilization; assisted motion exercise; active motion
      exercise; resistive exercise; task practice; use of assistive devices; and modality
      applications conventionally prescribed.

      FES ML INTERVENTION. The research treatment duration will be 3hrs/day, five days per week.
      The subjects will be present for a fourth hour each day, which will be used for breaks and
      rest periods that will be interspersed throughout the intervention time. The treatment
      duration is derived from prior work. We will stimulate muscles in a number of configurations
      including: wrist extension and finger extension; wrist extension and finger flexion; and
      wrist extension, finger flexion, and thumb abduction and opposition. Motor learning will
      include the performance of functional task components and full task practice during the use
      of FES. FES will be triggered by the patient, the treating therapist, or it will be
      automatically sequenced by the device according to alternate channel activations, with
      timings pre-set by the treating therapist.

      MEASURES. Data will be collected at weeks 1, 6, 12 (end of treatment), and 6 months after the
      end of treatment.

      Population The subjects will be sub-acute stroke survivors (2-24 weeks after stroke).
