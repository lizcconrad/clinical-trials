  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unlike for ventricular arrhythmias, the role of n-3 PUFAs in atrial arrhythmias has not been
      fully investigated. A recently published epidemiological study reported that in elderly
      patients, consumption of fish was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation
      over the 12 years of follow-up. This observation may be an indirect effect due to the overall
      beneficial effort of fish consumption on reducing ischaemic heart disease, however this
      association persisted after adjustment for confounding characteristics. Clinical data
      regarding the direct impact of n-3 PUFAs on atrial arrhythmias such as atrial
      fibrillation/flutter (AF) is lacking. However, as both INa and ICa-L are also in atrial
      myocytes, similar anti-fibrillatory actions by n-3PUFAs would be expected in atrial
      fibrillation and we would like to investigate this further. The primary aim of this study is
      to investigate whether dietary supplements of n-3 PUFA concentrates (1g fish oil/day
      comprising eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA 46% and docosahexaenoic, DHA 38%)) helps maintain sinus
      rhythm after cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm in patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation.

      The patients. Randomisation. Patients with persistent AF will be recruited from clinic
      attendees and in-patient hospital patients at Ninewells Hospital and Medical School. A total
      of 150 patients with AF of more than 7 days duration and scheduled for elective direct
      current cardioversion will be recruited. The patients will be randomised to receive fish oil
      supplements (3g/day) or placebo on recruitment for a period of 4 weeks prior to cardioversion
      and continued after cardioversion until recurrence of AF or until the end of 6 months. All
      patients will be anticoagulated routinely. Patients on anti-arrhythmic drugs, left atrial
      size &gt;6 cm, significant mitral valve disease, myocardial infarction in the last 3 months,
      unstable angina, NYHA IV heart failure, cardiac surgery in the previous 3 months, acute
      reversible conditions, significant thyroid, hepatic, pulmonary disease, pregnancy or child
      bearing potential will be excluded from the study.

      3.2. End Points of the Study. The primary endpoint will be time to first
      electrocardiographically confirmed recurrence of atrial fibrillation/flutter lasting more
      than 10 minutes. Secondary endpoints will be shock number and energy requirements to achieve
      electrical cardioversion. All patients will give informed consent and approval will be
      obtained from the Ethics Committee of Ninewells Hospital and Medical School.

      3.3. Free n-3 PUFA plasma concentrations On the day of cardioversion, 3mls of venous blood
      will be obtained for measurement of free n-3 PUFA plasma concentrations.

      3.4. Elective Direct current cardioversion and Follow-up Patients will be routinely scheduled
      for cardioversion (2 per week) as outpatients. Cardioversion will be under conscious sedation
      (titrated doses of intravenous midazolam) as is the current routine practice in the
      Department of Cardiology, Ninewells Hospital. Follow-up (with ECG) of cardioverted patients
      will be weekly in the first month; then 2,3,4,5 and 6 months; and at any time the patients
      complains of palpitations or other symptoms.
