    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Detrusor Pressure at Maximum Flow Rate (PdetQmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Detrusor pressure (Pdet) measures the force the detrusor muscle is exerting. This pressure is required to expel urine from the bladder during normal voiding. A high detrusor pressure may be observed in the presence of outflow tract obstruction. Detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow rate (PdetQmax) was evaluated using simultaneous recording of urinary voiding by an uroflowmeter during detrusor pressure evaluation by cystometry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Maximum Flow Rate (Qmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum flow rate (Qmax) during a micturition (urination) was recorded using uroflowmetry. A reduction in maximum flow rate may be due to an obstruction of the bladder outlet or a failure of the detrusor muscle to aid in expelling urine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Post Void Residual Volume (PVR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Healthy micturitions result in complete emptying of the bladder. Post Void Residual (PVR) is the volume of urine retained after voiding (post-void residual urine). Post void residual volume was assessed by abdominal ultrasound. An increasing PVR over time is an indicator of abnormal bladder function or detrusor decompensation.
End-of-treatment is the last post-baseline assessment during the treatment period.
Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for pooled center and the Baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Bladder Contractility Index (BCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Bladder Contractility Index (BCI) is a value used to measure the degree of contractility. BCI was calculated using the following formula:
BCI = pdetQmax + 5Qmax.
Strong contractility is a BCI &gt; 150, normal contractility is a BCI of 100-150 and weak contractility is a BCI of &lt; 100.
LS means were adjusted for pooled center and Baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Percent Bladder Voiding Efficiency (BVE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percent Bladder Voiding Efficiency (BVE) is a product of bladder contractility against the urethral resistance and is measured according to the degree of bladder emptying. BVE is expressed as a percentage and is calculated using the formula:
Bladder Voiding efficiency = (Voided volume x 100)/maximum cystometric capacity.
A higher number indicates a higher voiding efficiency.
LS means were adjusted for pooled center and Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Safety Assessed by Adverse Events (AEs), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Vital Signs, Physical Exam and Laboratory Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to within 30 days after last dose of double blind study medication (up to 16 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Abnormal laboratory parameters, vital signs or ECG data were defined as AEs if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or was clinically significant. A serious AE was an event resulting in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly or birth defect, was life-threatening, required or prolonged hospitalization or was considered medically important. AEs were assessed by the Investigator for intensity as mild (no disruption of normal daily activities), moderate (affected normal daily activities) or severe (inability to perform daily activities) and for causal relationship to study drug.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IPSS is a validated global questionnaire used to assess the degree of &quot;bother&quot; from benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and is based on the answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms:
Sensation of incomplete emptying
Repeat urinating after 2 hours (frequency)
Start and stop several times (intermittency)
Urgency
Weak stream
Straining
Nocturia
Each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).
Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for pooled center and the Baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Urgency Episodes Per 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>For each micturition and/or incontinence episode participants rated the degree of associated urgency (the sudden compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer) according to the following scale: 0: No Urgency, felt no need to empty my bladder but did so for another reason; 1: Mild urgency, could postpone passing water for as long as necessary; 2: Moderate urgency, could postpone passing water for a short while; 3: Severe urgency, could not postpone passing water; 4: Urge incontinence, leaked before reaching the toilet. An urgency episode is defined as an episode with urgency severity of three or higher.
The mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours was calculated from data recorded by the participant in the micturition diary for the 3 days preceding each clinic visit.

        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Detrusor Pressure at Maximum Flow Rate (PdetQmax)</title>
        <description>Detrusor pressure (Pdet) measures the force the detrusor muscle is exerting. This pressure is required to expel urine from the bladder during normal voiding. A high detrusor pressure may be observed in the presence of outflow tract obstruction. Detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow rate (PdetQmax) was evaluated using simultaneous recording of urinary voiding by an uroflowmeter during detrusor pressure evaluation by cystometry.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set (FAS) population consisted of participants who received at least one dose of double-blind treatment and had both urodynamic measurements at baseline and one or both measured at any post-baseline on-treatment visit. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Post Void Residual Volume (PVR)</title>
        <description>Healthy micturitions result in complete emptying of the bladder. Post Void Residual (PVR) is the volume of urine retained after voiding (post-void residual urine). Post void residual volume was assessed by abdominal ultrasound. An increasing PVR over time is an indicator of abnormal bladder function or detrusor decompensation.
End-of-treatment is the last post-baseline assessment during the treatment period.
Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for pooled center and the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Percent Bladder Voiding Efficiency (BVE) is a product of bladder contractility against the urethral resistance and is measured according to the degree of bladder emptying. BVE is expressed as a percentage and is calculated using the formula:
Bladder Voiding efficiency = (Voided volume x 100)/maximum cystometric capacity.
A higher number indicates a higher voiding efficiency.

        <title>Change From Baseline in International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS)</title>
        <description>The IPSS is a validated global questionnaire used to assess the degree of “bother” from benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and is based on the answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms:
Sensation of incomplete emptying
Repeat urinating after 2 hours (frequency)
Start and stop several times (intermittency)
Urgency
Weak stream
Straining
Nocturia
Each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).
Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for pooled center and the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in IPSS Voiding Score</title>
        <description>The IPSS is a validated global questionnaire used to assess the degree of “bother” from benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms based on the answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms. Each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The voiding score is the sum of the responses to 4 questions relating to urination (incomplete emptying, intermittency, weak stream and straining) and ranges from 0 to 20 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).
Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for pooled center and the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Urgency Episodes Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>For each micturition and/or incontinence episode participants rated the degree of associated urgency (the sudden compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer) according to the following scale: 0: No Urgency, felt no need to empty my bladder but did so for another reason; 1: Mild urgency, could postpone passing water for as long as necessary; 2: Moderate urgency, could postpone passing water for a short while; 3: Severe urgency, could not postpone passing water; 4: Urge incontinence, leaked before reaching the toilet. An urgency episode is defined as an episode with urgency severity of three or higher.
The mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours was calculated from data recorded by the participant in the micturition diary for the 3 days preceding each clinic visit.
