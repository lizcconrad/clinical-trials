    <textblock>
      This is a 53 week study consisting in a 26 week randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      multicenter study comparing efficacy and safety of Naproxcinod, Placebo and Naproxen. The
      first 26 weeks will be followed by a naproxen-controlled treatment period up to 52 weeks and
      a 1-week post-treatment safety follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To show that both doses of Naproxcinod (375 mg twice daily [bid] and 750 mg bid) were superior to placebo in relieving osteoarthritis (OA) signs and symptoms in subjects with OA of the knee at Week 13.</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of naproxcinod compared to naproxen 500 mg bid in relieving OA signs and symptoms in subjects with OA of the knee</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the effect on blood pressure (BP) of both doses of naproxcinod, placebo, and naproxen 500 mg bid, as measured by the office BP monitoring in a population of OA subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To obtain information regarding the pharmacokinetics/exposure of both doses of naproxcinod through a population pharmacokinetics (PK) approach</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess if there were any radiological changes at Week 52 in naproxcinod compared with naproxen subjects (target joint radiographs were taken at Screening and after 52 weeks of treatment, or if early termination occurred after Week 26)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the general safety and tolerability of both doses of naproxcinod versus naproxen 500 mg bid up to 52 weeks and with one Week post treatment follow up (Week 53)</measure>
