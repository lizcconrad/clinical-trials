    <textblock>
      Pancreatic islets are the part of the pancreas that produce insulin and help control the
      blood sugar. This study aims to improve islet transplantation as a treatment for Type 1
      Diabetes by using a new combination of immunosuppressive drugs that have been successful in
      treating other autoimmune diseases and in preventing kidney transplant rejection.
