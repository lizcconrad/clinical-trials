  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Environmental Protection Agency has recognized that organophosphorus pesticides require
      close regulation and continued monitoring for human health effects and some (e.g
      chlorpyrifos) have been phased-out from the consumer market due to the special risk that it
      posed for children. There is growing evidence in support of the association between pesticide
      exposure and childhood leukemia. Studies of pesticides and their association with childhood
      cancer have been limited by study designs, self-reporting and lack of biological
      measurements. While several large studies in California found little evidence of an
      association between agricultural pesticide use and childhood leukemia, these results are in
      contrast with the associations observed with household exposures to pesticides. The real
      association may depend on timing of exposure, type of pesticide, dose and pathway of
      exposure. Furthermore, some persons may be more susceptible to the effects of specific
      pesticides due to inherited mutations in their detoxification pathways.

      We are conducting a pilot study to test the hypothesis that environmental exposure to
      pesticides in pregnancy or during the neonatal period, together with genetic susceptibility
      may lead to childhood ALL or brain cancer. The study is a multicenter, case-control study,
      based on collaboration between clinical researchers and basic science research to evaluate
      the risk for childhood cancer in relation to measured levels of pesticides (and their
      metabolites) and genetic polymorphisms. Biomarkers will be used to examine the risks of
      chronic low-dose exposures, and to characterize relationships between specific pesticides,
      childhood cancer and genetic susceptibility.

      Hypothesis: Interaction between environmental factors (pesticides) and maternal or child
      genetic polymorphisms may lead to childhood cancer.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only newly diagnosed cases of ALL and brain cancers (i.e. diagnosed within the
             previous 12 months) under the age of 18 years are eligible for this study. These will
             include live born infants at term or born prematurely, and any cases we are able to
             ascertain from pediatric hematology records.

          -  Healthy controls of similar age will be recruited.

          -  The children must have a parent available to be interviewed who speaks English or
             Spanish well enough to understand the questionnaire.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of Down syndrome or other chromosomal disorder, single gene
             disorder, or recognized multi-organ syndrome will be excluded.

          -  Non-residents of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia will be excluded;
             this will avoid the inclusion of out-of-state case families who traveled a long
             distance for clinical care, where control sampling would be problematic.
