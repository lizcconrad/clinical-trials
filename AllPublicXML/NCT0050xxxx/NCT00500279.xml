      To evaluate the effect of celecoxib use for 3 month after drug-eluting stent implantation

        -  on restenosis

        -  on clinical outcome such as target lesion revascularization, thrombotic event,
           myocardial infarction, death

        -  on inflammatory biomarkers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restenosis is the major adverse effect of coronary stent implantation. Drug-eluting stent has
      markedly reduced restenosis as compared with bare-metal stent, but restenosis is still the
      main cause of repeat coronary intervention after drug-eluting stent implantation. After
      coronary stent implantation, inflammatory reaction occurs in vessel wall and vascular smooth
      muscle cells proliferate. Celecoxib is well known to have anti-proliferative effect as well
      as anti-inflammatory effect, and safety of this drug is well-established. Celecoxib use for 6
      month after paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation significantly reduced neointimal growth and
      repeat intervention without increase in adverse effect. Because inflammatory reaction seems
      to occur in very early period after vessel injury, reduced use of celecoxib may also be
      effective.
