  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and compare various methods for collecting lesion samples from
      subjects with clinically diagnosed herpes zoster for the laboratory confirmation of herpes
      zoster. The samples will be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect VZV DNA.
      Multiple samples from each type of herpes zoster lesion will be collected in order to
      determine whether the analysis of duplicate samples enhances the sensitivity of VZV DNA
      detection for the diagnosis of herpes zoster. In addition, blood will be collected for the
      evaluation of VZV immunity at the time of the initial herpes zoster sample collection (after
      herpes zoster has been clinically diagnosed) and one month later in order to establish the
      range of cellular and humoral immune responses during natural herpes zoster in adults ≥50
      years old.
