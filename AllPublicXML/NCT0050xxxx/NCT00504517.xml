  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We would like to better understand how different educational strategies may influence the
      practice of family medicine. More specifically, we are interested in participant satisfaction
      with the educational program, participant retainment in this career, and to see if the
      curricular change better prepares participants for contemporary clinical practice.

      In 2004, the Future of Family Medicine report called for implementation of innovative
      strategies in residency education, allowing translational key insights from the national
      demonstration project toward new approaches to family medicine training. Taking full
      advantage of the P4 Project will require careful evaluation planning and implementation. A
      comprehensive evaluation plan for the P4 Project will be implemented by a core evaluation
      team that will interact with site-specific evaluators.

      The P4 evaluation program represents an observational case series assessment of selected
      residency programs. It is not an intervention trial; rather each residency program will
      systematically enroll cohorts of learners who will be exposed to curricular content and
      learning approaches that will likely be innovative and unique. In the absence of a rigorous
      study design, core data elements should be obtained from each program including: learner
      characteristics, program characteristics, and both nationally available data and targeted
      validated instruments that can link specific educational interventions to learners knowledge,
      attitudes and skills.
