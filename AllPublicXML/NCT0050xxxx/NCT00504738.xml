      The purpose of this protocol is to obtain biologic samples from the blood and lungs from
      patients with lung diseases in order to study the causes and indications of these disorders,
      learn how these lung disease manifest and progress, and how the lung disease can be treated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lung diseases are disorders associated with functional and/or structural derangements to
      the alveolar structures, airways, pulmonary blood vessels, pleura and/or mediastinum. The
      purpose of this protocol is to obtain biologic materials from the blood and lungs from these
      patients in order to: (1) develop an understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of these
      disorders; and (2) identify individuals who will be suitable candidates for other protocols
      such as those involving investigational new drugs. As such, this protocol is part of the
      &quot;infrastructure&quot; for all of our human lung-related studies such as genomic/gene expression
      studies of airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages in all individuals with chronic
      obstructive lung disease (COPD), asthma, bronchogenic carcinoma, and pulmonary fibrosis
      compared to normal non-smokers and smokers, and studies of mediators in bronchoalveolar
      lavage fluid.

      This protocol, to be carried out at Weill Cornell Medical College - Qatar and Hamad Medical
      Corporation, Qatar, parallels a similar approved protocol IRB #0005004440, entitled,
      &quot;Evaluation of the Lungs of Individuals with Lung Disease with Segmental Bronchopulmonary
      Lung Lavage, Bronchial Brushing, and Bronchial Wall Biopsy&quot;, ongoing at Weill Cornell Medical
      College - New York.

        Recruitment will be from the patients of the Hamad Medical Corporation and others as
        relevant. The source of potential subjects will be the population of potential subjects
        with lung disease, as defined by the elegibility criteria, in Qatar. Accrual will be random
        with no bias as to gender or racial/ethnic group.

          -  Must provide informed consent

          -  Males and females, age 18 years and older

          -  Evidence of lung disease by at least one of the following:

               1. symptoms consistent with pulmonary disease;

               2. chest X-rays and/or chest CT consistent with lung disease;

               3. pulmonary function tests consistent with lung disease;

               4. lung biopsy consistent with lung disease;

               5. family history of lung disease;

               6. diseases of organs with known association with lung disease; and

               7. individuals suspected of having lung disease based on history and/or physical
                  examination

          -  Undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy as dictated by their standard clinical care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient refuses consent.

        Patients enrolled in Part A of the protocol will not undergo screening procedures/tests.
        These patients are undergoing a fiberoptic bronchoscopy as dictated by their standard
        clinical care and additional samples will be taken for research purposes.
