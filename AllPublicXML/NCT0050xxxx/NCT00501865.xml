  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to assess whether or not food affects the absorption of
      GW273225 into the blood of healthy male and female volunteers in order to evaluate whether or
      not this drug should be given at a certain time relative to the consumption of food.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to sequence AB, where A represents fasted state and B represents fed state. Subjects will be administered a single oral dose of GW273225 50 milligrams (mg) in the fasted state in dosing period 1. The subjects will receive a single oral dose of GW273225 50 mg immediately after a high fat breakfast in dosing period 2. There will be at least 21 days between doses for the fasted and fed treatment phases of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects aged 18-55 years, inclusive.

          -  Body weight 45-100kg and BMI 19-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive.

          -  Post-menopausal females (longer than two years). Or Pre-menopausal females with a
             documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, the latter only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment.

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential willing to participate commit to use a
             double-barrier method of contraception. One of the following methods is acceptable as
             the sole method of contraception if there is indisputable data that it is &gt;99%
             effective, otherwise it should be used with a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) used with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository): Documented tubal ligation. Documented placement of
             an IUD or IUS. Male partner sterilisation prior to the female subject's entry into the
             study and is the sole partner for that female subject.

          -  No abnormality on relevant clinical examination or clinical chemistry or haematology
             examination at the pre-study medical examination.

          -  A normal 12-lead ECG at the pre-study medical examination

          -  A negative pre-study Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV antibody result at screening.

          -  A negative pre-study urine drug screen.

          -  A negative screen for alcohol.

          -  Subjects must smoke &lt;10 cigarettes per day.

          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with the study and it's restrictions.

             IUD and oral contraceptives.

          -  History of alcohol/drug abuse or dependence within 12 months of the study

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study urine drug/ urine alcohol screen. A minimum list
             of drugs that will be screened for include Amphetamines, Barbiturates, Cocaine,
             Opiates, Cannabinoids and Benzodiazepines.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Weekly alcohol intake of more than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater than
             three units (for male subjects) or weekly alcohol intake more than 14 units or an
             average daily intake of greater than two units (for female subjects).

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug(whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current
             study medication.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is
             a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof.

          -  Where participation in study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL
             within a 56 day period.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to lamotrigine or GW273225.

          -  History of clinically relevant skin rashes and allergies that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might interfere with the conduct of the study.

          -  Subject has current or past history of seizure disorder or brain injury, or any
