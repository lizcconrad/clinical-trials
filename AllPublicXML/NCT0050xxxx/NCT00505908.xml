  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year in the United States alone, 300,000 persons are hospitalized for traumatic brain
      injury, with approximately one quarter dying. Despite advances in aggressive neurosurgical
      interventions, intensive care monitoring and overall supportive management, many of those who
      do &quot;survive&quot; do not fully recover and are left with a varying degree of permanent disability.
      It is therefore imperative that new methods of early interventions be explored.

      One possible road to effective therapy is to examine the timing of secondary injury via a
      biological marker, to help guide the timing of treatment directed specifically at early
      oxidant injury. A more thorough understanding of how quickly oxidant injury occurs will allow
      us to direct appropriate therapies targeted directly at oxidant injury within what is
      currently thought to be a very narrow window of opportunity for intervention, possibly
      peaking within the first two hours after the initial injury.

      Potential participants include patients between the ages of 18 and 50 years who are admitted
      to Parkland Memorial Hospital with a diagnosis of severe traumatic brain injury. Blood,
      urine, and CSF (if patient requires a clinically indicated ventriculostomy) will be collected
      over the first 5 days post-injury. Clinically-relevant patient progress, clinically required
      interventions, neuro-imaging results, and demographics will be tracked while the patient is
      hospitalized, with final neurological outcome measured at 3 months.
