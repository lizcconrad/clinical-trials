      This is a single center, single arm, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of combination chemotherapy with irinotecan and capecitabine in previously untreated
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Patients younger then 65 will be treated with irinotecan 100 mg/m2 on day 1 and 8 and
      capecitabine 1,000mg/m2 twice daily from day 1 to 14 every 3 weeks.For patiens equal to or
      older then 65, doses of irinotecan and capecitabine will be reduced to 60 mg/m2 and 750 mg/2,
      respectively.

      Response assessment will be performed every 3 cycles of chemotherapy.
