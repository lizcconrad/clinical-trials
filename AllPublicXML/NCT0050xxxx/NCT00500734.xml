      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this laboratory research study is to collect and store blood and tissue from
      patients who have a diagnosis of heart disease and may be at a high risk for the development
      of heart failure. This blood may be used in the future to identify genes that may play a role
      in developing congestive heart failure (CHF) from chemotherapy or other sources.

      This is an investigational study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      You will have a one time blood draw of 2 teaspoons of blood for use in future research. This
      blood may be studied in the future to try to find possible genetic or biochemical markers
      that may be the cause of CHF. Your blood will be drawn either on an outpatient basis or
      during a routine visit to the hospital. If you already have a central line or an IV placed,
      the blood will be drawn at these sites to decrease the pain and discomfort of the blood draw.
      The information obtained in this study will not be put into your medical records.
