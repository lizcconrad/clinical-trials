  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rexin-G is a tumor-targeted (pathotropic or disease-seeking) nanoparticle that when injected
      intravenously, seeks out and accumulates in cancerous lesions, thus enhancing local drug
      concentration within tumors. The goal of the adaptive trial design is to confirm the over-all
      safety of Rexin-G and to determine the optimal dosing regimen for Rexin-G that would document
      the significant clinical benefits required to support a Phase II registration protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I/II clinical trial incorporates a Phase II component that will evaluate the
      efficacy of Rexin-G using an adaptive trial design. Each treatment cycle will be six weeks:
      four weeks of treatment and two weeks of rest. Unlike a standard Phase I protocol, eligible
      patients may have repeat cycles after the safety data and objective tumor response/s are
      recorded. Continued Rexin-G treatment will enable the targeted nanomedicine to catch up with
      tumor growth, halt disease progression, and reduce tumor burden. The treatment strategy is to
      achieve tumor control as quickly as safely possible. The goal of the adaptive trial design is
      to confirm the over-all safety of Rexin-G and to determine the optimal dosing regimen for
      Rexin-G that would document the significant clinical benefits required to support a Phase II
      registration protocol.
