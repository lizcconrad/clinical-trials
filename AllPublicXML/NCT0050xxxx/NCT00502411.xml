    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of radiation therapy
      plus low dose doxorubicin chemotherapy given after surgery is effective in the treatment of
      sarcoma. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

      Doxorubicin is a drug that is commonly used to treat certain kinds of cancer.

      The radiation treatment and chemotherapy will start around 4-6 weeks after surgery. During
      the study, you will receive radiation treatments 5 days a week for 6 - 61/2 weeks. On Day 1
      of each week of radiation therapy, you will be given doxorubicin through a continuous
      injection into a vein for 4 days in a row. A special tube is placed into a large vein in the
      neck or chest region or through a large vein in the arm. This is called a central venous
      line. A small pump is then used to give the drug. This pump is about the size of a pack of
      cigarettes. You will receive appropriate instructions for the maintenance of the pump. The
      doxorubicin and radiotherapy will be given on an outpatient basis at M. D. Anderson.

      If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, chemotherapy and/or
      radiation therapy may be stopped and you may be taken off the study. At that time, your
      doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

      Before the start of each week of treatment, you will have a physical exam and blood tests
      (around 2 tablespoons). You will also have a MRI to check on the status of the disease.

      After the study, you will have follow-up visits at M. D. Anderson every 3-4 months for the
      first 2 years after the study then every 6 months for the next 3 years. After that you will
      have follow-up visits once a year for the rest of your life to check on the status of the
      disease. At every follow-up visit you will have ultrasound scans. You will have a MRI at the
      first follow-up visit then only when the doctor feels it is necessary.

      This is an investigational study. Doxorubicin is FDA approved and is commercially available.
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients with cytological or histological proof of large (&gt; 5 cm), completely
             resected soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk (AJCC Stage IB, IIA, IIC, and
             III) will be eligible. Patients with stage IV sarcoma who are considered for primary
             tumor treatment with surgery and postoperative radiation are also eligible.

          2. Patients who have undergone pre-referral surgical resection or excisional biopsy with
             no measurable residual disease on appropriate radiological imaging will be eligible.
             The adequacy of the surgical resection will be evaluated at MDACC and re-excision will
             be performed as necessary. Negative surgical resection margins are desirable; positive
             margins, however, are allowable if re-excision would result in functional deficit.

          3. Patients may have received prior doxorubicin-based systemic chemotherapy up to a total
             doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m2. Inclusion of patients with a prior history of
             malignancy will be at the discretion of the Study Chairman.

          4. Patients must have a Karnofsky P.S. of &gt; 70 or a Zubrod P.S. of 0 or 1.

          5. Absolute neutrophil count must be &gt; 1,500 cells/mm; platelet count &gt; 100,000
             platelets/ml; serum creatinine &lt; 1.8 mg/dl, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase
             (SGOT)/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &lt; 3 x normal, total bilirubin &lt;
             1.5 mg/dl. For patients with cumulative doxorubicin 400 - 450 mg/m2, EF &gt; 50%.

          6. EKG (within 6 weeks of the planned start of treatment).

          7. Echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) (if prior doxorubicin
             treatment or history of either myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure).

          8. Patients must have no uncontrolled co-existing medical conditions.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast feeding and must
             practice adequate contraception.

         10. All patients must sign an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Patients with a history of prior radiotherapy in the area of the primary tumor or those
        in whom the anticipated radiation field would include the perineum, scrotum, or vaginal
        introitus will not be eligible.
