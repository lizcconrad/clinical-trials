    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to determine the effect on recovery after surgery of patients
      who received a standardized daily protocol of osteopathic manipulative treatment.Patients
      undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery were voluntarily enrolled in the study and
      assigned to one of three groups.One group received a standardized daily treatment protocol
      along with conventional care, another received daily similar placebo treatment with
      conventional care, and a final group received only conventional post surgical care.The
      research hypothesis was that daily treatment with osteopathic manipulative treatment would
      reduce hospital stay and hasten recovery from surgery.Persons in the treatment group had
      earlier discharge, and faster recovery of bowel function and basic mobility.

      Fifty-three persons were voluntarily enrolled into this randomized, double-blinded placebo
      controlled trial to examine the effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on the
      post operative recovery of persons undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
      surgery. Participants were assigned randomly to one of three cohorts: one with only
      conventiobnal treatment, one with a daily standardized protocol of OMT and a third with a
      daily time matched placebo OMT protocol.All patients received standard state of the art care
      consistent with national standards of post CABG care. The study showed favorable trends in
      terms of hospital length of stay , return of bowel function, and mobility.
