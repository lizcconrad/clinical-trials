  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will evaluate the safety profile of Xeloda as monotherapy for adjuvant
      treatment of colon cancer. All patients will receive Xeloda 1250mg/m2 p.o. twice daily as
      intermittent treatment (3 week cycles consisting of 2 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week
      without treatment). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target
      sample size is 500+ individuals.

    <description>The postmarketing safety profile of capecitabine was evaluated by collection of AEs, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, and other findings from physical examination. Abnormalities in these findings were captured as AEs, defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant regardless of the suspected cause. Serious AEs were those which, at any dose, met one or more of the following criteria: resulted in fatality, were life-threatening, necessitated new or prolonged existing hospitalization, produced persistent or significant disability, resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect, were considered medically significant, or required intervention to prevent any of the aforementioned outcomes. Those specific serious AEs which resulted in fatality were also reported separately. The percentage of participants with an AE, serious AE, or AE resulting in death was calculated as [number of participants with event divided by number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

          <description>Participants with resected Stage III colon cancer (Dukes C) or high-risk Stage II colon cancer (Dukes B) received capecitabine orally (PO) as 1250 milligrams per meter-squared (mg/m^2) twice daily, once in the morning and once at night, in this non-randomized postmarketing safety study. For those with moderate renal insufficiency at Baseline, the initial dose was reduced to 950 mg/m^2 twice daily. Each 3-week cycle comprised 2 weeks of continuous treatment followed by a 1-week break, and treatment continued for up to 8 cycles (24 weeks) or until relapse, new-onset colon cancer, or unacceptable toxicity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE), Serious AE, or Death Due to an AE</title>
        <description>The postmarketing safety profile of capecitabine was evaluated by collection of AEs, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, and other findings from physical examination. Abnormalities in these findings were captured as AEs, defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant regardless of the suspected cause. Serious AEs were those which, at any dose, met one or more of the following criteria: resulted in fatality, were life-threatening, necessitated new or prolonged existing hospitalization, produced persistent or significant disability, resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect, were considered medically significant, or required intervention to prevent any of the aforementioned outcomes. Those specific serious AEs which resulted in fatality were also reported separately. The percentage of participants with an AE, serious AE, or AE resulting in death was calculated as [number of participants with event divided by number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>
