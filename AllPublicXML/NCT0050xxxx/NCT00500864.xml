  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary magnesium (Mg) intake has been shown to be independently related to lung function,
      airway reactivity, and respiratory symptoms in the general population. Inhaled Mg and IV Mg
      administration have been shown to promote bronchodilation and to improve lung function in
      asthmatic patients. Some studies have suggested that COPD patients exhibit decreased body
      levels of Mg. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of acute IV Mg
      loading on parameters of respiratory function and maximal exercise capacity of stable COPD
      patients.The study hypothesis is that Mg administration will be associated to improvements on
      airflow and vasodilation leading to improvements of pulmonary function and exercise
      performance.

      Patients are required to have a diagnosis of COPD according to the Global Initiative for
      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Twenty five
      patients are going to be included. They are going to come to the laboratory to receive IV
      placebo or IV Mg sulfate at two distinct occasions about 48 hours apart. Half of the patients
      are going to receive Mg first and Placebo at the second day, while the other half are going
      to receive the treatments in an inverse order. Tests are going to be performed before and
      about 40 minutes after the IV infusions. Tests to be performed are: spirometry, arterial
      blood gases, Mg plasma level measurements, and a maximal exercise test protocol in
      cycloergometer.
