      To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237
      when given by mouth (PO) for a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 21 consecutive days, followed by
      a 14-day recovery period.

      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, phase 1 study of MLN8237 in adult
      patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will be the first to administer MLN8237 to
      humans. MLN8237 will be given daily for 7 to 21 consecutive days followed by a 14-day
      recovery period (cycle length = 21 to 35 days). Patients will continue to receive repeated
      cycles of MLN8237 as long as their disease has not progressed and they have not experienced
      unacceptable MLN8237-related toxicity. The dose of MLN8237 will be increased in successive
      cohorts of 3 to 6 patients until a maximum tolerated dose of MLN8237 has been identified.
      Once a maximum tolerated dose has been identified for 7 consecutive days of treatment, a
      total of 9 to 12 patients will be treated at that dose to better define its safety, PK, and
      pharmacodynamics. Longer periods of dosing with MLN8237 then will be evaluated, with an
      increase from 7 to 14 days, and, if feasible, to 21 days. Intermediate lengths of dosing may
      also be evaluated. A 14-day recovery period will follow each dosing period regardless of its
      duration.

    <description>MLN8237 will be supplied in capsules of 5 or 25 mg and will be given on an empty stomach, with patients remaining nothing by mouth except for water and prescribed medications for 2 hours before and 1 hour after each dose. Each dose will be given by mouth with 8 ounces of water for 7 to 21 consecutive days. A 14-day recovery period will follow each dosing period regardless of its duration.</description>

             history of small intestine surgery, and celiac disease.

          -  History of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result in

          -  Difficulty swallowing capsules

          -  Inability to take nothing by mouth except for water and prescribed medications for 2
             hours before and 1 hour after each dose of MLN8237

          -  Received more than 4 previous cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens including regimens
             used as adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapies. There is no limit on the number of
             noncytotoxic therapies (eg, hormonal and immunologic) that patients may have received.
             Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, Tarceva and Iressa®) are considered noncytotoxic

             phosphatase (ALP) &gt;2.5 times the ULN. Both the AST and ALP may be elevated up to 5
             times the ULN if their elevation can be reasonably ascribed to the presence of
             metastatic disease to liver and/or to bone; however, the ALT must in all circumstances
             be &lt;2.5 times the ULN

             inability to restrict consumption of alcohol to no more than 1 standard unit of
             alcohol per day during the study and for 30 days from the last dose of study
             treatment. A standard unit of alcohol is defined as one 12-oz (150mL) beer, 1.5 oz
             (45mL) of 80-proof alcohol, or one 6-oz (175mL) glass of wine.
