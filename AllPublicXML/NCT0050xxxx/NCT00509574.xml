    <textblock>
      The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, played
      an important role in lipid-lowering therapy and reduction of cardiovascular risks. However,
      it has been observed that the response to statin therapy varies from patient to patient, and
      gene polymorphism could have contributed to the variation.

      Hyperlipidemic patients are retrospectively screened from 2006/1/1 to 2006/12/31. The patient
      is included if he or she had been receiving atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for at least 3
      months and did not receive other lipid-lowering medications 4 weeks before starting
      atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Genomic DNA was collected from the blood sample of each patient
      using genomic DNA purification kit. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
      determined afterward.

      The correlation between response of statin therapy, defined as changes in lipid profiles
      including triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol, and SNPs examined.
