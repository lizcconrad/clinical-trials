      RATIONALE: SB939 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of SB939 in treating
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of oral SB939 in patients with solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the toxic effects of SB939 and its association with dose and
           pharmacokinetics.

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of SB939.

        -  To assess preliminary evidence of antitumor effects of SB939 in patients with measurable
           disease as documented by objective response.

        -  To establish proof-of-principle for SB939 effects on histone acetylation by evaluation
           of histone acetylation and other biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
           (PBMCs) at all dose levels.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral SB939 once daily on days 1-5 and 15-19. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies. Samples are analyzed for levels of SB939 via LC-MS/MS method and
      levels of acetylated histone 3 (AcH3), target effect, downstream consequences, and tumor
      response via western blot, immunohistochemistry, or ELISA methods.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
