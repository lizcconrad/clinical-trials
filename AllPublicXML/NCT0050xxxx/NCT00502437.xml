      Antigagging effect of kytril (granisetron) an antiemetic drug in dental situations

      Gagging in dental situations can be a problem to the patient and the operating dentist. There
      are not proven methods of eliminating this reflex which sometimes will not allow routine
      quality dental care.

      Pharmacological and behavioral approaches to eliminate this reflex have been tried with
      limited success.

      This suggested study will test a potent antiemetic drug used in other clinical situations
      such as antineoplastic treatment. Granisetron is a potential antagonist for the
      5-hydroxytryptamine3-receptor - 5HT(3), The drug binds to the receptor and blocks the effect
      of nausea and vomiting. Kytril mechanism of action was successfully proven for various
      medical situations as a potential antiemetic agent. Our Center for dental sedation and
      anesthesia in the oral medicine department have received approval to use Granisetron as an
      antigagging drug in dental situations based on several pilot studies conducted in other
      medical centers in different clinical situations such as strabismus corrections, post
      hysterectomy and others. Our preliminary clinical impression is that pre-emptive IV
      administration of this drug to patients with increased gag reflex is beneficial.

      In our research we try to investigate the possibility of using kytril in dental situations.

      In the first stage of this research we will study the INTRAVENOUS use of this drug and its
      effects On normal subjects compare them to themselves with placebo. According to the results
      of this study we will go on to the second stage of the research and try the same drug under
      oral administration.

      The purpose of this study is to test the antigagging effect of this drug in a controlled
      manner in dental situations.

      Our working hypothesis is that administration of this drug in dental situations with success,
      will allow many patients to receive good dental care
