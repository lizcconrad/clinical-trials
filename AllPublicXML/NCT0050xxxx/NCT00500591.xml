  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that women who are obese are at higher risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the
      lining of the uterus or womb). The goal of this clinical research study is to find out how
      common abnormalities of the endometrium are in women who are considered obese and to find out
      if those same abnormalities are less common in women who are considered to be thin.
      Researchers would like to learn if obese patients have symptoms (like irregular menstrual
      cycles) that may mean there could be an abnormality present. Researchers would also like to
      know if obese women have access to regular female exams and whether they routinely go to
      their primary care doctors.

      Women in this study will be asked to complete three different parts of the study. All three
      parts of the study will be done during one visit to the gynecology center. First, you will be
      asked to complete a survey/questionnaire that will give researchers information on your
      background, weight history, gynecologic, and medical history. You will be assisted by a
      research nurse and completion of the questionnaire is expected take about 30 minutes.

      Second, you will be asked to have a blood sample drawn. About 2 tablespoons of blood will be
      drawn. This blood will be used to look at different hormone levels that may be related to
      your risk of endometrial abnormalities.

      Third, an endometrial biopsy will be performed by one of the doctors running the study. This
      will require you to have a full pelvic exam (much like when you have a pap smear), which will
      include looking at the cervix (mouth of the womb) and putting a small pipelle (straw) into
      the womb to collect a tissue sample. This procedure is routinely done in the office. You will
      not be required to take medications prior to the procedure and you will not receive a
      prescription for pain medication once the procedure is complete.

      Completion of all three parts of the study may take between one to two hours. You and your
      physician will be notified of your endometrial biopsy results.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. All
      will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
