  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor response was assessed at Week 8 and every 8 weeks to Week 48 and 3 monthly thereafter until disease progression; median follow-up time was 34 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best response of complete response or partial response. Disease assessments are based on investigator review of scans using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.0 criteria. A complete or partial response was confirmed no less than 4-weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Participants with no post-baseline assessment were considered non-responders.
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions, or, the disappearance of all target lesions but persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease (PD) and no new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response by 17 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 17</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with a best response of complete response or partial response by Week 17. Disease assessments are based on investigator review of scans using modified RECIST V1.0 criteria. A complete or partial response was confirmed no less than 4-weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Participants with no post-baseline assessment were considered non-responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor response was assessed at Week 8 and every 8 weeks to Week 48 and 3 monthly thereafter until disease progression; median follow-up time was 34 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants whose best response was either a complete or partial response or stable disease, based on modified RECIST v1.0 criteria as assessed by the Investigator.
Stable diease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD of target lesions and no progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesions, or, the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions not qualifying for either CR or PD if no target lesions were identified at Baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor response was assessed at Week 8 and every 8 weeks to Week 48 and 3 monthly thereafter until disease progression; median follow-up time was 34 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was calculated only for those participants who had a confirmed complete or partial response, and is defined as the time from first confirmed response to first observed progression. For participants who responded and did not progress by the analysis data cut-off date, duration of response was censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date. Duration of response was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Initial Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor response was assessed at Week 8 and every 8 weeks to Week 48 and 3 monthly thereafter until disease progression; median follow-up time was 34 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response is the time from the date of enrollment to the date of first confirmed complete or partial response. Participants with a best response of stable disease at the analysis data cut-off date were censored at their last assessment of SD and participants with all other categories of best response were censored at the maximum observed time to a first confirmed response among all responders. Time to initial objective response was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 18 June 2009; median follow-up time was 34 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is the time from the date of enrollment to the date of first observed progression or death, whichever comes first. Participants who were alive and did not progress by the analysis data cut-off date were censored at the last evaluable disease assessment date. Progression-free survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Disease Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 18 June 2009; median follow-up time was 34 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression is the time from the enrollment date to the date of first observed progression. For participants who had not progressed by the analysis data cutoff date, time to progressive disease was censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date. Time to disease progression was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor response was assessed at Week 8 and every 8 weeks to Week 48 and 3 monthly thereafter until disease progression; median follow-up time was 34 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of stable disease was calculated only for participants with a best response of stable disease and is defined as the time from enrollment to first observed PD. For participants who did not progress by the analysis data cut-off date, duration of SD was censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date. Duration of stable disease was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 18 June 2009; median follow-up time was 34 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to treatment failure is defined as the time from enrollment to the date the decision was made to end the treatment phase for any reason. For participants who remained in the treatment phase at the analysis data cut-off date, time to treatment failure was censored at the date of their last on-study assessment. Time to treatment failure was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.</description>

    <measure>Time to Disease Relapse Following Surgical Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 18 June 2009; median follow-up time was 34 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated only for those participants who underwent surgical intervention, and defined as the time from the date of first post-intervention radiographic disease assessment to the date of first observed PD. Participants with no post-intervention disease assessment had their time to relapse set to zero and censored in the analysis. Participants that had evidence of progression / recurrence at their first post-intervention disease assessment had a time to relapse of zero. For participants who had not progressed by the analysis data cut-off date, time to relapse was censored at the date of their last evaluable disease assessment. Time to relapse was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier metjhods.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate</title>
        <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best response of complete response or partial response. Disease assessments are based on investigator review of scans using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.0 criteria. A complete or partial response was confirmed no less than 4-weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Participants with no post-baseline assessment were considered non-responders.
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions, or, the disappearance of all target lesions but persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease (PD) and no new lesions.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
