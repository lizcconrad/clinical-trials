      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells may help the body build an effective
      immune response to kill non-small cell lung cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the effects of gp96-Ig vaccine therapy in treating
      patients with stage III, stage IV, or relapsed non-small cell lung cancer treated with
      first-line chemotherapy.

      Overall Goals:

      - to evaluate the safety and induction of anti-tumor immunity by administration of an
      immunogenic human tumor cell vaccine, and assess immune response in relation to clinical
      outcome.

      Primary Aim:

      - to evaluate the safety of administering a heat shock protein gp96-Ig-secreting allogeneic
      tumor cell-vaccine (gp96-Ig vaccine) in patients with advanced NSCLC.

      Secondary Aims:

        -  to study the immune response to vaccination,

        -  to monitor clinical responses and

        -  to recommend a dose-schedule combination for further testing in an initial Phase II
           trial of vaccine efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically confirmed NSCLC (squamous, adeno-, large cell anaplastic,
             bronchoalveolar, and non-small cell carcinoma NOS): stage IIIB with malignant pleural
             effusion, stage IV, or recurrent disease.

          -  At least one site of bi-dimensionally measurable disease.

          -  Metastasis if present and treated must be stable by CT scan or MRI for at least 8
             weeks.

          -  Patient must have received and failed at least one line of chemotherapy.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months.

          -  Laboratory parameters:

               -  Hemoglobin levels &gt;= 10.0 (transfusions allowed if necessary).

          -  Immune deficiency syndromes, including the following: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's disease, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, polymyositis,
             glomerulonephritis.

          -  Any patient enrolled on study whose respiratory symptoms have experienced marked
             deterioration not related to a known cause, such as pneumonia, congestive heart
             failure, or pulmonary embolism, will have a repeat PFT evaluation, and if the above
             parameter values for FeV1, DLCO, or PCO2 are seen, will be excluded from further
