  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 trial is evaluating the antineoplastic activity of tivozanib (AV-951) in
      treating patients with recurrent or metastatic renal cell cancer. Tivozanib (AV-951) is a
      VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 200 patients will be enroled into the initial, 16 week, open-label period using
      1.5 mg/day dosing. Patients will receive tivozanib (AV-951) continuously for 3 weeks followed
      by 1 week off study drug. Patients will undergo disease assessment at baseline and after
      Cycles 2 and 4 and response will be determined by RESIST criteria.

      After the initial, 16 week open-label period, disease status will be assessed and compared to
      baseline using modified RECIST criteria:

        -  Patients with greater than or equal to 25% tumor shrinkage will continue on their
           current dose of tivozanib (AV-951)

        -  Patients with less than 25% tumor change (growth or shrinkage) will be randomly assigned
           to double-blind tivozanib (AV-951) or matching placebo for 12 weeks

        -  Patients with greater than or equal to 25% tumor growth will be discontinued
