    <textblock>
      The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has awarded cooperative agreements to 6
      sites from across the country (Salt Lake City, UT, Molokai, HI, Houston, TX, Newark, NJ,
      Detroit, MI, and Baltimore City) to participate in a national 4-year demonstration (September
      15, 2006 to September 30, 2010). One goal of the demonstration is to reduce disparities in
      cancer treatment among seniors from U.S. racial and ethnic minority populations. Each site
      will focus on a specific racial/ethnic minority group, and collaborate with CMS in project
      implementation. A Core questionnaire, the Cancer Screening Assessment (CSA) will be
      administered at baseline to all participants in the demonstration. Participant
      identification, randomization, and intervention implementation will be standardized across
      sites.

      Goal: The proposal developed by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in
      collaboration with the Baltimore City Community Health Coalition is designed to address
      persistent disparities in breast, cervix, colon/rectum, prostate and lung cancer treatment.

      Primary Objective: Conduct A CONTROL RANDOMIZED TRIAL within a randomized control
      demonstration project (N = 200) to compare the efficacy of 2 interventions that differ in
      intensity to improve continuity and outcomes of care among African Americans seniors. Among
      African American seniors, compared to a less intensive intervention (general information and
      educational materials), does the addition of facilitation services delivered by a health
      coordinator result in a greater improvement in adherence to recommended treatment among those
      diagnosed with breast, cervix, colon/rectum, prostate, or lung cancer?

      Study Population: We will recruit African Americans, age 65 years or older, and currently
      enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. (Baltimore City's 82,202 seniors represent 13% of its
      population, and account for 68% of the City's cancer deaths. Among these seniors, 96% have
      Medicare Parts A and B, 54.5% have income levels at less than 250% of the federal poverty
      guideline, and 55.6% are African American.)

      The trial consists of individuals diagnosed with breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate, or
      lung cancer. Eligible participants will respond to a baseline questionnaire, the Cancer
      Screening Assessment (CSA). They will then be randomized to receive a less intensive or more
      intensive intervention. The less intensive group will receive general information about
      cancer and Medicare covered services and instructions to discuss the information with their
      primary care doctor. The more intensive group will receive the same information as the less
      intensive group receives, plus tailored facilitation services delivered by a nurse-supervised
      community health worker. The primary outcome variable for the trial will be the difference
      between randomized groups in adherence to treatment for breast, cervix, colon/rectum,
      prostate and lung cancer.

      A community advisory committee will guide all aspects of the study and will include important
      stake holders (both public and private sectors), representatives from the Baltimore City
      Community Health Coalition, the Baltimore City Department of Health, the Maryland Department
      of Health and Mental Hygiene, community leaders, consumers, health care providers
      (physicians, oncologists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, social workers,
      pathologists) and academicians.

      Among African American seniors, compared to a less intensive intervention (general
      information and educational materials), does the addition of facilitation services delivered
      by a health coordinator result in a greater improvement in adherence to recommended treatment
      among those diagnosed with breast, cervix, colon/rectum, prostate, or lung cancer?

      Background The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) received congressional
      authorization to launch a nationwide demonstration project to address persistent disparities
      in cancer treatment among racial and ethnic minority populations. Hopkins was selected as one
      of six national sites to conduct a demonstration project designed to test an intervention
      strategy to promote adherence to cancer treatment.

      Aim This demonstration project will evaluate the efficacy of a health coordinator model. We
      will conduct A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL testing the efficacy of the intervention for
      African American seniors diagnosed with cancer. The duration of follow-up post-randomization
      will be from date of randomization and September 30th, 2010, the end date for the
      demonstration.

      This randomized controlled trial will compare the efficacy of a less intensive intervention
      (general information and educational materials in the context of &quot;usual care&quot;) to that of a
      more intensive intervention, the addition of a health coordinator (HC), in promoting
      adherence to treatment among African American seniors who have been diagnosed with breast,
      cervix, colon/rectum, prostate or lung cancer.

      The primary outcome variable for the trial will be the difference between the two
      intervention groups in the time to initiation of therapy, beginning on the date of
      randomization.

      Population: The study population will consist of a convenience sample of 200 individuals
      diagnosed with breast, cervix, colon, lung or prostate cancer, and who intend to receive
      their cancer treatment from either Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) or from Johns Hopkins Bayview
      Medical Center (JHBMC).

      The sampling frame will be restricted to African American Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and
      older, enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, but not enrolled in managed care (Medicare Part
      C), hospice, or some other extended care facility. With a population of 651,154, African
      Americans constitute 64% of Baltimore City's total population44. Additionally, 13.2% of
      Baltimoreans are age 65 or older, and this accounts for 68% of the City's cancer deaths.
