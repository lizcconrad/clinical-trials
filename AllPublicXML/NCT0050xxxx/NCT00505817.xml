  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the two different protocols
      (long protocol vs antagonist protocol) on oocyte / embryo quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cycles with antagonists of the GnRHa present a series of advantages with respect the
      GnRHa in an oocyte donation program: treatment cycles are simpler and shorter, a lower amount
      of dose of gonadotrophins is needed for stimulation, and most important, a decreased rate of
      ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is observed. Nevertheless, several clinical trials relate
      their use to a greater rate of abortion and worse oocyte/ embryo quality. In order to
      discriminate the endometrial factor from the quality of oocyte cohort, the best strategy is
      the oocyte donation model. In the present study, for the first time, the effect of different
      protocols (long versus antagonist protocol) will be studied in the same donor, acting as its
      own control, undergoing COH. We will compare the COHÂ´s parameters and IVF outcome obtained in
      the same donor submitted to, firstly, GnRH antagonist protocol (Cetrorelix- n= 45) versus
      another consecutive cycle with long protocol (Ac. Leuprolide- n= 45).
