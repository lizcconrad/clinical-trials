  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the use of local anesthetic to numb the nerves
      that run deeper in the abdominal wall gives better post operative pain control than just
      infiltrating local anesthetic to the wound edges.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local anesthetic is often administered during an operation to reduce post operative wound
      pain. Whilst this is frequently done during an appendectomy there is currently no evidence to
      suggest whether there is any benefit to the patient to injecting the local anesthetic deeper
      to block the nerves supplying abdominal wall sensation, compared to using it just in the skin
      around the wound.

      Comparison: Post operative pain scores following appendectomy for patients given skin
      infiltration of local anesthetic (pre incision), compared to patients given both preincision
      wound infiltration and deeper field infiltration with local anesthetic(deep to external
      oblique).
