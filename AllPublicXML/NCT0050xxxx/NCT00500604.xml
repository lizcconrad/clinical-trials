  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300/25mg
      against valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 160/25mg in reducing mean systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      as measured by home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) after 24 weeks compared with baseline.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To compare the percentage of patients with normal blood pressure as measured by HBPM and
           at the doctor's office at weeks 16 and 24

        -  To compare the differences in mean Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), mean morning and
           evening SBP and DBP evaluated by HBPM at weeks 16 and 24

        -  To compare the difference in mean SBP evaluated by HBPM at week 16

        -  To compare the differences in mean SBP and DBP evaluated at the doctor's office at weeks
           16 and 24

        -  To determine the incidence and severity of adverse events
