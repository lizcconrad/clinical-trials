  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The purpose of this trial is to investigate if there is
      any change in the mechanism of energy expenditure (i.e. the way in which energy is used) in
      patients with type 1 diabetes, whilst taking two different, commercially available insulins
      for the treatment of their diabetes.

      The study had been temporarily halted due to an unplanned interim analysis. The Sponsor is
      now aware that a further interim analysis has been performed by the site and therefore a
      decision has been made not to recommence the study

    <measure>Total Energy Expenditure, Double-labelled Water Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 14-16, weeks 30-32</time_frame>
    <description>Total energy expenditure (TEE) measured after each treatment period by the double-labelled water (DLW) method. This technique required subjects to label their body water using oral administration of water labelled with 2 stable isotopes (2H218O). The clearance of 2H and 18O was measured over a two week period with daily collections of urine. The difference between the clearance of 2H and 18O is a measure of CO2 production rate. This can be converted to provide a measure of energy expenditure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Energy Expenditure, Dietary Record Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 14-16, weeks 30-32</time_frame>
    <description>The total energy expenditure (TEE) measured after each treatment period by the dietary record method. The calculation of energy balance is accomplished by compiling an accurate record of food intake over a period of time and measuring any changes in body weight that occur during that time. Data from the 7-day food diary was used to calculate TEE.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Component of Total Energy Expenditure: Resting Energy Expenditure (REE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Resting energy expenditure (REE) is a component of TEE (total energy expenditure). It was measured at 2 different timepoints during the trial using indirect calorimetry (measurement of O2 consumption/CO2 production) after an overnight fast when subjects would be metabolising a mixture of carbohydrate and free fatty acid. This technique allowed the calculation of the rate of carbohydrate and lipid oxidation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Component of Total Energy Expenditure: Diet Induced Thermogenesis (DIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) is a component of TEE (total energy expenditure) and is the energy expenditure following feeding for anabolic processes. Subjects fasted overnight and rested for 1 hour. Multiple measurements of REE (resting energy expenditure) were taken. A fixed 600 kcal liquid meal was given and REE was measured over the next 3 hours. DIT was calculated as area under the curve of total REE-resting REE for the 3-hour period and was then converted to a per day measurement by taking into account each individual's average daily food intake.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Component of Total Energy Expenditure: Physical Activity Thermogenesis</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16, week 32</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity thermogenesis is a component of TEE (total energy expenditure). Subjects were asked not to change their physical activity levels. Physical activity thermogenesis can be calculated as the difference between TEE minus (REE + DIT), as long as volitional exercise is unchanged. Volitional exercise was assessed using Actiheart 3-D monitor readings. Subjects were asked to measure their normal activity for between 1 and 5 days prior to their visits at week 16 and week 32).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Component of Total Energy Expenditure: Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16, week 32</time_frame>
    <description>Non-exercise activity thermogenesis is a component of TEE (total energy expenditure). Thermic efficiency was assessed by measuring O2 consumption/CO2 production while the subject exercised on a bike for 20 minutes while hooked up to a device that recorded their respiration (visit in week 14 and week 30). If thermic efficiency was unchanged and volitional exercise was unchanged, then any change in physical activity thermogenesis was due to changes in NEAT.</description>

        <title>Total Energy Expenditure, Double-labelled Water Method</title>
        <description>Total energy expenditure (TEE) measured after each treatment period by the double-labelled water (DLW) method. This technique required subjects to label their body water using oral administration of water labelled with 2 stable isotopes (2H218O). The clearance of 2H and 18O was measured over a two week period with daily collections of urine. The difference between the clearance of 2H and 18O is a measure of CO2 production rate. This can be converted to provide a measure of energy expenditure.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on an ITT (Intent-to-Treat) analysis set. The ITT analysis set consisted of all subjects who received at least one post-treatment value of the primary endpoint.</population>

        <description>Resting energy expenditure (REE) is a component of TEE (total energy expenditure). It was measured at 2 different timepoints during the trial using indirect calorimetry (measurement of O2 consumption/CO2 production) after an overnight fast when subjects would be metabolising a mixture of carbohydrate and free fatty acid. This technique allowed the calculation of the rate of carbohydrate and lipid oxidation.</description>

        <title>Component of Total Energy Expenditure: Diet Induced Thermogenesis (DIT)</title>
        <description>Diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) is a component of TEE (total energy expenditure) and is the energy expenditure following feeding for anabolic processes. Subjects fasted overnight and rested for 1 hour. Multiple measurements of REE (resting energy expenditure) were taken. A fixed 600 kcal liquid meal was given and REE was measured over the next 3 hours. DIT was calculated as area under the curve of total REE-resting REE for the 3-hour period and was then converted to a per day measurement by taking into account each individual’s average daily food intake.</description>

          <description>Diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) is a component of TEE (total energy expenditure) and is the energy expenditure following feeding for anabolic processes. Subjects fasted overnight and rested for 1 hour. Multiple measurements of REE (resting energy expenditure) were taken. A fixed 600 kcal liquid meal was given and REE was measured over the next 3 hours. DIT was calculated as area under the curve of total REE-resting REE for the 3-hour period and was then converted to a per day measurement by taking into account each individual’s average daily food intake.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on an ITT (Intent-to-Treat) analysis set. The ITT analysis set consisted of all subjects who received at least one post-treatment value of the primary endpoint.</population>

Thermic efficiency was assessed by measuring O2 consumption/CO2 production while the subject exercised on a bike for 20 minutes while hooked up to a device that recorded their respiration (visit in week 14 and week 30).
