    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to identify potential improvements for a noninvasive
      method of diagnosing dysplasia and neoplasia in the cervix using Multi-spectral Digital
      Colposcopy (MDC), a device that uses fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy to compare
      images to histopathologic mapping of the cervical epithelium.

      Primary Objective:

      -To measure Multi-spectral Digital Colposcopy images in vivo of the cervix both before and
      after acetic acid in a screening population.This is a second generation research device with
      low significant risk for which we are studying MDC.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the effect of the fading of acetic acid in the image contrast obtained over
           time to see if this fading can predict the presence of any neoplasia.

        2. To evaluate mapping the cervix so that software can reconstruct the cervical epithelial
           map as evaluated by a Papanicolaou Smear to compare to routine colposcopic images as
           well as those from the Multi-spectral Digital Colposcopy (MDC).

      A colposcopy is an exam of the vagina and cervix using a magnifying lens. A multi-spectral
      digital colposcopy uses a digital camera and a special light to take pictures of the cervix
      and vagina.

      Before taking part in this study, you will have a complete medical history recorded. You will
      have a physical exam and a pap smear. Women who are able to have children must have a
      negative urine pregnancy test.

      You will then have a multi-spectral digital colposcopy performed during the routine
      colposcopy in the outpatient clinic. A multi-spectral digital colposcopy device will shine
      light on the cervix and vagina and take several pictures. The pictures will be used by the
      doctors to check the cells and structure of the tissue. After the first set of pictures,
      acetic acid (vinegar) will be applied to the cervix so any lesions would show up better.
      Application of acetic acid is a normal part of the colposcopy and not part of the research.
      About 1-2 minutes later, more pictures will be taken.

      If the acetic acid/colposcopy show abnormal cells, you will have a biopsy of the cervical
      canal.

      If the acetic acid /colposcopy show normal cells, no biopsy will be taken.

      Once you have completed the colposcopy with or without the biopsy of the cervical canal, your
      participation on this study is complete.

      If either your Pap smear or biopsy of the cervical canal is abnormal, the study doctor/staff
      will recommend further care or treatment.

    <description>Measurements of normal sites during colposcopy before and after the application of acetic acid using Multi-spectral Digital Colposcopy (MDC) images in vivo of the cervix both before and after acetic acid. Three images (white, blue, and green light) compared before and after acetic acid placement, the images may be compared to pathology obtained from a Pap Smear taken to evaluate the performance of the instrument.</description>
