      In the era of emerging antibiotics resistant microbiology, we look for better outcome in the
      treatment of infections in the elderly.

      We look for guidelines to manage an elderly who has a permanent urinary catheter, admitting
      to E.R. with Fever/Sepsis.

      We assume that exchanging the permanent urinary catheter prior to the Urine Culture sample as
      well as for initiating antibiotic treatment will improve the outcome of the patients.It could
      help the day-to-day fight for the proper antibiotics treatment to avoid resistance.
