  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than half of all lower extremity amputations are in persons with diabetes. These
      patients suffer from severe, diabetes-induced, peripheral, sensory neuropathy and, thus they
      frequently do not protect their feet from repetitive shear stress or traumatic episodes and
      ulceration often ensues. We have previously shown that the temperature profile of the plantar
      aspects of the foot provides a reliable warning of tissue injury and can be effectively used
      as a preventive modality. In this study we propose to further develop and clinically test a
      novel infrared-based temperature instrument (TempTouchRM®) that is intended for home use by
      high-risk diabetic patients. This step-on remote monitoring device will serve as an early
      warning system for impending ulcers and Charcot fractures. The study’s central hypothesis is
      that the TempTouchRM device will reduce the incidence of ulcers by providing an accurate,
      simple, and effective approach to monitor changes in foot temperatures.

      The study’s central hypothesis is that the TempTouchRM device will reduce the incidence of
      ulcers by providing an accurate, simple, and effective approach to monitor changes in foot
      temperatures. To study this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed:

      Aim 1: To develop, validate and implement software and protocols for the following: (i) data
      acquisition and processing, and (ii) the physician-TempTouchRM communications interface. A
      state-of-the-art web interface will be developed to allow clinicians to view the stored data
      for their patients.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the TempTouchRM in reducing the incidence of diabetic
      foot ulcers among high-risk patients. Our hypothesis is that patients monitored with the
      TempTouchRM will have fewer foot ulcers and that the ulcers will be less severe. The 110
      patient study will comprise two treatment arms: the standard therapy group and the enhanced
      therapy group The latter will receive standard care plus infrared temperature monitoring
      using the TempTouchRM daily for 12 months. Elevated temperatures will provide information to
      the physician that prevention practices should be initiated, such as off-loading, skin care,
      etc.

      Aim 3: To determine the normal range of temperature variations for each individual foot for
      patients in the Enhanced Therapy and to correlate deviations from this range to the incidence
      of ulcers. Our previous studies have used the contralateral foot as the control to detect
      abnormal temperatures. We will investigate the hypothesis that with proper trending of normal
      foot temperatures, the individual foot can serve as its own control for predicting ulcers.
