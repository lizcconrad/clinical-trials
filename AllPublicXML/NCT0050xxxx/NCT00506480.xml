      The purpose of this study is to determine whether endometrial receptivity markers obtained by
      endometrial sampling are effective in prediction of in vivo human embryo implantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of In vitro fertilization (IVF), substantial improvements have been
      developed in ovulation induction, oocyte retrieval, fertilization capability and embryonic
      development. However, the end point which is to improve implantation and pregnancy rates
      after transferring embryos, remains below physiological expectations. It has been estimated
      that clinical implantation in the human is efficient in no more than 30% of cases considering
      that only one embryo is present in natural cycles, which gives us a 30% implantation rate.

      A frequent pitfall found in the literature is the consideration that implantation is the
      result of good embryonic quality. Although this is completely true, it is not the only truth
      because the maternal endometrium is at least of equal relevance. In ovum donation, the
      endometrial factor could also be improved by individualizing the implantation window in each
      patient. In this proposed research we will analyze suggested markers of endometrial
      receptivity in order to optimize human implantation in patients undergoing assisted
      reproductive technologies focusing on improving endometrial receptivity in IVF and ovum
      donation patients.

    <intervention_name>endometrial sampling</intervention_name>
    <description>Endometrial biopsy is a procedure in which a tissue sample is obtained from the endometrium. This procedure is performed without anesthesia during pelvic examination. The cervix is cleaned with an antiseptic solution and then grasped with an instrument (tenaculum) to steady the uterus. A small, hollow plastic tube is gently passed into the uterine cavity. Gentle suction removes a sample of the lining. The tissue sample and instruments are removed, and the sample is examined by pathology, immunohistochemistry, PCR and western blotting.</description>
