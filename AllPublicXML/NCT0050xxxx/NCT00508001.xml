  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of ZD6474 in
      patients with Child-Pugh class A, inoperable HCC. This study comprises 2 phases, the primary
      treatment phase and the secondary treatment phase. The primary treatment phase is a
      randomised, double-blind, parallel-group phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      ZD6474 300 mg plus best support care (BSC), ZD6474 100 mg plus BSC, and placebo plus BSC. The
      secondary treatment phase is an open-label expanded access program of ZD6474. In the primary
      treatment phase, patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive ZD6474 300 mg plus
      BSC, ZD6474 100 mg plus BSC, or placebo plus BSC, respectively. Randomisation will be
      stratified on the basis of Cancer of the Liver Italian Programme (CLIP) tumour staging (CLIP
      score 0-2 versus 3-4). The primary treatment will continue until objective disease
      progression, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria, or
      until patients meet any other withdrawal or discontinuation criteria.The primary endpoint is
      tumour stabilisation rate, and the secondary endpoints are objective response rate,
      progression-free survival, and overall survival. The purpose of the secondary treatment phase
      is to expand the access of ZD6474 so that every patient who is enrolled into this study can
      have the chance to receive the active medicine.Once an individual patient has progressive
      disease in the primary treatment phase, the blind will be broken for this patient. If this
      patient is in the ZD6474 100 mg arm or placebo arm, the patient will be offered the secondary
      treatment with ZD6474 300 mg per day. If this patient is randomised to the ZD6474 300 mg arm,
      the study medication will be discontinued unless the patient wishes to remain the treatment,
      and the patient is to be followed up for survival.

          <title>Child-Pugh Score</title>
          <description>Child-Pugh Scale is used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver disease. The total score employs five clinical measures of liver disease: severity of ascites and of encephalopathy, abnormality in the serum bilirubin, serum albumin and clotting times. Each measure is scored 1-3, with 3 indicating most severe derangement.
The Total score ranges between 5 min to 15 max where lower score = less liver disease and higher score = chronic liver disease.
The number of patients with Child-PughTotal score of 5 and 6 is presented.</description>

          <description>Cancer of the Liver Italian Programme (CLIP) is used to evaluate both tumour extension and remnant liver function with a score of min 0 to max 4. The CLIP score consists of 4 variables: Child-Pugh stage, tumour morphology, alpa-fetoprotein (AFP), and portal vein thrombosis. The higher the CLIP score the worse the survival.
The number of patients with CLIP Total score of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 is presented.</description>
