    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the prescription treatment
      compared to the non-prescription treatment. It is hypothesized that the prescription
      treatment will have a significantly greater effect than the non-prescription treatment on
      decreasing excess sweating.
