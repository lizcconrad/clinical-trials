  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational trial, aimed at testing the safety and performance of a
      electrostimulating device (&quot;GenNarino&quot;) to treat dry mouth, over one year. The design is as
      follows:

        -  Multi-center, double blind, sham (placebo) controlled, about 10 xerostomia patients per
           center

        -  Patients receive a GenNarino (and its remote control) that is programmed for one month
           sham and one month active mode (the order of which is randomly assigned), and thereafter
           9 months at the active mode (divided in period of 3 months, the order of each is
           randomly assigned at wearing GenNarino for 1, 5 or 10 minutes at a time).

      Study hypothesis: Gennarino will lead to significant symptomatic improvement

      - At the clinic: monthly examinations at the first 2 months, and then every 3 months,
      including whole saliva collection and questionnaire; at the first visit impression taking for
      GenNarino preparation

    <textblock>
      The clinical trial, titled &quot;Safety and performance evaluation of an electro-stimulator
      mounted on an intra-oral removable appliance (GenNarino) for the treatment of xerostomia&quot; is
      a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled multi-center trial, followed by an
      open-label study. Study subjects are patients with xerostomia. The purpose of the trial is to
      test the safety and efficacy of electrostimulation using the GenNarino device.

      The primary endpoint is significant symptomatic improvement, and the secondary ones,
      increased salivary output and event free use (no adverse side-effects). The clinical
      follow-up consists of periodic clinical examinations.

      In this clinical trial the use of the device is compared between active vs. sham mode for one
      month each in a double-blind design (Stage I). Thereafter, at Stage II the xerostomia
      relieving effect of the active device is assessed in an open label design for additional 6
      months. Clinic- and home-based questionnaires and whole saliva collections are performed.
