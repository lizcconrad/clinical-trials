      the objective of this study is to determine if the use of The Harmonic™ (an ultrasonic
      surgical instrument) in abdominolipectomy (tummy tuck)reduces volume and duration of wound
      drainage after surgery when compared to electrocautery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominolipectomy is performed to correct abdominal skin and fat redundancy and muscle
      diastases. Persistent serous wound drainage and seromas are the most common complications in
      abdominolipectomy. The rate of serous fluid collection determines the time drains need to
      remain in place. Although suction drains reduce seroma formation, prolonged use can delay
      healing, cause injury, and increase the risk of retrograde infection and patient discomfort.
      Wound drainage has a direct correlation with seroma formation. The loss of protein nutrients
      and minerals in the serum drained is also a concern with prolonged drainage that can result
      in healing delays.

      The Harmonic™ technology uses ultrasonic energy that allows both cutting and coagulating at
      the precise point of application. The Harmonic™ has been used since 1992 predominantly in
      urology and gastro-intestinal surgery (laparoscopic surgery). Significantly reduced serous
      drainage in a number of general surgery procedures such as superficial and total
      parotidectomy; thyroidectomy; tonsillectomy; pectoralis major myocutaneous flap dissection;
      axillary dissection; and lymphadenectomy have been reported with the use Harmonic™.

      The Harmonic™ has also been used in parotidectomy and maxillofacial surgery, but its use has
      been seldom mentioned in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery. Recent use of the
      Harmonic™ has shown promise in plastic and reconstructive surgery in dissection of the
      pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and total body lifts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible for this clinical research study must fulfill all of the following
        criteria:

             reasons

          -  Able to comprehend and sign the study informed consent form

          -  Able to return for all study mandated postoperative visits (3-4 days after the removal
             of drains, as well as 15 ± 2 days, and 30 ± 5 days after surgery); and

          -  Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with any of the following criteria are not eligible to participate in this
