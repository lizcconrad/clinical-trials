  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients are commonly treated with drugs that eggs present in the ovary and may
      reduce their chance for getting pregnant. Their fertility can be preserved by stimulating
      their ovaries, collecting multiple eggs, fertilize them in the lab and freeze them. Ovarian
      stimulation increase their estrogen levels in blood.this may stimulate their cancer and
      increase chance for recurrence. If a medicine that prevent estrogen rise is used (letrozole),
      this may increase the safety of stimulation. In this study we compared ovarian stimulation in
      breast cancer patients using letrozole with those who did not undergo stimulation and showed
      that there is no increase risk for recurrence after a median follow up of 2 years

      215 women with breast cancer were evaluated for fertility preservation before chemotherapy.
      Of those, 79 elected to undergo controlled ovarian stimulation (COH) with letrozole and
      gonadotropins for embryo or oocyte cryopreservation. The 136 patients who declined served as
      controls.There were no significant differences between the study and control groups regarding
      age at diagnosis, breast cancer prognostic parameters (tumor size, grade, number of positive
      lymph nodes, estrogen receptor status, her2-neu overexpression and vascular space invasion),
      and chemotherapy regimens. There was no difference between the two groups in the projected 10
      year relapse, breast cancer specific mortality or overall mortality. There were 3 recurrences
      or contralateral breast cancers (2 distant, 1 locoregional) in the letrozole group, and 11 in
      the control group (9 distant, 1 locoregional, 1 contralateral breast).

      Comparison; breast cancer patients that underwent ovarian stimulation with
      letrozole+gonadotropins and those who declined ovarian stimulation.
