    <textblock>
      this study was designed to evaluate the effect of routine excision of the ilioinguinal nerve
      in an attempt to decrease the incidence of chronic inguinodynia in patients who undergo open
      anterior hernia mesh repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As chronic pain is the 2nd most common complication following open hernia repairs and it
      causes limitations and dysfunctions for the patients and also according to some previous
      studies elective ilioinguinal neurectomy could result in less postoperative pain,we decided
      to perform a randomized double blind clinical trial.The primary goal of this study was
      evaluation of the effect of this type of neurectomy on postoperative pain and hyposthesia.
