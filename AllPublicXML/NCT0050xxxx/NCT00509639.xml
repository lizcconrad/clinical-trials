    <textblock>
      Anorectal Crohn's disease is one of the most problematic and debilitating conditions
      encountered in colorectal practise. The condition is usually chronic, debilitating, and
      frequently refractory to current medications. Failure to respond to medical therapy may
      ultimately result in proctocolectomy and ileostomy, even in the absence of more proximal
      colonic disease. Isolated anorectal Crohn's disease is reported in 3 to 5% of Crohn's
      patients. In Crohn's patients as a whole, anorectal involvement is reported in up to one
      third to one half of patients, in addition to either colonic or enteric Crohn's disease. In
      spite of the previously reported painless nature of anorectal Crohn's disease, it is the
      author's experience that the condition can be inordinately painful due to deeply eroding
      fissures, oedematous skin tags, and painful induration of the perianal region.
