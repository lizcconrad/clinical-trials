    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. The maximum time participants were followed was 11.07 months.</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is defined by the percentage of participants achieving either a confirmed tumor reponse or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks. Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is a system for measuring tumor shrinkage or progression in terms of the longest dimensions of the tumor on imaging scans such as computerized tomography (CT). A &quot;partial response&quot; requires a decrease of 30% or more, &quot;Progression&quot; requires an increase of at least 20%, and &quot;Stable disease&quot; falls in between these two. All responses have a repeat assessment to confirm the response.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. The maximum time participants were followed was 11.07 months.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dose date until the date of disease progression or death due to any reason, whichever occurs first.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent;

          -  Female ≥18 years;

          -  Pathology that has histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IIIb/c
             or stage IV disease;

             • If recurrent disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature
             should be confirmed by cytology or histology.

          -  Documented overexpression of Her2(ErbB2) of IHC 3+ or FISH positive, in primary or
             metastatic tumor tissue is required for enrollment into the study; by local testing or
             central laboratory testing determined by country of residence. NB. Approximately, 51
             subjects will be enrolled in a single stage design to test for efficacy in women from
             China and Hong Kong. Due to the fact that trastuzumab is not commonly prescribed in
             China and Hong Kong, the current study allows up to 40% of subjects who are
             trastuzumab naïve to be enrolled.

          -  Prior therapies must include at minimum a taxane and/or anthracycline and may include
             trastuzumab if available; other prior regimens are not limited except capecitabine and
             ErbB1/Erbb2 inhibitors other than trastuzumab. Chemo regimen requirements are as
             follows:

               -  Taxane containing regimen for at least 4 cycles or &lt;4 cycles provided disease
                  progression or treatment limiting toxicity occurred while on taxane

               -  Anthracycline containing regimen for at least 4 cycles or &lt;4 cycles provided
                  disease progression or treatment limiting toxicity occurred while on
                  anthracycline

               -  Taxanes and Anthracyclines may have been administered concurrently or separately

               -  Prior treatment may have contained trastuzumab alone or in combination with other
                  chemotherapy in the adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting and patient
                  must have failed the treatment

               -  Prior treatment with capecitabine is not permitted unless 6 months have elapsed
                  since the last dose of capecitabine and the subject is free of any capecitabine
                  related toxicity

               -  Prior therapy with an ErbB1 and/or ErbB2 inhibitor, other than trastuzumab is not
                  permitted

               -  Other prior chemo-regimens not listed above are unlimited.

          -  For those subjects whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ one of following criteria should be
             met.

               -  Subjects who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this
                  therapy and the hormonal treatment must have been stopped before the first dose
                  of investigational treatment

               -  Subjects with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., subjects with
                  liver or lung metastases)

               -  Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the
                  investigator

          -  Subjects with stable CNS metastases (asymptomatic and off systemic steroids and
             anticonvulsants for at least 3 months) are eligible

          -  Measurable lesion(s) according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors);

             must have been stopped within 2 weeks prior to initiation of any investigational
             treatment. All subjects must have recovered from all radiotherapy related toxicities
             prior to initiation of any investigational treatment. The site of radiotherapy must
             not be used as a site of measurable disease;

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range of normal as measured by
             echocardiogram. MUGA scans will be accepted in cases where an echocardiogram cannot be

          -  Unresolved or unstable, serious toxicity from prior administration of another
             investigational drug and/or of prior cancer treatment;

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or

        <title>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</title>
        <description>CBR is defined by the percentage of participants achieving either a confirmed tumor reponse or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks. Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is a system for measuring tumor shrinkage or progression in terms of the longest dimensions of the tumor on imaging scans such as computerized tomography (CT). A &quot;partial response&quot; requires a decrease of 30% or more, &quot;Progression&quot; requires an increase of at least 20%, and &quot;Stable disease&quot; falls in between these two. All responses have a repeat assessment to confirm the response.</description>
