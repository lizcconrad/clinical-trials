  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of BIO 300 capsules when
      administered orally to healthy male and female volunteers. BIO 300 is expected to be safe for
      use starting at 500 mg.

      This clinical trial will assess the safety and PK of BIO 300 capsules at doses expected to
      deliver a radioprotective or therapeutic effect in humans. Humanetics is planning to conduct
      this Phase I, single dose, dose-escalation (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 milligrams) study of
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BIO 300 by recruiting approximately 24
      healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 64 to be enrolled in cohorts of 6 subjects
      per group. The first cohort will receive one 500 mg BIO 300 capsule and pharmacokinetic blood
      sampling will be conducted over the first 4 days in an outpatient setting at a clinic skilled
      in this type of Phase I trial. Blood samples will be analyzed for BIO 300 levels, hematology,
      chemistry, lipid profiles, phosphorus, clotting factors and fibrinogen as well as pancreatic
      lipase and amylase. Urinalysis will assess kidney function as well as creatinine clearance
      and BIO 300 clearance. All subjects will be monitored for adverse events and the safety of
      BIO 300 capsules will be evaluated in this setting. After review of all safety information
      and provided no clinically significant negative findings are revealed, the second cohort will
      be treated with 1000mg BIO 300 (two 500mg capsules) using the same PK sampling program. Again
      safety concerns will be reviewed and provided no clinically significant negative findings are
      revealed, the third and fourth cohort will be treated with 1500 and 2000 mg, respectively, of
      BIO 300 using the same PK sampling program.
