      Randomized study comparing the effect of plastic stents to that of expandable metal stents as
      pre-operative drainage of the bile ducts prior to Whipple operation.

      Patients suffering from a locally invasive tumour process in the Periampullary area usually
      seek medical attention because of jaundice. Not only do patients suffering from jaundice show
      significant symptoms of exhaustion and purities, but they are also at higher risk for
      developing post-operative complications. Experimentally, the liver exhibits a reduced
      capacity for tolerating ischemia in the presence of jaundice. Several different etiologic
      factors suggest cause complication such as presence of toxic substances as bilirubin and bile
      salts, impaired nutritional status, effects of endotoxins, bacterial translocation,
      modulation of the inflammatory cascade with cytokine release, reduction of cellular immunity
      and nutritional. These complications primarily consist of septic complications (cholangitis,
      abscesses, and leakage), haemorrhage, impaired wound healing and renal disorders. Summarily,
      these issues have motivated pre-operative bile flow drainage by way of stent. Traditionally,
      pre-operative bile flow drainage has been achieved by insertion of a EP because these are
      considered easy to remove and cause less tissue reaction in the bile ducts. However, multiple
      studies have found the disadvantage with the EP is that it provides poorer bile drainage than
      the SEMS.

      In palliative situations, metal stents have been associated with fewer side-effects in the
      form of fever relapse of jaundice, etc. These effects are likely due to better bile flow
      through the stent. It remains unclear if metal stents can provide similar advantages in the
      curative situation.
