      With multicenter randomized control clinical evaluation investigations, the scheme of
      integrated medicine treatment of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) was further improved, and
      the therapeutic effects, safety and indications assured. Drawing in latest research fruits at
      home and abroad, a clinical practical guideline for integrated medicine of diagnosis and
      treatment of SAP would be formed, to be popularized all over China.

Treatment group: In addition to the concert schemes cited in the &quot;Guides to diagnosis and treatment of severe acute pancreatitis&quot;, during the first stage of the disease herbal Qingyi granules 1-B 4 bags dissolved in water 200ml were administered through the gastric tube q6h. Then the gastric tube was closed for 1h, and Qingyi granules 1-B another 4 bags dissolved in water 400ml were given through enema q6h. During the second stage (from the 2nd week to the 4th week after onset) Qingyi granules 2-B 2bags dissolved in water 200ml were added QD.</description>
