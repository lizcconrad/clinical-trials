      The purpose of this study is to determine the cardiovascular risk involved in the exertional
      exercise of marathon running. The researchers aim to investigate the beneficial effects of
      regular well-dosed exercise on health and compare these findings with the effects of the
      extreme strains of marathon running. Subclinical injuries to heart and arteries are being
      investigated in different groups of runners, including obese participants.

      Regular exercise leads to an improvement of cardiovascular risc factors in patients with
      coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. Aerobic exercise has
      anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the exertional exercise of marathon running causes an
      acute pro-inflammatory impulse. This may lead to myocardial injury and, in case of
      preexisting plaques, may result in plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.

      The researchers aim to define the critical role of inflammatory markers and cardiovascular
      risk factors as a predictor of an increased risk for myocardial and endothelial dysfunction
      in marathon runners.

      The study groups are divided into average trained runners (40 km/week), average trained obese
      runners and highly trained runners (&gt; 70km/week). Training programmes are supervised by
      professional coaches. Individual scientific marathon contests are organized for the
      assessments.

      Diagnostic tools include measurements of pulse wave velocity and heart rate turbulence,
      echocardiography and, for the first time, MRI-scans pre- and post marathon running.
      Additionally, cardiovascular markers such as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)and
      adiponectin are measured. Inflammatory markers include c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins
      and tumor necrosis factor.
