  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we are trying to determine the incidence of flat foot (also called pes planus)
      among patients who have had an ankle fracture. As compared to the general population, it is
      predicted that the incidence of pes planus will be higher among people who have fractured
      their ankle.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pes planus may develop following ankle fractures due to additional injuries that are
      sustained at the time of ankle fracture. If this study can demonstrate an association,
      further research would investigate how to effectively treat the pes planus early to prevent
      it from becoming a symptomatic problem.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be considered eligible if:

          -  They have sustained Weber type B or C ankle fractures and needed open reduction

          -  They are 18 years of age or older

          -  They are expected to be full weight bearing for at least 4 months to allow the
             potential of supporting structures to stretch and pes planus to develop

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they already have flat foot in their non-fractured foot.

          -  Patients with bilateral ankle fractures

          -  Patients who are not competent to sign a consent form

          -  A second fracture to the ankle

          -  Pathological fractures

          -  Patients with underlying cancer.
