  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis after retreating with high-dose melphalan with stem cell support after first
      relapse after high-dose treatment is dependent on the time to first relapse. Bortezomib can
      increase chemosensitivity of e.g. melphalan. The trial aims at determining the toxicity of
      adding bortezomib to high-dose melphalan with stem cell support and evaluating whether the
      time to a second relapse can be prolonged.

      Patients with multiple myeloma who have their first treatment demanding relapse after an
      initial treatment with high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell support and who have
      more than 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+ stem cells pr kg bodyweight in the freezer can be included in the
      trial.

      After disease status with basic clinical biochemistry, M-protein in blood and urine, bone
      marrow investigation including immunophenotyping and total skeletal x-ray the patients are
      treated with three courses of standard bortezomib (1.3 mg/sqm Days 1,4,8,11) and
      dexamethasone 20 mg days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12. Within 4 weeks the patients receive bortezomib
      days -5 and -2, high-dose melphalan (200 mg/sqm) day -2, and subsequent at least 2.0 x 10^6
      CD34+ stem cells pr kg body weight.

      The first month after high-dose therapy the patients are followed closely for toxicity
      according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI
      CTCAE), Version 3.0.

      The patients are evaluated for response according to EBMT criteria and for event (death or
      progressive disease).
