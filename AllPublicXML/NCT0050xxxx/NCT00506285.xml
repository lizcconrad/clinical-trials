      This study will look at the effectiveness of Methylphenidate Transdermal System (MTS) in
      treating adult ADHD. MTS has received FDA approval for childhood ADHD but this is the first
      trial for adult ADHD. Subjects will experience two screening visits and one baseline visit.
      Those who meet admission criteria will enter the double-blind phase. This will involve two
      4-week treatment periods one of which will involve the use of MTS and the other a placebo
      patch. Subjects who complete the double-blind phase will be allowed to enter a 180-day,
      open-label MTS phase designed to assess long-term effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD affects from 3 to 5% of children, persists into adolescence in 40 to 70% of these
      children and continues into adulthood in at least 50% of affected adolescents.
      Methylphenidate was the first medication shown to be effective in treatment for adults with
      ADHD and continues to be widely used. While the extended release formulations represent an
      improvement over the immediate release versions, significant problems remain for many
      patients. In particular, most have been designed with the goal of providing medication only
      during school hours and a short time period after school. In adults, there is a frequent need
      for much more extended duration of treatment. MTS is a new form of methylphenidate that
      provides medication in a transdermal patch delivery system. It has a very even, slowly
      ascending pharmacokinetic profile. MTS's very stable slowly increasing blood level should
      overcome the problems noted above with a delivery system that is more convenient for many
      patients. It is currently approved for treatment of childhood ADHD, with effectiveness and
      safety profiles similar to other forms of methylphenidate. This study will be the first to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MTS in adult ADHD.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial comparing MTS with
      placebo patch. The double-blind trial will be preceded by an enrollment period consisting of
      two screening visits followed as quickly as possible by a baseline visit. Patients who
      continue to meet admission criteria at baseline will be randomized into the first of two
      4-week treatment periods. We will attempt to reach the highest tolerated dose size of MTS
      within 2 weeks and then observe the response over the last two weeks of each crossover phase.
      The double-blind period will be followed by a 180 day open-treatment, flexible-dose phase
      designed to assess long-term effects.

    <description>This arm was 4 weeks long. Subjects were treated using Methylphenidate Transdermal System. Patients were seen weekly, phone contact was made between visits and dosing could be adjusted as a result of the phone contact. MTS was initiated using a 12.5 cm patch. The dose was increased during the first 2 weeks based on treatment response and side effects to the largest tolerated dose/patch size. It was held steady the last 2 weeks.</description>

    <description>MTS is an advanced patch product that provides methylphenidate evenly mixed with the adhesive. This formulation allows good adhesion and a wide range of dose sizes. MTS patch sizes of 12.5, 18.75, 25 and 37.5cm2 are equivalent to nominal doses over a 9-hour wear time of 10, 15, 20 and 30mg of MPH.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adults meeting DSM-IV-Text Revision criteria for ADHD, the Utah Criteria for ADHD, and
        experiencing at least moderate impairment (a score of 4 or greater on the CGI-Severity
        Scale for ADHD at both Screening and Baseline visits) will be enrolled. Other criteria
        include:

          1. Subjects ages 18 to 65, inclusive;

          2. Female subjects are eligible to enter and participate in this study only if:

               1. She is of non-childbearing potential; has a male sexual partner who is surgically
                  sterilized; is on implant of levonorgestrel, injectable progesterone, or an oral
                  contraceptive; has an intrauterine device (IUD); or is sexually inactive with a
                  male partner.

               2. Or agrees to use a double barrier method of contraception (any combination of
                  physical and chemical methods) and has a negative urine pregnancy test at
                  screening interview.

          3. Subject must be in general good health as determined by medical history, ECG, and
             other analysis that, in the judgment of the study physician, would confirm the
             patient's good health.

          4. Subjects must read and write at a level sufficient to provide written informed consent
             and complete study-related materials.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
             criteria apply:

               1. Subjects with other current DSM-IV Axis I Disorders including Current or lifetime
                  history of psychosis, current bipolar disorder type I, current Major Depressive
                  Disorder, and Current Anxiety Disorder (unless in the opinion of clinic physician
                  ADHD is the primary disorder and causes the disability seen in the patient);

               2. Subjects with any other DSM-IV Axis II diagnosis so severe that it would suggest
                  non-responsiveness to pharmacotherapy for ADHD or noncompliance with the
                  protocol;

               3. Subjects at risk for suicide or a risk to harm others;

               4. History of Substance Dependence according to DSM-IV criteria within 3 months of
                  screening;

               5. Subjects currently abusing illegal drugs or alcohol are excluded from the study;

               6. Positive urine screen for drugs of abuse at screening for patients who have a
                  significant history of substance use but still meet criteria 4 and 5. Patients
                  not at risk for substance abuse will not be given a urine drug screen;

               7. Subjects in whom stimulants would represent a risk such as those with a history
                  of stimulant abuse,

               8. History of uncontrolled hypertension or significant cardiovascular disease;

               9. Any known or suspected significant medical or psychiatric illnesses (e.g.,
                  hepatic or renal insufficiency, pulmonary (asthma, COPD, etc), gastrointestinal,
                  endocrine, neurological or metabolic disturbances that, in the judgment of the
                  investigator, may impair interpretation of study results or constitute a
                  significant safety concern in the context of the clinical trial;

              10. Medications, including health food supplements judged by the investigator to be
                  likely to have central nervous system activity (for example, St John's Wort,
                  gingko leaf, and melatonin), are not permitted during the study. If the subject
                  is taking the medication prior to study entry, there must be a 7 day washout
                  period prior to Visit 2. We will ask for an honest report of all medications
                  consumed between visits. In the event a medication with psychoactive properties
                  is consumed, the patient will be counseled regarding the use of prohibited
                  medications;

              11. Use of any medication not considered acceptable by the clinical investigator or
                  the medical monitor during the 7-day period before the start of the study (Day
                  1);

              12. Subjects with high BMI (&gt;38) and those with high adipose tissue concentrations in
                  the hip as judged by the clinician.

      <pre_assignment_details>There were 3 screening visits. Subjects met DSM-IV &amp;/or Utah criteria for adult ADHD, experiencing at least moderate impairment.
