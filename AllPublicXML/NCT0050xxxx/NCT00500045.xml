  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a less risky, yet effective and more sustainable
      treatment for retinal vein occlusions than the current commonly used approach of repeated
      intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog) injections. The types of retinal vien
      occlusion that are being studied include central (CVRO), hemi-retinal (HRVO),and branch
      (BRVO) retinal vein occlusion. Niacin, (Nicotinic Acid, not Nicotinamide) a B-vitamin, has
      lipid lowering and vasodilating properties. The combination of Niacin and Prednisolone
      Acetate steroid eye drops as a non-invasive treatment approach was developed by the Principal
      Investigator. The Niacin dilates the retinal vessels, hopefully encouraging earlier
      collateral vessel formation aimed at bypassing the venous obstruction, thus restoring venous
      outflow. The Prednisolone Acetate steroid eye drops are aimed at reducing vascular leakage
      and therefore the macular edema in the eye while the Niacin is taking effect.

      A spontaneous improvement was noted in some patients who were experiencing deteriorating
      retinal vein occlusions. A chart review and questioning of the patients revealed that the
      addition of Niacin by the Internist seemed to be the factor that was bringing about the
      vision improvement.

      The Niacin has vasodilating properties, and it is postulated that as the Niacin dilates the
      retinal vessels, it will encourage earlier collateral vessel formation that will bypass the
      venous obstruction, and restore venous outflow. The prednisolone steroid eye drops will
      hopefully reduce the macular edema in the eye.

      This is a retrospective study conducted by chart review of up to 45 patients who have
      undergone treatment with 1500 mg per day of oral Niacin (Nicotinic acid) with or without
      topical steroid eye drops, Prednisolone acetate (Pred Forte) for the treatment of retinal
      vein occlusion central (CRVO), hemi-retinal (HRVO), branch (BRVO). The retrospective chart
      review of patients seen by Dr. Michael Gaynon will go back to 1998 and will continue through
      the present time. All patients with vision impairment caused by deteriorating retinal vein
      occlusion, and who were or will be prescribed the Niacin with or without Pred Forte treatment
      will be included.
