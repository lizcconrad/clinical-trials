      Birdshot Retine choroidopathy (BRC) is a sight threatening posterior uveitis. The long term
      visual outcome has recently be studied showing a legal blindness to 14% at 5 years. Visual
      acuity is threatened by macular edema (80%), macular atrophy, and choroidal
      neovascularization.

      Birdshot Retine choroidopathy (BRC) is a sight threatening posterior uveitis. The long term
      visual outcome has recently be studied showing a legal blindness to 14% at 5 years. Visual
      acuity is threatened by macular edema (80%), macular atrophy, and choroidal
      neovascularization.

      The conventional therapy includes in first line steroid therapy of which side effects are
      well known. If the daily steroid dose necessary to control the intra ocular inflammation is
      superior to 0.3 mg/kg/d a combined therapy to immunosuppressive drug is suggested in order to
      do a steroid sparing effect. Immunosuppressive drugs include increased infectious risks,
      hematologic and sterility troubles, and secondary malignancies. Moreover immunosuppressive
      drugs have a own toxic effect and The classical immunosuppressive drug used in BRC the
      cyclosporineA has a high level of nephrotoxicity.

      That is the reason why immunomodulatory drugs as interferons have been suggested in BRC.

      Interferon alpha2 a has been shown efficient in uveitis in Behcet's disease. We propose to
      analyse the potential therapeutic effect of Interferon alpha2 a versus Steroid therapy with a
      control group for a 4 months period. This short period could not make the disease worse
      because of the slow pathologic processus.
