  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to clinically validate a new device for the objective outcome
      evaluation of adult patients undergoing shoulder surgery for glenohumeral osteoarthritis and
      rotator cuff disease, using the activities of daily living described in the Simple Shoulder
      Test (SST) as a reference.

      The study was set up as a clinical trial including patients over an observation period of one
      year and a control group of subjects. Clinical evaluations will be made at baseline, 3
      months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery by two independent observers. Miniature sensors
      each containing three 3D gyroscopes and three 3D accelerometers will allow computing new
      kinematic scores. They will be compared to the regular SST, DASH, ASES and Constant scores.
