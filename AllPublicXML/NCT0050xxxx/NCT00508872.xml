      Objective:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the use of the combination of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil,
           leucovorin and bevacizumab (FOLFOX-B) in patients with unresectable colorectal liver
           metastases, with the objective to downstage hepatic disease and enable complete
           resection of residual disease.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the resection rate in patients with initially unresectable hepatic
           colorectal metastases downstaged with FOLFOX-B. Complete resection of all liver lesions
           is the goal.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the probability of complete response, partial response or stable disease.

        -  To evaluate the proportion of patients who are resected, and the proportion of patients
           achieving an R0 resection (among those receiving surgery).

        -  To correlate survival with downstaging and resection based on metastatic colorectal
           prognostic score.

        -  To evaluate the disease-free survival and overall survival.

        -  To evaluate the positron emission tomography response rate.

        -  To explore correlations of clinical response with telomerase and hTERT expression.

      Oxaliplatin and bevacizumab are chemotherapy drugs that are designed to kill cancer cells.
      5-FU is a chemotherapy drug that helps to stop the growth of cancer cells. Leucovorin is a
      drug that may help increase the effect of 5-FU.

      The study drugs will be given to you on an outpatient basis and will involve a minimum of 4
      cycles and up to a maximum of 12 cycles of chemotherapy. All chemotherapy will be given
      through a catheter placed in a vein in the shoulder in &quot;cycles&quot;. Each &quot;cycle&quot; equals 14 days.
      On the first day (Day 1) of each cycle, bevacizumab will be given for 30 to 90 minutes and
      oxaliplatin and leucovorin for 2 hours. On Day 1 as well, part of the total 5-FU dose will be
      given for 15 minutes through the catheter. The rest of the 5-FU dose is then given through a
      pump over the next 46 hours. After 46 hours, you will have a rest period, without drug
      treatment for the rest of the cycle until the start of the next cycle.

      Before each chemotherapy cycle, you will have blood drawn (about 2 tablespoons) for tests to
      check for any side effects. Depending on the results of the blood tests, these blood tests
      may be done more often. You will also have your vital signs (blood pressure, breathing,
      temperature, and heart rate) monitored during the treatment. You will be seen every 2 weeks
      by one of your doctors during your therapy.

      If at any time the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you
      will be taken off the study.

      After completion of the 4th cycle of chemotherapy, you will have a complete physical exam and
      routine blood tests (about 2 tablespoons). You will also have a CT scan of the abdomen and
      pelvis and a chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest. These tests are being done to find out if
      the tumor can be removed by surgery.

      If your tumors cannot be removed at this time, you will continue to receive the same dose of
      chemotherapy with the same tests for up to a maximum of 12 cycles. If it is found that the
      tumor still cannot be removed after 12 cycles, your participation in this study will be
      complete and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

      If the tumor can be removed, you will receive 1 additional cycle of oxaliplatin, leucovorin,
      and 5-FU (no bevacizumab) at the same doses before you go on to have the surgery. Your
      surgery will be scheduled 8-12 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. The surgeon will
      explain the surgery and any risks. During liver tumor surgery, normal tissue around the edges
      of the tumor will be collected as part of routine care. You will be asked to sign a separate
      consent form for the surgery. Additional routine blood tests (about 2 tablespoons) and a PET
      scan will be done before surgery.

      If you have tumors removed, around 28 days after the surgery, you will be given 8 additional
      cycles of bevacizumab given the same way as before surgery.

      Around 4-6 weeks after the final chemotherapy treatment, you will have follow-up CT scans of
      the abdomen and pelvis, a chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest, and a routine blood test
      (about 2 tablespoons). These tests will be repeated every 3 months for the first 3 years
      after surgery, every 6 months for the 4th and 5th year after surgery, and then once a year
      for the rest of your life. PET scans will be done once a year to check on the status of the
      disease.

      This is an investigational study. Oxaliplatin, 5-FU, leucovorin, and bevacizumab are FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of this disease. However, their use
      together in this study is investigational. Up to 42 patients will take part in this study.
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have hepatic colorectal metastasis confirmed by percutaneous or
             intraoperative hepatic tumor biopsy.

          2. Patients must have radiological evidence of measurable liver metastasis with helical
             CT scan (1 cm or greater in greatest transverse dimension).

          3. Patients with synchronous disease and resectable intact primary tumors are eligible.

          4. Colorectal liver metastases will be determined to be unresectable by a surgeon with
             expertise in hepatic surgery (equal to or greater than 10 resections performed in a
             year). A patient is defined as unresectable when distribution and extent of disease
             preclude margin negative resection (tumor contact with or involvement of all three
             major hepatic veins or portal confluence or a combination of involvement of main
             branches of portal veins and hepatic veins), but two adjacent hepatic segments with
             adequate vascular inflow and outflow are relatively spared (contain 4 or fewer
             lesions).

          5. Performance status: Zubrod 0 or 1.

          6. Patients with a prior history of non-colorectal cancer may be included if there is no
             evidence of malignancy for at least 5 years from last treatment and no evidence of
             recurrence. In addition, patients with completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or
             cervical carcinoma in-situ may be included.

             registration.

          8. Laboratory data as follows (within 21 days of protocol registration): Adequate bone
             marrow as evidenced by; Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g %; White blood cell

          9. Continued from inclusion # 9: Laboratory data as follows (within 21 days of protocol
             registration): Adequate renal function as evidenced by; Creatinine less than or equal
             to 1.5 mg/dL or estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 cc/min;
             Urinalysis: less than or equal to trace proteinuria. If greater than trace proteinuria
             exists, a 24- hour urine collection for assessment of protein must demonstrate less
             than 500 mg of protein/24 hours.

         10. Continued from inclusion #10: Laboratory data as follows (within 21 days of protocol
             registration): Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by; Total Bilirubin less than or
             equal to 2.0 mg %; Alanine aminotransferase less than or equal to 280 IU/L; Aspartate
             aminotransferase less than or equal to 230 IU/L; International normalized ratio less

         11. Women must not be pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative Beta-HCG serum pregnancy test and to refrain from breast-feeding, as
             specified in the informed consent given the unknown risk of teratogenicity of agents
             in the study. Patients of childbearing potential agree to use an effective form of
             contraception during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of study
             medication.

          7. Patients who have ever received bevacizumab.

          8. Previous or concurrent treatment of hepatic metastatic disease with resection,
             radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy/other ablative techniques, or

             requirements are excluded.

         13. Patients with preexisting chronic hepatic disease (chronic active hepatitis B or C,
             cirrhosis), which would preclude surgical resection of metastases.
