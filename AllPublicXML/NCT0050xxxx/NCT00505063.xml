  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at your body's response to the new immunizations. We want to see how
      well they will protect you. Immunization is the same as vaccination. Our goal is to protect
      you as much as we can. We do not want you to have the measles, mumps, or whooping cough. We
      are doing the study because there is no standard way to re-immunize people after cancer
      treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be &lt; or less 18 years of age at cancer diagnosis

          -  Patient must be 3 to 24months following completion of chemotherapy for malignant
             disease.

               1. For patients &lt;12 months following completion of therapy, CR must be documented
                  within 3 months of enrollment.

               2. For patients &gt;12 months, CR must be documented at approximately 12 months and
                  then only as clinically indicated

             i. For patients with leukemia: bone marrow aspirate defined as &lt;5% blasts, absence of
             cytogenetic abnormality by FISH or karyotype (if applicable) and no evidence of CSF
             involvement (if applicable) ii. For patients with solid tumors remission will be
             determined by appropriate radiologic scans, and other tests, including bone marrow
             aspirate and biopsies demonstrating absence of extrinsic cells and absence of specific
             FISH or cytogenetic abnormality (if applicable), iii. For patients with lymphoma,
             remission will be determined by bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, radiologic scans and
             other tests. Bone marrow will show &lt;5% blasts, absence of cytogenetic abnormality by
             FISH or karyotype (if applicable), and flow cytometry (if lymphoma specific marker
             present) and absence of CNS disease by spinal fluid (if applicable)

             proposed study and be able to sign consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients who have received an autologous or allogeneic HCT.

          -  Active uncontrolled bacterial or fungal infection.

          -  Patients who have a history of previous allergic reaction to vaccinations currently
             recommended by the ACIP.

          -  Patients on any immunosuppressive drugs.

          -  HIV-1,2 sero-positive patients.

          -  Patients or guardians not signing informed consent.

          -  Patients with prior allergic reaction to any vaccine component or to latex.
