      An analgesia protocol for acute renal colic will lead to faster significant reductions in
      pain than prior practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective study was performed that assessed the time to significant analgesia and
      medications used to achieve analgesia in the DHMC ED. Based upon this a prospective pain
      management protocol was designed and we will track the difference in time to significant pain
      relief between the two groups.
