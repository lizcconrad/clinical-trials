    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how well bladder cancer responds to a
      combination treatment with Avastin and M-VAC (methotrexate, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and
      cisplatin) before surgery to remove the tumor.

      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the response of patients with locally advanced urothelial cancer treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a combination of Dose Dense Methotrexate, Vinblastine,
      Adriamycin, and Cisplatin (DD-M-VAC) plus Avastin followed by radical surgery with curative
      intent. In this context, response will be defined as the absence of residual muscle invasive
      cancer in the resected specimen (&lt;= pT1, N0.)

      Secondary Objective:

      To estimate the 4-year disease-free survival of patients with locally advanced urothelial
      cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with DD-M-VAC plus Avastin followed by radical
      surgery with curative intent.

      Document perioperative morbidity and mortality in this cohort, with reference to
      well-established historical standards.

      Determine the effects of VEGF inhibition on angiogenesis and angiogenesis-related gene
      expression utilizing fluorescent tissue staining techniques that we have developed in the
      laboratory (such as two-color TUNEL, phospho-receptor, and microvessel density).

      Interrogate downstream receptor signaling pathways to provide insight into the development of
      chemotherapy resistance, and hence hypothesis for its prevention.

      Avastin is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the growth
      of blood vessels. Methotrexate, vinblastine, and doxorubicin are designed to disrupt the
      growth of cancer cells, which causes cancer cells to start to die. Cisplatin has an atom at
      its center that contains platinum. The platinum is designed to poison the cancer cells, which
      may cause them to eventually die.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be treated with the
      combination of Avastin, methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. The study
      drugs and saline will be given through a needle in your vein. Avastin will be given over 90
      minutes. Methotrexate will be given over 30 minutes. Vinblastine will be given over 30
      minutes. Doxorubicin will be given over 15 minutes. Cisplatin will be given over 4 hours. You
      will also receive saline for hydration after you have completed the infusion of cisplatin.
      This will take up to 20 hours. If you have a catheter in place, the chemotherapy drugs as
      well as the saline will be given through the catheter. You will receive the study drugs 1
      time every 2 weeks. Every 2 weeks is called a study &quot;cycle&quot;.

      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital
      signs, height, and weight. You will be asked about any side effects you have experienced
      since your last visit. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine
      tests.

      After 3 cycles of therapy, you will have a bone scan if your screening test showed signs of
      bone disease. You will also have a repeat cystoscopy. These tests will be done to check the
      status of the disease.

      You will receive a total of 4 cycles of chemotherapy. At least 6 weeks after the last dose of
      Avastin, you will have a cystectomy (removal of your tumor). Your doctor will explain this
      procedure to you in detail. You will sign a separate consent form for this procedure.

      After surgery, if you do not have disease in your lymph nodes or other sites, you will be
      taken off-study.

      After surgery, if you still have disease in your lymph nodes or other sites, you will be
      eligible to continue treatment with Avastin. Therapy can be restarted no sooner than 28 days
      after your surgery. You will receive Avastin every 2 or 3 weeks through a needle in your
      vein. Every 2 or 3 weeks will be considered a study cycle.

      Before each cycle of treatment, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.
      Urine will be collected every cycle for routine testing. Every 3 months you will have a CT
      scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      You may continue to receive the study drug for up to 18 months of therapy. You will be taken
      off study in the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      Once you are off-study, you will have long term follow-up visits every 3-6 months for the
      first 30 months and then every year after that. These visits will continue for up to 4 years,
      or longer if your doctor thinks it is necessary. At these visits, you will have a CT or MRI
      scan of your abdomen and pelvis and a chest x-ray. Blood (about 1 teaspoons) will be drawn
      for routine testing.

      This is an investigational study. Avastin is not FDA approved or commercially available for
      this indication. Its use in this study is considered to be investigational. Methotrexate,
      doxorubicin, vinblastine, and cisplatin are all FDA approved and commercially available. Up
      to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Number of participants out of total with a response defined as &quot;downstaging&quot; to &lt;= pT1N0 in the resected specimen. A binary variable was defined for downstaging (pathologic stage below initial clinical stage and below pT1N1N0M0); staging using American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system of &quot;TNM&quot;; T describes size tumor &amp; cancer spread into nearby tissue; N describes spread to nearby lymph nodes; &amp; M describes metastasis (spread to other parts of body). Numbers after T (such as T1, T2, T3, and T4) describe tumor size and/or amount of spread into nearby structures, higher the T number, the larger the tumor and/or more it has grown into nearby tissues. Responses of lesser magnitude scored as treatment failure. Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria do not apply for this cohort of neoadjuvant participants since this study does not require measurable disease by traditional assessment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologic proof of urothelial cancer. Patients with all histologic
             subtypes are eligible as long as transitional cell carcinoma predominant, with 2
             exceptions:

               -  More than a few clusters of small cell carcinoma are treated with different
                  chemotherapy and are ineligible for this study

               -  Patients with micropapillary tumor will be allowed irrespective of the extent of
                  transitional cell carcinoma. A transitional cell component is not required in the
                  setting of pure or extensive micropapillary tumors. Note that minor histologic
                  components are acceptable.

          2. Patients with primary tumors arising in the bladder or urethra are eligible if they
             demonstrate any of the following features:

               -  A 3-dimensional mass on examination under anesthesia (EUA); ie: cT3b disease

               -  Direct invasion of prostatic stroma or the vaginal wall: ie:cT4a disease

               -  Lymphovascular invasion on the specimen with &gt;/= cT1 disease

               -  Hydronephrosis present on CT scan or on renal ultrasound

               -  Tumor involving bladder diverticulum.

          3. Patients with more than a few areas of micropapillary histology are eligible, even if
             they do not meet the anatomic criteria for locally advanced disease enumerated above.
             Patients with micropapillary histology will be analyzed as a separate cohort.

          4. Patients with primary tumors arising in the ureter or renal pelvis are eligible they
             have either grade 3 tumor, or a radiographic abnormality large enough to recognize as
             an abnormal mass by CT or MRI imaging. These patients may also be analyzed separately,
             since we do not have benchmark data for upper tract disease.

          5. Patients must have an evaluation in the department of urology, and be deemed an
             acceptable surgical candidate.

          6. Patients must have adequate physiologic reserves as by:

               -  Zubrod performance status (PS) of &lt;/= 1; or 2 if of recent onset and due entirely
                  to the cancer and not due to comorbidity (especially if the compromised
                  performance status is related to uncontrolled pain which is expected to be
                  rapidly reversible when therapy starts)

               -  Normal WBC, ANC &gt;/= 1,800, and platelet count &gt;/= 150,000. Supranormal values
                  judged to be of benign or inconsequential etiology are acceptable

               -  Transaminase (AST or ALT) &lt;/= 3 * the ULN

               -  Conjugated bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dl (or total bilirubin &lt;/= 2.5 mg/dl)

               -  Normal Serum Creatinine or Creatinine clearance (either measured or by
                  Cockcroft-Gault formula) of &gt;/= 50 ml/min.Cockcroft-Gault: CLcr = [(140-age) *
                  wt(kg)]/[72 * Cr(mg/dL)] (For females, multiply by 0.85)

          7. Patients (Pts) must NOT have clinical evidence of disease beyond the involved organ by
             either CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest X-ray. Pts with lymph node
             involvement are not eligible. In absence of a bone scan, pts should be free of bone
             pain and have an alk. phos. &lt; 150% of the ULN, or a normal bone fraction of alk. phos.
             If these features are present, pts should have a bone scan and this should be
             interpreted as showing no evidence of metastatic disease to be eligible. In case of
             bladder tumors, cancer invading local organs (pT4a) but not pelvis sidewall (pT4b) are
             allowed.

          8. Patients must have a determination of LV function with an EF &gt;/= 50% to participate.

          9. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., who has had menses at any time in the
             preceding 24 consecutive months) must have a negative pregnancy test. Elevations of
             BHCG which are related to tumor (and not the rapid escalation associated with
             pregnancy, i.e. doubling time of 3-5 days) are acceptable.

         10. Patients of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must agree to use an acceptable
             form of birth control while on the study, i.e. condoms.

         11. Patients with second malignancies are eligible provided that the expected outcome from
             the second cancer is such that this will not interfere in the delivery of this
             therapy, or the assessment of response in the cystectomy specimen. The expected
             survival from the prior malignancy should reliably be &gt; 4 years to be eligible for
             this study.

         12. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must not have current, recent (within 3 weeks), or planned participation with
             other experimental medication clinical trials.

          2. Prior systemic cytoreductive chemotherapy for bladder cancer. Please note, that prior
             intra-vesical therapy is allowed.

          3. Blood pressure of &gt; 140/90 mmHg. Patients whose blood pressure is controlled with oral
             medication are eligible, as long as the blood pressure is &lt;/= 140/90 mmHg.

          4. Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.

          5. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure.

          6. History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to study
             enrollment.

          7. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to study
             enrollment.

          8. Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, aortic
             dissection).

          9. Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.

         10. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

         11. Known history of central nervous system or brain metastases.

         12. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 1, anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of
             the study. For the purpose of this study, Cystoscopy and ureteroscopy is not included
             as a major surgical procedure.

         13. Lactating women.

         14. Proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by either:

               -  Urine protein:creatinine (UPC) ratio &gt;/= 1.0 at screening OR

               -  Urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt; 2+ (or &gt; 100 protein on urinalysis) Patients
                  discovered to have &gt;2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis or &gt;100 on urinalysis
                  at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and must demonstrate &lt;= 1g
                  of protein in 24 hours to be eligible.

         15. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess
             within 6 months prior to therapy. Patients with Crohn's disease will be excluded.

         16. Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

         17. Lung carcinoma of squamous cell histology or any histology in close proximity to a
             major vessel, cavitation, or history of hemoptysis (bright red blood of 1/2 teaspoon
             or more; non-small cell lung cancer trials only).

         18. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures, or sign informed consent.

         19. Patients who are not candidates for surgery, or are unwilling to undergo surgery.

         20. Patients with fluid collections (such as ascites, or pleural effusions) are not
             eligible for therapy as such collections may serve as a reservoir for methotrexate.

          <description>Low risk or high risk are based upon likelihood of cancer recurrence, including size, number, and appearance of tumor(s), if it recurs, and how deeply it invades into the bladder. A person whose cancer is low risk may be able to have less aggressive treatment and follow up, whereas a person with high risk bladder cancer may require more aggressive treatment and more frequent follow up. Participants may have more than one high-risk feature, so numbers exceed total number of participants.</description>
