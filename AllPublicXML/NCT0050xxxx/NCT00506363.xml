  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The appearance of skin after surgery plays an important role in patient's self confidence and
      life style. In fact, Keloids and hypertrophic scars are abnormal wound responses appearing in
      predisposed individuals after surgery. Among different kind of lasers, used to improve the
      appearance of hypertrophic scars and keloids, pulsed dye laser is now being used successfully
      in treatment of scars. Pulsed dye laser is effective in improving the color, height, texture,
      and elasticity of scars. Also, treatment with this technique is noninvasive, minimally
      uncomfortable, and requires no anesthesia. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of
      different onset times of treatment with pulsed dye laser on improvement of surgical scars.

    <description>Each scar will be divided into 3 equal parts. One part will be randomly allocated to be treated with pulsed dye laser and dynamic cooling device on the day of suture removal. Another part will be treated with pulsed dye laser and dynamic cooling device 2 months after suture removal. Only dynamic cooling device will be used for remaining part serving as control. Treatment will repeat for 6 sessions at 3 weeks intervals.</description>
