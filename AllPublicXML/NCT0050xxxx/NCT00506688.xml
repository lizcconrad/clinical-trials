  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients die from a progressive pulmonary disease.Airway
      inflammation plays a major role for the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, and ultimately leads
      to lung destruction. The release of oxidants during the inflammation process leads to a
      chronic imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants and may be a central component leading to
      irreversible lung damage in CF patients. The antioxidant glutathione, which is a naturally
      occurring tripeptide, is depleted in the extracellular epithelial lining fluid of the CF
      lung. The elevation of reduced level to normal and also the augmentation of glutathione
      concentrations above the normal level, as observed in smokers and during defence of
      Pseudomonas infection, may be desirable to avoid lung damage. Data from pilot studies in
      humans and animals have indicated that the glutathione concentrations in epithelial lining
      fluid can be elevated by aerosol application.

      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of a 24-week treatment with
      inhaled glutathione compared with control inhalations (normal saline) on pulmonary function
      in adult and pediatric CF patients. Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of
      inhaled glutathione on inflammatory variables, glutathione levels and free elastase in
      induced sputum and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 24-week treatment with
      inhaled GSH.

      There is considerable hope within the CF community that the addition of anti-oxidative
      therapy to an already comprehensive program for treating the lungs will decrease morbidity
      and improve the quality of life for patients with CF.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient, 8 years (pediatric 8 - 17 years inclusive; adult 18 years)

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CF (positive sweat chloride, 60 mEq/liter by pilocarpine
             iontophoresis and/or a genotype with two identifiable mutations consistent with CF
             accompanied by one or more clinical features with the CF phenotype)

          -  Patient is able to perform acceptable spirometric maneuvers according to ATS standards

          -  FEV1 &gt; 40% predicted and &lt; 90% predicted

          -  The patient is clinically stable fulfilling the following:

        No evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of
        screening.

        No pulmonary exacerbation requiring an use of i.v./oral/inhaled antibiotics, or oral
        corticosteroids within 4 weeks of screening.

        FEV1 at Visit 2 is within a range of ± 10% of FEV1 from the Visit 1. (If FEV1 at V2 is not
        within that range, V2 may be re-scheduled once within 7 days)

          -  Concomitant or chronic medication is planned to be continued unchanged for the entire
             study duration

          -  The patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative is able to give
             informed consent in accordance with ICH and GCP guidelines and local legislation

          -  Patient is able to comply with the study visit schedule and willing and able to
             complete the assessments specified in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including medication allergy) that is deemed
             relevant to the trial by the investigator. &quot;Relevance&quot; in this context refers to any
             increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to trial medication. (Specific concerns
             currently identified with respect to the use of inhaled glutathione in allergic

             the screening visit or the drug cycles of other therapies are not in accordance with
             the 4-week time-schedule for the single visits of this study

          -  Clinically relevant diseases or medical conditions other than CF or CF-related
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of
             the patient or the quality of the data. This includes, but is not limited to,
             significant hematological, hepatic,renal, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases
             (diabetic patients may participate if their disease is under good control prior to
             screening).

          -  Participation in another study with an investigational drug within one month or 6
             halflives(whichever is greater) preceding the screening visit.
