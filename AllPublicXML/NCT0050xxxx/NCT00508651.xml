  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of
      MEDI-560 at 10^5 TCID50 when administered to children 6 to &lt; 12 months of age who are HPIV3
      (human parainfluenza virus type 3) seronegative at baseline and to infants 1 to &lt; 3 months of
      age regardless of baseline serostatus.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose Phase 1/2a multicenter
      study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, viral shedding, immunogenicity, and
      genotypic and phenotypic stability of MEDI-560 in infants 1 to &lt; 12 months of age. Three
      doses of MEDI-560 at a dosage level of 10^5 TCID50 were administered 0, 2, and 4 months after
      enrollment to a 30-participant cohort of 6 to &lt; 12 month-old HPIV3 seronegative children
      randomized 2:1 to MEDI-560 vs placebo. A second 160-participant cohort of 1 to &lt; 3 month-old
      infants not screened for baseline serostatus was planned but was not opened to enrollment for
      reasons other than safety. Participants were followed for safety through 180 days post last
      dose. Nasal wash specimens were collected at screening and Days 7, 12, and 28 following each
      dose and during unscheduled illness visits to assess vaccine virus shedding and genotypic and
      phenotypic stability of any shed vaccine virus. Blood was collected at screening to determine
      eligibility and prior to Dose 1 for baseline serostatus. Blood for assessment of antibodies
      to HPIV3 was collected approximately 7 to 12 days after Dose 1 and Dose 3 and 1 month after
      each dose for antibodies to PIV3.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants 6 to &lt; 12 months of age were screened prior to randomization at 8 sites in the USA. The first and last days of informed consent were 07Nov2007 and 30Jun2008, respectively. No participants were screened for Cohort 2 (1 to &lt; 3 months of age) because the study was closed prior to enrollment into Cohort 2 for reasons other than safety.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Thirty participants were randomized into Cohort 1 between 12Nov2007 and 07Jul2008. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive MEDI-560 or placebo, and randomization into Cohort 1 was not stratified.</pre_assignment_details>
