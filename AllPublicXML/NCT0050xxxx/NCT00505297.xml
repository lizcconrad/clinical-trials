  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to design future disease modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD) proof of concept
      studies, this study is being conducted to assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      measurements of cartilage morphology and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content as it relates to the
      progression of disease in subjects with potentially rapidly progressing OA. The subject
      population is selected to have higher likelihood of having rapidly progressing OA (i.e., a
      more rapid joint space narrowing (JSN) compared to general knee OA population and thus, may
      be more likely to have changes in GAG content and/or cartilage volume. The results of this
      study may provide a reasonable means to assess DMOAD activity of drugs in development. The
      non-OA controls are included to determine the rate of change for subjects of similar age.
      Ideally, results of this study will identify reliable methods for delayed Gadolinium Enhanced
      MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) and MRI cartilage assessment that correlate with OA disease
      progression as compared to x-ray changes.

      The objective of the study are:

        -  Evaluate OA progression by evaluating cartilage morphology, cartilage glycosaminoglycan
           (GAG) content, and joint space changes measured by MRI (3.0T), dGEMRIC index, and
           radiography, respectively using age-matched control subjects to identify disease related
           changes.

        -  Identify subject characteristics associated with more rapidly progressing OA.

        -  Identify most sensitive efficacy endpoints for future DMOAD proof of concept (POC)
           studies.

        -  Establish time interval for future studies based on MRI endpoints.

        -  Evaluate the effect of contrast agent on MRI cartilage morphology and T2 measurements

        -  Define criteria for classifying cartilage legions/deficits using dGEMRIC and T2
           measurements.

        -  Collect biofluid samples for future validation of disease specific biomarkers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients evaluated to be relatively in good health

          -  40 years old and above

          -  Negative pregnancy test

        Additional inclusion criteria for OA patients:

          -  Frequent knee symptoms in the past year, defined as:

          -  pain, aching, or stiffness on most days of a month during the past year

          -  use od medication (all types) for treatment of knee pain on most days of a month
             during the past year

          -  Kellgren &amp; Lawrence Grades 2 or 3 of the study knee (with either the same or less
             severe OA , or no OA in the contralateral knee)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 30 and above

          -  Medial joint space width of 2 mm and above

        Additional inclusion criteria for age-matched controls:

          -  BMI of 28 and above

          -  No evidence of knee OA in either knee (i.e., Kellgren &amp; Lawrence Grade 0 diagnosed by
             x-ray on AP view; infrequent knee pain, aching, stiffness during the past year;
             infrequent use of medication (all types) for treatment of knee pain during the past
             year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anticipated need for knee surgery in the next 2 years

          -  OA predominantly in the lateral tibiofemoral compartment measured by PA x-ray view of
             the study knee
