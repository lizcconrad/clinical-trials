      The primary objective of this study is to assess the time of onset of Vyvanse compared to
      placebo, in the analog classroom as measured by the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M. Flynn and
      Pelham (SKAMP) deportment scale in children (aged 6-12) diagnosed with
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

    <description>Duration of effect will be defined as the first time point at which there is a non-significant difference between Vyvanse and placebo after a time point at which there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups as measured by SKAMP Deportment Scores.
