  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We designed this prospective, randomized control study to compare the benefits between the
      insulin therapy and OADs after correction of the glucose toxicity with a short period of
      intensive insulin therapy.

      OBJECTIVE—Type 2 diabetes is associated with defects in insulin secretion and insulin action.
      Hyperglycemia may aggravate these defects, a feature known as glucose toxicity. Previous
      studies have shown that acute correction of hyperglycemia in subjects with long-standing type
      2 diabetes gives only short-term improvement in glycemic control after discontinuation of
      insulin. The current study attempts to identify any characteristics of patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes (fasting glucose &gt;300mg/dL) who would have a long-term benefit, in
      terms of glycemic control, from a brief course of insulin therapy.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with severe
      hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose &gt;300 mg/dL or random blood glucose &gt;400 mg/dL) will be
      hospitalized and treated with intensive insulin injection for 10 to 14 days. Oral glucose
      tolerance will be performed after one week of intensive insulin treatment. After discharge,
      patients will be randomized to receive insulin injection or oral anti-diabetic drug for
      further management. Patients will be followed in our clinics and adjust their medication
      according to their blood glucose levels. Oral glucose tolerance test will be repeated 6
      months later, whereas the insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function will be evaluated again.

      EXPECTED RESULTS—We will respect that short-term intensive insulin therapy can induce
      lone-term glycemic control in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe hyperglycemia.

    <description>Insulin therapy was initiated at a 75% total daily dose in the last day hospitalization with Insulatard. Two third of daily dose was administered before breakfast and the other was administered at bedtime. Insulin doses were titrated every 3 days to achieve target FPG and pre-supper blood glucose values between 90 and 130 mg/dl. Bedtime insulin doses were titrated based on FPG values and the pre-breakfast dose was titrated base on pre-supper blood glucose.</description>

    <description>Subject in other OAD group was visited every two weeks in the two months and the every four weeks. The subjects will start with Gliclazide-MR 30mg before breakfast, The dosage was titrated based on the fasting blood glucose on the visiting day with the same target. Decreased by 30mg if blood glucose was &lt;70mg /dl, decreased by 15 mg if blood glucose was 70-90mg/dl, no change if blood glucose was 90-130mg/dl, increased by 15 mg if blood glucose was 131-160 mg/dl, increased by 30 mg if blood glucose &gt;160mg/dl. When the Gliclazide-MR dose each to the maximum dose of 60 mg twice daily, Metformin was added. The titration of Metformin was use 250mg for an adjust dosage with the same target.</description>
