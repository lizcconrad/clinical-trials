  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this open-label study is to investigate the interaction of
      ketoconazole, a liver enzyme inhibitor, on oral LBH589 in adult patients with advanced solid
      tumors. The extension phase of the study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of LBH589 in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.
