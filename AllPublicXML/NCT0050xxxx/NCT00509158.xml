  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is responsible for over 2 million deaths each year. The development of an efficient
      vaccine would present by far the best solution for solving this disastrous situation.
      Liver-Stage-Antigen-3 (LSA-3) is an antigen that is mainly exhibited by Plasmodium falciparum
      sporozoites and liver-stage parasites. It is characterized by its remarkable antigenicity in
      humans with a wide range and a variety of B and T-lymphocyte epitopes, by its extremely high
      immunogenicity and by an excellent protective efficacy against sporozoite challenge in animal
      models. Therefore, PfLSA-3-rec is a promising candidate vaccine against P. falciparum in
      humans The aim is to screen two different formulations of the recombinant malaria vaccine
      PfLSA-3-rec, one adjuvated with aluminium hydroxide and one with Montanide Isa 720, by
      assessing the safety and immunogenicity (phase I) profile of each formulation in humans, as
      well as its protective efficacy following a sporozoite challenge (phase IIa).
