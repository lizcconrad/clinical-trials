      This study will investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) / total IL-1beta pharmacodynamic (PD)
      relationship in joint fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with
      different doses of ACZ885 and to evaluate the impact of the subcutaneous (s.c.) versus
      intravenous (i.v.) route of administration.

          -  Post-menopausal or surgically sterile female patients. Women of child-bearing
             potential if already on a stable dose of methotrexate and are practicing effective
             contraception for at least 3 months prior to screening, have a negative pregnancy test
             at screening and baseline, and are willing to use 2 forms of contraception including
             at least 1 barrier method during the study and for at least 2 months following the
             completion/discontinuation of the study. Male patients must be willing to use an
             effective contraception method during the study and at least for 2 months following
             the completion/discontinuation of the study.

          -  Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis, classified by ARA (American Rheumatism Association)
             1987 revised criteria (Appendix 2). Disease duration of at least 6 months prior to
             randomization is essential.

          -  Functional status class I, II or III classified according to the ACR (American College
             of Rheumatology) 1991 revised criteria (Appendix 3).

          -  Active disease at screening and baseline (Day 1 predose) evaluation (same evaluator):
             ≥ 6 tender and ≥ 6 swollen joints of 28 examined (including any effused joint) and
             either a) Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥ 28 mm/hour, or b)
             C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 1.0 mg/dL.

          -  Prior treatment with 1-3 disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) - Patients
             should have failed at least 1 DMARD but should not be deemed &quot;refractory to all
             therapies&quot;. Patients should be on a current treatment with methotrexate ≤ 25 mg/week
             and with the current dose stable for at least 3 months. All patients will take folic
             acid 1 mg daily, or 5 mg weekly post MTX dose, to minimize toxicity, according to
             local guidelines. In addition to methotrexate, patients may be on either a stable dose
             of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or a stable dose of oral
             corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent ≤ 10 mg daily) for at least 4 weeks prior to
             randomization. Patients who failed any DMARDs will be allowed.

          -  Negative purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test reaction (PPD 5
             tuberculin units or as according to local standard practice).

          -  Patients with a total white cell count and platelet count clinically acceptable for
             patients with RA; hemoglobin must be ≥ 10 g/dL and hematocrit ≥ 30% at screening and
             baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with anti-TNF-α or anti IL-1 therapy (or other biological therapy),
             immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, mycophenolate or tacrolimus. The
             following washout period will be required for such patients to be eligible to
             participate in the trial.

               1. 2 months washout prior to screening for etanercept or adalimumab

               2. 3 months washout prior to screening for infliximab

               3. 3 months washout prior to screening for rituximab

               4. 1 month washout prior to screening for cyclosporine, mycophenolate and
                  tacrolimus.

          -  If patient has been discontinued from other DMARDs for lack of efficacy or toxicity,
             the patient should be at least 1 month off the agent and the effects of that agent
             should have dissipated according to the recognized duration of effect (e.g.,
             sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine), or standard washout procedure (cholestyramine for
             leflunomide). Importantly, discontinuation should not be undertaken only for the
             purposes of participation in this study.

          -  Patients who have received intra-articular or systemic corticosteroid injections
             having been required for treatment of acute RA flare (not being part of a regular
             therapeutic regimen) within four weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Presence of or history of Major chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases like
             psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, inflammatory bowel disease or
             systemic lupus erythematosus.

        Renal trauma, glomerulonephritis or patient with one kidney. Patients with congestive heart
        failure (New York Heart Association class &gt; III), QT prolongation syndrome or poorly
        controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with a history of QTc prolongation will be excluded.
        A positive HIV test result, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C test result.
        Significant illness within 2 weeks prior to dosing or any active systemic infection or
        medical condition that may require treatment or therapeutic intervention during the study.
        Hypersensitivity to any biological agents, serious allergic reaction, collagen disease,
        neurological disease (including demyelinating disease). Any joint surgery in past 8 weeks
        or planned surgery within next 5 months. Cancer (other than basal cell cancer or adequately
        treated carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix). Drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior
        to dosing or evidence of such indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the
        screening or baseline evaluations. Underlying metabolic, endocrine, hematologic, pulmonary,
        cardiac, blood, renal, hepatic, infectious, psychiatric or gastrointestinal conditions
        which places the patient at unacceptable risk for participation in a study of an
        immunomodulatory therapy.

          -  Treatment with an investigational agent within 12 weeks prior to enrollment or longer
             if required by local regulation.
