      Abstract:

      Over 25 million HIV-1 infected individuals are currently living in Africa and as many as
      50-90% may be co-infected with soil transmitted helminths such as roundworms, hookworms or
      whipworms. Helminth infection in HIV-1-infected individuals may increase HIV-1 RNA levels and
      increase the rate of progression of HIV-1 to AIDS. Studies have also shown that successful
      treatment of helminth co-infection (as documented by clearance of helminth eggs in stool) led
      to a significant decrease in HIV-1 plasma viral load (-0.36 log10). This change in viral load
      was significantly greater than that seen in those individuals without documented clearance of
      their helminth co-infection (+0.67 log10) (p=0.04). Studies conducted in Africa have shown an
      estimated 2.5-fold increased risk for sexual transmission of the HIV-1 for each log increase
      in plasma HIV-1 viral load. In addition to direct effects on plasma viral load, the rate of
      CD4 cell decline in helminth infected individuals may be directly impacted by the significant
      immune activation seen with such co-infection.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial examining the potential benefits of
      routine empiric helminth eradication in HIV-1 infected adults who do not yet qualify for
      antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in Kenya. The current standard of care of symptomatic diagnosis
      and treatment will be compared to a systematic empiric scheduled de-worming program for HIV
      infected adults. The investigators will compare markers of disease progression including rate
      of CD4 decline and changes in HIV-1 RNA levels between the two treatment arms.

      INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE AND RATIONALE

      • Epidemiology of HIV-1 and helminth infections in Africa: Over two thirds of all HIV-1
      infected individuals live in Africa. An expected 4 million new infections will occur this
      year in Africa alone. While antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) offer the hope of stemming this
      tremendous public health disaster, the reality is that many individuals are not able to
      access ARTs. In addition, millions of HIV infected individuals do not yet qualify for ART
      based on clinical or immunologic staging criteria. Alternative care strategies to delay
      immunosuppression and reduce infectivity are critically needed. Treatment of co-infections
      that are prevalent in areas of high HIV-1 sero-prevalence may be one strategy to address this
      need.

      Helminths represent some of the most common infections of humans throughout the world. It is
      estimated that over half of all individuals living in Sub-Saharan Africa are infected with at
      least on species of soil transmitted helminths. Distribution mapping of HIV-1 sero-prevalence
      and helminth infection prevalence reveal remarkably geographic similarities.

      We have recently conducted a large study of helminth infection among HIV-1 infected adults at
      several sites in Kenya. While rates of helminth co-infection are highest in Kilifi and Nyanza
      sites, there is a significant rate of co-infection even within the greater Nairobi area.

      We also determined that while hookworm was the most common helminth identified in this
      cohort, the type of helminth infection varied significantly with the location.

      • Immunology of helminth co-infection: Helminth infection has been shown to have profound
      effects on the immune system. Chronic helminth infection leads to a dominant Th2 immune
      profile, anergy to various antigens, and significant activation of the immune system. These
      changes suggest that helminth co-infection may significantly affect the host immune response
      to HIV-1 viral replication and control. Such immune dysregulation may also increase HIV
      co-receptor expression and result in a cell population more susceptible to HIV infection.

      • Th1/Th2 Immune Bias: An important immunologic consequence of helminth infection is the
      polarization of the immune response to a TH2 subset. This immune modulation by helminth
      species appears to be important in tempering TH1 cell mediated inflammation and subsequent
      tissue damage to the host. Such modulation may be detrimental to the HIV-1 infected host by
      limiting the Th1 immune response that may be important for the control of HIV-1 replication.
      The TH2/TH1 response to infection is directly influenced by parasite biology. Helminth
      infection results in specific nematode-elicited macrophages (NeMacs) that directly induce
      naïve T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells. Cytokine mimics produced by some parasites are
      also able to directly induce Th2 cells. Other non-protein molecules produced by helminths are
      able to interact with dendritic cells and induce Th2 cells and Treg cells that produce IL-10
      and directly lead to a Th2 shift in naïve T cells.

      In addition to being inducers of Th2 cells, there is evidence that helminth infection can
      directly suppress the Th1 response. This reduction in the Th1 cytokine response is
      accompanied by a reduction in virus specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL's). Plasma
      HIV-1 viral load is directly related to HIV-1 specific CTL responses in humans and a
      reduction in CTL response is associated with a more rapid progression of HIV-1 disease.

      • Immune Activation: Individuals residing in Africa display high levels of immune activation.
      Initial studies of Ethiopian immigrants to Israel revealed elevated levels of plasma IgE and
      IgG as well as increased levels of eosinophilia that were strongly associated with the
      presence of helminth infection in this population. These individuals were also found to have
      significantly activated CD4 lymphocytes that correlated with reduced total CD4 number in this
      cohort.

      Several authors have suggested that this increased activation may be important in the
      pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. The uncontrolled T cell destruction characteristic of HIV
      infection is not due to the direct cytopathic effects of the virus but is more likely the
      result of activation-induced cell death. Immune activation markers (namely HLA-DR, Ki-67 and
      CD38) have been shown to be more predictive of CD4 decline than plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.
      Treatment of helminth infections can result in reversal of this activated immune state.

      Helminth co-infection and clinical HIV-1 disease progression in resource constrained settings
      • Effect of treatment on HIV-1 RNA: Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels correlate closely with the burden
      of helminth infection as measured by the number of excreted eggs per gram of stool (p &lt;
      0.001). In this same cohort, anti-helminth therapy leading to clearance of helminth eggs in
      the stool led to a significant decrease in HIV-1 plasma viral load (-0.36 log10) in this
      cohort. While this effect may appear modest, mathematical modeling suggests that a 0.5 log
      reduction in HIV-1 RNA levels would slow the onset of AIDS by 3.5 years and would delay the
      need for antiretroviral medications by almost a full year.

      To date, only one randomized controlled trial has been conducted evaluating the effect of
      treating helminths on markers of HIV-1 progression. In this small unblinded study conducted
      in Zimbabwe, individuals with schistosomiasis (both with and without HIV-1 infection) were
      randomized to receive praziquantel at inclusion or after a delay of 3 months. The study found
      that the HIV-1 infected individuals receiving early treatment of schistosomiasis had no
      change in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels compared to an increase in HIV-1 RNA levels in the delayed
      treatment group. However, several other observational studies evaluating the effect of
      treating helminth co-infection have found that successful eradication of helminths had no
      effect on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels or even led to transient increases in viral load. We are
      currently conducting a systematic review for the Cochrane Library evaluating all of the
      available data examining the effect of treating helminths of HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 counts.

        -  Effect of treatment on CD4 count:

      Studies evaluating changes in CD4 counts following therapy for helminth co-infection have
      largely failed to find significant differences. The randomized controlled trial noted above
      did find that patients treated for helminths in the early treatment group (both HIV
      seropositive and seronegative) had a increase in absolute CD4 counts compared to no change in
      CD4 counts in the delayed treatment group (p &lt; 0.05). Another study conducted in Ethiopia
      found that the treatment of helminth infection in a population of co-infected individuals
      resulted in a significant increase in absolute CD4 counts (192 versus 279 cells/mm3, p =
      0.002). Other studies have shown no significant difference in CD4 decline following
      anti-helminth treatment. The systematic review currently in preparation has not found a trend
      towards an effect on CD4 counts in the available studies though all included studies were of
      short duration (4 months or less).

      • Justification of the Study: It is important to determine if empiric deworming can be
      beneficial for the millions of pre-HAART HIV-1 positive individuals living in helminth
      endemic areas. Documenting the potential effects of such an intervention on markers of
      disease progression will serve to inform practical approaches for cost-effective
      interventions in resource limited settings. Interval anti-helminth therapy may be a feasible
      option in many areas of the world to delay immunosuppression, to enhance the response to
      antiretroviral therapy or to reduce infectiousness in HIV-1 infected individuals. In
      addition, as patients progress to HAART, it is important to determine the ideal timing for
      helminth eradication.

      • Hypothesis: An empiric intensive treatment regimen to eliminate helminths in patients with
      HIV-1 may impact markers of disease progression, namely CD4 count and plasma HIV-1 RNA
      levels, when compared to current standard of practice in Kenya.

      • Overall General Objectives: To evaluate the effect of an empiric intensive helminth
      eradication regimen on HIV-1 disease progression in a cohort of HIV-1 infected Kenyan adults
      who do not meet criteria for highly active antiretroviral therapy.

      • Specific Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the effect of an intensive, empiric deworming regimen on changes in markers
           of HIV-1 disease progression, namely time to ART eligibility and time to CD4 count less
           than 200 and less than 350 cells/mm3 in a cohort of HIV-1 infected adult Kenyans not
           meeting criteria for antiretrovirals.

        2. To determine if intensive treatment of intestinal helminths in HIV-1 infected adults can
           reduce markers of clinical disease progression as measured by WHO staging criteria,
           hospitalization and death.

           DESIGNS AND METHODOLOGY • Study Site: The study will be conducted at several HIV care
           sites in Kenya. The University of Washington has a history of collaborative research
           with the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the University of Nairobi, and Kenyatta
           National Hospital; all leading academic institutions in Kenya. Enrollment in the
           randomized clinical trial will take place at up to three sites in Kenya. The
           determination of sites will be based on ongoing studies of helminth prevalence in Kenya
           (Walson JL, Otieno P, ongoing) and may include AMREF/CDC Clinic in Kibera, KNH
           Comprehensive Care Clinic, KEMRI CCC, Homa Bay District Hospital, Kisii District
           Hospital, Kisumu District Hospital, Kerugoya District Hospital, Machakos District
           Hospital, Mbagathi District Hospital, Thika District Hospital, and The Comprehensive
           Care and Research Clinic at Kilifi District Hospital (CGMR-C).

             -  Study Populations:

           Individuals who are 18 years or older, who are not currently on antiretroviral therapy
           and who are interested in study participation will be enrolled after written informed
           consent is obtained.

           • Sample Size: Sample size determination - Assuming a power of 90% and alpha of 0.05, we
           have calculated that 340 individuals would be needed in each arm to detect a difference
           in CD4 decline of 50 cells/mm3 between the two groups (SD of 200 cells/mm3) over the two
           years of follow up. Given a maximum expected loss to follow up of approximately 20% over
           the 24 months of follow up and a maximum of 20% beginning ARV therapy, we will enroll
           1200 individuals in the trial to ensure that 340 individuals are available in each arm
           for analysis. This sample size will also provide greater than 90% power to detect a 0.5
           log difference in log10 HIV RNA levels between the treatment arms.

             -  Study design:

           Specific Aim 1: randomized clinical trial Specific Aim 2: randomized clinical trial

             -  Procedures:

           Summary: We propose a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of an intensive
           deworming care package versus standard of care in a cohort of HIV-1 seropositive adults
           who do not yet meet criteria for antiretroviral medications. Participants will be
           randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm 1 will receive an intensive regimen of
           anti-helminthic therapy consisting of albendazole every three months for two years and
           praziquantel at enrollment and at one year of follow up. Arm 2 will receive symptomatic
           diagnosis and treatment of helminth infection as is current standard of care in Kenya.
           The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate changes in CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA
           over the two years of follow up in each of the study arms.

           Adult men and women participating in or referred to the HIV Care and Treatment Clinics
           at each of the included sites will be offered screening for eligibility. HIV-1
           seropositive individuals with a documented CD4 count greater than 350 cells/mm3 will be
           considered potentially eligible. Those who agree to participate, are willing and able to
           provide informed consent, are WHO stage I or II based on clinical exam and history, are
           18 years of age or older, have not been treated with worm medication in the previous 4
           months and who are not pregnant (based on urine beta-HCG testing if female) will be
           offered to participate in this trial. Pregnancy testing will be performed at each study
           visit (every three months) for all premenopausal women. Women who become pregnant during
           the course of the study will continue to be followed but will not receive any further
           study medication during pregnancy if they had been randomized to study arm A.

             -  Clinical Trial:

           Screening for trial eligibility:

           At each selected clinical trial study site, HIV-1 infected individuals who meet
           inclusion and exclusion criteria will be informed about the ongoing study. A physical
           examination will be conducted on all prospective clients, and those found to have
           clinical pallor or signs of WHO Stage III or IV HIV will be excluded from the study and
           referred for appropriate medical management. Those who meet criteria and wish to
           participate will be referred to the study staff for possible enrollment.

           All invited participants will be required to sign written informed consent prior to
           enrollment. At enrollment, all participants will complete a standardized questionnaire
           assessing medical and social history and will undergo a complete physical examination.
           Blood specimens will be collected for full blood count with differential measurement of
           absolute CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA levels.

           A detailed questionnaire will also be administered in order to assess socio-economic
           status, living conditions, level of education completed and occupation. This
           questionnaire will also document potential exposures to helminth infection such as water
           supply, sanitation facilities, exposure to large bodies of water and type of foot
           covering used. In addition, a detailed clinical history will also be collected to
           document any prior illnesses or treatments relevant to HIV-1 or co-infections.

           Detailed information regarding the location of each participant's current residence and
           any additional residences that they consider as a primary dwelling will also be
           collected by field workers at each site. Global positioning system information will be
           collected at the location of each participants site of primary residence to facilitate
           patient tracing. This information will be stored as well as any other potential contact
           information available (such as cell phone numbers) in order that participants may be
           traced for the purposes of the study.

           After signing informed consent and being enrolled, participants will be randomized into
           one of two treatment arms. The study biostatistician will generate block randomization
           codes for the sites. Both the investigators and the participants will remain blinded to
           study arm allocation until randomization occurs.

           All enrolled participants will have scheduled study visits every third month for 24
           months (enrollment, months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24) at the clinic from which they
           were enrolled. At each follow up visit, a standardized questionnaire designed to assess
           any change in socio-demographic variables or clinical history will be performed. A
           physical examination will also be performed at each visit. Blood will be collected at
           enrollment, months 6, 12, 18 and 24 for measurement of full blood count with
           differential and CD4 count. Measurement of HIV-1 RNA will be collected at enrollment,
           the 12 month visit and the 24 month visit. All blood will be separated into plasma and
           PBMC's (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and stored for future studies. Any future
           study utilizing stored specimens will obtain approval from both the Kenya Medical
           Research Institute and the University of Washington Ethical Review Boards. All
           participants will provide a single stool sample at the final 24 month follow up visit to
           determine helminth infection status at that time.

           • Rationale for not screening stool samples at each visit: Participants will not be
           screened for helminth infection at enrollment or during the course of this study. The
           only testing for helminth infection status will occur at the final visit. The rationale
           for this design is principally due to the study objectives. The study is designed to
           assess the potential benefit of empiric helminth therapy in HIV-1 infected individual's
           not yet meeting criteria for initiation of antiretroviral medications. As such, it is
           important to determine if HIV infected individuals in areas of moderate helminth
           prevalence (20-40%) would benefit from a program of empiric deworming as part of their
           pre-HAART care package. It is critical that participants be enrolled regardless of
           helminth infection status in order to determine if empiric therapy should be considered
           as a useful addition to the care package currently provided to these individuals.

           Storage of stool samples for evaluation of helminth status following completion of the
           study is also not feasible for several reasons. Most importantly, there are ethical
           issues related to the collection of samples (and therefore the potential knowledge of
           infection status) without providing directed therapy. If helminth status is known (or
           potentially known), the standard of care in Kenya would change from symptomatic
           screening and treatment to definitive pathogen directed therapy. This would alter the
           intervention arms in the current study. In addition, the most common helminth at all of
           the sites sampled in our previous study was hookworm. Hookworm eggs are fragile and
           rapidly degrade. None of the currently available techniques will preserve hookworm eggs
           reliably and so any delayed evaluation of helminth infection status is likely to miss
           many infections and therefore not provide any additional useful information.

           • Laboratory:

           Between ten and twenty millilitres of blood will be drawn each visit where laboratory
           investigations are being conducted (months 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24). This quantity of blood
           is being drawn for the following assays:

        1. CD4 measurement (5 mL) will be assessed by FACSCount or FACSCalibur at the individual
           study sites or at the KEMRI/University of Washington Flow Laboratory at the Centre for
           Clinical Research in Nairobi, Kenya.

        2. Full Blood Counts with Differential (2 mL) will be assessed at each individual study
           site.

        3. Stool microscopy will be performed by technicians with training and certification in the
           differentiation and quantification of stool helminth species. Stool will be prepared for
           examination by wet preparation, Kato-Katz technique and formol-ether concentration. Both
           qualitative and quantitative diagnosis will be made for all helminths identified in
           stool.

        4. Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA) (3 mL) will be assessed in the Centre for Clinical
           Research, KEMRI.

        5. HIV-1 RNA levels (10 mL) will be quantified at the Kenya Medical Research
           Institute/Centers for Disease Control, Kenya.

           • Data Management and Analysis: This study is being carried out at several clinical
           sites in Kenya. Clinical and laboratory data for each participant will be abstracted
           from routine clinical data forms into standardized trial files. These data will be
           entered weekly into a computer using a computerized database designed and maintained by
           the study investigators. Information will be cross checked for accuracy on a bi-weekly
           basis. All data, both hard and soft copy format, will be stored in locked cabinets with
           limited access by study staff only. Participants will be identified by a unique study ID
           number and the code linking the study ID to individual identifying information will be
           kept in a separate secure location by the principal investigator.

           All data will be collected on preprinted forms and data entered into a software data
           management program (Teleform SPSS, MS ACCESS or SQL). Data will be collected at
           enrollment and at each follow up visit on these forms. Following collection, the data
           forms will be entered into the database as described above. Original data forms will be
           stored in the study offices with access restricted to study investigators. Following
           completion of all data collection, the data forms will be archived. At 1-year following
           completion of the study, identifiers will be removed from the data. Data will be the
           property or KEMRI and the University of Washington.

           Data verification:

           A data clerk from KEMRI will be employed to hand verify that all data is completed
           accurately and that the computerized scanned data is comparable to the paper forms. Data
           will be cleaned by the Principal Investigator, the data manager and data clerk and at
           that time a second verification of accuracy will be performed.

           Data Analysis:

           Aim 1: All analyses will be intent-to-treat. To assess the success of randomization we
           will compare baseline characteristics between the 2 randomization groups using
           Chi-square tests for categorical data and Mann-Whitney U-tests or t-tests for continuous
           data. To determine the effect of anti-helminth treatment on disease progression markers,
           we will compare the time to eligibility for ART between the groups and the time to CD4
           counts of less than 200 and 350 respectively using Cox regression analysis models. If
           current treatment guidelines for the initiation of ART change during the course of the
           study, the analysis plan would incorporate that change in ART eligibility criteria as a
           date dependent event. In addition, we will compare changes in measurements of mean CD4
           count and log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA in the two study arms using linear mixed effects models
           or linear regression censoring values after initiation of ART.

           Aim 2: To determine the effect of anti-helminth treatment on clinical disease
           progression markers, we will compare time to changes in WHO Clinical Staging, time to
           hospitalization, and time to death using Cox regression analysis models. We will also
           compare the treatment arms for CD4 response to ARVs, and development of IRIS among those
           who initiate therapy during the course of the trial using regression models.

           Efficacy assessment The primary measure of efficacy for the randomized clinical trial is
           the time to ART eligibility and the time to CD4 counts of less than 200 and 350
           cells/mm3. Secondary measures of efficacy will include changes in WHO Clinical Staging,
           development of IRIS, time to hospitalization, time to death, time to initiation of ARVs
           and CD4 response to ARVs as well as the development of IRIS among those who initiate
           ARVs.

           Safety and loss to follow up All participants will be monitored over the course of the
           trial for adverse events, laboratory abnormalities and HIV related morbidity. Any
           participant experiencing National Institutes of Health grade 3-4 toxicity after receipt
           of anti-helminthic therapy will be withdrawn from the study.

           A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be convened and will meet every 6 months
           following the start of enrolment to review safety data including all adverse events,
           protocol violations and any other reported events. In addition, the DSMB will review
           interim data when 250 patients have completed 12 months of follow up.

           Participants failing to meet a clinic appointment or follow up will be identified and
           have their study file flagged. If a participant fails to return to clinic within two
           weeks following a missed appointment, a social worker or peer counselor will attempt to
           contact the participant to encourage attendance using the contact information provided
           at enrollment. All attempts at contact will be recorded. If a participant desires to be
           removed from the study or fails to follow up after 3 consecutive attempts by the peer
           counselors or social workers to encourage follow up, the participant will be considered
           lost to follow up. It the study staff is unable to trace the patient for a period of 60
           days following a missed appointment, the participant will be considered lost to follow
           up. If a participant dies in the course of the study, a verbal autopsy will be obtained
           from family members or household contacts where possible for classification of possible
           cause of death.

           Participants who meet criteria for the initiation of septrin prophylaxis or ARV's during
           the course of the study (based on CD4 count or clinical criteria) will be referred for
           initiation of treatment at the clinic at which they were enrolled. All of the clinics
           considered as study sites are supported by Government of Kenya and PEPFAR and provide
           antiretroviral therapy and septrin prophylaxis at no charge to clients who qualify.

             -  Time Schedule:

           This study will require approximately 3-4 years for completion. Enrollment will occur
           over a 6 month period. All participants will be followed for 24 months after enrollment.
           Thus, it will take approximately 2.5 years to enroll, randomize and complete follow up
           for all of the patients in the study. An additional 6 months of preparation time will be
           required to develop the database and prepare each site for study enrollment. Following
           completion of follow up, we anticipate an additional 6 months will be necessary to
           complete all laboratory investigations, data analysis, data cleaning and completion of a
           manuscript.

           • Ethical Considerations:

           • Ethical approval: Study approvals will be obtained from the University of Washington
           and the KEMRI ethical review boards.

           • Benefits: This study has been designed to address several areas of major public health
           significance for HIV-1 infected individuals in resource poor settings. If we are able to
           show that treatment of helminth co-infection in HIV-1 infected individual's delays
           immunosuppression, millions of HIV infected individuals in resource poor settings may
           benefit. Participants randomized to the intensive intervention arm will benefit from
           free treatment and examination given to them. All participants will benefit from
           intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring.

           • Voluntary Participation: All subjects will provide written informed consent prior to
           study enrolment. Consent forms will be made available in Swahili as well as in English.
           All patients will have the opportunity to have the forms explained to them and to ask
           questions of the investigator prior to study enrollment. Patients will be informed of
           their right to withdraw consent at any time. Since the participants will spend extra
           time to participate in the study, they will receive compensation for transport, but no
           other compensation will be provided to them.

           The field sites where patients will be recruited for screening and enrollment are in
           Kenya. All of these sites are currently receiving support through CDC Kenya using the
           PEPFAR mechanism. Laboratory procedures will be performed at each clinic site, in
           Nairobi and in Seattle, Washington. The study will be reviewed by the Institutional
           Review Board (IRB) at the University of Washington and the Ethical Review Board (ERC) at
           the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). The study will not recruit subjects prior
           to approval from both the University of Washington IRB and the KEMRI ERC.

             -  Risks:

           Patients will be informed of all potential risks. The proposed study will involve adult
           men and women infected with HIV-1. All participants will be interviewed. Participants
           may experience discomfort while answering some of the questions regarding socio-economic
           status. Participants may also be uncomfortable discussing or providing stool samples for
           helminth screening. Study staff including social workers and/or peer counselors may
           contact the participants by telephone or visit the participants in their home if
           scheduled appointments are missed. These visits will be conducted in a manner designed
           to protect confidentiality but it is impossible to completely eliminate the risk of
           further social stigmatization for participants.

           This study involves serial blood specimen collection at 5 time points over a two year
           period (enrollment and months 6, 12, 18, and 24). The collection of these samples
           involves venipuncture which may cause discomfort, pain or bruising. Precautions will be
           taken to avoid bleeding by immediate application of a pack and pressure at the injection
           sites.

           All participants will provide written informed consent prior to screening or enrollment.
           Any adverse events associated with anti-helminthic medications will be managed by the
           appropriate clinic site, and if necessary, hospitalization. The costs of this care will
           be borne by the study. All clinical information including HIV status that is collected
           for the purposes of the study will be delinked from any client's identifier. This
           includes data collected in the clinic and in the laboratory. All data will be entered
           into a password protected computer with no links to identifiers. The code linking
           individual patient identifiers to a unique study ID will be kept securely locked in a
           separate location under control of the study principal investigator. All study files
           will be accessible only to researchers and will be stored in a locked office when not in
           use.

           There may be risks associated with use of the study medications, albendazole and
           praziquantel:

           Albendazole is a benzimidazole carbamate derivative with activity against most nematodes
           and some other worms. Albendazole is thought to inhibit cytoplasmic microtubules in the
           worm's intestinal tract leading to decreased glucose uptake and depletion of glycogen
           stores in the worm. Three 400 mg doses of albendazole has efficacy against whipworm,
           hookworm and roundworm infections, all of which we expect to be prevalent in this
           cohort. A recent randomized controlled trial of various albendazole dosing regimens
           showed that a single 400mg dose of albendazole was associated with a significantly lower
           rate of cure (23%) compared to a three day regimen (67%). In this study, reduction in
           the number of eggs/gm of feces with a single 400mg dose was 96.8% compared to 99.7% with
           the three day regimen. Albendazole is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
           and has minimal side-effects.

           Praziquantel is a heterocyclic prazino-isoquinoline derivative with significant activity
           against both cestodes and trematodes. Praziquantel is highly effective against
           schistosomes in humans and there have been no confirmed cases of resistance reported.
           Praziquantel is well tolerated and severe adverse reactions are rare. There have been
           rare cases of increased intracranial pressure during treatment in patients with
           neurocysticercosis. This is not anticipated to be an issue in Kenya due to the low level
           of pork consumption in this population and the rarity of Taenia solium. In the study
           described above, we screened over 1600 individuals for helminths and documented no cases
           of Taenia solium (Walson J, unpublished data). Praziquantel is contraindicated in
           pregnancy and all female patients will undergo urine beta-HCG testing prior to
           administration. Pregnant or breast feeding women will not receive praziquantel.

           Patients with obvious clinical signs or symptoms of anaemia, significant diarrhoea or
           abdominal pain will not be enrolled. Neither routine screening of asymptomatic helminth
           infection nor empiric anti-helminth therapy is currently conducted in adults in Kenya.

           • Confidentiality: Patients will be assigned a study number at enrollment. This number
           will be used to identify patients for all matters related to data analysis. The forms
           linking patient names and demographic information to particular ID numbers will be kept
           locked in a file at the office of the Fellow Investigator.

           • Expected application of result: We anticipate that the proposed study will help to
           determine the role that common helminth co-infections play in HIV-1 pathogenesis and
           progression. If empiric deworming is found to significantly slow HIV-1 disease
           progression, it may be a cost-effective and easily implemented strategy to add to the
           current treatment options in helminth endemic areas.
