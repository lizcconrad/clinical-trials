  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess whether Growth Hormone(GH)improves exercise capacity
      and cardiopulmonary performance in patients with chronic heart failure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      clinical studies have focused the effects of GH on left ventricular function and
      hemodynamics. Little is known about the impact of GH on cardiopulmonary performance and
      exercise capacity. Such data would be relevant, given the well-recognized importance of
      cardiopulmonary performance and exercise capacity as markers of disease progression and
      predictors of mortality in patients with CHF.Consequently we conducted a randomised double
      blind placebo controlled trial to investigate the effects of a three month course of GH,
      adjunctive to background therapy, on cardiopulmonary performance and exercise capacity in
      patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and CHF.The primary outcome of the study was improvement
      of peak VO2 assessed by a cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Secondary endpoints were exercise
      capacity and ejection fraction obtained by echocardiography.
