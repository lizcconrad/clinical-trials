    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      esmirtazapine (Org 50081) compared to placebo in patients with chronic primary insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common complaint or disorder throughout the world. About one third of the
      population in the industrial countries reports difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep,
      resulting in a non-refreshing or non-restorative sleep. The majority of the insomniacs suffer
      chronically from their complaints. It has been reported that in patients with chronic
      insomnia lasting longer than six months, 50% had a past or current mental disorder. This
      raises the possibility that treatment of insomnia may reduce the risk for psychological
      conditions. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial is
      designed to assess the efficacy and safety of esmirtazapine in patients suffering from
      chronic primary insomnia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO) During the In-Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 to Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>WASO was defined as the total objective time awake after the onset of persistent sleep until the end of the 8-hour sleep cycle period as measured by polysomnography (PSG). WASO was calculated as the mean of Nights 1, 15, and 36.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Latency to Persistent Sleep (LPS) During the In-Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 to Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>LPS was defined as the time in minutes from lights out to the first 20 consecutive epochs scored as sleep as measured by PSG. LPS was calculated as the mean of Nights 1, 15, and 36.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Subjective Total Sleep Time (TST) During the In-Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 to Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>TST was defined as the total amount of time in minutes that was actually spent sleeping the previous night as recorded daily in the participant's sleep diary. TST values over the 6 week In-Treatment Period were averaged for each participant, and average TST was then reported by treatment arm. For participants with missing data, the average of the nights for which TST data were available was used in the analysis.</description>
