      The QuickClose study is a prospective, non-randomized study, to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the QuickClose device using two different dose types of heat exposure.

      Patients undergoing a diagnostic angiogram procedure will be treated with the QuickClose
      device. Two groups of 20 patients each, will be enrolled consecutively, Group A will complete
      enrollment before enrollment into Group B begins. Patients will be monitored until 30 days
      after the procedure

      The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of major complications related to method for
      achieving hemostasis at the puncture site. The secondary safety endpoint is the incidence of
      minor complications related to method for achieving hemostasis at the puncture site. The
      primary efficacy endpoint are time to hemostasis, time to ambulation and time to discharge .
      The secondary efficacy endpoints are device and procedure success.
