      Background: Several studies have indicated that infants who had undergone postnatal painful
      procedures appear to be hypersensitive to pain, with a lower threshold to tactile
      stimulations later on life.

      Objective: To study the effect of early exposure to pain on cerebral somatosensory evoked
      potential (SEP) response to thermal stimulation (550C), in preterm and full term born
      adolescents (15-18 years old), who have undergone painful procedures during their neonatal
      period. As well as to study the effect of early exposure to thermal and tactile sensory
      thresholds and pain thresholds to thermal and tactile stimuli, by using the TSA and von Frey
      hairs.

      Design: Case-control study.

      Participants: Four groups of 20 adolescents (aged 15-18 years), two of which are full term
      and preterm-born who were exposed to painful procedures during the neonatal period. The other
      two groups are term and preterm-born adolescents who were not exposed to such procedures.

      Main Outcome Measures: Cerebral SEP response (P300, Medoc Ltd., Israel) to thermal
      stimulation (550C). Warm-sensation threshold (WST), heat-pain threshold (HPT), Cold sensation
      threshold (CST) and cold pain threshold (CPT) by using Thermal sensory analyzer
      (TSA-2001,Medoc Ltd., Israel). Pain threshold to tactile stimulation will be measured by
      using Von-Frey hairs.
