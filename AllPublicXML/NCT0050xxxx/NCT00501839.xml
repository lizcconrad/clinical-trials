  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anovulatory infertility is a common feature of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
      Clomiphene citrate (CC) represents the first therapeutic option for treating the anovulatory
      infertility in PCOS patients because it is characterized by low costs, limited dose-dependent
      side effects, and simplicity of administration and management due to no need for ongoing
      monitoring.

      Excellent results in terms of ovulations have been obtained using CC. However, only 50% of
      patients who ovulates under CC will conceive. The exact explanation for the discrepancy
      between the ovulation and pregnancy rates is unknown, but several hypotheses on the
      anti-estrogenic effects that CC exerts on the ovary and uterus have been suggested.

      To date, few data are available on the optimal schedule for CC administration, and it is
      unknown how long patients who ovulate under CC should continue treatment before switching to
      second-line ovulation induction therapy. The aim of the study was to define the clinical
      benefits of CC administration according to its duration of administration.

      Infertile PCOS patients who had three previous ovulatory cycles under CC will be enrolled and
      randomized in three groups (groups A, B, and C). In group A, patients will receive cyclic
      progestogens for nine months; in group B, patients will continue CC treatment for further
      three cycles at the same ovulating doses followed by six months of cyclic progestogens; and
      in group C, patients will continue CC administration at the same ovulating doses for nine
      cycles. In each case, CC will be administered using a traditional incremental-doses protocol
      up to 150 mg daily.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the clinical and reproductive
      outcomes, and the adverse experience will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant. Continuous variables will be analyzed with the unpaired t
      test and general linear model for repeated measures analysis with Bonferroni test for the
      post-hoc analysis as required. For categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square and Fisher's
      exact tests will be used. Cumulative pregnancy rate, our primary end-point, will be
      calculated by the Kaplan-Maier method, and the differences between the two groups will be
      assessed with the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards model will be used to calculate the
      hazard ratio for new pregnancy in both groups.
