  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer can benefit from palliative
      chemotherapy. However, over half of patients with metastatic gastric cancer who received
      chemotherapy failed to achieve response and even in these responders, the duration of
      responses was as short as a few months. Patients with metastatic gastric cancer who fail to
      respond or have relapse after first line chemotherapy have a grim prognosis and a standard
      salvage treatment is not available.

      We designed this phase II trial to determine the efficacy and safety of irinotecan
      monotherapy or combination (ILF) as second-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.
