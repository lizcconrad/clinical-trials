  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NeuroModulation Technique (NMT) is
      effective in reducing maladaptive behaviors and increasing adaptive behaviors in children
      diagnosed with autism.

      Hypothesis: Children in the Experimental group will show significant improvement over the
      Wait-List control group as measured by the Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavioral
      Inventory (PDDBI), the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, Community Version (ABC-C), and the Autism
      Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). Children in the Wait-List control group will show
      significant improvement over their baseline measures after receiving NMT treatment.

    <description>Children in both the Experimental and Wait-List control groups will show significant improvement over their respective baseline scores in these primary outcome measures following NMT treatment, which will reflect an improvement in adaptive behaviors as well as a decrease in maladaptive behaviors.</description>

    <description>NeuroModulation Technique is an informational technique that works by identifying and bringing awareness of the mind-body to incorrect informational states of the nervous system which has led to illness or maladaptive behavior. NeuroModulation Technique then directs the body to correct these information states, thereby helping the nervous system resume more adaptive functioning.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Qualified participants are those who have received a formal diagnosis of autism from a
             physician or psychologist using DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR or ICD-9-CM diagnostic criteria.
             Parents and/or legal guardian must supply proof of autism diagnosis. Autism (DSM-IV,
             DSM-IV-R or ICD-9-CM 299.0) must be diagnosed - any other diagnosis such as Pervasive
             Developmental Disorder (PDD), Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified
             (PDD-NOS) or Asperger Syndrome is not sufficient for inclusion in this study.

          -  Children must have had their diagnosis of autism for at least one year prior to the
             date of the application for participation in this study.

          -  Children must not have started any new therapies or stopped any ongoing therapies
             designed to treat their autism such behavior therapy, speech therapy, physical
             therapy, sensory integration, dietary modification or dietary supplementation, or any
             alternative or experimental therapies not mentioned here in the 6 months prior to the
             date of the application for participation in this study.

          -  During the course of this study, children will be required to continue with any
             therapies they have been receiving prior to starting the study, and they will be
             required to not start any new therapies besides NeuroModulation Technique during the
             course of this study.

          -  Parents and/or legal guardians of children in the study must be fluent in English and
             complete all forms and questionnaires in English (for U.S. and Canadian research sites
             only)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excluded from participating will be children with any of the following medical
             conditions: cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome, traumatic brain injury, encephalitis,
             Lyme disease, cancer, any active infectious disease, endocrine disorder, other mental
             disorders such as psychotic disorders or other mood disorders including bipolar
             disorders, or any acute, chronic or unstable medical condition (such as a seizure
             disorder, Crohn's disease, asthma, bronchitis, etc.) other than autism for which the
             child has been receiving treatment, medication and/or therapy.

          -  Also excluded from the study are children who have undergone chelation therapy in the
             past or are currently undergoing chelation therapy, and children who have displayed
             significant self-injurious behavior (children who have caused visible harm to
             themselves).Children with a history of mild to moderate food or airborne allergies,
             sensitivities, or mild digestive problems are eligible to participate in the study.

          -  In order to participate in the study, children must not have received any previous
             NeuroModulation Technique treatment.
