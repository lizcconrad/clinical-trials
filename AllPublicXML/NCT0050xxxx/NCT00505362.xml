  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suture reapproximation of the rectus muscles at primary cesarean delivery is a common
      practice about which there are no data. Some Obstetricians believe that suture
      reapproximation of the rectus muscles increases post-operative pain, and it may decrease
      adhesions, yet there are no published data to support or refute these claims. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the effect of rectus muscle reapproximation at cesarean delivery and
      post-operative pain. We also plan to assess the impact of rectus muscle closure on adhesions
      as seen at repeat cesarean delivery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are more than 1 million cesarean deliveries performed annually in the United States, at
      a rate of 30.2% of all deliveries. Data are limited regarding optimal surgical closure
      techniques to minimize adhesions at cesarean. Adhesions are implicated in pelvic pain,
      infertility, difficult repeat surgery, and bowel obstruction. Practice techniques regarding
      rectus muscle reapproximation vary widely, and there are no data regarding the impact of this
      step on pain, and some data suggesting a reduction in significant adhesions. Given the
      frequency of cesarean deliveries, small changes in surgical technique may yield significant
      benefits.

      We hope to learn 1) whether suture reapproximation of the rectus muscles increases pain, and
      2) the degree to which suture reapproximation of the rectus muscles alters adhesions when
      studied in a prospective, randomized trial.

      All patients undergoing primary cesarean delivery at Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital (LPCH)
      will be offered the study. Once consented, patients will be randomized to one of two
      standardized closure techniques at cesarean: two-layer uterine closure, peritoneal closure,
      fascial and skin closure, and either reapproximation of the rectus muscles with
      three-interrupted sutures, or non-closure. Intra-operative and post-operative pain management
      will be standardized. Subjects will undergo pain assessments while in-house on post-operative
      days 1 and 3, and at the standard post-partum clinic visit after 6 weeks. These assessments
      will require less than 5 minutes of the patient's time. Patients will be shown a pain chart,
      and will be asked to rate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 at rest. They will then stand up
      and rate their pain again. Pain medication usage will also be assessed.

      The surgeons will know the groups to which the patients are randomized. The patients and
      those collecting data on pain scores will not.

      Primary Endpoint: combined opioid use and movement pain score (Silverman Integrated
      Assessment-SIA) 72 post-operative hours.

      Secondary Endpoint: surgical complications, maternal satisfaction with analgesia.

    <description>Post-operative pain was assessed using Silverman Integrated Assessment (SIA) pain score which combines the opioid use and movement pain score over the 72-hour study period. The SIA pain and opioid score is calculated by first rank ordering each patient's total opioid use (morphine milligram equivalents) and area under the curve (AUC) movement pain score over the 72 hour study period, then calculating a mean for both opioid use and movement pain scores, expressing both opioid use and movement pain score as percent differences from the mean, and lastly adding the percent differences from the mean for the two variables. The SIA composite score value for each subject ranges from approximately 200% to approximately -200%, with the highest positive score indicating the least comfortable or the most pain despite the greatest use of analgesics, and the lowest score indicating the most comfortable or least pain despite the least use of analgesics.</description>
