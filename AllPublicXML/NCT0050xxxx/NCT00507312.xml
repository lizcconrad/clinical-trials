  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be testing two devices which are designed to detect cardiovascular disease in
      patients as early as possible. As there are now many therapies to prevent and treat this
      condition it is believed that detecting it early will help reduce the burden of the disease
      and permit more effective treatment.

      The two devices the investigators are testing are the ViScope developed by HD Medical and a
      device developed by CSIRO. Both of these devices are simple, non-invasive and may provide
      useful information on how well the heart contracts and relaxes as well as valve function of
      the heart.

      The investigators are planning to enroll 100 healthy subjects, 100 participants with risk
      factors for heart failure and 300 patients with varying types of heart failure.

      The data collected from the experimental devices will be compared to the results from
      standard tests.

      Patients will not have any of their therapies altered as part of this study.
