  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from chronic infections of the lower respiratory
      tract that can be caused by one or multiple bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which
      has been particularly problematic to eradicate and been implicated as the major cause of
      morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Aerosol delivery of antibiotics directly to the lung
      increases the local concentrations of antibiotic at the site of infection resulting in
      improved antimicrobial effects compared to systemic administration. Bacterial resistance to
      current aerosol antibiotic treatments indicate a need for improved therapies to treat CF
      patients with pulmonary infections caused by multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
      other bacteria. High concentrations of MP-376 delivered directly to the lung are projected to
      have antimicrobial effects on even the most resistant organisms and reduce the emergence of
      resistant bacteria.

      This trial will be a single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalating between cohorts,
      single and multi-dose, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic profile of levofloxacin administered as MP-376 once, then twice daily for 14
      days by the aerosol route to CF patients.
