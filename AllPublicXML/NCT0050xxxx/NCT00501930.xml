      This study will assess safety and tolerability when taking GSK189075 at doses that are likely
      to be higher than the expected prescribed doses. The study will also measure the level of
      GSK189075 in blood after dosing as well as the effect of the drug on certain laboratory tests
      performed on volunteer urine and blood. Each volunteer will take part in 3 dosing periods and
      will be given a different dose level at each period (either 2000mg, 4000mg, or a placebo).
      Volunteers will not know which of the three doses they are receiving. In each period,
      volunteers will dose every morning for three straight days. Before and after dosing, blood
      pressure, heart rate, laboratory tests on blood and urine, physical examinations and ECGs
      will be taken to assess safety. Volunteers will also be asked to provide information should
      they feel they are having a possible effect from the GSK189075. The levels of GSK189075 in
      the blood will be assessed by multiple blood draws, most of these will follow the third dose
      in each period. Depending on the results from the preceding periods, a fourth period may be
      added to the study to assess another dose level. The fourth period, if this is to occur, will
      be the same design as the other three periods, and the dose received will be less than
      4000mg.
