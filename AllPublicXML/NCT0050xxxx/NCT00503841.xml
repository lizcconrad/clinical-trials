      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating women
      undergoing surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the effect of erlotinib hydrochloride on expression of interleukin (IL)-1α
           in patients with estrogen receptor (ER-)-negative, EGFR-positive and IL-1α-positive
           breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the effect of erlotinib hydrochloride on expression of nuclear NF-κB and
           amphiregulin (AR) in patients with ER-negative, EGFR-positive and IL-1α-positive breast
           cancer.

        -  To estimate the effect of erlotinib on tumor cell proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis
           (TUNEL).

        -  To estimate the rates of IL-1α, nuclear NF-κB, and AR expression in patients with
           ER-negative, EGFR-positive breast cancer.

        -  To follow the clinical course of patients with resectable ER-negative, EGFR-positive and
           IL-1α-positive breast cancer.

        -  To assess the toxicity of a 15-day regimen of daily oral administration of erlotinib
           hydrochloride in participants with ER-negative, EGFR-positive and IL-1α-positive breast
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to HER2 status
      (positive vs negative).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days -14 to 0 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo surgery on day 0.

      Tissue samples are collected at baseline and examined for expression of estrogen receptor,
      progesterone receptor, HER2, EGFR, interleukin (IL)-1α, amphiregulin, and NF-kB. Tissue
      samples collected at surgery are examined for IL-1α, NF-kB, and amphiregulin by IHC.

      Following surgery, patients will be contacted 1 week post-surgery (± 1 day) or 1 week
      post-withdrawal from study (± 1 day) by phone call or clinic visit to assess toxicity. After
      that, patients will be followed and treated according to standard of care practices. If
      patients choose to follow-up with an oncologist outside of our institution, they or their
      oncologist will be contacted every 6 months for updated information on their conditions.

            <description>Patients must be willing to consider treatment with erlotinib, in the event they are eligible for the treatment phase of the study. Erlotinib (Tarceva®) will be self-administered in an open-label, unblinded manner to all patients enrolled in the study. During the treatment period, patients will receive single-agent erlotinib (Tarceva®), at a dose of 150 mg/day mg by mouth. Patients will be instructed to take tablets once daily. The day of planned surgical resection of the invasive breast cancer will be considered day 0. Patients will undergo baseline physical examination and performance status evaluation on or before day -14. Patients will begin treatment with erlotinib 150 mg (1 tablet) orally daily on day -14 and it will be continued for a total of 15 days, through day 0.</description>
