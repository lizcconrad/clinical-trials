  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate if a light based technique, called Optical Breast Spectroscopy
      (OBS) formerly known as Transillumination Breast Spectroscopy (TiBS), can be used to detect
      differences in breast tissue between high- and low-risk populations and within the high-risk
      population between BrCa1 or 2 carriers and non-carriers. These differences may include
      differences in breast tissue composition and metabolism at time of enrollment into the study
      (possibly reflecting changes occurring in adolescence) and in the rate of breast tissue
      change over time (possibly reflecting rate of tissue transformation from normal to ultimately
      malignant state).

      Preliminary data show Optical Breast Spectroscopy (OBS)has the ability to detect tissue
      differences with various pathologies and age-related changes in breast tissue over a two year
      period. In the present study, we want to determine whether OBS has the ability to detect
      optical differences between women who harbor a mutation in the breast cancer susceptibility
      gene, BrCa1 or BrCa2, and their age-matched controls (non-carriers). More specifically,
      possible differences in the breast tissue at time of enrollment into the study (reflecting
      changes potentially occurring in adolescence) and in the rate of breast tissue change over
      time (reflecting rate of tissue transformation from normal to ultimately malignant state).
      The overall goal is to develop a pre-screening technique to survey or monitor the risk of
      breast tissue and to advise the earliest point when imaging techniques (e.g. MRI) should be
      initiated or when more drastic primary prevention measures are recommended.
