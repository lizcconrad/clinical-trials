      This is an open-label study that will measure blood levels of different parts of a drug
      called GKS189075. People participating in this study will receive a single dose of 250mg
      GSK189075 by mouth. About 20 people with mild to moderate decrease in renal (kidney) function
      will be asked to participate in this study. They will be compared to about 20 healthy
      participants who are close to the same age and body size. People participating in this study
      will stay at a clinical research unit beginning 2 days before they receive their single dose
      of GSK189075 and will remain there until approximately one day after receiving the study
      drug. During this study urine will be collected beginning the day before receiving study drug
      until the day after, just prior to leaving the clinical research unit. Blood samples will
      also be collected at various times beginning immediately before until 24 hours after
      receiving the study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of
             Non-child-bearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at screening or of
             Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, is not
             lactating, and agrees to adequate contraception.

          -  Satisfactory medical evaluation based upon medical history, medication history,
             physical examination, and clinical laboratory data obtained at the Screening visit.

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg. BMI within the range of 19 to 40 kg/m2.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to participation in any

             into the clinic

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption averaging &gt;7 drinks per week for women or &gt;14

             status will be recorded in the CRF.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study
             medication for the current study.

          -  The subject has donated more than 450mL blood within the 56 day period prior to the
             first scheduled administration of GSK189075.

          -  Known or suspected gastroparesis, gastric surgery within the 6 months prior to
             screening, or any other gastrointestinal condition that would likely interfere with

             if they have normal liver enzymes and no history of hepatitis and are approved by the
             GSK medical monitor.

          -  Any history of myocardial infarction, cardiac syncope.
