      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine whether rhG-CSF treatment will increase the frequency of donor-derived cells
      contributing to repair of damaged epithelial/endothelial or solid organ-specific tissue
      caused by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients who underwent sex-mismatched stem cell
      transplantation.

      Secondary Objective:

      1. To determine whether rhG-CSF treatment can alleviate GVHD-induced damage to
      epithelial/endothelial or solid organ-specific tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been found that cells circulating in the blood are capable of forming cells lining the
      oral cavity, skin cells, and/or cells of various organs. RhG-CSF is used to support cell
      recovery after stem cell transplantation and is commercially available.

      Before treatment starts, participants will have at least one (and up to three) biopsy(ies) of
      damaged tissue performed to find out about the severity of tissue damage. A biopsy is taken
      with a large needle. Women able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.

      Participants in this study will receive rhG-CSF as an injection under the skin once a day
      over one week. This will be repeated every other week for a total of 4 weeks. Blood tests
      (about 2 teaspoons each) will be performed 3 times while at M. D. Anderson or once a week
      while outpatient to make sure that the white blood count stays in a safe range. Participants
      will have at least one (and up to three) biopsy(ies) again performed about 8 weeks after the
      start of rhG-CSF treatment. An additional biopsy at 3 months after the start rhG-CSF
      treatment will only be performed in case your regular treatment follow up requires it, and
      not for research purposes only.

      Participants will be taken off study if severe side effects occur. The study will end after
      the last biopsy or biopsies are taken, about 3 months after the start of rhG-CSF treatment.

      This is an investigational study. RhG-CSF is FDA approved and commercially available, though
      its use in this study is investigational. A maximum of 5 patients will be treated on this
      protocol. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell
             transplantation.

          2. Patients should have engrafted with WBC concentration &gt;3000/ul. Patients should have
             acute GVHD overall &gt; grade 2 or chronic GVHD.

          3. Patients with acute GVHD or chronic GVHD including patients refractory to steroid
             treatment.

          4. Donors and patients must be of different gender.

          5. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of the hospital.

          6. The only acceptable consent form is the one attached at the end of this protocol.

          7. Patients agree to biopsy tissue areas unaffected by GVHD for only research purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are allergic to rhG-CSF.

          2. Patients who had any prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation using a sex mismatched
             donor other than the donor used for the previous stem cell allotransplantation.
