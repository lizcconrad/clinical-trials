      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a culturally-tailored,
      comprehensive behavioral intervention program specially designed for linguistically
      challenged ethnic minority immigrant populations (Korean Americans) with type 2 DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Korean American immigrants (KAI), one of the most underserved and understudied minority
      populations in the U.S., suffer from diabetes, which goes under-diagnosed, inadequately
      treated and has a potential to result in costly and tragic consequences. Language barriers,
      the lack of self-confidence, and diminished social support that accompany the acculturation
      process prevent KAI from improving their health-seeking behaviors. Our previous research has
      indicated that overwhelming numbers of KAI suffer not only from uncontrolled hyperglycemia
      but also from a loss of self-confidence and social isolation because of language and cultural
      barriers. They are in urgent need of an intervention to assist them in their efforts to
      achieve better glycemic control and restore their self-confidence in diabetes and health
      management so that they are able to adjust successfully in this new environment. Therefore,
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a culturally-tailored,
      comprehensive behavioral intervention program specially designed for linguistically
      challenged KAIs with type 2 DM.

      This pilot project will test the hypothesis: Compared to KAI in the control group, KAI with
      type 2 DM who receive a comprehensive DM management intervention through structured
      psycho-behavioral education, home glucose monitoring with a telephone transmission system,
      and interaction with a bilingual nurse case manager will show: (1) a greater level of glucose
      control; and (2) a greater level of self-help skills including knowledge related to glucose
      control, problem-solving skills, heightened confidence and mood/affect, adherence to
      treatment recommendations, and quality of life. An additional outcome will be to measure and
      obtain an ideal BP as the proposed intervention focuses on management of multiple risk
      factors with which many KA DM patients often struggle.
