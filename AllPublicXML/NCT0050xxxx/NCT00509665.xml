      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and doxorubicin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with
      doxorubicin works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the overall response rate (complete and partial response) produced by the
           combination of gemcitabine hydrochloride and doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with
           recurrent or progressive head and neck cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with the
           chemotherapy combination.

        -  To describe the duration of response (complete and partial response) among patients who
           attain a response.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity associated with the administration of the combination in
           previously treated head and neck cancer patients.

        -  To establish a correlation of the cytotoxicity of these agents with cell cycle-arrest
           and apoptosis in cancer cells, particularly involving the sphingolipid pathway.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and after every 2 courses for
      correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for plasma/serum sphingosine-1-phosphate, ceramide,
      and other markers of the apoptotic pathway via LC/MS.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years.
