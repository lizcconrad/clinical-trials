    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Adverse Event During the 16-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 to the end of the Treatment Period (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <measure>Partial Onset Seizure (Type I) Frequency Per Week Over the 16-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to the end of the Treatment Period (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>Partial (Type I) seizures can be classified into one of the following three groups:
Simple partial seizures
Complex partial seizures
Partial seizures evolving to generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.
Partial Onset Seizure (POS) frequency per week over the Treatment Period (TP) was calculated as:
(Total Type I seizures over the TP)*7/(Total number of days with no missing seizure count in the TP)</description>

    <measure>Responder Rate for Partial Onset Seizures (Type I) Frequency Per Week Over the 16-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to the end of Treatment Period (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>The responder rate was presented as the percentage of responders and non-responders. A subject is a responder, if the subject has at least 50 % reduction in Partial Onset Seizure frequency per week from Baseline to Treatment Period. Subjects with zero seizure frequency per week at Baseline were considered as non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Seizure Frequency (All Seizure Types) Per Week Over the 16-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to the end of Treatment Period (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>There are three different types of seizures:
Type I: Partial seizures
Type II: Generalized seizures
Type III: Unclassified epileptic seizures. All seizure frequency per week over Treatment Period (TP) was calculated as: (Total number of seizures over the TP)*7/(Total number of days with no missing seizure count in the TP)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to end of Treatment Period (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from Baseline was calculated as percent reduction by:
(weekly seizure frequency Baseline - weekly seizure frequency Treatment)*100/(weekly seizure frequency Baseline).
A negative value in percent Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.
The higher the negative values for percent change in Partial Onset Seizure (POS) frequency, the higher the improvement from Baseline.</description>

    <description>The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-Form 31 (QOLIE-31-P) is an adaptation of the original QOLIE-31 instrument that includes 30 items grouped into 7 multi-item subscales: Seizure Worry (5 items), Overall Quality of Life (2 items), Emotional Well-being (5 items), Energy/Fatigue (4 items), Cognitive Functioning (6 items), Medication Effects (3 items) and Daily Activities/Social Functioning (5 items), and a Health Status item. In addition to the 31 items of the QOLIE-31, the QOLIE-31-P contains 7 items asking the subjects to rate the degree of 'distress' related to the topic of each subscale (ie, distress items). The QOLIE-31-P also contains an item asking about the relative importance of each subscale topic (ie, prioritization item). The subscale scores, the total score and the Health Status item score were calculated according to the scoring algorithm defined by the author with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better function.</description>

        <description>The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-Form 31 (QOLIE-31-P) is an adaptation of the original QOLIE-31 instrument that includes 30 items grouped into 7 multi-item subscales: Seizure Worry (5 items), Overall Quality of Life (2 items), Emotional Well-being (5 items), Energy/Fatigue (4 items), Cognitive Functioning (6 items), Medication Effects (3 items) and Daily Activities/Social Functioning (5 items), and a Health Status item. In addition to the 31 items of the QOLIE-31, the QOLIE-31-P contains 7 items asking the subjects to rate the degree of 'distress' related to the topic of each subscale (ie, distress items). The QOLIE-31-P also contains an item asking about the relative importance of each subscale topic (ie, prioritization item). The subscale scores, the total score and the Health Status item score were calculated according to the scoring algorithm defined by the author with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better function.</description>

        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate Anxiety and Depression. The HADS was developed as a self-administered scale to assess the presence and severity of Anxiety and Depression. It consists of 14 items that are scored on a 4-point severity scale ranging from 0 to 3. A score per dimension was calculated with each score ranging from 0 to 21 (higher scores indicating greater problems). A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

          <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate Anxiety and Depression. The HADS was developed as a self-administered scale to assess the presence and severity of Anxiety and Depression. It consists of 14 items that are scored on a 4-point severity scale ranging from 0 to 3. A score per dimension was calculated with each score ranging from 0 to 21 (higher scores indicating greater problems).

        <description>The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-Form 31 (QOLIE-31-P) is an adaptation of the original QOLIE-31 instrument that includes 30 items grouped into 7 multi-item subscales: Seizure Worry (5 items), Overall Quality of Life (2 items), Emotional Well-being (5 items), Energy/Fatigue (4 items), Cognitive Functioning (6 items), Medication Effects (3 items) and Daily Activities/Social Functioning (5 items), and a Health Status item. In addition to the 31 items of the QOLIE-31, the QOLIE-31-P contains 7 items asking the subjects to rate the degree of 'distress' related to the topic of each subscale (ie, distress items). The QOLIE-31-P also contains an item asking about the relative importance of each subscale topic (ie, prioritization item). The subscale scores, the total score and the Health Status item score were calculated according to the scoring algorithm defined by the author with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the 16-week Treatment Period in Cognitive Functioning Patient Weighted Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-Form 31 (QOLIE-31-P) Score</title>
        <description>The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-Form 31 (QOLIE-31-P) is an adaptation of the original QOLIE-31 instrument that includes 30 items grouped into 7 multi-item subscales: Seizure Worry (5 items), Overall Quality of Life (2 items), Emotional Well-being (5 items), Energy/Fatigue (4 items), Cognitive Functioning (6 items), Medication Effects (3 items) and Daily Activities/Social Functioning (5 items), and a Health Status item. In addition to the 31 items of the QOLIE-31, the QOLIE-31-P contains 7 items asking the subjects to rate the degree of 'distress' related to the topic of each subscale (ie, distress items). The QOLIE-31-P also contains an item asking about the relative importance of each subscale topic (ie, prioritization item). The subscale scores, the total score and the Health Status item score were calculated according to the scoring algorithm defined by the author with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better function.</description>
