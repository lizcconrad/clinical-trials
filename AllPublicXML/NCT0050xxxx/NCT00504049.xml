  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several methods exist to evaluate motor function in the child with cerebral palsy and are
      used to assess the outcome of a clinical intervention. However, these scales are not directed
      towards measuring the changes in muscle activity patterns that can result from the
      intervention. For example, there are classification scales aimed at measuring motor function
      and functional abilities, and indices of gait function. These scores, while providing a way
      to quantify function and mechanics, do not directly measure muscle activation
      characteristics. Therefore, these tests may be insensitive to how the intervention has
      directly affected muscle function, which is usually the focus of the intervention (i.e.
      botulinum toxin, functional electrical stimulation, dorsal rhizotomy). Muscle biopsies and
      motor evoked potentials can provide information about the muscle activation characteristics,
      however, they are invasive and there are concerns about using these techniques on the
      pediatric population and/or the practicality of clinical implementation, especially since
      they do not provide insight into how the muscle behaves during a functional task. One method
      that can be used to provide insight into muscle activity in a non-invasive and clinically
      meaningful manner is the use of surface electromyography (sEMG). Surface EMG is typically a
      routine part of clinical assessment and the evaluation of motor impairment in CP. However,
      the analysis of the data has been limited in most cases to examination of signal amplitude or
      differences in muscle onset and offset timing.

      The long-term goal of this research is to develop an analysis method for sEMG that can be
      used during functional tasks for treatment planning, diagnostic, assessment purposes in CP.
      This is to be accomplished through the use of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). By
      developing an assessment method based on muscle activity, it is believed that a clinically
      viable measurement tool can be devised that will provide a level of insight into the effects
      of an intervention on muscle pathophysiology that is not currently available. The first step
      in progressing towards this long-term goal is to determine the variability and range of
      expected time-frequency patterns that can be expressed in a given population (i.e., cerebral
      palsy) during the execution of a meaningful task (gait), and relate the time-frequency
      information back to more standard assessments
