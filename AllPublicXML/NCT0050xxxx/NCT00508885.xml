  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphosphatemia is common in the peritoneal dialysis population. Current strategies are
      insufficient to optimize phosphorus control. Animal studies have shown niacinamide, a form of
      vitamin B, to reduce phosphate uptake by the rat small intestine. Our trial investigates the
      use of niacinamide, in addition to standard phosphorus lowering strategies, to reduce plasma
      phosphorus levels in peritoneal dialysis patients versus placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of niacinamide versus placebo to reduce plasma phosphorus levels in
      peritoneal dialysis patients. Patients on a stable regimen of phosphate binders with plasma
      phosphorus levels &gt; 4.9 mg/dL are eligible for enrollment and randomization. The study will
      span 8 weeks of active medication treatment. The primary end-point will be absolute change in
      plasma phosphorus levels. Sixteen patients (8 randomized to each treatment arm) are needed to
      detect a 1.5 mg/dL difference assuming a standard deviation of 1 and powered at 80% (alpha
      0.05). Placebo will be packaged to resemble the study drug in all physical attributes. The
      starting dose of niacinamide will be 250 mg twice daily to be titrated to 500 mg twice daily
      at the end of week 2 with a final titration to 750 mg twice daily at the end of week 4.
      Secondary end-points will include absolute change in the calcium-phosphorus product, intact
      parathyroid hormone, hemoglobin, platelet count, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
      percentage change in plasma phosphorus.
