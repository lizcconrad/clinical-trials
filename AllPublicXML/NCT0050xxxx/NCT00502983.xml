  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the epidemiologic risk factors associated with the development of acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML), and less is known about the role that genetic susceptibility
      plays in the development of AML. We propose to conduct a population-based study to
      investigate genetic susceptibility in adult AML patients, both de novo and treatment-related
      in a well-defined geographical area. Using a case-control design, we will prospectively
      enroll 400 patients from Texas and 800 healthy controls. Controls will be recruited using
      random digit dialing, and will be matched to the cases by age, gender, and ethnicity.
      Epidemiological and demographic information will be obtained through personal interviews, and
      will be integrated with clinical information, cytogenetic data, and genotypic markers. Blood
      specimens will be collected on all participants, who will be genotyped for markers associated
      with activation and detoxification of chemical carcinogens, including chemotherapy drugs.
      Polymorphisms in genes such as cytochrome p450 (CYP2E1), glutathione S-transferases (GSTT1,
      GSTM1, GSTP1), epoxide hydrolase (HYL1), NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and
      myeloperoxidase (MPO) will be analyzed.

      This study will provide insight into the role that these susceptibility markers, along with
      clinical epidemiological, and cytogenetic factors, play in the identification of people at
      risk of developing AML. Understanding how genetic predisposition and exogenous exposures
      interact to determine AML susceptibility will allow the development of prevention strategies
      in the future.

      INFORMED CONSENTS FOR AML PATIENTS:

      For this study, participant will be asked to complete a personal interview. During the
      interview, participant will be asked questions about participant's demographics (age, sex,
      etc.), any chemicals participant may have been exposed to, participant's medical history,
      family history of cancer, participant's diet, and participant's smoking and alcohol use
      histories. It should take around 50 minutes to complete the interview.

      Participant will also have around 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for special tests. These tests
      will look for any biologic factors associated with AML.

      The interview and the blood draw may be done during a regularly scheduled visit to M. D.
      Anderson, or may be scheduled at the time and place of participant's convenience.

      Participant may be contacted at home by phone so that researchers can collect information
      about any changes in participant's health status.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 1,200 participants will take part in this study.

      INFORMED CONSENT FOR CONTROL SUBJECTS:

      For this study, participant will be asked to complete a personal interview. During the
      interview, participant will be asked questions about participant's demographics (age, sex,
      etc.), any chemicals participant may have been exposed to, participant's medical history,
      family history of cancer, participant's diet, and participant's smoking and alcohol use
      histories. It should take around 50 minutes to complete the interview.

      Participant will also have around 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for special tests. These tests
      will look for any biologic factors associated with AML. The interview and blood draw will be
      scheduled at the time and place of participant's convenience.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 1,200 participants will take part in this study.
