               -  are willing to continue a monophasic COC containing ethinyloestradiol 30µg and
                  levonorgestrel 150 µg from at least the commencement of their last normal period
                  prior to the first dose of study medication;

               -  are willing to continue a monophasic COC containing ethinyloestradiol 30µg and
                  levonorgestrel 150 µg until 14 days after last treatment or until the first
                  normal period (defined as normal for the woman, both in terms of duration and
                  quantity of menses) after last treatment, whichever is the longest.

             contraception, in addition to the COC

          -  Aged 18-45 years inclusive.

          -  Healthy subjects, defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant
             illness or disease as determined by their medical and psychiatric history (including
             family), physical examination, laboratory studies, and other tests.

          -  Body weight ≥ 45 kg for women and BMI within the range 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive;

          -  Demonstrates no evidence of active disease, physical or significant mental impairment.

             prior to the start of dosing until collection of the final pharmacokinetic sample.

          -  Agree to abstain from alcohol for 24 hours prior to the start of dosing until
             collection of the final pharmacokinetic sample.

          -  Normal electrocardiogram (subjects must have no clinically significant abnormalities
             on a 12-lead ECG and a 24 hour Holter ECG).

          -  Hormone assessments must be within normal range, at the pre-study assessment.

          -  Agree to remain in the clinic for the time defined in the protocol.

          -  Subject who has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) with known aetiology must

             such subjects appropriate steps must also have been taken to minimize reoccurrence of
             risk (i.e. if PUD was nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] induced, the subject
             should no longer be taking NSAID medications; if cause was H. pylori, the subject
             should have been appropriately treated). Subjects with a history of PUD &gt;10 years ago,
             without recurrence, may be included after discussion with the medical monitor even if
             documentation from treating physician is not available or aetiology unclear. See
             Section 6.3.6 for more details.

             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  A positive pre-study HIV 1/2, Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C

             with a repeat LFT

          -  Any other clinically significant laboratory abnormality.

          -  The subject has a screening ECG with values outside the ranges defined in the protocol

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures
             or compromise subject safety.

          -  History or presence of allergy to the study drug or drugs of this class, or a history
             of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible,
