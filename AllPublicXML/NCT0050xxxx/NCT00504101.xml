      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide and melphalan,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving high-dose combination chemotherapy together with
      bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when
      given together with arsenic trioxide and melphalan in treating patients undergoing an
      autologous stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate toxicity of a conditioning treatment regimen comprising bortezomib, arsenic
           trioxide, and melphalan.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate response and overall survival.

        -  Determine what correlative laboratory and clinical parameters, if any, are associated
           with efficacy (e.g., serum arsenic trioxide intracellular glutathione depletion, gene
           profiling of myeloma cells).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Bortezomib will be given on days -6, -4, and -2, arsenic trioxide
           will be given on days -6, -5, -4, -3, and -2 (total of 5 doses), and melphalan will be
           given on day -2.

        -  Stem cell infusion: On day 0 a minimum of autologous 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg will be
           infused by central catheter.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.
