  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to estimate the pathologic complete response rate of cetuximab, irinotecan, and
      capecitabine concurrent with radiotherapy given preoperatively in patients with resectable
      rectal cancer.

      Daily fractions of radiotherapy at 1.8 Gy to total of 45 Gy to tumor and draining lymph nodes
      and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy to the tumor are delivered concurrently with
      chemotherapy.

      Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 is given intravenously on D-6 (1 week before radiation), followed by 250
      mg/m2 once a week (D 1, 8, 15, 22 &amp; 29).

      Administration of irinotecan and capecitabine starts on day 1 of radiotherapy. Capecitabine
      is administered orally at a dose of 825 mg/m2 twice daily during weekdays (Monday to Friday)
      during radiotherapy. Irinotecan 40 mg/m2 is given intravenously once a week (D 1, 8, 15, 22 &amp;
      29).

      Four to eight weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, curative surgery is performed.

      Safety evaluation of the study will be performed after the first 6 patients treated. If more
      than 1 out of 6 patients received less than 70-80% of planned dose of capecitabine or
      irinotecan, the dosage of chemotherapy in the further study patients will be adjusted by a
      protocol amendment.
