      This study, conducted by the Malaria Research and Training Center at the Faculty of Medicine
      in Bamako and the NIAID will measure the frequency of occurrence of malaria in infants in
      Bancoumana, Mali. Information from the study will help in planning trials of malaria
      vaccines.

      Healthy children from 6 weeks to 6 months of age who live in the Bancoumana health area may
      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood
      tests.

      Participating children are visited at home for a total of about 17 visits to see if they are
      well. They come to the clinic every month during the 7-month study for a clinical evaluation,
      including a blood sample obtained by finger prick to test for malaria. Some of the blood
      collected may be stored and used for research. Children who become sick with malaria are
      treated for the disease.

      This is an observational study to determine the burden of malaria in rural Malian infants.
      Infants will be identified during a village-wide census and at Expanded Program for
      Immunization (EPI) visits. After obtaining community consent, eligible infants' parents will
      be invited to bring infants to the clinic for screening. Enrolled infants will receive a
      baseline evaluation and monthly visits during the rainy season at which times they will
      receive interim evaluations and heel, toe, or finger pricks for determinations of hemoglobin,
      thick and thin blood films, malaria antibody titers (at first and last visit for each
      transmission season), and hemoglobin typing at one visit. Study subjects will also receive a
      weekly home visit to determine if they are well or ill. If ill or febrile at any visit, or if
      they present to the clinic for an unscheduled visit, subjects will receive a history and
      physical examination, heel, toe, or finger pricks for determinations of hemoglobin, thick and
      thin blood films, filter paper blood collection and an RDT for malaria. Diagnosis and
      treatment of malaria will be performed according to Mali National Malaria Control Program
      (NMCP) guidelines. Diagnosis and treatment of other conditions will be performed as
      determined by the treating clinician.
