  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was done to evaluate the effect of various adjuvants in combination with HBsAg as
      a model antigen on the induction of immune responses, mainly cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in
      healthy volunteers. The study was also done to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the
      various adjuvanted vaccines.
