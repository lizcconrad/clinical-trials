      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine the feasibility of conducting a multi-site longitudinal observational study
      of patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to fill-out some questionnaires,
      and your medical records will be reviewed. Your doctor or healthcare provider will also be
      asked to complete a questionnaire.

      You will be asked to fill-out questionnaires at 3 different times (when you join this study,
      3 months later, and 6 months later). The questionnaires will include questions about how your
      chronic GvHD impacts your body, your day-to-day activities, your emotions and perceptions,
      and your social and sexual life. Each questionnaire has 195 questions. Each should take about
      20-30 minutes to complete, but you will also be asked how long it takes you to complete each
      questionnaire. For most participants, these visits will be part of your routine schedule for
      follow-up for the disease.

      You have several options for where you may choose to complete the questionnaires. They may be
      completed when you visit the doctor for your appointments, at home (you will have to mail
      them back in self-addressed stamped envelopes that will be provided to you), or over the
      internet. If you are interested in the internet option, please ask study staff for more
      details. If at any time, your healthcare provider does not think it would be in your best
      interest to receive a survey at one of your scheduled time points, you will not be given a
      survey at that time, and you will be taken off this study.

      Your healthcare provider will be asked to fill-out a questionnaire that asks about what was
      found on your physical exam and routine laboratory tests, what medications you are taking,
      and how severe your chronic GvHD is at that clinic visit.

      Your medical records will be reviewed for about 1 year after your enrollment in this study to
      collect information about your stem cell transplant procedure, your medications, your medical
      condition, and the results of tests and procedures. The reviewing of your medical records
      does not require your active participation.

      You will be on this study until you have completed the 6-month questionnaire.

      This is an investigational study. There is no cost involved for participation in this study.
      Up to 40 participants will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 15 will be enrolled M.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 2 years

          2. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, with any graft source, donor type, and GVHD
             prophylaxis allowed

          3. If a prevalent case (defined as enrollment three or more months after chronic GVHD
             diagnosis), then subject must be within 2 years of stem cell infusion

          4. Diagnosis of chronic GVHD meeting the diagnostic criteria of the diagnosis and staging
             group of the NIH consensus conference

          5. Need for systemic treatment, defined as any medication or intervention delivered
             systemically, including extracorporeal photopheresis. If a patient only received
             topical or local therapy at diagnosis, but subsequently requires systemic treatment,
             they may be enrolled upon initiation of systemic therapy. (Note, these patients will
             be classified as incident or prevalent cases depending on time from chronic GVHD
             diagnosis, not start of systemic therapy)

          6. Progression-free for their malignancy at enrollment (no evidence of primary disease
             progression since transplant, although residual disease may still be present)

          7. Evaluation at the transplant center at the time of study enrollment, and agreement to
             be re-evaluated at the transplant center at 3 and 6 months

          8. Signed, informed consent and if applicable, child assent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to verbally communicate in English

          2. Inability to comply with study procedures

          3. Anticipated survival less than 6 months due to co-morbid disease or persistent
             malignancy
