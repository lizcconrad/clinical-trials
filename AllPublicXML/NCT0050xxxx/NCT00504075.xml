      threshold of 50 x 109/L, similar to that of published response &gt;60%. Also to assess the

      The primary objective is to determine if BPL's GAMMAPLEX raises the platelet count of
      subjects with chronic ITP to a threshold of 50 x 109/L, similar to that of published response
      &gt;60%. The secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the safety of GAMMAPLEX at the dosage
      used in this study. 2) to determine if GAMMAPLEX maintains platelet counts of ³ 50 x 109/L in
      subjects with chronic ITP for a period of time similar to that of a published data.

The first course of GAMMAPLEX will be administered as an intravenous infusion of 1 g/kg on each of 2 consecutive days. If required, a further 1 or 2 courses on the same dosage regimen may be administered in the period Day 32 to Day 90 following the first course of GAMMAPLEX.</description>
