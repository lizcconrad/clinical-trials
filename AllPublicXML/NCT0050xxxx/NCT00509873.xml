    <description>Percentage of patients that achieved clinical success, defined as achievement of a score of zero for both conjunctival hyperemia and conjunctival discharge in the study eye at Day 6.

(Eradication=pathogen is absent in follow-up culture; Reduction=pathogen is reduced from baseline below threshold count in follow-up culture; Persistence=pathogen reduced from baseline but is above or equal to threshold count in follow-up culture; and Proliferation=pathogen has increased in count from baseline in follow-up culture)</description>
