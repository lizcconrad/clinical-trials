        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use birth control

             investigator

          -  Diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis or status post pancreatectomy

        Diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is based upon at least one of the following:

          -  Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
             (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound demonstrating ductal changes consistent with chronic
             pancreatitis

          -  Abnormal Secretin Pancreatic Function test with a peak bicarbonate concentration &lt; 75
             milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L)

          -  Presence of pathognomic pancreatic calcifications

          -  Pathology proven chronic pancreatitis on surgical specimens

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, breastfeeding or of childbearing potential and not willing to use methods
             of birth control during the study

          -  History of liver transplant

          -  Liver transaminases &gt;3x Upper Limit Normal (ULN) or total bilirubin &gt;1.5x ULN at
             screening or at Baseline (except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome)

          -  Participation in an investigational study of a drug, biologic, or device not currently
             approved for marketing within 30 days prior to screening

          -  Any condition that the investigator believes would interfere with the intent of this
             study or would make participation not in the best interest of the patient

          -  History of pancreatic cancer

          -  Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis

          -  Active alcohol or drug abuse
