  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded assessment of biologic efficacy of AdcuCD40L. The
      individuals enrolled in this study will be individuals with biopsy proven resectable
      esophageal carcinoma. The dose of the AdcuCD40L vector (administered endoscopically directly
      to the tumor) will be the highest tolerable dose (most likely 10^11 particle units)
      determined from Weill-IRB protocol #0011004683 dose escalation study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to add to the safety profile data as well as assessing biologic
      efficacy parameters. It will include 24 individuals with biopsy proven, resectable, stage
      I-III esophageal cancer. Because there may be immune responses attributable to the gene
      therapy vector itself, independent of the CD40L transgene, this part of the study is designed
      in a randomized, blinded fashion to compare intratumoral administration of the AdcuCD40L
      vector compared to a placebo. Because there are likely differences over time in the pattern
      of the biologic response to the expression of CD40L in the tumor (including activation and
      trafficking of DC, and recruitment and activation of immune cells), this study will include 2
      &quot;time&quot; cohorts (based on the time between administration of the AdcuCD40L vector and the time
      of surgery to remove the tumor). Using Weill-IRB protocol #0011004683 dose escalation study
      to determine the highest non-toxic dose of the AdcuCD40L vector, this dose (likely 10^11
      particle units) will be used for all individuals enrolled in this efficacy study. The placebo
      will be the salt water-sugar solution used as a vehicle for the vector. Since there is no
      evidence that delay of surgery for solid tumors for 15 days following diagnosis alters the
      prognosis, surgery for removal of the primary tumor will be carried out at either 5 or 15
      days after administration of the vector (n= 12/group, including n=6 receiving the AdcuCD40L
      vector, and n=6 receiving placebo). This will permit assessment of the resulting data (in a
      randomized, blinded fashion) and the biologic responses to the AdCUCD40L vector over time. In
      addition to safety/toxicity parameters, the primary tumor, regional and distant nodes removed
      at the time of surgery, and peripheral blood will be assessed for biologic parameters
      relevant to responses to the AdcuCD40L vector.
