  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of systemic chemotherapy in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) is known to be very
      limited although various single-agent or combination therapies had been tested. However,
      there is a possibility that palliative chemotherapy induce prolong survival and improve
      quality of life in advanced BTC based on several studies. A GERCOR study showed the promising
      result of gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin as first line chemotherapy in advanced
      BTC. Therefore, this phase II trial was planned to investigate efficacy and toxicity of
      combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and dose adjusted oxaliplatin in patients with
      inoperable BTC in Korea.

      Treatment scheme

      :Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2/d IV D1 as a 10mg/m2/min Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2/d IV D2 as a 2 hours
      infusion

      Each cycle is repeated every 2 weeks.

      Repeated cycles of treatment will be given for this study unless there is confirmed disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Subjects will be treated for at least 4 cycles unless
      there is documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse events or withdrawal of
      consent.
