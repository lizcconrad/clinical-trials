      The specific aims of the study include:

        1. Profile the demographic, health-related, psychosocial and behavioral characteristics of
           adults with MEN1 or MEN2.

        2. Evaluate MEN-specific distress as well as adherence to surveillance regimens among
           adults with MEN1 or MEN2, and identify associated with those outcomes.

      The proposed cross-sectional study is intended to obtain information regarding current
      surveillance behaviors and other psychosocial outcomes among persons affected by the multiple
      endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1 or MEN2, which are inherited conditions.

      Study participants will include patients who have been seen previously at MDACC for
      evaluation of MEN1 or MEN2. Because this is the first time investigators are contacting these
      patients to invite them to participate in psychosocial research, the proposed study also will
      help determine the feasibility of conducting similar studies in the future.

      Investigators anticipate that data gathered from this study will enhance existing knowledge
      about the psychological and behavioral aspects of the MEN syndromes, and will inform future
      research efforts directed toward this understudied population.
