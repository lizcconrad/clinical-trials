      Background: Preadministration of recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) increases the amount
      and homogeneity of thyroid radioiodine uptake, and when used as an adjuvant can augment the
      efficiency of 131I therapy by allowing multinodular goitre (MNG) volume reduction.

      Objective: The investigators aimed to assess low-dose rhTSH-aided fixed-activity radioiodine
      therapy outcome in MNG patients.

      Design: This was a long-term (36 months) observational study. Methods: The investigators
      measured 24 h thyroid radioiodine uptake (RAIU) of 1.4 µCi (0.5 MBq) of 131-iodine at
      baseline and 24 h after intramuscular injection of 0.1 mg rhTSH in 42 patients (aged 42-80
      years) who subsequently received 30 mCi 131-iodine 24 h after an identical rhTSH injection.
      Urinary iodine was measured at baseline and at 3 months after following a low iodine diet.
      TSH, free thyroxine (FT4), T3 (T3) and thyroglobulin (TG) were measured at baseline, 24 h, 48
      h, 72 h, 168 h, one month, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after therapy. Thyroid volume
      was assessed by computer tomography at baseline and every 6 months thereafter.
