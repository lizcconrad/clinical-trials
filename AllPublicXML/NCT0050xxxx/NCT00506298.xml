      This trial will assess the efficacy of CRx-401 in lowering FPG levels in patients taking
      metformin to treat their diabetes. In addition, this initial trial will evaluate insulin
      resistance (HOMA-IR index), HgbA1c levels, glycated protein, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and
      total cholesterol, as well as the safety of CRx-401.
