    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histological or cytological confirmed advanced solid tumor, which is
             refractory to standard therapies or for which no standard therapy exists and for which
             there is a rationale for the therapeutic use of a combination of sorafenib and
             sirolimus (especially metastic RCC, malignant melanoma, HCC, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer,
             hormone refractory prostate cancer).

          -  Men or women of at least 18 years

          -  Patients who have an ECOG status of 0 or 1

          -  Patients who have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function

          -  Negative pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential

          -  Women and men enrolled into this trial must use adequate birth control measures during
             the course of the trial.

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of serious cardiac disease

          -  Active clinically serious bacterial, viral or fungal infections (&gt; grade 2).

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic hepatitis B
             or C.

          -  Clinically symptomatic brain or meningeal metastasis.

          -  Patients with seizure disorders requiring medication (such as steroids or
             antiepileptics).

          -  Patients with evidence or history of bleeding diathesis.

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with
             the patients participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.

          -  Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inductors (such as rifampicin, St. JohnÂ´s
             Wort) or CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole,
             diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin). Moderate or weak CYP3A4 modifiers should be used
             concomitantly only after careful assessment of risk-benefit ratio. Concomitant use of
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin or chronic use of dexamethasone is excluded
