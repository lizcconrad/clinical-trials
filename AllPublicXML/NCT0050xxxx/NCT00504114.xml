  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use better magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to
      examine the knee and the bony and soft tissue changes so as to better predict the progression
      of osteoarthritis and acute knee injuries.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will examine the pathophysiology of bone marrow changes, relationship between
      trabecular bone and cartilage changes; and evaluate T1p relaxation methods and its' relating
      to cartilage loss. The protocol is geared towards sequences utilizing 3 Tesla magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) that will enable the measures of cartilage volume and T2. Measures
      cartilage volume and T2 are more established MR methods for studying osteoarthritis (OA).

      All OA and Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) subjects will undergo MR imaging of the knee
      joint at 3 Tesla at baseline,, and three annual follow up time points. Regions of interest
      will include the total tibial and femoral cartilage, and sub-division such as the medial and
      lateral compartments of the tibial and femoral cartilage to account for localized disease
      activity and progression.

      Bone marrow edema size, MR spectroscopy based marrow fat/water content, and trabecular bone
      microarchitecture underlying the edema will be measured in the OA and ACL groups to determine
      whether there is any distinction between these measures in OA and in traumatic ACL injury,
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and their relation to cartilage loss and OA
      progression.
