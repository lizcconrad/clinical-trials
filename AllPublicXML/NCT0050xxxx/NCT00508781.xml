      We use multiphoton laser scanning microscopy to observe cutaneous anatomy and pathology. The
      study aims to compare surgical specimen by conventional pathology slice with the image by
      non-invasive multiphoton laser scanning microscopy.

    <textblock>
      For skin diseases, the most convincing method for diagnosis to date is surgical biopsy.
      However, a skin biopsy is an invasive procedure which carries the risk of tissue damage,
      wound infection and scar formation. To solve the inconvenience from surgical biopsy,
      multiphoton laser scanning microscopy is a developing, non-invasive method for observing the
      cutaneous anatomy and pathology. Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy is good in tissue
      penetration and resolution with less tissue damage. The study aims to compare surgical
      specimen by conventional pathology slice with the image by non-invasive multiphoton laser
      scanning microscopy. A good correlation in multiphoton image may serve as optical biopsy for
      cutaneous pathology and spare the invasive procedure of skin biopsy.
