    <textblock>
      258 patients who have been treated for at least 3 months with oral olanzapine, risperidone or
      quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia and currently presenting with metabolic
      syndrome, will be randomized to: i) aripiprazole for 16 weeks, with flexible dosing within a
      range of 10 to 30 mg once daily (QD); or ii) continue for 16 weeks on the same atypical
      antipsychotic treatment prior to the study enrollment.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Remaining on Metabolic Syndrome at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolic syndrome is defined as the presence of at least 3 out of the following Adult Treatment Panel III-A (ATP III-A) criteria (all of which are to be assessed at the same visit): waist &gt;102 cm in males, &gt;88 cm in females; blood pressure (BP) systolic BP ≥130 or diastolic BP ≥85 mm Hg; fasting HDL &lt;40 mg/dL in males, &lt;50 mg/dL in females; fasting triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL; fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL, and/or the start of a treatment for any of the parameters of metabolic syndrome during the course of the study.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>A CGI-S assessment (a 7-point scale to evaluate the severity of symptoms) was performed at baseline (1=normal; 7=among the most extremely ill patients). A decrease in value indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptics Scale (SWN-short Form) Through Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8,Week 12, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SWN-short form is a 20-item self-report instrument that measures subjective well-being under neuroleptics. 10 positive and 10 negative items cover 5 health domains (subscales) (4 items each): emotional regulation, self-control, mental functioning, social integration, and physical functioning. Individual scores range from 1 (not at all) to 6 (very much). With negative item scores being reversed, Subscale scores range from 4 to 24 and Total score ranges from 20 to 120.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQoL-Lite) Scale Through Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>IWQoL-Lite is a 31-item self-report inventory to assess the impact of weight on quality of life among patients with obesity. Subscales include: Physical Function, Self Esteem, Sexual Life, Public Distress and Work. The rescaled IWQoL-Lite Total Score is determined by the sum of the 1 to 5 scores on all 31 items and rescaling this sum to a 0-100 scoring with 0=the poorest and 100=the best quality of life. A change of 7.8 to 12.0 points on the rescaled IWQoL-Lite Total Score=a meaningful improvement. A change of -4.5 to -7.6 on the rescaled IWQoL-Lite Total Score=a meaningful deterioration.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptics Scale (SWN-short Form) Through Week 16</title>
          <description>The SWN-short form is a 20-item self-report instrument that measures subjective well-being under neuroleptics. 10 positive and 10 negative items cover 5 health domains (subscales) (4 items each): emotional regulation, self-control, mental functioning, social integration, and physical functioning. Individual scores range from 1 (not at all) to 6 (very much). With negative item scores being reversed, Subscale scores range from 4 to 24 and Total score ranges from 20 to 120.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQoL-Lite) Scale Through Week 16</title>
        <description>IWQoL-Lite is a 31-item self-report inventory to assess the impact of weight on quality of life among patients with obesity. Subscales include: Physical Function, Self Esteem, Sexual Life, Public Distress and Work. The rescaled IWQoL-Lite Total Score is determined by the sum of the 1 to 5 scores on all 31 items and rescaling this sum to a 0-100 scoring with 0=the poorest and 100=the best quality of life. A change of 7.8 to 12.0 points on the rescaled IWQoL-Lite Total Score=a meaningful improvement. A change of -4.5 to -7.6 on the rescaled IWQoL-Lite Total Score=a meaningful deterioration.</description>
