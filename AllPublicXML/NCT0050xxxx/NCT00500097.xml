      The purpose is to assess accuracy of digital retinal image interpretation by technicians and
      direct ophthalmoscopy by nurses for the determination of diabetic retinopathy severity and
      the presence of diabetic macular edema for the identification of referrals to
      ophthalmologists. The results of both screening methods were compared with comprehensive eye
      examination by ophthalmologists.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic visual disabilities have increasingly become a global concern since a number of
      diabetic patients are expected to surge dramatically in the coming decade. Essential means to
      minimize this problem are detecting vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy early in the
      course of disease and timely interventions by ophthalmologists.

      The American Diabetes Association had issued a guideline for the detection and recommended
      regular comprehensive eye examination as a preferred method. However, it is not likely that
      there will be ophthalmologists enough to comprehensively examine the surging number of
      diabetic patients. Other practical screening methods, such as an interpretation of digital
      retinal images or direct ophthalmoscopy employed by other health care providers, for
      identifying the retinopathy for referral to ophthalmologists, should minimize this problem.
