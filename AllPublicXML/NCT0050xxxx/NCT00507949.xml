  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the effect of megestrol acetate in the gain of body
      weight in patients with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in order to improve the
      survival of the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that the body weight measured as a Body mass index (BMI)is an
      independent risk factor of mortality in the severe COPD.It seems to be one influence of
      inflammatory factors in the development of denutrition in these patients.

      The use of especial diets has no so good results in the aim to improve the weight, being
      necessary to complement with muscular rehabilitation or anabolic products. The megestrol
      acetate has demonstrated good results in a short period of time, nevertheless the studies are
      scarce.

      The beneficial effects of the megestrol acetate seems to be mediated by cytokines.
