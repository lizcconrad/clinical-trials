  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-institutional, open-label, single-arm, Phase II study of trastuzumab
      emtansine (T-DM1) administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to patients with human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

    <measure>Objective Response Assessed by the Independent Review Facility Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization until the analysis data cutoff-dates of 31 Jan 2009 (6 months after the last patient was enrolled in the study) and 25 Jun 2009 (approximately 12 months after the last patient was enrolled in the study, up to 23 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined on 2 consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR: The disappearance of all target lesions and all non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level, and no new lesions. PR: Disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of ≥ 1 non-target lesions and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and no new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Objective Response (OR) Assessed by the Independent Review Facility Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization until the final analysis cut-off date of 25 Jun 2009 (end of the study, approximately 12 months after the last patient was enrolled, up to 23 months)</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who achieved an objective response, duration of objective response was defined as the time from the first tumor assessment that supported a patient's objective response to the time of disease progression or death on study (ie, death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study drug), whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For participants who experienced no disease progression and did not die while on study, data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the duration of objective response.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessed by the Independent Review Facility Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization until the final analysis cut-off date of 25 Jun 2009 (end of the study, approximately 12 months after the last patient was enrolled, up to 23 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to documented disease progression or death on study (ie, death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study drug), whichever occurred first. Disease progression was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For patients who experienced no disease progression and did not die while on study, data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.

PR: Disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of ≥ 1 non-target lesions and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and no new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <description>For patients who achieved an objective response, duration of objective response was defined as the time from the first tumor assessment that supported a patient's objective response to the time of disease progression or death on study (ie, death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study drug), whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For participants who experienced no disease progression and did not die while on study, data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.

          <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessed by the Independent Review Facility Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</title>
          <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to documented disease progression or death on study (ie, death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study drug), whichever occurred first. Disease progression was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For patients who experienced no disease progression and did not die while on study, data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate PFS.</description>

        <description>Objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined on 2 consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR: The disappearance of all target lesions and all non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level, and no new lesions. PR: Disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of ≥ 1 non-target lesions and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and no new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <title>Duration of Objective Response Assessed by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</title>
        <description>For patients who achieved an objective response, duration of objective response was defined as the time from the first tumor assessment that supported a patient's objective response to the time of disease progression or death on study (ie, death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study drug), whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For participants who experienced no disease progression and did not die while on study, data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.
