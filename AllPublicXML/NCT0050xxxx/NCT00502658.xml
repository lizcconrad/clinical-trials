    <textblock>
      Excessive body weight is becoming a concern around the world, for example over half of the
      American adult population is overweight or obese. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether dietary supplements and shakes containing a combination of nutrients/ingredients
      individually shown in research studies to reduce hunger, enhance metabolism, reduce the
      body's ability to 'store' fat, and enhance energy, promote healthy body weight and
      composition over 12 weeks. A further study objective is to determine whether the inclusion of
      a personal, easy to use, energy tracking device for the measurement of daily energy intake
      and expenditure also helps with the promotion of healthy body weight and body composition.

      In this prospective, blinded study 120 volunteers who meet the entrance criteria including a
      BMI 25-35 kg/m2 and sign the informed consent form to participate in a 12 week long study
      will be recruited. All subjects will consume a multi-vitamin, mineral and fish oil
      supplement. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a control or experimental group and
      stratified by BMI 25-30 and &gt;30-35 kg/m2, age, and gender with an equal number of subjects in
      each strata across groups. A subset of subjects will also wear a personal energy tracking
      device. Subjects will be instructed how to incorporate the shakes and supplements into their
      current diet and encouraged to incorporate fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other
      healthy foods into their current meals and to exercise at least 30 minutes five days per
      week.
