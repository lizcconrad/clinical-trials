      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of Sunitinib on tumor vascularization and
      necrosis in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sutent is an angiogenesis inhibitor used in the treatment of renal cell cancer. Very often
      tumor necrosis is seen after the start of the treatment. It is unknown after how many days
      this effect starts. In patients with renal cell cancer with metastases, who will be treated
      with Sutent, 3 MRIs will be made. Kep, R2*, b-coefficient (perfusion, hypoxia, blood volume
      and necrosis) will be measured.
