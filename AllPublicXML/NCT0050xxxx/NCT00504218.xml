      This study will determine the prevalence of endocrine-related side effects in children who
      have been treated for cancer and establish a database and registry organized according to
      cancer diagnosis, treatments and endocrine side effects. In children, the endocrine system,
      which includes glands and hormones that help to control metabolism, growth, development and
      reproduction, is particularly vulnerable to long-term side effects associated with cancer and
      its treatments. The study will also serve to help train medical fellows, residents and
      students in identifying and managing endocrine abnormalities in children who have been
      diagnosed with and treated for cancer.

      Children between 2 and 24 years of age who have been treated for a childhood cancer and have
      been disease-free for at least 1 year may be eligible for this study.

      All participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Review of cancer treatment record

        -  Review of medical and family history

        -  Blood draw for DNA studies

        -  Physical examination and body measurements (height, weight, waist, body proportions)

        -  Completion of child health questionnaires

        -  Individualized screening and counseling program

        -  Review of the following endocrine systems: growth, pituitary and hypothalamic function,
           thyroid function, ovary and testicular function, bone health, risk of obesity and
           diabetes

      The following additional studies may be done, as clinically indicated:

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain

        -  Thyroid, testicular or ovarian ultrasound

        -  DEXA scan to measure bone density

        -  Wrist x-ray to measure bone age

        -  Blood tests

        -  Urine pregnancy test for girls who are old enough to have menstrual periods

        -  Stimulation testing (tests that involve giving medicine by mouth or in the vein and then
           measuring blood levels of substances afterwards, such as oral glucose tolerance test,
           arginine-clonidine growth hormone stimulation test, ACTH stimulation test, and
           gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test)

      Children with endocrine abnormalities are offered standard treatments.

      Endocrine dysfunction is increasingly recognized as one of the most important aspects of
      quality of life issues, physical and psychosocial development and overall prognosis in
      pediatric patients diagnosed with neoplasms as well as in patients s/p bone marrow transplant
      throughout their lifespan. In addition, several of the new, molecularly designed therapies
      for neoplasms may interact with endocrine signaling; these include receptors and/or their
      ligands for growth and/or proliferation factors, and disruptors of steroid hormone
      interactions. The present study serves as a natural history protocol.

      As a natural history, this protocol allows our Institute to care for pediatric and adult
      patients with endocrine related complications associated with prior cancer therapy and/or
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for the purposes of:

      Training our fellows, residents and students in the identification and management of
      endocrine abnormalities developing in patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for
      neoplasms and/or who have received HSCT at the NIH-Clinical center.

      Developing new clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of endocrine side effects
      related to cancer therapy and/or HSCT: this protocol will eventually lead to new, separate
      protocols that will address specific aspects of endocrinopathies in childhood cancer
      survivors and HSCT survivors.

      The protocol will serve as the basis for outpatient clinics that will function within the
      context of the pediatric and adult endocrine outpatient clinics: every eligible patient
      referred to the endocrine service from the NCI, NHLBI, and other NIH institutions and centers
      will be enrolled in this study, which for the first time will create an endocrine database
      for these patients. As stated in our aims above, it is our hope that the present
      investigation will serve as an incubator of further research-focused studies with the
      ultimate goal of improving the life of children and adults who have been cured of their
      underlying neoplasms as well as those individuals who are recipients of an HSCT.

        -  INCLUSION

          -  Age &gt;2 years.

          -  History of diagnosis of malignancy or HSCT and completion of therapy prior to entering
             the study. Eligible patients must be free of their underlying malignancy for at least
             one year prior to entering the study, as confirmed by records from the referring
             oncologist.

          -  We will request permission to administer the Child Health Questionnaires (PF 50 and
             CF87) to all patients who are enrolled in this protocol. This instrument has been
             validated for use in children ages five and older. Children 10 years and older will
             complete the child version. The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) has been normed in a
             representative sample in the US, and is being used in large population studies in
             Australia, Ireland, and the UK. Additionally, it has been rigorously translated into a
             number of languages using international guidelines including American-Spanish,
             Canadian-French, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Greek, Honduran-Spanish,
             Mexican-Spanish, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish. For this study will purchase the
             CHQ in American- Spanish in order to include Spanish-speaking subjects in this part of
             the study. The costs to purchase the CHQ in numerous languages would be prohibitive
             for this pilot study. However, if a significant number of subjects in a specific
             language are recruited, we will consider the purchase of the CHQ for that group of
             subjects.

        EXCLUSION FOR CAROTID MRI
