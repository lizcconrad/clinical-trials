      This study is to try to maintain cultured dermal papilla cells in spherical structure in
      vitro before transplanting into dermis in vivo. Also, this study is aimed in clarifying
      actual mechanism of inducing hair follicle by dermal papilla cells.

      Hair transplantation is an well-documented way of treating hair loss. Hair transplantation is
      based on redistribution of hair follicles without any new follicle formation. It has been
      long that a lot of researchers have focused on developing skills in regenerating hair
      follicles. However, cultured dermal papilla cells lose the ability of inducing hair follicle
      formation after several generations in vitro culture. Our study is aiming in culturing dermal
      papilla cells in vitro and maintain their spherical structure before transplanting into
      dermis in vivo. Meantime, this study may help clarify the actual mechanism of inducing hair
      follicle by dermal papilla cells.
