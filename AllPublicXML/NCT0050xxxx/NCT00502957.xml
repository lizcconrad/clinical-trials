  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial is to examine how well biofeedback treatment
      works to improve constipation. The study is comparing two kinds of biofeedback treatment: 1)
      anorectal-specific biofeedback therapy and 2) generalized biofeedback therapy using
      relaxation techniques.

      The study will also examine which medical and psychological factors determine biofeedback
      success for treating constipation, such as bowel habits, emotional reactions to constipation,
      and levels of stress and psychological distress.

      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of anorectal biofeedback
      therapy for functional constipation secondary to pelvic floor dyssynergia. Participants will
      be randomized to either six sessions of anorectal biofeedback or to six sessions of
      generalized biofeedback.

      Participants will complete questionnaires at baseline, at completion of randomized
      treatment(12 weeks), and six months after completion of treatment to measure change in bowel
      habits, constipation severity, constipation-related quality of life, and constipation-related
      disability. An examination of psychosocial factors will also be conducted prior to treatment
      to distinguish which ones are predictive of biofeedback success for functional constipation.
