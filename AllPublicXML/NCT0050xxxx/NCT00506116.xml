  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pushing during labor that is controlled by
      the woman results in less birth-related injury and less postpartum urinary incontinence (UI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Birth related urinary incontinence (UI) is a predictor of UI in older women. Ways to protect
      the continence mechanism during delivery may diminish a woman's risk of UI later in life. We
      propose to study the functional anatomy of the pelvic floor as it relates to UI in women who
      are having their first baby. We hypothesize non-directed, spontaneous pushing is a protective
      strategy in decreasing the risk of immediate and long term UI. Longitudinal comparisons of
      pelvic floor characteristics will be taken at 35 week gestation and 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12
      months postpartum. Study participants will be seen first at 20 weeks gestation for
      documentation of baseline levels of pelvic floor function, specifically voluntary and
      involuntary muscle strength, urinary continence status, and urethral support. They will be
      randomly assigned into non-directed, spontaneous (experimental) and directed, sustained
      pushing (control) groups. Alterations that may occur in urethral support before and after
      birth will be described through non-invasive urethral ultrasound.
