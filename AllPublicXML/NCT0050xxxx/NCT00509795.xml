    <description>The NEI VFQ-25 total score ranges from 0-100 with a score of 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome. The NEI VFQ questionnaire is organized as a collection of subscales which are all scored from 0-100. To reach the overall composite score, each sub-scale score is averaged in order to give each sub-scale equal weight.</description>

          2. Men and women ≥ 50 years of age.

          3. Active primary or recurrent subfoveal CNV lesions secondary to AMD, including
             juxtafoveal lesions that affect the fovea as evidenced by FA in the study eye.

          4. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)
             of: letter score of 73 to 25 (20/40 to 20/320) in the study eye at 4 meters.

          5. Willing, committed, and able to return for ALL clinic visits and complete all
             study-related procedures.

          6. Able to read, (or, if unable to read due to visual impairment, be read to verbatim by
             the person administering the informed consent or a family member. See Appendix J.4)
             understand and willing to sign the informed consent form.

        Key

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior ocular (in the study eye) or systemic treatment or surgery for neovascular
             AMD except dietary supplements or vitamins.

          2. Any prior or concomitant therapy with another investigational agent to treat
             neovascular AMD in the study eye, except dietary supplements or vitamins.

          3. Any prior treatment with anti-VEGF agents in the study eye.

          4. Total lesion size &gt; 12 disc areas (30.5 mm^2, including blood, scars and
             neovascularization) as assessed by FA in the study eye.

          5. Subretinal hemorrhage that is either 50% or more of the total lesion area, or if the
             blood is under the fovea and is 1 or more disc areas in size in the study eye. (If the
             blood is under the fovea, then the fovea must be surrounded 270 degrees by visible
             CNV.)

          6. Scar or fibrosis, making up &gt; 50% of total lesion in the study eye.

          7. Scar, fibrosis, or atrophy involving the center of the fovea.

          8. Presence of retinal pigment epithelial tears or rips involving the macula in the study
             eye.

          9. History of any vitreous hemorrhage within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 in the study eye.

         10. Presence of other causes of CNV in the study eye.

         11. History or clinical evidence of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema or any
             other vascular disease affecting the retina,other than AMD, in either eye.

         12. Prior vitrectomy in the study eye.

         13. History of retinal detachment or treatment or surgery for retinal detachment in the
             study eye.

         14. Any history of macular hole of stage 2 and above in the study eye.

         15. Any intraocular or periocular surgery within 3 months of Day 1 on the study eye,
             except lid surgery, which may not have taken place within 1 month of day 1, as long as
             its unlikely to interfere with the injection.

          <description>SAF population used for analysis. The NEI VFQ-25 total score ranges from 0-100 with a score of 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome. The NEI VFQ questionnaire is organized as a collection of subscales which are all scored from 0-100. To reach the overall composite score, each sub-scale score is averaged in order to give each sub-scale equal weight.</description>

          <description>SAF population used for analysis. BCVA assessed by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. For BCVA tested via the 4 meter ETDRS protocol, 83 letters or more would represent 20/20 vision or better which would be considered an excellent outcome. Although, the ETDRS charts include 100 letters as the maximum possible score. The worst outcome is 0 letters read.</description>
