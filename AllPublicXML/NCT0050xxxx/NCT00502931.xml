    <textblock>
      With the number of individuals becoming overweight or obese, healthcare professionals are in
      need of accurate, reliable, and convenient tools to help personalize weight loss programs.
      Recently, a new indirect calorimeter (i.e. MedGem / BodyGem; aka “Gem”) was introduced as a
      convenient solution to determine resting metabolic rate (RMR) for assessment of daily energy
      needs. Several validation and comparison studies were conducted to determine if the Gem
      device is accurate and reliable. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review
      of previous studies that evaluated the accuracy and reliability of the Gem devices.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Random or counterbalanced assignment of participants to eliminate measurement bias;
             similar subject positioning for both Gem and reference system measurement or
             adjustment to a measurement for positioning differences; and use of a measurement
             protocol that is similar to the established “best practice” guidelines for employing
             indirect calorimetry
