  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic anal fissure is a linear tear in the distal anal canal. Most chronic fissures require
      intervention to heal. Surgical sphincterotomy is currently performed. However, the procedure
      permanently weakens the internal sphincter and may be associated with permanent complications
      such as incontinence. Current topical treatment or &quot; chemical sphincterotomy&quot; is effective in
      the short term for about 70% of the patient more than 50% of them will suffer from
      recurrence. Number of studies support the hypothesis that local ischemia is the reason for
      failure to heal in anal fissure. Treatment of refractory wounds by macrophage suspension is
      an innovative method since 1995, macrophage suspensions have been used successfully in more
      than 1400 patients in several hospitals in Israel without any side effect.Macrophages have
      key function in almost every stage of wound healing. They help in the digestion of bacteria,
      in a later stage, they secret IL-6, which influences endothelial cell proliferation and the
      initiation of angiogenesis.

      The study hypothesis is that local injection of activated human macrophages into chronic anal
      fissure may induce fissure healing.
