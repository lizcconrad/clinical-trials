  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is a well-recognized risk factor of Graves’ disease and, particularly,
      Graves’ ophthalmopathy. Hence, germline polymorphisms of detoxification genes and genes
      belonging to the major DNA repair/apoptosis pathways might have an important role in disease
      susceptibility. In addition, as some of these genes are regulated by thyroid hormones, they
      could affect the outcome of these patients. Our objective was to assess the influence of the
      GST, CYP and TP53 gene polymorphisms in the risk of Graves' disease and its outcome.

    <textblock>
      Although the role of many polymorphisms of genes related to toxins’ metabolism has been
      extensively investigated regarding the susceptibility to thyroid cancer, their influence in
      thyroid autoimmune diseases risk is still largely unknown. Hence, this study was designed to
      assess the influence of GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, CYP1A1 and 72TP53 polymorphic inheritance on the
      susceptibility to Graves' disease and to its response to the treatment.
