      You are being asked to take part in this study because you are pregnant or have been pregnant
      while diagnosed with cancer.

      The goal of this research study is to collect information on patients who are or were
      pregnant while diagnosed with cancer and to store this information in a research database.

      This is an investigational study. About 500 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      If you agree to take part in this study, information about the type of cancer, the type of
      treatment you have had or are having, and details about your pregnancy will be collected for
      the database. Data will be collected from patients seen at MD Anderson since September 2003
      until data has been collected for 500 cases. This information will serve as a basis for
      future studies about pregnant women with cancer. You will receive no special tests or
      treatment at MD Anderson as a result of this study.

      Progress notes and ultrasound reports about your pregnancy will be requested from Maternal
      Fetal Medicine and/or from your personal obstetrician. This information will be entered into
      the database and also included in your medical record. If the information is not consistent
      in the record, we may contact you to clarify the information. You will remain on study until
      your pregnancy and/or any treatment you are receiving are completed.

      Periodically the database will be updated to include information about patient survival. This
      information is usually found in the medical record however it may be necessary to contact you
      directly.
