  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to re-evaluate the therapeutic superiority and safety of
      acupuncture treatment using high quality and large sampled clinical research. The
      investigators want to provide a preferred treatment protocol, which is effective, safe, and
      easy to use in clinical practice. This research also clarifies that the insertion depth is a
      key factor in the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. The results of the study will help
      promote the development of the standardization of acupuncture.

    <textblock>
      Functional constipation is a high morbidity disease. The life-long treatment of functional
      constipation can seriously impact a patient's quality of life. At present, one of the most
      frequently used treatment is catharsis, which deals with the symptom. There are three main
      problems with catharsis. First, there are no long-lasting effects once the patient stops
      taking medication. Second, there are many side effects, including abdominal pain with
      defecation and diarrhea. Third, long-term use of irritant laxatives will not only make the
      constipation become refractory and complex; but also, this type of medicine can harm the
      enteric nervous system, cause melanosis coli, or even carcinoma of colon. Therefore, a
      therapy that is safe with minimal side effects and good short-term and long-term effects is
      urgently needed in functional constipation treatment.

      Clinical practice shows that acupuncture may meets this need to some extent. The acupuncture
      therapy is safe and effective and the therapeutic effects are still present several months
      after the treatment has been completed.

    <measure>Change of Mean Value of Straining During Defecating</measure>

    <description>Score of straining during defecating was assessed every week according to patients' diaries during 4 weeks of treatment. Score ranges from '0' to '4'. '0' means none of symptoms and '4' means very severe symptoms. Change from baseline of the mean value of straining during defecating over 4 weeks of treatment was evaluated as the secondary outcome. The change was calculated as the value at baseline minus the average over 4 weeks of treatment. We corrected the mean value of straining during defecating by covariance because the data had significant difference among three groups at baseline.</description>

    <description>Acupoints of bilateral Tianshu (ST25), which were located according to WHO Standardized Acupuncture Points Location, were used. After sterilizing the skin, needles of the size of 0.35×0.75mm were inserted into ST25 vertically and slowly without manipulation for about 20~60mm until piercing into the muscle layer. Paired alligator clips of the electric acupuncture (EA) apparatus were attached transversely to the needle holders of bilateral ST25. EA stimulation lasted for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 2/15Hz and current intensity of 0.1~1mA. Participant's abdominal muscle twitching mildly showed the proper dose. Patients were treated once a day, five times a week for continuous 4 weeks.</description>

          <title>Deep Needling Group</title>
          <description>Acupoints of bilateral Tianshu (ST25), which were located according to WHO Standardized Acupuncture Points Location20, were used.
After sterilizing the skin, needles of the size of 0.35×0.75mm were inserted into ST25 vertically and slowly without manipulation for about 30~70mm until touching the parietal peritoneum. Paired alligator clips of the EA apparatus were attached transversely to the needle holders of bilateral ST25. EA stimulation lasted for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 2/15Hz and current intensity of 0.1~1mA. Participant's abdominal muscle twitching mildly showed the proper dose.
Patients were treated once a day, five times a week for continuous 4 weeks.</description>

          <title>Shallow Needling Group</title>
          <description>Bilateral ST25, the same acupoints as deep needling group, were used. After skin disinfection, needles of the size of 0.30×25mm penetrated the skin uprightly for about 5~9mm into the fat layer without manipulation. The usage of EA apparatus and treatment course were the same as deep needling group.</description>

            <description>Acupoints of bilateral Tianshu (ST25), which were located according to WHO Standardized Acupuncture Points Location20, were used.
After sterilizing the skin, needles of the size of 0.35×0.75mm were inserted into ST25 vertically and slowly without manipulation for about 30~70mm until touching the parietal peritoneum. Paired alligator clips of the EA apparatus were attached transversely to the needle holders of bilateral ST25. EA stimulation lasted for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 2/15Hz and current intensity of 0.1~1mA. Participant's abdominal muscle twitching mildly showed the proper dose.
Patients were treated once a day, five times a week for continuous 4 weeks.</description>

        <description>Score of straining during defecating was assessed every week according to patients' diaries during 4 weeks of treatment. Score ranges from '0' to '4'. '0' means none of symptoms and '4' means very severe symptoms. Change from baseline of the mean value of straining during defecating over 4 weeks of treatment was evaluated as the secondary outcome. The change was calculated as the value at baseline minus the average over 4 weeks of treatment. We corrected the mean value of straining during defecating by covariance because the data had significant difference among three groups at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change of Mean Value of Stool Consistency</title>
        <description>Score of stool consistency was assessed every week according to patients' diaries during 4 weeks of treatment. Score ranges from '0' to '4'. '0' means none of symptoms and '4' means very severe symptoms. Change from baseline of the mean value of stool consistency over 4 weeks of treatment was evaluated as the secondary outcome. The change was calculated as the value at baseline minus the average over 4 weeks of treatment. We corrected the mean value of stool consistency by covariance because the data had significant difference among three groups at baseline.</description>

After sterilizing the skin, needles of the size of 0.35×0.75mm were inserted into ST25 vertically and slowly without manipulation for about 30~70mm until touching the parietal peritoneum. Paired alligator clips of the EA apparatus were attached transversely to the needle holders of bilateral ST25. EA stimulation lasted for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 2/15Hz and current intensity of 0.1~1mA. Participant's abdominal muscle twitching mildly showed the proper dose.

            <description>Acupoints of bilateral Tianshu (ST25), which were located according to WHO Standardized Acupuncture Points Location20, were used.
After sterilizing the skin, needles of the size of 0.35×0.75mm were inserted into ST25 vertically and slowly without manipulation for about 30~70mm until touching the parietal peritoneum. Paired alligator clips of the EA apparatus were attached transversely to the needle holders of bilateral ST25. EA stimulation lasted for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 2/15Hz and current intensity of 0.1~1mA. Participant's abdominal muscle twitching mildly showed the proper dose.
Patients were treated once a day, five times a week for continuous 4 weeks.</description>
