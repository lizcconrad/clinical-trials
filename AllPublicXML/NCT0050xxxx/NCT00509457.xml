  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the safety and efficacy of telomerase peptide vaccination ( stimulation of the
      immune system) in patients with NSCLC after having been treated with conventional therapy
      with radiotherapy and docetaxel as a radiosensitizer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival in patients with locally advanced, inoperable NSCLC may be improved if local control
      can be achieved with concurrent chemo radiotherapy .After completed standard chemo-and
      radiation therapy; the safety and efficacy of vaccination therapy will be measured as time to
      progression after treatment with GV1001. Analysis of changes in T-cell subpopulations and
      cytokines in peripheral blood will be performed.
