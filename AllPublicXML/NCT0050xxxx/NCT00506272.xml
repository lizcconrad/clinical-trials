  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ISMAS is designed to test the hypothesis that self management of insulin dependent diabetes
      mellitus by selected patients admitted for elective surgery is more efficacious than standard
      care with respect to overall glycemic control, attaining finger-stick blood sugars, and
      administering insulin.
