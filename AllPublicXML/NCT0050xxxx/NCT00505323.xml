  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder in which sustained muscle contractions cause
      twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. This disease is very heterogeneous
      and can have many causes. Current treatments (drugs, pallidal stimulation) improve primary
      generalized dystonias; however they are ineffective for focal dystonias following brain
      damage.

      Cortex stimulation is a present and effective technique used in the treatment of chronic pain
      and could represent an interesting strategy to treat focal dystonias. This is the aim of the
      present study.

      Pilot study included 6 centres (Clermont-Ferrand, Bordeaux, Paris, Créteil, Lyon and
      Grenoble)

      Study progress :

        -  3 months to 1 month before chirurgical intervention : selection of patient that could be
           included in the protocol.

        -  15 days to 8 days before chirurgical intervention : inclusion visit.

        -  Operating phase : under anaesthesia, implantation of the neurostimulator and its
           components, and adjustment of stimulation parameters.

        -  1 month after chirurgical intervention : checking that all is fine (detection of
           undesirable events)

        -  2 months to 5 months after chirurgical intervention: randomization (double blind): the
           stimulator is put on position On or OFF

        -  5 months after chirurgical intervention : Stimulators of all patients are stopped for
           one month whatever the group they belong.

        -  6 months to 9 months after chirurgical intervention: Stimulatiors are put on position On
           or OFF (cross over with the first period).

        -  9 months to 13 months after chirurgical intervention: Stimulators of all patients are
           started for four months whatever the group they belong.

        -  13 months after chirurgical intervention : study end
