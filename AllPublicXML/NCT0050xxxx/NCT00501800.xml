      The purpose of this study is to identify clinical and genetic markers of ovarian aging. In
      this process, we will evaluate environmental factors that may affect fertility and the age at
      which fertility declines, and may influence the age at which women enter menopause. Wide
      variability exists between women both in the age at which menopause occurs and the rate of
      decline in oocyte number and reproductive capability. As the loss of ovarian function has
      profound impact on women's hormonal milieu and their subsequent risk for the development of
      disease, improving our understanding of the factors that determine the timing and rate of
      reproductive aging is critical to improving quality of life for all women. In addition,
      improving our understanding of reproductive aging has profound economic, and social,
      implications given the complex choices women face regarding the timing of childbearing and
      the growing burden of infertility. While the inter-individual variability in age at menopause
      has a large genetic component and possible environmental influences, to date no studies have
      addressed the relationship between oocyte number as reflected by antral follicle count (AFC)
      and genetic inheritance.

      We hypothesize that ovarian aging, as reflected by antral follicle count, is largely
      determined by common genetic polymorphisms that impact the initial oocyte endowment and/or
      the rate of oocyte loss over time thus lowering antral follicle count for any given age. We
      further hypothesize that antral follicle count will be an improved marker of ovarian aging.
      Thus, we propose a study of the genetic and environmental factors that influence age-specific
      variability in antral follicle count.

      This is a cross-sectional study with a subgroup followed longitudinally over time. This study
      consists of four basic components:

        -  identification and recruitment of a population-based sample of 1,250 regularly cycling
           women of diverse ethnicities, ages 25-45;

        -  a baseline examination on days 2-4 of the menstrual cycle, including a blood draw,
           transvaginal ultrasound examination, body size measurements, and questionnaires, to
           establish cross-sectional relations between the AFC and the genetic and environmental
           exposures of interest (see Specific Aims);

        -  genetic analyses of X-chromosome and autosomal mutations, deletions, and polymorphisms,
           implicated in the control of ovarian function; and

        -  follow-up examination, 3 years after baseline, completed by approximately one-third of
           the cohort (n=450), to begin to describe longitudinal relations between AFC and the
           exposures of interest and to identify markers predictive of accelerated follicle loss.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Characterize antral follicle count (AFC) as a marker of ovarian age by comparing it to
           other available biomarkers, FSH, FSH/LH, and inhibin B, and determine effect
           modification of these relationships by age.

        2. Examine the relationship between antral follicle counts and the frequencies of specific
           genetic polymorphisms in the DAZL (Deleted in AZoospermia-Like) and interacting protein
           genes.

        3. Determine the associations between race/ethnicity, body fat, and active and passive
           smoking and AFC, independently of age; if main effects are observed between genetic
           polymorphisms and AFC (Specific Aim 2), explore the effect modification of those
           relationships by race/ethnicity, body fat and active and passive smoking.

        4. Determine the change in AFC over a three-year period and its relation to genetic and
           environmental characteristics, based on the approximately 450 women who complete a
           3-year follow-up examination.

      The primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the relationship between antral follicle
      count and common genetic polymorphisms and the effect of modification of environmental
      factors. To achieve this goal, our multidisciplinary team proposes to recruit a random sample
      of 1,250 regularly cycling, ethnically diverse women, ages 25-45, who belong to the Northern
      California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care (KPMC) Program in San Francisco.

      This study will provide evidence to support ultrasound evaluation as a non-invasive marker of
      ovarian aging. This and the genetic testing may lead to an opportunity for prospective
      identification of patients at risk for early decline in ovarian function. The ability to
      accurately generate and share this type of information will allow women to become proactive
      in managing their fertility as well as to better understand their risks associated with
      reproductive aging. The recruitment of a large, population-based cohort will increase the
      generalizability of the data generated. The ethnic diversity of this population will allow
      multiple comparisons to identify true &quot;risk factors&quot; for early, and/or accelerated, ovarian
      aging and their correlation with ethnicity.
