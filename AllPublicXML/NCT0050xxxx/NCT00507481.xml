      The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between sleep disturbances and
      delirium in surgical ICU patients. The study set up to test the hypothesis that the
      occurrence of delirium is associated to the alteration of sleep quality and quantity observed
      in the critically ill patients.

      Sleep disorders are an important clinical entity affecting outcome in respiratory,
      cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric disorders and exacting a potentially significant
      toll on patients at both a personal and socio-economic level.Delirium is a common organ
      dysfunction in the critically ill patients characterized by an acute onset of impaired
      cognitive function [REF] associated with prolonged ICU and hospital stay, nosocomial
      pneumonia, and death.
