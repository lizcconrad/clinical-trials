      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of cognitive training on blood
      levels of neurotrophic factors in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current research suggests that levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and certain
      excitatory neurotransmitters - specifically glutamate, D-serine, and glycine are low in
      participants with depression and other mental illnesses (Wolkowitz and Reus 2002, Tan et al.,
      2005; Shoval &amp; Weizman, 2005; Hashimoto et al., 2005). Research also suggests that levels of
      both BDNF and excitatory transmitters can be enhanced by cognitive stimulation (Hynd et al.,
      2005; Wu et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2005; Mattson et al., 2004). BDNF is found in brain
      tissue and is also measurable in blood; it stimulates neuronal cell growth in certain brain
      regions (Duman, 2004). In Phase 1, we wish to measure the levels of specific neurotrophic
      factors in healthy, young participants. Phase 2 is intended to correlate similar levels with
      change in neurocognitive performance in healthy, older participants. Overall, this study is
      designed to obtain a raw measure of the impact that cognitive training has on the mature
      adult brain.

    <description>The experimental cognitive training program consists of interactive training exercises in which the participant responds to visual patterns and stimuli. The program is designed upon the principles of brain-plasticity, and, for the purposes of this study, is intended to be used for an 8-10 week period (40 total hours of training.)</description>
