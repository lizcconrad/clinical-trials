  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have shown that the quality of life of two common interstitial lung
      diseases (ild), sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis patients, is impaired and that fatigue is
      a substantial problem for those patients. Furthermore, breathlessness is an additional major
      problem in pulmonary fibrosis. In the field of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer,
      personality factors have shown to play a role in patient's morbidity, mortality, quality of
      life, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and one study showed a predictive role of personality
      factors in health care consumption. No studies examining personality factors have been
      performed in sarcoidosis or pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to
      examine the role of personality factors as predictors of fatigue, quality of life, prognosis,
      and health care consumption in sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis. In this study a number of
      possible moderators, such as social support, will also be examined, aiming to get a full
      picture of the relationship between the various factors examined. Known and new sarcoidosis
      and pulmonary fibrosis patients (inclusion period 1 year) of ild care team of the outpatient
      clinic of the department of Respiratory Medicine of the University Hospital Maastricht will
      be asked to participate through completing questionnaires at baseline and every six months
      for 18 months, and allowing the researchers access to their medical records for the purpose
      of this study.
