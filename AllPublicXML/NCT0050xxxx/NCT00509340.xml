      This study will compare the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral intervention versus usual
      clinic care in helping HIV infected adults with depression to take their HIV medications on
      schedule.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a type of medication treatment for HIV that impairs the
      virus's ability to multiply. When used properly, it has been shown to be successful in
      reducing HIV-related deaths. A high adherence rate to ART is required to adequately suppress
      the virus, limit drug resistance, and reduce transmission. HIV infected people who are
      depressed often experience increased difficulty with adhering to their ART regimen. This
      study will compare the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral intervention that targets both
      depression and adherence versus usual care practices which may or may not include mental
      health intervention with the goal of improving ART adherence among HIV infected adults with
      depression who are experiencing difficulty with adhering to their medication regimen.

      This study will last 24 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the
      cognitive behavioral intervention or usual care. Study visits for all participants will occur
      at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24. Those receiving the intervention will also have
      visits at Weeks 1 and 2. Participants receiving the intervention will attend five individual
      treatment sessions followed by one to three booster treatment sessions; these sessions will
      coincide with the study visits.
