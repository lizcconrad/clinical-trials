  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and acupressure in
      treating insomnia in Chinese adults. The main components of CBT for insomnia (CBT-I) includes
      psychoeducation, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, and
      relaxation. CBT-I is widely used in western countries but it fails to address patient
      preference among Chinese adults with insomnia, as demonstrated in a previous study examining
      the subjective experience of chronic insomnia in Hong Kong Chinese adults. The study revealed
      that Chinese adults showed distrust in hypnotics and preferred traditional Chinese medicine
      (TCM) which was believed to be more natural. In order to maximize the therapeutic effects of
      psychological interventions for insomnia, integrative medicine with a combination of CBT-I
      and TCM could be an alternative to address insomnia in the Chinese population. Acupressure, a
      non-invasive therapy, is commonly used in TCM. It is suggested that acupressure can induce
      relaxation and improve sleep quality. Some studies have demonstrated the separate efficacy of
      CBT-I and acupressure in treating insomnia. However, few studies have examined the effect of
      their combination.

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 4-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item scale designed to evaluate perceived insomnia severity. Ratings on the 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the perceived severity of sleep-onset, sleep-maintenance, early morning awakening problems, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeably of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and level of distress caused by the sleep problem.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 7-Day Sleep Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 4-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The standardized sleep diary records sleep-onset latency (SOL; min), wake after sleep onset (WASO; min), total wake time (TWT; min), total sleep time (TST; min), time in bed (TIB; min); sleep efficiency (SE; calculated as TST/TIB * 100%), etc.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 4-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item self-rating scale that measures anxiety and depression in both hospital and community settings. It is divided into an Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and a Depression subscale (HADS-D) both containing seven intermingled items. It is for screening purpose and not meant to be a diagnostic tool.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale - 16-item version (DBAS-16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 4-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-item self-report measure designed to evaluate sleep related cognitions (e.g., faulty beliefs and appraisals, unrealistic expectations, perceptual and attention bias).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 4-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. Ratings on a 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the dimensions of general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short Form (Six-Dimension) Health Survey - The Chinese (Hong Kong) Version (SF-6D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 4-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A preference-based single index measure of health. A six-digit number represents each SF-6D health state, each digit denotes the level of one of six SF-6D dimensions: physical functioning, role limitation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Credibility-Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
