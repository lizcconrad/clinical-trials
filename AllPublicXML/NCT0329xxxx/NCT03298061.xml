  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), also referred to as Churg-Strauss
      syndrome, is a rare hyper-eosinophilic syndrome. Eosinophilia is central to the
      pathophysiology of EGPA and interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine regulating the life-cycle
      of the eosinophil. Neutralization of IL-5 with mepolizumab, an anti-IL5 monoclonal antibody,
      therefore offers a potential therapeutic option for EGPA. The objective of study MEA115921
      was to investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab compared with placebo wherein the
      subjects were randomized to receive either: 300 milligram (mg) mepolizumab or Placebo
      subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4 weeks in addition to their background standard-of-care
      therapy. Subjects were treated for a period of 52 weeks and then followed up for a further 8
      weeks to study completion at Week 60. This is a LAP to support provision of open-label
      mepolizumab on an individual basis to eligible subjects who participated in clinical study
      MEA115921 and who require a dose of prednisolone (or equivalent) of &gt;=5 milligrams per day
      (mg/day) for adequate control of their EGPA. Eligible subjects can initiate mepolizumab under
      this LAP within a 6-month period starting from completion of study MEA115921 (that is, at
      Week 60) or, in case of premature discontinuation from study MEA115921, the subjects will
      initiate mepolizumab at the time point that would have been Week 60 if the subject had
      completed the study. Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneously administered mepolizumab
      at a dose of 300 mg SC every 4 weeks. Eligible subjects will continue to receive mepolizumab
      under this LAP until mepolizumab is commercially licensed for the treatment of EGPA in the
      relevant country or until GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) discontinues the program or until the subject
      meets any of the withdrawal/stopping criteria.

SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical events based on medical or scientific judgment; and is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function. Additionally, systemic (that is, allergic/hypersensitivity and non-allergic) reactions and local injection site reactions will be recorded throughout the treatment and follow-up period.</description>
