  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to investigate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      teprotumumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody [mAb] inhibitor of the insulin-like growth
      factor-1 receptor [IGF-1R]) administered once every 3 weeks (q3W) for 21 weeks with a final
      assessment at Week 24, in comparison to placebo, in the treatment of participants with
      moderate-to-severe active Thyroid Eye Disease (TED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study.
      Approximately 76 participants (38/group) who meet the study eligibility criteria will be
      randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by tobacco use status) to receive 8 infusions
      of teprotumumab or placebo q3W. All participants will enter a 24-week double-masked Treatment
      Period, during which study drug will be infused on Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12,
      15, 18, and 21 (with a final visit at Week 24). All study drug dosing will be performed at
      the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff. On each dosing day, scheduled assessments
      (except for adverse event [AE] and concomitant medication use monitoring, which will be
      monitored throughout the clinic visit) will be completed prior to study drug dosing.

      At the end of the double-masked Treatment Period (Week 24), participants who are proptosis
      non-responders (study eye has &lt; 2 mm decrease in proptosis) will be eligible to enter an
      open-label extension study in which participants may receive up to 8 infusions of
      teprotumumab in an open-label fashion.

      At Week 24, proptosis responders, as well as non-responders who choose not to enroll in the
      open-label extension study, will enter a 48-week Follow-Up Period, during which study drug
      will not be administered and clinic visits are scheduled for Weeks 28, 36, 48, 60, and 72.
      Participants who are considered responders at Week 24 but who meet criteria for re-treatment
      due to relapse during the Follow-Up Period may enroll in the open-label extension study.

             Follow-Up Period); participants must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception
             during the trial, one of which is recommended to be hormonal, such as an oral
             contraceptive. Hormonal contraception must be started at least one full cycle prior to
             Baseline and continue for 180 days after the last dose of study drug. Highly effective

          6. Any steroid use (intravenous [IV] or oral) with a cumulative dose equivalent to ≥ 1 g
             of methylprednisolone for the treatment of TED. Previous steroid use (IV or oral) with
             a cumulative dose of &lt;1 g methylprednisolone or equivalent for the treatment of TED
             and previous use of steroid eye drops is allowed if the corticosteroid was

             anticipated use during the course of the trial.

         11. Identified pre-existing ophthalmic disease that, in the judgment of the Investigator,
             would preclude study participation or complicate interpretation of study results.

         12. Bleeding diathesis that in the judgment of the Investigator would preclude inclusion
             in the clinical trial.

         13. Malignant condition in the past 12 months (except successfully treated basal/squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin).

         14. Pregnant or lactating women.

         15. Current drug or alcohol abuse, or history of either within the previous 2 years, in

             hypersensitivity reactions to mAbs.

         18. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude inclusion
             in the study.

         19. Previous enrollment in this study or participation in a prior teprotumumab clinical
             trial.
