  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential cardiovascular safety concerns and
      all-cause mortality described in the risk management plan for aclidinium bromide, through
      sequential, nested case-control studies for each endpoint of interest
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-authorisation safety study (PASS) of new users of aclidinium bromide, fixed
      dose aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate, and other inhaled medications
      frequently used by patients with COPD.

      The plan is for the PASS study to be conducted on one population-based automated health
      database; the initial candidate database is the CRPD in the United Kingdom.

        The study will be conducted in patients aged 40 years or older diagnosed with COPD
        initiating treatment with aclidinium bromide or other inhaled COPD treatments. Patients
        must have at least 1 year of enrolment in the electronic database and to have not been
        prescribed the study medication of interest during the 6-months before the date of the
        first prescription for that specific study medication. Patients with life-threatening
        non-cardiovascular comorbidity (e.g., malignancy, HIV infection, other) will be excluded

          3. Have a recorded diagnosis of COPD.

          4. Have not been prescribed a study medication of interest during the 6 months before the
             date of the first prescription for that specific study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with cancer or other serious, non-cardiovascular, life-threatening conditions
             or indicators of severe comorbidity will be excluded from the study cohort.

          2. Subjects who will be potentially excluded are those with the following conditions
             recorded in the database at any time before the date of cohort entry: cancer, HIV,
             respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease or dialysis, organ transplantation, drug
             or alcohol abuse, coma, congenital abnormalities of the heart or great arteries.
