      The purpose of the study are:

        1. To make quality, characterized samples and related data available for future studies,
           including Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), genomics, and biomarker research;

        2. To use these samples and related medical information to answer research questions aimed
           at understanding the genetics and underlying biology of acquired disease and injury to
           the brain, heart and blood vessels with the express purpose of advancing the search for
           effective modalities for prevention, treatment, and recovery;

        3. To develop additional operational infrastructure to support this project across the
           Prince of Wales Hospital and divisions, including (1) tracking of patient consent, (2)
           management of collection and sample processing processes, (3) sample inventory and QC/QA
           processes, and (4) release of materials to investigators for further research.

      TYPES OF TISSUES TO BE BANKED

      Blood:

      Blood will be collected from the out-patient clinic, prospectively at the time of a
      clinically planned procedure or prospectively during a procedure performed solely for
      research. After informed consent is obtained, the patient/ subject will be asked to donate a
      one-time blood sample of up to 30ml. A portion of each blood sample will be used to generate
      a DNA sample, and the remainder will be used to separate out plasma, peripheral blood cells,
      and/or serum for future research studies, including but not limited to metabolomics,
      proteomics, biomarker measurements, and bioenergetic assays.

      Cerebrospinal Fluid:

      Cerebrospinal fluid 5-10ml may be collected prospectively from lumbar puncture or the subset
      of patients who have an external ventricular drain (EVD) placed as part of their clinical
      care. The standard clinical protocol for EVD includes the drainage of CSF externally into a
      collection bag. Once the volume of CSF drainage is recorded, the CSF is typically discarded.
      The collection of CSF will be coordinated with the subject's primary treatment team. At this
      time, CSF banking will not occur in subjects who do not have CSF collection planned as part
      of their clinical care.

      Body Tissue:

      The body tissue will be collected from the patients who undergo the carotid stent which is
      their routine medical treatment. Around 5mg tissue will be taken from the filter wire during
      the stenting operation and then stabilized by RNAlater reagent immediately. The tissue will
      be kept in -80oC freezer for future process.

      Buccal swab or saliva:

      Buccal swab or saliva (~5-10ml) may be collected from the patients, their family members
      and/or normal subjects for DNA and RNA extraction if necessary. It would be collected by the
      trained doctor, medical staffs or research assistant. The collected samples will be kept in
      -80oC freezer for future use, for example, extraction of DNA.

    <description>Discovery of novel genetic predictor of stroke and its complications will be done by identifying cases and controls for different stroke subtype and complications within the recruited samples, and using whole-genome genotyping arrays, or by sequencing approaches.
Replication of novel genetic markers of stroke will be performed using a combination of genotyping, multiplex genotyping, customized-content genotyping arrays and sequencing.</description>

    <ipd_description>Tissues and data from the repository will only be shared with other academic, non-profit institutions. No collaboration with for-profit companies is anticipated. All investigators seeking to gain access to the repository must first demonstrate that their research interests are relevant to the central theme of the repository. Investigators must also complete all required IRB documentation before samples and information will be released.
In the event that a commercial, for-profit, collaboration is sought, a bona fide intellectual collaboration between the PI and an individual or group at the for-profit site and a Materials Transfer Agreement will be required. For all researchers requesting samples, the IRB recommended Letter of Agreement must be signed prior to our releasing tissues and information.</ipd_description>
