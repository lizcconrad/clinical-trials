  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, pilot trial to evaluate the immune effects, safety and
      tolerability of pembrolizumab in subjects newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      who have persistent leukemia after induction chemotherapy. Patients must have an ECOG
      performance status of 0-1. The enrollment target for this study is 10 patients.

             classification (21) who have persistent leukemia after a course or more of treatment
             with induction chemotherapy (the diagnosis of persistent disease, which is defined as
             &gt;10% blasts by evaluation of bone marrow biopsy or bone marrow aspirate).

          4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45%

             days of treatment initiation.

          7. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

             contraception- Contraception, for the course of the study through 120 days after the
             last dose of study medication.

          9. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception- Contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through
             120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         15. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
