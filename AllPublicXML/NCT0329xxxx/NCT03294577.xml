  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in patients
      treated with:

      Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) + pegfilgrastim versus Docetaxel,
      doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) + plinabulin

      Severe neutropenia is an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 × 109/L.

      Patient treated in this study will either have HER2 negative, early breast cancer (node
      positive or node negative with high risk of recurrence) Or HER2 negative, metastatic breast
      cancer, who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.

      Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) will be used as the chemotherapy in this
      study. These agents are among the most active and commonly used chemotherapeutic agents
      employed for treating patients with breast carcinoma. In particular, TAC chemotherapy has
      been used for the adjuvant treatment of HER2 negative early breast cancer patients with node
      positive disease as well as for node negative breast cancer patients who have a high risk of
      recurrence.

      Plinabulin is a novel small molecule that is being developed for the mitigation of
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Administered by IV infusion on the same day of
      (approximately 1 hour after) chemotherapy (TAC), plinabulin will be given in a single dose
      per cycle. Plinabulin is being studied to see if it is a convenient alternative to G-CSF,
      Pegfilgrastim, for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a multi-center randomized study, with Phase 2 and Phase 3 portions. Approximately 180
      patients total will be enrolled in the study. Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled in
      Phase 2 and approximately 120 patients are planned to be enrolled in Phase 3.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in patients
      with HER2 negative, early breast cancer (node positive or node negative with high risk of
      recurrence) or for patients with HER2 negative, metastatic breast cancer, who have not
      received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, treated with Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and
      cyclophosphamide (TAC) + plinabulin versus TAC + pegfilgrastim. Severe neutropenia is an
      absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 × 109/L.

      Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) will be used as the chemotherapy in this
      study. These agents are among the most active and commonly used chemotherapeutic agents
      employed for treating patients with breast carcinoma. In particular, TAC chemotherapy has
      been used for the adjuvant treatment of HER2 negative early breast cancer patients with node
      positive disease as well as for node negative breast cancer patients who have a high risk of
      recurrence.

      Plinabulin is a novel small molecule that is being developed for the mitigation of
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Administered by IV infusion on the same day of
      (approximately 1 hour after) chemotherapy (TAC), plinabulin will be given in a single dose
      per cycle. Plinabulin is being studied to see if it is a convenient alternative to G-CSF,
      pegfilgrastim, for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

      The Phase 2 portion is randomized and open label. Approximately 60 patients with breast
      cancer will be enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to one of the treatment arms, with 20
      patients enrolled in each arm, with the arm designation and planned intervention as follows:

      Arm 1: TAC + pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg). Arm 2: TAC + plinabulin (10 mg/m2). Arm 3: TAC +
      plinabulin (20 mg/m2).

      In Phase 2 (Open Label), Cycles 1 to 4 will consist of TAC (or TC for Cycles 2 to 4)
      administered IV on Day 1, every 21 days.

      Patients in Arms 2 and 3 will receive a single dose of plinabulin over 30 minutes (±5
      minutes), 30 minutes after the end of the TAC (or TC for Cycles 2 to 4) infusion on Day 1.

      On Day 2 of each cycle (≥24 hours after completing chemotherapy) patients in Arm 1 will
      receive a single dose of pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg) (subcutaneous injection) in an open label
      treatment.

      The study will be temporarily closed to enrollment when a total of 60 patients have been
      enrolled and completed at least 1 treatment cycle in each arm in Phase 2. The sponsor will
      notify the study sites when this occurs.

      Once the study is temporarily closed to enrollment in Phase 2, a PK/PD analysis will be
      performed to determine the recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D). The PK/PD analysis will be done
      at the time 60 patients in Phase 2 have completed at least Cycle 1.

      Phase 3 will not begin until RP3D has been determined based on the Phase 2 PK/PD analysis as
      mentioned above; the RP3D will be the only plinabulin dose administered in Phase 3.

      In Phase 3 part of the trial, treatment will be double blinded, approximately 120 patients
      with breast cancer will be enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to one of the treatment
      arms, with 60 patients enrolled in each arm, with the arm designation and planned
      intervention as follows:

      Arm 1: TAC + pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin. Arm 2: TAC + plinabulin
      (RP3D) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim.

      In Phase 3 (double blinded treatment), Cycles 1 to 4 will consist of TAC (or TC for Cycles 2
      to 4) administered IV on Day 1 every 21 days. Patients will receive a single dose of
      plinabulin or placebo IV over 30 minutes (±5 minutes) in a double blinded manner, 30 minutes
      after the end of the TAC (or TC for Cycles 2 to 4) infusion. On Day 2 of each cycle (≥24
      hours after completing chemotherapy), all patients will receive a single dose of
      pegfilgrastim (6.0 mg) or placebo (subcutaneous injection) in a double blinded manner.
