    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether an Actigraph GT3X accelerometer can identify body position
      and quantify step count in a ward based population recovering from critical illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ward based patients recovering from critical illness who satisfy the inclusion criteria will
      have an Actigraph GT3X accelerometer positioned on the thigh and ankle of the non dominant
      leg. These will be used as an objective method of identifying adoption of lying, sitting and
      standing postures and quantification of step count. Both placement sites will be investigated
      in isolation. A further analysis will be undertaken to determine whether combining data from
      both placement sites (ankle and thigh) is superior in identification of lying, sitting and
      standing postures compared to an isolated single site. Accelerometer data will be compared
      against direct observation as the criterion measure.

      Patients will undertake a semi-structured movement protocol consisting of typical activities
      undertaken by this population. These include lying in bed, transferring over the side of the
      bed, sit to stand postural transfers (and the reverse), sitting in a chair and walking.
      Observation periods will not exceed 3 hours. During this time all aspects of the movement
      protocol will be completed.

      The data from this study will be analysed to determine the validity of the Actigraph GT3X in
      identification of body position and quantification of step count using the placement sites
      described above.
