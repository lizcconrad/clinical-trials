  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TRANSFORM-HF is a large-scale, pragmatic, randomized, unblinded clinical effectiveness study
      comparing torsemide versus furosemide as treatment for heart failure. Approximately 6,000
      patients with heart failure will be enrolled. The primary objective of the TRANSFORM-HF study
      is to compare the treatment strategy of torsemide versus furosemide on clinical outcomes over
      12 months in patients with heart failure who are hospitalized.

    <textblock>
      -  This study will be a randomized, unblinded, two-arm, multi-center clinical trial of
           patients with heart failure who are hospitalized. Heart failure need not be the reason
           for hospitalization. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either oral torsemide OR oral
           furosemide prior to hospital discharge. Oral dosing of torsemide compared to furosemide
           will be 1mg:2mg. The specific loop diuretic dose will be at the discretion of the
           treating physician with the above noted conversion.

        -  Trial enrollment occurs before hospital discharge, at the discretion of the healthcare
           provider.

        -  As appropriate, adherence to the randomized medication will be encouraged during the
           remainder of hospitalization and will continue post-discharge. Patients will receive
           follow-up per standard care without any additional study-specific visits.

        -  Patients will have 30-day, 6-month and 12-month follow-up phone contacts for assessments
           of vital status, interval hospitalizations, adherence, and quality of life. &quot;Central
           follow-up&quot; and collection of hospital discharge summaries via IRB-approved mechanisms.
           Subsets of patients enrolled early in the study have additional phone contacts beyond 12
           months, up to 30 months, at six month intervals, to document vital status.
