  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single center study to evaluate the efficacy of
      Thymoglobulin induction therapy in combination with Mycophenolate Mofetil, tacrolimus, and
      steroids in the prevention of CAV. Approximately half of the patients will be randomized to
      receive a total of 5 doses of Thymoglobulin during the study. The first dose of Thymoglobulin
      will be administered at 1.5 mg/kg via intravenous infusion over 6 hours immediately upon
      arrival to the ICU post-operation (day 1). Subsequent doses of 1.5 mg/kg will be administered
      on days 2, 3, 4, and 5 via IV infusion over 4 hours.

      Mechanistic assays (T-reg cells, Lym subsets, B cell subsets, IL-1b, cytokines, TGFb, IL-21
      to be drawn at Pre-transplant, 3, 6, 12 months post-transplant) will also be performed.

      All patients will be followed and monitored according to standard of care protocols for heart
      transplant recipients at our center.

    <description>Thymoglobulin® (Genzyme) [rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)] is a purified pasteurized, gamma immune globulin, obtained by immunization of rabbits with human thymocytes. This immunosuppressive product contains polyclonal cytotoxic antibodies directed against antigens expressed on human T-lymphocytes. Approximately half of the patients will be randomized to receive a total of 5 doses of Thymoglobulin during the study. The first dose of Thymoglobulin will be administered at 1.5 mg/kg via intravenous infusion over 6 hours immediately upon arrival to the ICU post-operation (day 1). Subsequent doses of 1.5 mg/kg will be administered on days 2, 3, 4, and 5 via IV infusion over 4 hours.
In addition, there will be maintenance doses of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cumulative dose of corticosteroids at 12 months post-transplantation</description>
