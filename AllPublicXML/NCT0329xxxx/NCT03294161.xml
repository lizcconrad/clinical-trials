      A clinical trial to asses efficacy and safety of Transition-state Analog Inhibitor of Human
      Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase for topical use associated standard antimonial in the
      treatment of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Bahia, Brazil.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis in Brazil with pentavalent
      antimony is associated with a high rate of failure, reaching up to 45% of cases.
      Additionally, pentavalent antimony is only administered by parenteral route with important
      toxicity and ulcer lesion healing takes a long time, from 2 to 3 months.

      So, this randomized and controlled clinical trial was designed to compare the efficacy and
      safety of standard antimonial (20mg/day /kg for 20 days) associated with Transition-state
      Analog Inhibitor of Human Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase for topical use versus standard
      antimonial (20mg/kg/day for 20 days) associated with placebo for topical use in the treatment
      of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis and Early Cutaneous Leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis in the
      endemic area of Corte de Pedra, Bahia, Brazil.

    <description>Bidirectional measurements of ulcers will be taken of the patients' lesions at the initial visit, and at each follow-up visit with standardized caliper. The area involved will be calculated as the product of the two measurements.
All lesions will be categorized as either active or healed (cured) at follow-up visits. Only lesions with complete re-epithelialization, without raised borders, infiltrations or crusts will be considered healed. Evaluation of the lesions will be performed by 2 clinicians who will be unaware of the group assignment of all patients.</description>
