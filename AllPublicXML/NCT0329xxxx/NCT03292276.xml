  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two recent randomized clinical trials reported a significant contribute of Amadeo toward the
      recovery of hand motor function in acute stroke patients in association with physiotherapy
      and/or occupational therapy. However, no data are available in patients with chronic stroke,
      and the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying such clinical improvement need to be
      elucidated. Given that robotic devices harness brain plasticity to foster motor function
      recovery, a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological bases of Amadeo training could
      help clinician to realize patient-tailored rehabilitative training based brain plasticity
      knowledge. We planned a pilot randomized-controlled observer trial aimed at evaluating the
      effects of intensive robot-assisted hand therapy compared with intensive occupational therapy
      in chronic phase after stroke. We estimated that 40 patients per group will be required to
      demonstrate a greater effect of Amadeo as compared to occupational therapy, with an effect
      size of 0.5. Twenty chronic stroke patients (at their first-ever stroke) will be enrolled and
      randomized into two groups. The experimental group will be provided with Amadeo training. The
      Control group will be provided with occupational therapy executed by a trained
      physiotherapist.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nine hole peg test</measure>
    <time_frame>by 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Administered by asking the client to take the pegs from a container, one by one, and place them into the holes on the board, as quickly as possible. Participants must then remove the pegs from the holes, one by one, and replace them back into the container. The board should be placed at the client's midline, with the container holding the pegs oriented towards the hand being tested. Only the hand being evaluated should perform the test. Hand not being evaluated is permitted to hold the edge of the board in order to provide stability. Scores are based on the time taken to complete the test activity, recorded in seconds. Alternative scoring - the number of pegs placed in 50 or 100 seconds can be recorded. In this case, results are expressed as the number of pegs placed per second. Stopwatch should be started from the moment the participant touches the first peg until the moment the last peg hits the container.</description>

    <description>To understand the cortical modifications related to movement preparation and execution after robot-assisted training we will study the EEG modifications of cortical activity using time-frequency event-related EEG and task-related coherence (TRCoh).
Friedman ANOVA with post-hoc t-test (corrected for multiple comparisons) will be used to assess the significance of training-induced changes in the two groups.</description>
