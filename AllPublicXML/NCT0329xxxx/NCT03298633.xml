      A multicenter, parallel-controlled(1:1 treatment ratio), double-blinded, randomized clinical
      trials regarding fertilization and pregnancy outcomes between ICSI and conventional IVF among
      couples with no-severe male-factor infertility in China.

    <textblock>
      A multicenter, large-scale, randomized controlled clinical trial will enroll 2,346 couples
      with non-severe male infertility undergoing their first or second cycle of IVF or ICSI. The
      study will recruit participants from 6 Reproductive Medical Centers across mainland China.The
      participation in this study will be approximately 2 years with a total of 7 visits from
      controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, pregnancy to delivery. On the day of oocyte retrieval,
      eligible participants will be allocated to two groups at a ratio of 1:1- ICSI protocol, and
      conventional IVF protocol. All participants will be randomized through stratified block
      randomization according to the study sites.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients that have provided informed consent will be randomized to either ICSI or conventional IVF. Randomization and allocation of patients to study groups will be performed on the day of oocyte retrieval. Stratified permuted block randomization will be centrally controlled by administrative staffs in the trial center, who are not involved in the treatment procedure. When there is an eligible participant to be enrolled into the study, nurses from the specific site will login the trial system to get allocation of patients according to a computer-generated randomization list in a 1:1 ratio, with a variable block size of 2, 4 or 8 and stratified by center.</intervention_model_description>
