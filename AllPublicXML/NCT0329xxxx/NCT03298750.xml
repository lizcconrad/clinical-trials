  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examine the possibility that mechanical stimulation and ovarian fragmentation in women with
      premature ovarian failure or low ovarian reserve intended for egg donation may cause early
      follicular recruitment and increase chances of achieving pregnancy through IVF.

      The women will undergo a surgical laparoscopy during which one of the two technique will
      ensue.

        1. One of the ovaries will be scratched ( 2 mm depth) with a knife. Simultaneously, a piece
           of the ovary will be preserved for further histologic analysis and research in the
           laboratory.

        2. A piece of one ovary will be resected (up to one third of the ovary's volume, without
           harming the other ovary.

      The resected ovarian tissue will be transferred immediately to the laboratory where the
      cortex will be divided from the medulla and sliced to small pieces of 1-2 square millimeters.

      These pieces will be transferred back to the operation room in order for them to be
      transplanted under the serosa layer of the remaining ovary.

      Any bleeding would be stopped using a stiches or hemostatic mesh (diathermy will not be
      used).

      Simultaneously, a piece of the ovary will be preserved for further histologic analysis and
      research in the laboratory.

      Post operational follow up ( up to two years) including: menstrual cycle surveillance,
      hormonal profile, AMH level, US of the pelvis and Antral Follicles Count (AFC).

      A month after the surgery, an ovarian stimulation will commence following IVF while close
      monitoring the ovarian response and comparing the pre and post operation response.

      Moreover, the treated ovary will be compared to the untreated one: using the US the ovarian
      volume and antral follicles size and count will be evaluated.

      The preserved pieces of ovary will be histologically evaluated for ovarian reserve analysis.

      Additionally, these pieces will be used for experiments for the evaluation of various methods
      for primordial follicles stimulation including mechanical stimulation like the laser or using
      substances like Akt Stimulators.
