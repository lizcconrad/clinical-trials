  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although Pilates has been proposed as a useful rehabilitation strategy in PD, research on its
      feasibility and potential effects on the motor symptoms and balance with this population is
      scarce. Some works have included Pilates as part of combined exercise session interventions,
      but information concerning their specific effects was not provided. Under these
      circumstances, this study aims at identifying the effects of adding Pilates as part of a
      conventional exercise rehabilitation program on the motor symptoms and static balance of PD
      persons. Participants (n=15) were assigned to a Pilates (PG) or to a conventional exercise
      group (CG) and performed one land-based and one water-based exercise session per week for 14
      weeks. The MDS-UPDRS and a stabilometer were used to assess the impact of the intervention on
      the participant´s motor symptoms and static balance.

    <time_frame>The participants were assessed one week before starting the program (week #0).</time_frame>
    <description>The static balance was evaluated using the TecnoBody Prokin 3 platform. The assessment protocol was developed in a sitting and standing position, with open (OE) and closed (CE) eyes. The participants had three 30-second attempts to perform the position with open and closed eyes and a 60-second interval of active rest between them. The static balance parameters assessed were the centre of pressure of the body in the frontal plane, the centre of pressure of the body in the sagittal plane, the amplitude movement of the centre of pressure in the sagittal plane, the amplitude movement of the centre of pressure in the frontal plane, the average speed of oscillation movement of the centre of pressure in the sagittal plane, the average speed of oscillation movement of the centre of pressure in the frontal plane, the sum of distances of the amount of movement of the centre of pressure, and the displacement area of the centre of pressure.</description>
