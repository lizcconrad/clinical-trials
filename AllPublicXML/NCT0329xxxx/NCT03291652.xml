  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to attain early recognition of the unstable plaques which have an imminent
      embolic risk in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (IAD).

      Potential candidates will undergo a cranial MRI and MR angiography. Patients who are found
      signal void in a relevant intracranial internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery will
      proceed to a 30-minute TCD monitoring for MES an angiograms will be analyzed by investigators
      blind to subjects' clinical information. All recruited patients will receive standard medical
      therapy throughout the investigation period.

    <description>DSA and 3DRA will be performed with access through a 4F sheath at the right femoral artery. Angiograms of intracranial arteries will be obtained by contrast injection at internal carotid artery and vertebral artery ostium from a 4F H1 catheter. Each injection will contain 10ml of iopaminro 300 diluted in 1:1 with normal saline. Each angiographic run will capture a complete series of images from the arterial phase to the end of the venous phase. A 3-dimensional rotational angiogram (a scan time of 4 seconds with 120 images) will be obtained for evaluation of plaque morphology.
2. The access site will be closely observed for hemostasis after the procedure. The neurological status and renal function will be monitored.

               2. Patient who has a high-grade (&gt;60%) intracranial stenosis (signal void in MR
                  angiography) but without infarct in the corresponding vascular territory in DWI
                  or T2-weighted sequence.
