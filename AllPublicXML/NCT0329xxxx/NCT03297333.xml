  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to study the effects of exercise energy expenditure
      matched vigorous dynamic resistance training and aerobic training on cardiac fat, and its
      relationship to cardiac function and geometry using cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise-induced weight-loss is one of the most common strategies for reducing excess fat in
      overweight and obese individuals. Although vigorous intensity may be more favorable promoting
      positive cardiac adaptations compared to low-moderate intensity, evidence of the positive
      effects of different exercise modes needs to be explored to allow for realistic comparisons
      with other strategies. Research using cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging that compares the
      effects of different modes of exercise - matched by exercise energy expenditure â€” on
      epicardial adipose tissue and paracardial adipose tissue, and how these interventions modify
      cardiac function and geometry have not been previously explored in obesity.

    <description>Resistance training will consist of a supervised circuit training 3 sessions/week for approximately 45-50 min/session. The circuit will include 7 strength exercises engaging the major muscle groups (leg press, rows, back squats, weighted crunches, deadlifts, bench press, and squat jumps with weights). The participants will perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions with resting periods of 30 seconds between exercises, and 2 minutes between sets. The overall OMNI-Resistance Exercise Scale per set will range between 8-10. Heart rate and exercise energy expenditure during the workout will be monitored. The load will be changed depending on the participants' perception when needed. In addition, the intensity will be monitored assessing Lactate concentrations at baseline and at the end of each session. Circuit will be repeated until meeting the targeted exercise energy expenditure of 450-500 kcal/session.</description>

    <description>Aerobic interval will consist of a supervised aerobic interval training sessions 3 times/week. Duration will range between 45-50 min/session depending on the exercise energy expenditure. Each interval will have a total duration of 5 min, and it will be divided into 2 periods. The first period will consist of 3 minutes of high-intensity activity, and the second period the intensity will be reduced for 2 minutes. The speed/incline will be changed depending on the participants' heart rate and perception using the Borg's rating of perceived exertion as needed. Heart rate and exercise energy expenditure during the workout will be monitored. Intensity will be monitored assessing Lactate concentrations at the end of each session. Intervals will be repeated until meeting the targeted exercise energy expenditure (450-500 kcal/session).</description>
