  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease affects around 25% of the UK population aged over 55. Left
      untreated it can lead to debilitating pain, gangrene, amputation and death. It most commonly
      affects the lower limbs and in the earlier stages of the disease patients can present with a
      symptom known as intermittent claudication; pain felt in the legs which stops the patient
      from walking past a certain distance. Current National Institute for Healthcare and
      Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend Supervised Exercise as first line treatment for
      patients with peripheral arterial disease presenting with intermittent claudication.
      Supervised exercise employs behaviour changing techniques which enable the patient to modify
      their lifestyles, improving their claudication symptoms, quality of life and reducing their
      cardiovascular risk. Despite this treatment being significantly more cost-effective than
      often employed complex endovascular management, most institutions don't offer such programmes
      citing lack of resources and compliance from clinicians and patients alike.

      The investigators propose a more cost-effective, resource-savvy solution in the form of
      REmotely SuPervised ExerCise Training (RESPECT). This allows the patient to exercise in the
      convenience of their own home, at a time of their choosing but still be supervised via
      fitness tracker technology and an online fitness platform. This randomised controlled trial
      will attempt to prove its' effectiveness in increasing claudication distance, improving
      functional ability, decreasing cardiovascular risk and improving quality of life whilst being
      more cost-effective than the currently recognised national first line treatment. This trial
      has the potential to revolutionise the management of patients with peripheral arterial
      disease.
