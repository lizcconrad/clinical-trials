  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumers are often forced to eat fast, convenient foods and snacks (&quot;eat on the go&quot;) in
      order to match the pace of their lifestyles. However, these snack options more often than not
      offer little health benefit to the consumer. In fact, 55% of calories consumed by Canadians
      are ultra processed foods, which are limited in their nutrient profile and only offer empty
      calories. Subsequently, these foods lead the consumer to eat more and provides little to no
      feelings of satiety or satiation. the proposed objectives of the current project are to
      examine the physiological benefit(s) of consuming readily available pulse snacks and compare
      them to other commonly consumed snack varieties. This work aims to incentivize consumers to
      seek out pulses as valuable snacking options and highlight the benefit of including these as
      alternatives to other energy-dense snacks that lack the nutritional composition of pulses.

      Hypothesis of the study: Inclusion of pulses as part of a snack will lower appetite and
      post-prandial glycemia (PPG) in comparison to commercial, commonly consumed non-pulse snacks.

      Overall Objective of the study: To investigate and compare the effects of pulse and non-pulse
      snacks served as chips and dip on appetite and PPG in healthy adults.

      Specific objectives of the study: To test the acute effects of different pulse snacks on: 1)
      PPG and appetite for three hours, and 2) food intake 1 hour following consumption of snacks.
