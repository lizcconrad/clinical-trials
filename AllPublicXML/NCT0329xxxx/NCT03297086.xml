  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate possible changes of angle kappa after multifocal
      intraocular lens implantation. Presumable influencing factors of postoperative visual axis
      shift (ie. biometric parameters of the eye) are investigated to determine the degree and
      direction of angle kappa alterations.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes of angle kappa after multifocal intraocular
      lens implantation.

      During cataract surgery Medicontur Bi-Flex 677MY IOL and Alcon Acrysof Restor SN6AD1 IOL are
      implanted. Optical biometry is carried out for IOL calculation and to measure axial length
      and angle kappa. Three months after surgery biometry is repeated, IOL position and angle
      kappa are measured using Scheimpflug-camera.

    <measure>Measurement of changes of angle kappa after multifocal intraocular lens implantation.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in magnitude and orientation of angle kappa (deviation between the visual and pupillary axis) are measured before and after cataract surgery with multifoocal intraocular lens implantation. During pre-and postoperative examination optical biometry is carried out using Lenstar LS 900. Optical biometer determines deviation between the visual and pupillary axis that represents angle kappa. Deviation of these axes can be defined by its magnitude and orientation. Location of the pupil centre relative to the visual axis - the reference axis - is determined by x- and y-offsets using trigonometrical analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biometry data (axial length, keratometry, lens thickness, anterior chamber depth) are measured preoperatively by Lenstar LS 900 optical biometer. Their effect on changes of angle kappa is determined using statistical analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of influencing effect of intraocular lens decentration on postoperative visual axis shift</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three months after cataract surgery postoperative intraocular lens (IOL) position is determined using a rotating Scheimpflug-camera (Galilei G4). IOL decentration is obtained from the distance between the IOL centre and visual axis. The effect of possible IOL decentration on changes of angle kappa is determined using statistical analysis.</description>
