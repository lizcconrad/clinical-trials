      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and blood kinetics of
      autologous T cells genetically modified to express CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor and PD-1
      knockout engineered T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin
      Lymphoma and Leukaemia.

      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) and PD-1
      knock out engineered T-cells (CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells) in children and
      adults (age &lt;70 years) with high risk, relapsed CD19+ haematological malignancies (Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma). Following informed consent and registration
      to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the
      CD19 CAR T-cells. Patients will receive the CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells
      following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      duration of response of the CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells in children with
      high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.
