  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to assess the efficacy of combined IDO and PD-1 inhibition in a single
      arm phase II trial of epacadostat and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced
      imatinib-refractory GIST, using a primary endpoint of overall response rate.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), the overall
      survival (OS), the response rate and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combined
      epacadostat and pembrolizumab treatment.

      The investigator hypothesizes that treatment with epacadostat and pembrolizumab will increase
      the response rate compared to what has been historically achieved with salvage tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While targeted therapy with imatinib has significantly improved survival for patients with
      inoperable and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), the majority will
      eventually progress after a median of 20-26 months. Standard second-line treatment with
      sunitinib has a response rate of 7%, and third-line treatment with regorafenib has a response
      rate of only 5%. More effective treatments for imatinib-refractory GIST are needed.

      This study aims to assess the efficacy of combined IDO and PD-1 inhibition with epacadostat
      (IDO inhibitor) and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) in patients with imatinib-refractory
      GIST.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the overall response rate as defined as the best response using RECIST v1.1 criteria. A standard way to measure how well a cancer patient responds to treatment. It is based on whether tumors shrink, stay the same, or get bigger. To use RECIST, there must be at least one tumor that can be measured on x-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans. The types of response a patient can have are a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), and stable disease (SD). Also called Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors.</description>

                  drug.

               -  All subjects must agree to pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies. Subjects in whom
                  biopsy is technically not feasible or in whom would result in unacceptable risk,
                  in the opinion of the investigator, may be exempted from the biopsy requirement
                  with discussion with the principal investigator. Use of outside archived tumor
                  tissue for a baseline biopsy is not permitted.

             inhibitor.

          -  Subjects who have received experimental vaccines or other immune therapies should be
             discussed with the principal investigator to confirm eligibility.

          -  Any prior ≥ Grade 3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) while receiving immunotherapy,
             or any unresolved irAE &gt; grade 1.

          -  Subjects receiving immunologically based treatment for any reason, including chronic
             steroids or prednisone (at dose &gt;10 mg/day of prednisone) within 14 day prior to first
             study treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids or systemic steroids (at dose ≤10 mg/day
             of prednisone) is permitted.

          -  Subjects with any active or inactive autoimmune process (eg, rheumatoid arthritis,
             moderate or severe psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease) or who
             are receiving systemic therapy for an autoimmune disease. Exceptions include vitiligo,
             hypothyroidism controlled on hormone replacement, type I diabetes, Grave's disease,
             adrenal insufficiency on stable replacement doses of steroids (prednisone ≤10 mg/day

             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in-situ carcinoma of the cervix, isolated
             elevation of prostate-specific antigen, indolent secondary malignancies not requiring
             active therapy, or with the approval of the principal investigator. Subjects with a

             eligible.

          -  Subjects with known active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection as defined
             by the following (Hepatitis screening studies are required:

               -  Positive test for hepatitis C antibody and/ or hepatitis C quantitative viral
                  load (Note: Subjects with a positive hepatitis C antibody and negative

             study.

          -  Subjects receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors within 21 days of study
             enrollment (epacadostat increases serotonin levels, theoretically increasing the risk
             of serotonin syndrome, although this has not been reported in any ongoing clinical
             studies to date).

          -  Any history of serotonin syndrome (SS) after receiving 1 or more serotonergic drugs.

          -  Current pregnancy or breast feeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because the teratogenicity of epacadostat and pembrolizumab are unknown. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab and/or epacadostat, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued in all female subjects.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccines (including, but not limited to: intranasal
             influenza vaccine (FluMist), measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever,
             rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine) within 30 days before the
             first dose of study treatment.

          -  Concurrent use of any medication that is an inhibitor of UGT1A9 during the screening
             or treatment period.

          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 14 days of initiating
             study drug or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the study.

          -  Inability to swallow capsules, or refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, an
             external biliary shunt, or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate
             absorption.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, active liver disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  History of current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the study, or interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the study.

          -  Known allergy or reaction to any component of either study drug formulation.
