    <textblock>
      Iodine ingestion insufficiency was widespread existence in the 50's in Taiwan, induced the
      hypothyroidism with the popular name &quot;the big neck&quot;. After many experts study and evaluation,
      goiter was gradually disappeared after salt adding iodine in the 60's. But the nodule of the
      thyroid gland was widespread on the Taiwan island. This situation was a particular victim in
      living in the mountainous area inhabitant. The middle area populaces suffer from the thyroid
      gland disease really popular than other areas. Recently literature reported that the cancer
      rate of thyroid gland rises gradually. In according to the statistics, thyroid cancer
      prevalence probably has 10% in the nodular goiter.

      The major early preliminary diagnosis of the thyroid cancer is thyroid fine-needle aspiration
      cytology (FNAC), but this technique must to have skilled clinical puncture's doctor and to
      have special training cytological pathology doctor. Therefore, if we can have simple fast
      screening tool and can make up this insufficiency, then we can achieved the fast diagnosis,
      rapid processing, the promotion diagnosis and treatment quality and promotes the survival
      percentage. The thyroid ultrasonography (Thyroid US) is one universal, fast, cheap, and the
      simple diagnosis nodular goiter tool. If we can friendly use this tool, we can early
      diagnosis &amp; management this disease.

      This research collect subjects from Jan 2002 to Dec 2016 under procedure of thyroid US, FNAC
      and thyroidectomy. Preliminary design index of thyroid gland tumor score (TTS) was to survey
      and analysis.

    <description>Enrolled subjects with nodular goiter had thyroid sonography and thyroidectomy from 2002 January to 2016 December in CMUH. Total enrolled subject about 2000. These subjects were confirmed by pathology. Each subject had been transverse and longitudinal views of thyroid ultrasonography with high-resolution ultrasound (7-14 MHz) (HP Image Point-HS, Toshiba SSA250, GE ,Aloka SSD-1200 and Siemens S2000) that was performed by our partners - endocrinologist in all patients. Gray scale ultrasonography was routinely performed in every subject. Color Doppler ultrasonography for blood flow and thyroid fine needle aspiration was not absolute done in routine procedure. All data at least was interpreted by 3 endocrinologists under the blind method. Each subject was analyzed under thyroid echogenicity, margin, calcification, inclusion, grooving change and size &amp; ratio size of tall and transverse.</description>
