  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Population in study will be selected from students and staff of the University of Pisa. Right
      carotid artery contour wave analysis will be performed during the application of different
      PEEP levels (from 0 cmH2O to 10 cmH2O) with applanation tonometry technique.

    <description>four-step measurements of central artery blood pressure evaluating contour wave analysis during a progressive increasing of PEEP level First step (Baseline) Subjects spontaneously breathe in air at atmospheric pressure during applanation tonometry.
Second step (PEEP=5 cm H2O) Applanation tonometry was performed during the application of PEEP = 5 cmH2O (Oxygen flow = 8lt.- Air flow = 10 lt.).
Third step (PEEP= 10 cm H2O) Applanation tonometry was performed during the application of PEEP = 10 cmH2O (Oxygen flow = 15lt.- Air flow = 20 lt.).
Fourth step (Recovery) Subjects spontaneously rebreathe air at atmospheric pressure during applanation tonometry.</description>
