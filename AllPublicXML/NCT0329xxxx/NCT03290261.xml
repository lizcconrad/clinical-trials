  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Half of the women present an episode of cystitis once in their lives. A recurrence occurs in
      about 20% to 30% of the patients, and half of these patients will make more than 4 episodes
      per year, defining recurrent cystitis (CR).

      Complications such as pyelonephritis are rare (less than 0.5% of patients in the absence of
      underlying complication), however, CRs are responsible for a significant impact on women but
      also on society. Pain is at the forefront, but also the fear of not managing pollakiuria,
      with its social exclusion. The impact on sexuality is major. The medical circuit imposed on
      the patients is long and arduous. The clinical assessment sometimes reveals favorable
      factors, variable in pre- or post-menopause, but in the majority of cases, no explanatory
      cause can resolve the problem and some authors suggest resignation as a classic reaction to
      this problem. The only study on psychological disorders associated with recurrent cystitis
      suggests patients who are much more anxious than the average of female.

      Hypnotherapy is an old technique, used for care in Western societies for at least two hundred
      years. By the word, the practitioner induces in the patient a particular state of
      consciousness characterized by an indifference on the outside and a hyper suggestibility.
      This &quot;hypnotic&quot; state of consciousness can be used to amplify the patient's internal
      resources to fight against anxiety and pain, and to eliminate symptoms.

      The physiological mechanisms at work in hypnosis are the subject of recent studies becoming
      more and more precise. The results of these studies made it possible to objectify changes in
      cerebral functioning related to hypnotic trance.

      A report by Inserm of 2015 confirms the effectiveness of this practice in hypnosedation,
      hypnoanalgesia and hypnotherapy, particularly in irritable bowel syndrome, although the
      methodology to be used in its evaluation is difficult and subjective. The principal
      investigator hypothesizes that the symptoms presented in recurrent cystitis (pain, anxiety)
      can be improved by hypnotherapy, and that thus the prognosis of this pathology can be totally
      modified.

      In the absence of any study published in the literature, the investigator propose an
      intervention pilot study with minimal risks and constraints monocentric prospective
      non-randomized prospectively in 15 patients.

      The main objective of this project is to demonstrate that hypnotherapy improves the
      psycho-emotional parameters of patients suffering from recurrent cystitis after 3 hypnosis
      sessions combined with home exercises performed by the patient. The evaluation will be
      carried out during the last session of hypnosis.
