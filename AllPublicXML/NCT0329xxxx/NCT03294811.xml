  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open randomized clinical trial with two study arms. One group, receiving usual
      care for heart failure, will be compared to another group, receiving usual care plus active
      telemonitoring interference.

      When leaving the hospital, the usual care arm receives a document with a predefined
      medication scheme and advice for the general practitioner (like it is currently done in usual
      care).

      The telemonitoring interference in the other study arm consists of a smartphone application
      to register medication intake and to transmit the data of an automatic blood pressure device
      and a balance to a central platform. The goal is to improve medication uptitration
      (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and bètablockers (BB)) in heart failure
      patients and to improve medication compliance.
