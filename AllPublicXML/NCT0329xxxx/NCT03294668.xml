      This study evaluates the KONTAKT social skills group training in Australian adolescents on
      the autism spectrum compared to an active control group which is a group cooking class

      KONTAKT is a manualized Social Skills Group Training program designed for children and
      adolescents with ASD which aims to improve communication, social interaction skills, reduce
      the severity of ASD symptoms, improve the ability to empathise and adapt in a group setting.
      A large randomized controlled trial in Sweden found that adolescents who participated in
      KONTAKT demonstrated improvements in social skills, behaviour, reduced stress and improved
      overall functioning as reported by parents immediately following and at three months after
      the program. However, social skills are at least in part influenced by social cultural
      contexts and there is a need to understand the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness
      of KONTAKT in an Australian context. Moreover, in the previous studies, the social skills
      groups were compared to treatment as usual groups. Therefore, this study evaluates the
      KONTAKT social skills group training in Australian adolescents on the autism spectrum
      compared to an active control group which is a group cooking class

    <description>The GOAL Attainment Scale will be used as the adolescents' primary outcome. Using the scale the participants personally meaningful social goals will be specified, and a behavioural expectation that ranges from the worst to the best possible outcome will be listed for each goal. This allows qualitative data to be quantified in relation to the success of the participant in achieving expectations of change.</description>
