  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well contrast-enhanced subharmonic ultrasound imaging
      works in improving the characterization of adnexal masses in patients undergoing surgery.
      Contrast-enhanced subharmonic ultrasound imaging uses high-frequency sound waves to produce
      images of internal organs and when combined with an ultrasound agent such as perflutren lipid
      microspheres, may help improve imaging and management of adnexal masses.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop qualitative subharmonic imaging (SHI) or SHI-derived quantitative biomarkers.

      II. To generate pilot data for a study to evaluate if they improve the characterization of
      benign and malignant adnexal masses compared to standard ultrasound or contrast enhanced
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or the risk of malignancy index (RMI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the SHI depiction of adnexal masses' neovascularity in humans to intra-tumoral
      microvascular density (iMVD) obtained from CD31 an immunohistochemical marker of
      angiogenesis.
