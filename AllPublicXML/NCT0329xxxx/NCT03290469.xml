  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-site, study to evaluate the clinical utility of cWGS in a proband. One
      group will receive cWGS and a clinical report approximately 15 days after blood samples are
      received, while the other group will continue to receive standard of care until Day 60. The
      standard of care group will receive cWGS and a clinical report at Day 60 as part of secondary
      and tertiary analyses. Both groups will be followed for a total of 90 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site, randomized study to evaluate the clinical utility of cWGS
      in each proband. Throughout this study, each proband will receive SOC testing as determined
      by the site clinical team. Upon enrollment in the study, each proband will be randomly
      assigned to the 15 day cWGS group or the SOC group. SOC is defined as the management of the
      proband's care under the same or similar conditions as if the proband was not enrolled in
      this study. A blood sample from each enrolled proband will be collected and shipped to the
      Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory (&quot;ICSL&quot;), which is Clinical Laboratory Improvement
      Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited. ICSL will
      conduct cWGS testing with the TruGenome Undiagnosed Disease Test (&quot;TruGenome Test&quot;). The
      TruGenome Test cWGS results will be provided to the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee
      who will evaluate each proband test outcome based on the aggregate medical information,
      informed by the cWGS or SOC results.

        Proband Inclusion Criteria

          1. Current admission in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit/Intensive Care Unit at a
             participating clinical site at the time of enrollment from day of life 0 to 120 days

          2. A suspected genetic etiology of disease, based on objective clinical findings or other
             phenotypic defects for which a genetic test would be considered

          3. Must be able to have 1 - 1.25 ml tube of whole blood drawn for testing

          4. One parent of the proband must be able to provide written informed consent

          5. At least one biological parent must agree to participate and provide at least 4 ml of
             whole blood for testing

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Proband Exclusion Criteria

          1. Known non-genetic cause(s) of disease, disorder, or phenotypic defect

          2. The phenotype is fully explained by complications of prematurity

          3. Trisomy 13, 18 or 21 or Turner Syndrome is the likely diagnosis; such a proband will
             be eligible if a diagnostic karyotype is normal

          4. Blood transfusion within 48 hours (each proband will be re-eligible 48 hours after the
             most recent transfusion)

          5. The PI decides that the study is not in the best interest of the proband (for example,
             the neonate or infant is at a high risk of severe morbidity or mortality within the
             next 7 days and these risks could be mitigated by alternative testing). Subsequent
             eligibility for enrollment of each proband is at the discretion of the site PI.
