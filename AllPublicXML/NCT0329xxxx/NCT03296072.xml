    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled, single center, single- blind, 3 period, 3 treatment,
      cross-over, in situ design which consists of placing pre-eroded bovine enamel specimens intra
      orally using a palatal appliance and testing the remineralizing performance of the
      experimental (dentifrice containing 0.254 Percent weight by weight [%, w/w] sodium fluoride
      (1150 parts per million [ppm] fluoride) and 5% KNO3 [potassium nitrate]), comparator
      (dentifrice containing 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride (1100 ppm fluoride) and placebo (Fluoride
      free placebo containing 5% KNO3 [0 ppm fluoride] ) dentifrices 2 and 4 hours (hrs) post
      treatment application, based on surface micro hardness measurements. This study will be
      carried out in healthy adults with a maxillary dental arch suitable for the retention of the
      palatal appliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of an experimental dentifrice
      formulation in promoting enamel remineralization and inhibiting post-treatment enamel
      demineralization in an in situ erosion model, in comparison with a fluoride-free placebo and
      with a marketed competitor dentifrice product. The study will have 4 visits, 1 screening
      visit to assess participants eligibility and 3 treatment visits to assess product efficacy,
      where the treatment product will be dispensed and used under the supervision of a suitably
      trained study site personnel. Prior to each treatment visit, there will be a washout period
      of a minimum of 3 days. During this period participants will use their own dentifrice for at
      least one day, and a fluoride free dentifrice (provided) for two days prior to the next
      scheduled visit (including in the morning of the scheduled visit) to minimize any carry-over
      effects of the fluoride toothpaste.

    <time_frame>After 4 hrs following single exposure of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of remineralization will be calculated as the % recovery in surface micro hardness (SMH), which will be calculated from the enamel indentation length at baseline, after the first erosive challenge and after the in situ remineral-ization phase after 4 hrs of intraoral phase.</description>

    <time_frame>After 4 hrs following single exposure of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The %RER will be calculated based on the indentation length at baseline, after the first and the second erosive challenge after 4 hrs. This will determine whether the formulations prevents enamel demineralization after the 4 hours intra oral remineralization phase as per a second erosion challenge.</description>

    <description>EFU will be assessed by the microdrill enamel biopsy, and will be determined after 4 hrs in situ remineralization period but before the second extra-oral erosive challenge. This measurement will provide with micrograms of fluoride per square centimeter (μg F/cm).</description>
