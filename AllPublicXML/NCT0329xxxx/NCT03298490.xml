      Low back pain (LBP) is defined as the pain that occurs in the area between the lower border
      of the scapula and the buttocks and sometimes radiates to the lower extremities. In the
      community, lower back pain is the second most common health problem after cold. 15% of LBP
      cases are chronic. Appropriate use of assessment questionnaires is one of the most important
      steps in the evaluation of the functional level of the patient and in deciding on an
      effective treatment protocol. The purpose of study is to determine the Turkish version,
      validity and reliability of Back Performance Scale. 180 patients with chronic low back pain
      were included in the study. Test-retest and internal consistency analysis were conducted to
      determine the reliability of the questionnaire. Test-retest results evaluated using the
      Intraclass Correlation Coefficient method.
