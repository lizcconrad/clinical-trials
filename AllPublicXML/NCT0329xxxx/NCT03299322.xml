      Investigators aimed to assess Jia Wei Yang He Formula as a plus therapy in the treatment of
      persistent asthma and to explore Airway Microbiome variation of Asthma by Traditional Chinese
      Medicine treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory respiratory disease, patients showed high airway
      reactivity, and the clinical manifestations of recurrent wheezing, shortness of breath, chest
      tightness or cough with wheezing dyspnea mainly for a breath. Although many studies have
      shown that viral infections may be an important cause of asthma seasonal attacks. However,
      more and more studies have shown that bacterial infection is an important risk factor for
      asthma. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Mora bacteria infection may increase the risk of
      asthma by a research report.

      Chinese medicine decoction, as a common treatment for asthma, can significantly alleviate
      seasonal attacks and reduce the number of acute attacks. Research shows that Chinese medicine
      has widely immunomodulatory effects and imbalance of immune system in patients with asthma
      control, improve the cellular immunity of patients with airway and defense function,
      significantly reduced asthma attacks of which induced by upper airway infection or chronic
      persist asthma.

      This study will be conducted for 4 weeks of standard anti-asthma treatment plus Jia Wei Yang
      He Formula for patients.Some patients are not willing to use standard treatment such as
      inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-adrenoceptor agonists because of side effects. We
      will provide these patients free JWYH formula after the efficacy of the JWYH is validated and
      the subsequent results are considered exploratory.

      Participants will undergo a physical examination, lung function, blood and sputum collection
      and all induced sputum samples will be detected by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing
      and analyzed for microbial bioinformatics. To study whether there is association between the
      efficacy of Jia Wei Yang He Formula and the changes in microbiota composition.
