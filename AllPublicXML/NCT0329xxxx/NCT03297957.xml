  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluorescent technology continues to advance in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).
      Currently, this requires switching from near-infrared light to white light to be able to
      identify the fluorescent tissue contrasting with normal surrounding tissue. Currently, no
      system has been studied specifically for head and neck sentinel lymph node biopsies using a
      hands free goggle system that can visualize white light (normal surgical visualization) and
      nearinfrared light (ICG fluorescence) simultaneously. This technology may have implications
      on the safety and accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy for head and neck mucosal and
      cutaneous tumors. Secondarily, this may reduce operative costs by decreasing the amount of
      time required to perform the SLNB procedure.

    <description>The patient will then be taken to the operating room, without deviating from normal operating procedures for this surgical procedure. Prior to starting the operation, the patient will undergo injection of ICG around the tumor per standard techniques while in the operating room
Patients will then undergo the standard SLN biopsy procedure.
After gamma probe and methylene blue identification of the SLN as per standard of care, the surgeon will put on the goggle system to attempt to identify the SLN using fluorescence guidance. After this is performed, the goggle system will be removed and the SLN biopsy will be completed per standard techniques. Lymph nodes that are fluorescent from ICG detected with the goggles will also be removed if the node identified in the dissected nodal basin. All three visualizations will be performed prior to removal and the nodes will then be sent for pathologic confirmation of node positivity or negativity.</description>
