  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the investigator's previous data on risk classification for acute leukemia,the
      investigators will design a set of panels to detect the gene expression and genomic variants
      (SNPs, mutation, insertion, deletion and fusion genes, etc), and identify the high-risk
      subtypes of acute leukemia, such as Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Furthermore, the
      target therapy (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors,et.al) will be used to treat the identified
      patients. In addition, more sensitive minimal residual disease (MRD) detection technology
      will be designed and used to detect the MRD in patients to early predict the disease relapse.
