      All study objectives will be assessed in HCC patients or colorectal cancer patients with
      secondary metastases in the liver, respectively.

        1. Primary objective:

             -  To observe the safety of SIR-Spheres® microspheres therapy (SIRT)by,

                  -  Adverse events and serious adverse events (non-specific and radiation
                     specific)

                  -  Changes in liver function parameters

             -  To observe the efficacy of SIR-Spheres® microspheres therapy by, assessing the best
                overall response rate after SIRT

        2. Secondary objectives:

             -  To observe the efficacy of SIRT by,

                  -  Overall survival (OS)

                  -  Overall/objective response rate (ORR)

                  -  Time-to-progression

                  -  Time-to-liver progression

                  -  Progression-free survival

             -  To observe the changes in clinical presentation after SIRT by,

                  -  ECOG score

                  -  Child-Pugh score

                  -  Percentage of subjects with down-staging or down-sizing of treated lesion to
                     resection, transplantation, or radiofrequency ablation (RFA)

             -  To observe the practice pattern of SIRT by,

                  -  Median dosage (GBq)

                  -  Number of SIRT sessions received by subjects

        3. Exploratory objectives:

             -  To explore prognostic factors for disease progression after SIRT by comparing the
                following parameters:

                  -  Number of tumors in subjects prior to SIRT

                  -  Median tumor size in subjects prior to SIRT

                  -  Location of tumor in subjects treated with SIRT (hepatic segment or lobe)

                  -  Number of prior TACE treatment in subjects

                  -  Antiviral therapy subjects HCC
