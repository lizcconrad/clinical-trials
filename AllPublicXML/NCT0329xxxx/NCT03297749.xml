  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the systemic impact of periodontitis in patients with
      Metabolic Syndrome, by assessing measures of sub-clinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
      risk, microbial factors and host genetic variants, and to study the possible effect of
      mediators of inflammation and oxidative stress as links between the two conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study. 102 patients with metabolic syndrome will be recruited and
      will have periodontal and dental examination for diagnosis of caries and periodontal
      diseases. They will undergo blood, saliva, GCF and subgingival plaque sampling and a series
      of tests on cardiovascular disease, including measures of pulse-wave velocity,carotid
      intima-media thickness and echocardiography assessment. Statistical analysis will assess
      associations between dental diagnoses and metabolic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, genetic,
      microbial and cardiovascular risk outcomes.
