    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the neuromodulatory effect of combined tDCS and aphasia therapy in
      patients in the acute stage after stroke. Half of the participants will receive aphasia
      therapy and tDCS, the other half will receive aphasia therapy and sham-tDCS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is present in about one third of all stroke patients in the acute phase. The first
      few months after stroke, considerable spontaneous recovery is initiated, including neuronal
      plasticity and reorganization processes. Language recovery in aphasic stroke patients
      involves reorganization of brain functions. Longitudinal fMRI studies reveal that the right
      hemisphere shows increased activity at different times in the recovery process, but in the
      long-term is correlated with poorer performance. Left re-lateralization, if possible, seems
      to be the most effective in restoring language function. For a large subgroup of patients,
      aphasia therapy is not sufficient to resolve language deficits and not all patients are
      capable to endure intensive aphasia therapy. Therefore, non-invasive techniques (NIBS) such
      as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are currently explored as an add-on
      treatment to improve or accelerate therapy outcomes. tDCS is a painless and safe stimulation
      tool that modulates cortical excitability through weak polarizing currents (1 mA - 2 mA)
      between two electrodes. These weak currents are thought to induce a subthreshold shift of
      resting membrane potentials towards depolarization or hyperpolarization. The effects of
      stimulation depend on the polarity of the applied current relative to the axonal orientation.
      It has been found that tDCS not only triggers immediate aftereffects, but also long-lasting
      effects that persist beyond the stimulation time, even for up to 12 months. It was suggested
      that long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) might be responsible for
      these long-term effects, however the precise physiologic mechanisms of action are not yet
      fully understood.
