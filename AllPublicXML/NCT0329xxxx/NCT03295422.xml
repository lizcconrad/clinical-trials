    <textblock>
      Investigator initiated, randomized controlled trial of two radiofrequency (RF)ablation
      protocols currently performed in the electrophysiology lab, but have not been studied
      prospectively to identify which, if either technique, is superior for individuals with
      persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Two-hundred subjects will be consecutively enrolled and
      randomized to either pulmonary vein isolation only or pulmonary vein isolation plus posterior
      left atrial wall isolation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation, the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, affects
      approximately 2.7 million U.S. adults. Percutaneous catheter ablation is an effective
      treatment option for individuals with persistent AF. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has
      emerged as the gold standard for paroxysmal AF with excellent success rates, however,
      individuals with persistent AF procedural efficacy from pulmonary vein isolation is not
      optimal. Therefore, improved ablation strategies for these individuals are needed.

      This randomized controlled trial will compare two radiofrequency ablation strategies, PVI
      alone and pulmonary vein isolation plus left posterior atrial wall (LPAW) isolation in
      individuals with persistent AF. Both strategies are currently used to treat persistent AF,
      but no randomized controlled trial ahs been conducted to investigate which strategy is more
      efficacious.

      Two-hundred subjects will be randomized into groups of 100 to undergo a radiofrequency
      ablation procedure for AF. For group 1, a series of radiofrequency applications will be
      delivered around both sets of pulmonary veins. For group 2, a series of radiofrequency
      applications will be delivered around both sets of pulmonary veins and along a roof and low
      posterior line of the left atrial wall.

      All subjects will be followed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post ablation. If
      indicated, antiarrhythmic drugs will be discontinued. For the first month, subjects will
      receive a continuously recording electrocardiogram heart card to monitor for AF, and then
      two-week ambulatory monitors at 3 months and one year post ablation.

    <description>A series of RF applications will be delivered around both sets of pulmonary veins with complete entry and exit block obtained around the antrums of all 4 pulmonary veins. In addition, a roof and posterior line will be placed in the left atrium to achieve entrance and exit block on the posterior wall. Entry block will be confirmed by placing a circular mapping catheter in multiple locations along the posterior wall and confirming lack of presence of any local potentials. Exit block will be confirmed on the posterior wall with pacing at 10 amps from the ablation catheter at multiple locations within the box as well as all lines.</description>
