  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled trial. Approximately 330
      eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups as shown in
      the Trial Design table below. Each group will consist of approximately 110 subjects total,
      stratified by age, gender, and history of receipt of 2016 - 17 influenza vaccine. On Day 0,
      subjects in Groups A and B will be administered an IM injection of NanoFlu at one of two dose
      levels; subjects in Group C will receive the preconfigured comparator (Fluzone HD) at the
      manufacturer's recommended dose and volume. On Day 21, all Group A and B subjects will be
      administered a rescue injection with a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine, while all Group C
      subjects will be administered an injection with sterile saline placebo to maintain trial
      blind. Trial follow-up for each subject will span approximately 1 year from the Day 0.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy older adults, male or female,

          2. Willing and able to give informed consent prior to trial enrollment, and

          3. Able to attend trial visits, comply with trial requirements, and provide reliable and
             complete reports of adverse events.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any ongoing, symptomatic acute or chronic illness requiring medical or surgical care.

               -  Asymptomatic chronic conditions or findings (eg, mild hypertension, dyslipidemia)
                  that are not associated with evidence of end-organ damage are not exclusionary
                  provided that they are being appropriately managed and are clinically stable (ie,
                  unlikely to result in symptomatic illness within the time-course of this trial)
                  in the opinion of the investigator.

               -  Acute or chronic illnesses or conditions which may be reasonably predicted to
                  become symptomatic if treatment were withdrawn or interrupted are exclusionary,
                  even if stable.

               -  Acute or chronic illnesses reasonably expected to be associated with increased
                  risks in the event of influenza infection (eg, cardio-pulmonary diseases,
                  diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies) are
                  exclusionary, even if stable.

               -  Note that illnesses or conditions may be exclusionary, even if otherwise stable,
                  due to therapies used to treat them (see exclusion criteria 2, 5, 8, 9).

          2. Participation in research involving investigational product (drug / biologic / device)
             within 45 days before planned date of first injection.

          3. History of a serious reaction to prior influenza vaccination, or known allergy to
             constituents of influenza vaccines - including egg proteins - or polysorbate 80.

          4. History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks following a previous influenza
             vaccine.

          5. Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination and any
             influenza vaccine within 6 months preceding the trial vaccination.

          6. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive illness, congenital or acquired, based on
             medical history and/or physical examination.

          7. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the
             trial vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a
             systemic dose ≥ 10 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical,
             inhaled, and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.

          8. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the trial vaccine or during the trial.

          9. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature &gt; 38.0°C, on the planned
             day of vaccine administration).

         10. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or
             interpretation of trial results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions deemed
             likely to impair the quality of safety reporting).

         11. Known disturbance of coagulation.

         12. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or
             other substance abuse.
