  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose, Phase 1 study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      intravenous (IV) MK-3866 in participants with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (HI)
      compared to that of matched healthy participants. The primary purpose of this study is to
      understand the effect of HI on the plasma PK of MK-3866 in order to guide dosing
      recommendations for participants with HI. This study will also evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MK-3866 in participants with moderate and severe HI.
