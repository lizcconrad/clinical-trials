  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LEEP conization is commonly used for cervical pathologies treatment. The techniques for
      hemostasis usually used are: cautery, Monsel's solution and vaginal pack. Actually, there is
      no consensus about the best technique and there is not much information that validates the
      use of some of that. To compare the use or not of vaginal pack as methods of hemostasis after
      LEEP conization for management of cervical lesions.

      A randomized clinical trial was conducted at Gynecology Oncology Department/Barretos Cancer
      Hospital for patients with indication of LEEP conization. After local IRB approval, patients
      were allocated in two arms (50 patients each): without vaginal pack (group 1 - GP1) and with
      vaginal pack (group 2 - GP2). The Monsel's solution was used in all patients. Intraoperative
      and postoperative outcomes will be evaluated: operative time, intraoperative and
      postoperative bleeding, hormonal status, age, parity and cone specimens' characteristics as
      well as short-term outcome were recorded and compared using Chi-square test, Fisher exact
      test and t-test where appropriate.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were allocated in two arms (50 patients each): without vaginal pack (group 1 - GP1) and with vaginal pack (group 2 - GP2).Randomization was generated through a computer program creating a random entry list in the study, separating in group 1 (local application of Monsel's solution without intra-vaginal gauze buffer) and group 2 (application of Monsel's solution with intra-vaginal gauze). In this way, all patients had an equal chance of being included in both groups.</intervention_model_description>
