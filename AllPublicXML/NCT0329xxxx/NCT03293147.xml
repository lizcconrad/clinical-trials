  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment is one of the leading causes of suboptimal blood
      pressure control and translates into increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Currently, there is no effective intervention for therapeutic non-adherence. Our
      project will assess whether high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
      (HPLC-MS/MS)-guided intervention (providing patients with information on the results of their
      HPLC-MS/MS-based urine analysis combined with targeting the main reason for non-adherence)
      leads to an improvement in blood pressure control, adherence and a reduction in healthcare
      costs. Our multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial consists of 6 stages
      (screening, recruitment, baseline phenotype assessment, intervention, short-term and
      long-term outcome visits). The study will fill in an important gap in knowledge on management
      of blood pressure in non-adherent hypertensive patients beyond the initial diagnostic step.
      It will also inform the development of a cost-effective model for the management of
      non-adherence in chronic disorders that require long-term drug therapy.

    <textblock>
      Non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment is one of the leading causes of suboptimal blood
      pressure control and translates into increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Currently, there is no effective intervention for therapeutic non-adherence.

      An ultra-sensitive and highly specific biochemical assay has been developed to detect urinary
      biomarkers of antihypertensive treatment. The high performance liquid chromatography mass
      spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS)-based assay screens spot urine samples for the presence of 40
      commonly prescribed blood pressure lowering medications. The results of the test provide a
      clinician with information on the presence/absence of prescribed antihypertensive drugs
      or/and their metabolites in urine - a direct confirmation of therapeutic
      adherence/non-adherence.

      The study is a prospective multi-centre randomised controlled trial to examine if
      HPLC-MS/MS-guided intervention is superior to standard clinical care in improving clinical,
      behavioural and health-economy outcomes in hypertensive patients who are non-adherent to
      antihypertensive treatment.

      Patient adherence to antihypertensive treatment will be determined at baseline. Non-adherent
      hypertensive patients at baseline will be randomised in a 1:1 ration to either usual clinical
      care plus HPLC-MS/MS-guided intervention (Arm A) or usual clinical care only (Arm B).

      The study also evaluates a cohort of patients who are adherent to antihypertensive treatment
      at baseline. Those adherent hypertensive patients will receive the usual clinical care (Arm
      C). The main purpose of involving this group of patients is to blind the clinical research
      staff to the adherence status of those patients randomised receiving standard care alone, to
      prevent introducing any bias in treating non-adherent patients.

    <masking_description>Participants and clinicians will initially be blinded to the result of the baseline (at trial entry) HPLC-MS/MS based urine test to determine the participant adherence to antihypertensive treatment.
Non-adherent patients allocated to Arm A will be un-blinded at the stage of visit 3 where the results of their HPLC-MS/MS urine test will be revealed to them as a part of HPLC-MS/MS-guided intervention. The doctor will also require un-blinding to provide the required intervention. However, during further study visits the research personnel will remain blinded as to the adherence status of these patients, the results of their HPLC-MS/MS-based analysis and the treatment allocation. The doctor who delivers the intervention will not be involved in collecting clinical information necessary to define outcomes during appointments 4 and 5.
Hypertensive patients randomised to Arms B and C will remain blinded to the results of their HPLC-MS/MS-based urine test throughout all stages of the study.</masking_description>
