  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to investigate whether administration of oral baclofen forms an adequate
      treatment option in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal. The investigators will
      compare placebo with doses of baclofen 30 and 60 milligram per day (mg/day) in a randomized
      controlled trial including patients receiving symptom triggered diazepam.

      The conducted study will be randomized and single-blind (patients). After signing informed
      consent, the participants will be randomized in one of three groups: - placebo - baclofen 30
      mg/day - baclofen 60 mg/day. The participants will be given a first administration after
      which the participant can receive Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA-ar) score
      triggered diazepam, frequently assessed for at least 7 days. The primary outcome measure is
      the number of participants who received additional diazepam during these 7 days. The
      secondary outcome measure is the amount of diazepam received per group.
