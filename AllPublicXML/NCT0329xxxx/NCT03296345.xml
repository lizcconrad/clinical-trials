  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) in sickle cell disease (SCD) are primarily managed with
      opioids. Tolerance and hyperalgesia to opioids develops due to N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA)-receptor mediated activation of the nociceptive system, and as a receptor antagonist,
      ketamine mitigates this. Intravenous (IV) ketamine has demonstrated efficacy in reducing
      post-operative, chronic, and cancer-related pain in pediatrics, as well as in reducing time
      to pain control in the emergency department (ED) in adults. Limited studies suggest efficacy
      in adult opioid-refractory SCD patients. This study is investigating the safety and
      tolerability of adjuvant low-dose IV ketamine bolus for pediatric SCD VOE in the ED, as well
      as its efficacy in improving pain control and reducing hospitalization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this cohort study, all consenting pediatric sickle-cell patients between 10 and 25 years
      old who are cared for at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (UCSFBCHO) presenting to
      the emergency department for VOC will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be compared to
      themselves in a time series, pre and post exposure to the study intervention (low-dose
      ketamine bolus at 0.2 mg/kg x 1 prior to second dose of IV opiate) The pediatric FACES pain
      scale will be used to measure pain scales at pre-designated time points in the ED per
      standard nursing protocol (FACES for younger kids, visual analog scale in adolescents/young
      adults). Opiate usage will be summed in the ED, converted to mg/kg/hour of morphine
      equivalents (since different opiate agents are given to different patients based on
      individual historical efficacy, and since length of stay in the emergency room could affect
      total morphine equivalents received), and compared between the pre and post-intervention
      groups. In addition, the proportion of discharged vs admitted patients, pain scores at
      admission, during the visit, and discharge, and proportion of patients re-presenting for
      care, will all be compared in the pre and post intervention groups. Data will be collected
      via chart review in the UCSFBCHO system by study investigators. Pre-intervention data from
      the past three patient encounters (e.g., the mean of the mg/kg/hour of morphine equivalents
      used in the last three patient encounters prior to receipt of ketamine) will be compared to
      the post intervention data. In addition, a survey, which is attached, will be given to
      patients/families at the time of the drug administration to attempt to discern if patients
      subjectively experienced improvement in their pain and if they experienced any negative side
      effects due to the drug administration.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events are defined as cardiorespiratory events requiring intervention. Minor adverse events are defined as nausea/vomiting, emergence reaction (dysphoria; hallucinations; frightening dreams), and a sense of de-realization or &quot;dreamy&quot; sensation. The incidence of treatment-emergence adverse events will be expressed in percentages and reviewed by our DSMB and IRB, in comparison to the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events published in the adult literature (none currently exists in the pediatric literature for comparison). Both study providers and patients themselves, via a survey that the parent and/or patient (based on age) fills out post receipt of ketamine, will report serious and minor adverse events. Per the decision of the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital and Research Center of Oakland IRB and Research Committee, at least 30 patients are required to complete this outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of low-dose ketamine on opiate usage in the ED</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Opiate usage for at least one but up to as many available prior patient visits in the last one year for each patient enrolled in the study will be summarized, expressed as morphine equivalents in mg/kg/h, to account for different types of opiates used per patient preference and time spent in the ED. This will be compared via a t-test to determine if a significant difference exists pre and post intervention with ketamine. To detect a 20% difference, 90 patients must be enrolled.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of low-dose ketamine on pain scores in the ED</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient pain scores at presentation, discharge from the ED/admission to the hospital, and time to 50% pain reduction in minutes for at least one but up to as many patient encounters prior to receipt of ketamine in the last one year, will be assessed. Pain scores and time to pain reduction as above will be compared via a t-test pre and post receipt of ketamine.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of low-dose ketamine on hospitalization and discharge rates from the ED</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The average hospitalization and discharge rates, expressed as percentages, for all patients in the study pre and post receipt of ketamine will be calculated. These will be compared via a t-test to determine if a significant difference exists.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective effect of low dose ketamine on pain relief assessed via a patient survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>After receipt of ketamine, patients and/or their parents, based on age, will fill out a survey based on a Likert scale regarding their agreement with the following questions: if ketamine relieved their pain faster, if ketamine relieved their pain more completely, and if they would like to receive ketamine for a future vaso-occlusive crisis. There is also an area where patients can provide general comments regarding their experience in receiving ketamine.</description>

    <description>Prior to the second dose of IV opiates, the experiment will be to give patients a single IV bolus of ketamine at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Pain scores will be collected using the FACES scale currently in place. In consenting patients, chart review will be performed with the following data being collected: mg/kg/hour of morphine equivalents, pain scores on admission, during the encounter, and at discharge, the time to 50% pain reduction, whether or not the patient was discharged, and if re-presentation occurred in the subsequent 3 months.
In addition, a survey, which is attached, will be given to patients/families at the time of drug administration to determine if they experienced a subjective improvement in their pain and if they suffered any undue side effects due to drug administration.</description>

Patients are allowed to re-enroll 4 weeks after presentation, which is typically considered a second vaso-occlusive crisis in the literature.</description>
