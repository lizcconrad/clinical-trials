  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of three experimental antibiotics in the treatment of
      uncomplicated anogenital gonorrhoea. The participants will be divided in four groups and will
      receive either one of the three experimental antibiotics (ertapenem, fosfomycin and
      gentamicin) or the current standard antibiotic (ceftriaxone). Both the study team and the
      participant are blinded to the administered treatment. This enables the investigators to
      compare the eradication capacity and safety of the experimental antibiotics with the standard
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to extended spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) among Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae (Ng) is a major public health concern. With no alternative antimicrobial
      treatment options for gonorrhoea and only a few new drugs in the development pipeline, it is
      important to test existing antibiotics for their efficacy in gonorrhoea treatment. This
      project aims to identify new treatment modalities for uncomplicated gonorrhoea using the
      registered drugs ertapenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. This trial is a double blind
      randomized clinical non-inferiority trial with four treatment arms. Fivehunderd forty-eight
      participants are randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms. Participants will receive
      either ceftriaxone 500mg intramuscularly (IM) or ertapenem 1000mg IM or gentamicin 5mg/kg IM
      with a maximum of 400mg (in two doses) supplemented with an oral placebo, or receive
      fosfomycin 6g oral suspension supplemented with an intramuscular placebo. The bacterial
      eradication capacity of the study antimicrobials at the included infection site is measured
      7-14 days after treatment, using an RNA-based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT).
