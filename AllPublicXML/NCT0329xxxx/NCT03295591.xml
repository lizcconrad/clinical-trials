  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resection of liver metastasis is potentially curative in patients with colorectal cancer
      bearing liver metastasis. However, early recurrence occurs in up to 30% in 3 months after
      liver resection. To optimize patient selection, the investigators propose to evaluate the the
      value of incorporating circulating tumor cells enumeration to clinical factors in a
      prospective study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center prospective study to evaluate the predictive value of circulating
      tumor cells (CTC) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are planned to have
      curative resection of liver metastasis. Blood will be taken from patients within 7 days
      before liver resection. CTC enumeration is done by a highly-sensitive microfluidic platform
      for which CTC can be subsequently enumerated with or without sequencing performed. Patients
      are then followed up regularly with contrast CT scan for recurrence. The primary study
      endpoint is to define the cutoff value of CTC count in patients with early relapse &lt; 6months
      after liver resection. Seventy-seven patients will be recruited in 24 months.
