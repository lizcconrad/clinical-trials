  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community walking is an issue that older adults with chronic conditions have described as
      important to participation in the community. Walking outside the home is a universally
      accessible form of physical activity that has multiple health benefits. Walking for 150
      minutes per week can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke,
      diabetes, osteoporosis, and depression, as well as falls. Practice walking across roads,
      slopes and curbs, while talking, and dealing with crowds and traffic, is safe and feasible
      and can improve confidence, balance and walking ability. Being physically active outdoors in
      nature appears to improve mental health more than being active indoors. Despite these health
      benefits, the majority of older Canadians do not walk outside on a regular basis. Barriers to
      walking outside include fear, physical disability due to chronic disease, the appropriateness
      of footwear and walking aids, and the physical environment, such as uneven pavement, weather
      and temperature. To date, the best strategy for getting people to walk outdoors regularly is
      unknown. The investigators propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a dynamic 1-day workshop,
      at which older adults who infrequently walk outdoors learn strategies to facilitate outdoor
      walking, such as appropriate use of footwear, ambulatory aids and equipment, goal setting,
      and practice skills related to increasing outdoor walking. The workshop will be compared to
      the workshop plus involvement in a walking group for 3 months. Outcomes include outdoor
      walking activity, total physical activity, walking ability, participation, and health-related
      quality of life. Each participant will have three evaluations: before the intervention and 3
      and 6 months later. The investigators will interview select participants at 6 months to ask
      them about their opinions of what worked and didn't work. Increasing outdoor walking is
      expected to improve health and well-being, and help people live independently in the
      community for longer.

      Background: Inability to walk outdoors restricts full participation in physical activity and
      community living for older adults that can reduce health-related quality of life (HRQL).
      Older adults report limited outdoor walking with only 8% achieving the Canadian
      recommendation for older adults of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous (MV) intensity
      physical activity per week. Known barriers to walking outside include fear, physical
      disability due to chronic disease, the appropriateness of footwear and walking aids, the
      physical environment, weather and temperature. Group practice walking outdoors in locations
      with variable environmental challenges has the potential to improve physical ability,
      confidence, outdoor and overall physical activity and social participation. The extent to
      which it is safe and feasible to implement this intervention in people with varying degrees
      of physical ability, preferences for where to walk, neighbourhood walkability, and to measure
      outdoor walking activity, is unclear.

      Objectives: In older adults with a limitation in outdoor community mobility:

        1. To estimate the extent to which a 1-day educational workshop and 3-month outdoor
           mobility program (GO-OUT intervention) compared to the workshop and weekly reminders
           improves outdoor walking activity (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes of physical
           activity, lifespace mobility, participation, HRQL, balance, leg strength, walking
           self-efficacy, walking speed, walking distance/endurance, and mood over 12 months.

        2. To explore participants' perceptions of intended and unintended consequences of the
           interventions, potent intervention components, mechanisms of effect, modifying
           influences of disability level, sex,neighbourhood walkability, weather, car access, and
           study site, and recommendations for future program delivery models.

      Approaches and Methods:Study Design: A 2-group mixed methods stratified randomized controlled
      trial following CONSORT55 criteria is proposed. Group allocation will be concealed and
      outcome evaluation blinded. The trial will be run at 4 sites (Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto,
      Montreal) to accrue a sufficient sample size, optimize the external validity of the results
      to urban centres variable in population size, weather conditions, and environmental barriers,
      and build capacity across 4 provinces to support potential implementation.10 Following a
      baseline assessment, eligible participants will be stratified by site, and randomly assigned
      to receive the 1-day educational workshop and 3-month outdoor mobility program (GO-OUT
      intervention) or the 1-day workshop plus reminders. Follow-up evaluations will occur at 3, 5
      and 12 months from baseline. A sub-sample of participants from the GO-OUT and workshop groups
      at each site will participate in face-to-face interviews at 6 and 12 months to explore their
      experiences. Interventions and assessments are designed to be implemented in 'good weather'
      months, to avoid the potential negative effect of season on the primary outcome of outdoor
      walking activity.

    <description>The 1-day workshop will be 5 hours with breaks. Participants will complete a series of stations learning information, strategies and skills related to safely walking outdoors. Stations include: pedometer use; walking pole use; footwear; footcare; fall prevention; balance exercises; proper use of walking aids; correct posture; self-management of exercise intensity; goal setting; and walking safely outdoors. Participants will receive a workbook with Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines, benefits of outdoor walking, information for each workshop station and a pedometer. Participants will use the workbook as an information resource and to record their community ambulation goals, planning routes, and walking time. All participants will be encouraged to walk outside with a partner, for safety.</description>
