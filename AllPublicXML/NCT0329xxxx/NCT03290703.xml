  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the PK of GDC-0853 following changes to formulation
      and in the presence or absence of food, the proton pump inhibitor (rabeprazole), or both.
      This will be a 3-part open-label randomized study conducted in healthy adult participants.
      Approximately 63 subjects will be enrolled in this study.
