  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that new runners participating in an 8 week strength and
      coordination training program prior to beginning to run will 1) display different
      coordination patterns , and 2) experience fewer injuries, compared to new runners who do not
      perform strength or coordination training prior to running.

      The study will investigate the effect of a sequenced training program - beginning with
      strength training, followed by running-specific coordination exercises, and finally a gradual
      introduction to running - on strength, coordination and injury incidence in a group of novice
      runners. he investigators hypothesize that runners who perform strength and coordination
      training prior to beginning to run will 1) demonstrate greater lower extremity strength, 2)
      demonstrate alters coordination patterns and 3) experience fewer injuries, when compared to a
      control group of novice runners who perform no physical preparation prior to a gradual
      introduction to running. The possible long-term benefits of this study include reduced burden
      of running-related injuries, increased participation in the sport of running, improved
      cardiovascular and metabolic health characteristics, and reduced incidence of disease such as
      cardiovascular events and cancer.
