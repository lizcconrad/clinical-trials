  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An innovative method of needleless transcutaneous electroacupuncture (TEA) using a newly
      developed watch-size stimulator is proposed. Weak electrical current will be delivered via
      skin surface electrodes to acupuncture points related to gastrointestinal functions. The
      stimulator can be attached to the skin near the acupuncture points and therefore daily
      activity of the patient does not need to be altered. Two experiments are designed to prove
      the feasibility of the proposed therapy for gastric complications of Scleroderma .

    <description>for acute study: The experiment in patients will be performed in 4 randomized sessions on separate days (at least 3 days apart): one control session with sham-TEA and 3 TEA sessions at various parameters. TEA will be applied on both acupoints ST36 and PC6; the following sets of parameters will be tested for TEA at ST36: A) standard parameters: the set used in the previous SSc study: 25 Hz, 0.3ms, 2s-on and 3s-off; B) same as A but pulse width of 0.6ms; C) same as B but 0.1s-on and 0.4s-off. For TEA at PC6, 25 Hz will be replaced by 100Hz because TEA at PC6 is used to treat symptoms and 100Hz is believed to be better than 25Hz. The patient will be fasted overnight, and the test will last 2 hours (1 hour fasting and 1 hour postprandial).</description>
