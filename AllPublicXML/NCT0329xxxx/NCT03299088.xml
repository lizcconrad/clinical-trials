  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and trametinib in treating
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer and KRAS gene mutations that has spread to other
      places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and trametinib may
      work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when given in
      combination with trametinib in the proposed sequencing schemes in patients with advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess in a preliminary manner the clinical efficacy of these combinations with the
      proposed sequencing schemes including overall response rate and progression free survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      To determine in an exploratory manner changes in PD-L1 expression as well as other immune
      correlates induced by mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)
      inhibition.
