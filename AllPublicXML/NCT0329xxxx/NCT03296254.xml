  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two mindfulness interventions for
      stress, anxiety and burnout in mental health professionals. Participants will receive the
      treatments in reverse order: a brief intervention based on body exercises and another brief
      intervention based on sitting meditation. It is hypothesized that both interventions will
      decrease stress and anxiety levels and professional burnout, with mindfulness body exercises
      being at least as effective as mindfulness meditations.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two mindfulness interventions for
      stress, anxiety and burnout in mental health professionals. It is a 2-sequence, 2-period,
      2-treatment crossover design with sequences AB and BA. Treatment A consists of a block of
      five sessions of body mindfulness exercises, whereas experimental treatment B consists of a
      block of five sessions of sitting mindfulness meditation exercises. In the sixth session, the
      exercise blocks will be exchanged. Each group will be composed of 30 participants with a
      total sample of 60. The principal hypothesis is that both interventions will decrease stress
      and anxiety levels and professional burnout, with mindfulness body exercises being at least
      as effective as mindfulness sitting meditations. Secondarily, the personality type will be
      analyzed as a moderating variable in the effectiveness of the interventions. Te investigators
      will also study the role of daily practices and previous expectations in the results of this
      intervention. Finally, a qualitative study will be conducted in order to analyze the the
      acceptability and use-effectiveness in mental health professionals who are beginner
      meditators. This study will allow to understand what types of personality may benefit most
      from different types of meditation interventions.
