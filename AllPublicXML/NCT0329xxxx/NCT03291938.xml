    <textblock>
      This clinical research study has 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

      The goal of dose escalation in this clinical research study is to find the recommended dose
      of IACS-010759 that can be given to patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.

      The goal of dose expansion in this clinical research study is to learn if the dose of
      IACS-010759 found in the dose escalation part of the study is the best dose to use in future
      studies using IACS-010759 in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.

      The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. IACS-010759 is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you joined the study. Up to 5 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled
      in the dose escalation part of the study. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in dose
      expansion.

      If you are enrolled in dose escalation, the dose of IACS-010759 you receive will depend on
      when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level
      of IACS-010759. Each new group will receive a higher dose of IACS-010759 than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest
      tolerable dose of IACS-010759 is found.

      If you are enrolled in the dose expansion part of the study, you will receive the dose level
      of IACS-010759 that was found to be the best dose in the escalation part of the study.

      In the dose expansion part of the study, 3 groups of 10 participants each will be enrolled.
      Each group will be made up of participants with different disease types (breast cancer,
      pancreatic cancer, and cancers with tumors that can be safely biopsied on several occasions
      [the Biopsy Expansion Cohort]).

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 21 days. You will take the drug in 2 phases: Induction Phase and
      Maintenance Phase.

      In the Induction Phase, you will take IACS-010759 by mouth one (1) time every day on Days 1-7
      of Cycle 1. At the end of the Induction Phase, you will move on to the Maintenance Phase.

      During the Maintenance Phase, you will take IACS-010759 by mouth on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1.
      You will then take the study drug by mouth on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 and every cycle
      after that.

      You should take each dose with about a cup (8 ounces) of water and at least 1 hour before or
      2 hours after a meal. If you miss a dose, you should not take another dose until the next
      scheduled time.

      You will be admitted to the hospital on Day 7 of Cycle 1 for 24 hours and on Day 15 of Cycle
      2 for 24 hours. This is done so that you can be checked on for any side effects, and so the
      effects of the drugs on your body and vice versa can be monitored at different times over
      this period.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue to take IACS-010759 up to 12 cycles or longer if the study doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions. It is possible that you may need to stop taking the study drug for a period of
      time and then re-start it. The study doctor will tell you if this is the case.

      Your participation on this study will be over after long-term follow-up (described below).

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 7-8 teaspoons each time) will be drawn before and after the dose for
           acid/base level tests, for PK testing and for PD testing.

        -  You will have an EKG before the dose after the dose.

      On Days 4, 11, and 18 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be collected for
      acid/base level and PK testing.

      On Day 7 and 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn before the dose to check how well your organs
           function and for routine and acid/base level testing.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before the dose and then 5 more times
           over the next 12 hours on Day 7 and before and after the dose on Day 15 for PK testing.

        -  On Day 15 only, blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing.

        -  Urine will be collected before the dose for routine tests.

      On Day 8 of Cycle 1:

        -  Blood (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn for acid/base level and PD testing.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before and after the dose for PK
           testing.

        -  If you are in the Biopsy Expansion Cohort, you will also have a tumor biopsy.

      On Day 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 7-8 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests, acid/base level
           tests, to check how well your organs are functioning, and for PD testing.

        -  On Day 1, blood (1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before and after the dose for PK
           testing.

        -  On Day 15, blood (1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before the dose and again 6 more
           times over the next 24 hours for PK testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 21 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a PET, MRI, CT scan or X-ray.

        -  You will have a physical exam

        -  If your doctor decides it is needed, blood (up to 1/2 teaspoon) will be drawn for tumor
           marker testing

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn to check how well your organs are functioning
           and for routine acid/base level and PK testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 21 of Cycles 3 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn to check how well your organs are functioning
           and for routine acid/base level and PK testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Every 2 cycles while you are on study, you will have blood drawn to test for relevant tumor
      markers, PD testing and a CT scan performed. After you have received the study drug for 6
      months, your doctor may decide that you can have these tests performed once every 3 cycles
      (instead of every 2 cycles). If you have a response to the study drug, you will have CT scans
      performed again within 4 weeks.

      If the study doctor stops and re-starts your dose of study drug, the following will be
      performed:

      Â°Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for acid/base level and PK testing. This blood
      draw will also be used to check how well your organs are functioning.

      If the study doctor lowers your dose of study drug, the following will be performed when you
      start taking the lower dose:

      Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a PET, MRI, CT scan or X-ray.

        -  Blood (about 9-10 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests, acid/base
           level tests, and PK and PD testing. Blood for PK and PD testing may continue to be
           collected, if possible, every 4 days for up to 4 weeks after your last dose of study
           drug.

        -  If you are in the Biopsy Expansion Cohort, you will have a tumor biopsy.

      If you are unable to return to the clinic for the visit, this testing can be performed by a
      local doctor and the results will be sent to the study doctor. The research nurse will call
      you to ask about your health. These calls should last about 5 minutes.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After the End-of-Study visit, you will remain in long-term follow-up until the disease gets
      worse, you start a new cancer therapy, or up to two years after the last dose of study drug,
      whichever occurs first. During this time, the study staff will call you every 3-6 months and
      ask about how you are doing. Each call should last about 5 minutes. If the doctor thinks it
      is needed, you may be asked to come to the clinic for a physical exam.

          8. Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active serious bacterial, fungal or viral infection or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          9. Subjects with a history of significant cardiac disease including: Congestive heart
             failure requiring therapy; History of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris,
             coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 6 months prior to starting study treatment;
             Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete
             left bundle branch block, high-grade AV block (e.g., bifascicular block, Mobitz type
             II and third degree AV block); Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%
             evaluated by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA); Increased
             QTcF (&gt;450 for men and &gt;470 for women)

         10. Women who are breast-feeding or pregnant as evidenced by positive serum or urine
             pregnancy test performed within 72 hours of first dosing. (Pregnant women are excluded
             from this study because it is not known whether IACS-010759 has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             IACS-010759 breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             IACS-010759.)

         11. Subjects with significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may affect absorption
             (e.g., gastric bypass, short gut syndrome).

         12. Subjects with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acute chronic hepatitis B
             virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus. (HIV-positive subjects are
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions of antiviral
             therapy with IACS-010759.)

         13. Lactic acid levels &gt; 2 mmol/L and/or serum pH &lt;7.35 at screening.

         14. Subjects with other active malignancy in the past 3 years with the exception of
             adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical
             cancer, or another early stage cancer that in the discretion of the investigator(s) is
             currently in complete remission.

         15. Subjects with &gt;/= Common Terminology Criteria for Advance Events (CTCAE) grade 2
             toxicity (except alopecia) due to prior cancer therapy.

         16. Subjects with any concomitant disease or condition that, in the clinical judgment of
             the treating physician, is likely to prevent the subject from complying with any
             aspect of the protocol or that may put the subject at unacceptable risk.
