  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The studys evaluates the effect of prehospital administration of crushed tablets of Prasugrel
      loading dose (in addition to ASA and standard care) versus uncrushed tablets of Prasugrel
      loading dose on efficacy and safety as well as pharmacodynamics as measured by platelet
      reactivity using VerifyNow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-centre, randomized, 1:1 trial comparing prehospital prasugrel initiation
      therapy between crushed vs. uncrushed prasugrel tablets on efficacy and safety as well as
      pharmacodynamics in STEMI patients.

      Patients with STEMI planned for primary PCI will be screened and, if inclusion criteria are
      met, included at first medical contact (paramedics). After enrolment, patients will be
      randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 60mg prasugrel loading dose by ingesting integral or
      crushed tablets.

      The follow-up duration is 12 months, i.e. clinical outcomes will be analysed in-hospital, at
      30 days, and 12 months

          -  Oral anticoagulation therapy that cannot be stopped (i.e. patients requiring chronic
             therapy)

             CYP3A

          -  Condition which may either put the patient at risk or influence the result of the
             study (e.g., cardiogenic shock with severe hemodynamic instability, active cancer,
             risk for non-compliance, risk for being lost to follow up)

          -  Patient unable to swallow oral medication (i.e. intubated patients)
