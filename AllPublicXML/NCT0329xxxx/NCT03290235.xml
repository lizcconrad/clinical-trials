  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To further evaluate the safety and efficacy of PEG-Somatropin in the treatment of
           children with growth hormone deficiency for a relatively long period

        2. To explore the factors influencing the efficacy of PEG-Somatropin and to establish the
           height prediction model based on Chinese children with short stature, and to provide the
           basis and guidance for standard and reasonable long-term clinical application of
           PEG-Somatropin.
