    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects between 6 and 12 years of age

             disorders, bipolar I disorder (subjects 10 to 12 years old only for bipolar), conduct
             disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or any psychotic disorder and who are
             receiving antipsychotic treatment for their medical condition. Subjects' diagnoses
             will be determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th
             Edition (DSM-5) criteria and confirmed at screening using the Kiddie Schedule for
             Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL).

          -  Subjects must be considered psychiatrically/medically appropriate for participation in
             a clinical trial in which they will receive two doses of an antipsychotic medication.

          -  Subjects with good physical health, as determined by no clinically significant
             deviation from normal for all of the following, prior to enrollment in the trial:

               1. Medical history

               2. Clinical laboratory determination

               3. ECGs

               4. Physical examinations

          -  Subjects who are within the 5th to 95th percentile for gender-specific BMI for age
             from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts and weight at least
             15 kg (approx. 33 lbs)

          -  Ability to commit to remain fully abstinent or use 2 approved methods of birth control
             during the trial for 21 (± 2) days following the last dose of IMP for sexually active
             females of childbearing potential.

          -  Ability, in the opinion of the PI, of the subject and the subject's legally acceptable
             representative or caregiver(s) to understand the nature of the trial and follow
             protocol requirements, including all of the following:

               1. Comply with prescribed dosage regimens and tablet ingestion, as well as the
                  discontinuation of prohibited concomitant medications

               2. Reliably return for scheduled visits

               3. To be reliably rated on assessment scales

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a clinical presentation or history that is consistent with delirium,
             dementia, amnesia, or other cognitive disorders; subjects with psychotic symptoms that
             are better accounted for by another general medical condition(s) other than those
             listed in the second inclusion criterion above, or direct effect of a substance (ie,
             medication, illicit drug use, etc.).

          -  Subjects with a history of at least mild intellectual disability as determined by IQ &lt;
             70, clinical evidence, or a social or school history that is suggestive of

          -  Subjects who have any of the following:

               1. A significant risk of committing suicide based on history and the principal
                  investigator's clinical judgment, or routine psychiatric status examination

               2. Current suicidal behavior

               3. Imminent risk of injury; active suicidal ideation

               4. Any lifetime history of suicidal behavior detected by the Children's
                  Baseline/Screening version of the C-SSRS.

          -  Subjects with a lifetime history of a substance use disorder (as determined by the

             heart failure, HIV seropositive status/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or chronic
             hepatitis B or C. Medical conditions that are minor or well-controlled may be
             considered acceptable if the condition does not expose the subject to an undue risk of
             significant adverse event or interfere with assessments during the course of the
             trial.

          -  Subjects with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are excluded. Subjects with
             non-IDDM may be eligible for the trial if their condition is determined to be stable.

             orange juice within 72 hours prior to the first dose of IMP and throughout the trial

          -  Subjects who participated in a clinical trial and were exposed to IMP within the last
             30 days prior to screening or who participated in more than 2 interventional clinical
             trials within the past year.

          -  Subjects with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or hypersensitivity to
             atypical antipsychotics.

          -  Subjects with a history of true allergic (i.e. not intolerance) response to more than
             one class of medications.
