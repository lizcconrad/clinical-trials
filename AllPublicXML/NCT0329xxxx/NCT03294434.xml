  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumours are the leading cause of cancer deaths in children, men under the age of 45 and
      women under the age of 25. Glioblastoma is the most common and most malignant primary tumour.
      The predominant treatment is surgical removal of the tumour followed by radiotherapy. Sadly
      the majority of patients given this treatment develop recurrent and progressive disease.

      Better understanding of the invasive margin might improve outcomes by facilitating more
      complete surgical resection beyond the traditional contrast enhancing margins. Diffusion
      tensor MRI (DTI) is an imaging technique which may be able to predict the site of tumour
      recurrence. DTI has previously been shown to identify regions, which have been confirmed with
      biopsies, to be areas of invasive tumours and are present before progression is seen with an
      MRI.

      The primary aim of this study is to qualify an imaging biomarker that can be applied at
      initial presentation, that can accurately predict the site of where glioblastomas will
      progress after treatment and allow personalisation of both radiotherapy and surgical targets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, prospective longitudinal observational cohort study in patients with
      high grade glioma, who have surgery planned to remove &gt;90% of the tumour, and subsequent
      radical radiotherapy with concomitant tomozolomide. The purpose of this study is to establish
      a model using DTI that can accurately predict the site of where glioblastomas will progress
      after treatment. This study aims to validate the use of DTI as a biomarker across multiple
      centres to develop analysis methods that could be used in the future to personalise
      radiotherapy treatment volumes, and potentially surgical targets.

      Patients will be given a DTI-MRI both prior to the operation and prior to radiotherapy.
      Clinical MRIs will take place according to standard guidelines. Whilst the study is open
      patients will participate in the study until death. Once a total of 70 patients from the
      first 90 have shown true progression patients will participate in the study for a minimum of
      6 months from the beginning of radiotherapy.

      This study will be conducted in 6-10 NHS centres, where 120 patients will be recruited,
      patients who are withdrawn will be replaced.

    <description>Diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI) is a technique sensitive to the ordered diffusion of water along white matter tracts and can detect subtle disruption. A diffusion tensor signature method was developed that splits the tensor information into isotropic and anisotropic diffusion components. This can differentiate regions of pure tumour from invaded white matter.</description>
