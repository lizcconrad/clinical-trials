  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a well-recognized public health issue, affecting 415 million people
      and costing HK$5.2 trillion in global health expenditures worldwide. It is estimated 568,000
      people are living with DM in Hong Kong, and the projected number will increase to 781,000 in
      2040. In Hong Kong, the health care costs for diabetic patients are estimated to be HK$2
      billion accounting for 4.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and a major
      health service burden accounting for 200,000 (17% of total) hospital admissions with 1.2
      million hospitalization days per year.

      DM can lead to many complications resulting in morbidity and mortality. According to the
      International Diabetes Federation (IDF), in 2015, diabetes led to 5.0 million (14.5% of all
      deaths) deaths worldwide which translated to one death every six seconds and approximately
      70% of DM related deaths were attributed to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The development of
      diabetes-related complications significantly increases medical costs. A previous local study
      also found that the direct medical cost for diabetic patients with CVD were 1.1 times more
      than patients without CVD in Hong Kong.

      Objectives:

      To develop 10-year risk prediction models for total CVD and all-cause mortality among Chinese
      patients with DM in primary care. Risk prediction models for individual DM complications
      including coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke and end stage renal disease (ESRD)
      will also be developed.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Patient socio-demographic, clinical parameters, disease characteristics and treatment
           modalities are predictive of 10-year risk of total CVD, all-cause mortality and
           individual DM complication.

        2. Risk prediction models developed from this study should have over 70% of discriminating
           power.

      Design and Subjects:

      10-year retrospective cohort study. All Chinese patients who were clinically diagnosed to
      have DM and were receiving care in the Hospital Authority primary care clinics on or before 1
      July 2006 will be followed up until 31 December 2016.

      Main outcomes measures:

      For total CVD, all-cause mortality and each major DM complication

        1. 10-year incidence;

        2. Predictive factors

      Data analysis:

      The analyses will be carried out separately for men and women. Two thirds of subjects will be
      randomly selected as the training sample for model development. Cox regressions will be used
      to develop 10-year risk prediction models of total CVD, all-cause mortality and each major DM
      complication. The validity of models will be tested on the remaining one third of subjects by
      receiver operating characteristic curve.

      Expected results:

      Risk prediction models for diabetic complications specific to Chinese patients in primary
      care will enable accurate risk stratification, prioritization of resources and more
      cost-effective interventions for DM patients in primary care.

      This study aims to develop 10-year risk prediction models for total CVD and all-cause
      mortality among Chinese diabetic patients in primary care. Risk prediction models for
      individual DM complications including CHD, heart failure, stroke and ESRD will also be
      developed.

      The objectives are to:

        1. Calculate the 10 years incidence of total CVD, all-cause mortality and each major DM
           complication in Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        2. Determine the risk factors that significantly predict total CVD, all-cause mortality and
           each major DM complication for Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        3. Develop and validate risk prediction models for total CVD, all-cause mortality and each
           major DM complication for Chinese DM patients in primary care.

        4. Develop a risk prediction nomogram and chart for the risk of total CVD, all-cause
           mortality for Chinese DM patients in primary care

      Hypotheses:

        1. Patient socio-demographic, clinical parameters, disease characteristics, and treatment
           modalities are predictive of 10-year risk of total CVD, all-cause mortality and
           individual DM complication as a dependent variable.

        2. The risk prediction models for total CVD, all-cause mortality and individual DM
           complication developed in this study can have over 70% of discriminating power.

CVD is defined as the presence of any of CHD, heart failure and stroke. CHD includes all ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, coronary death or sudden death as indicated by the ICPC-2 K74 to K76 or ICD-9-CM 410.x, 411.x to 414.x, 798.x codes. Heart failure is defined by the ICPC-2 K77 or ICD-9-CM 428.x. Stoke (fatal and non-fatal stroke) is defined by the ICPC-2 K89 to K91 or ICD-9-CM 430.x to 438.x codes.</description>
