      (Non-clinical summary)

      Tramadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic of the aminocyclohexanol group with
      opioidlike effects. Tramadol is extensively metabolized following administration, which
      results in a number of enantiomeric metabolites that display different opioid-receptor
      binding properties, and monoaminergic reuptake inhibition.
