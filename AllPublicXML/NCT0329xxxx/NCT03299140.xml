  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is an early onset chronic disorder. Children of bipolar parents are at high
      risk of developping the same disorder and/or a psychopathology. Early intervention focused on
      emotion and problem solving strategies could improve their prognosis.

      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the FFT (Family Focused Therapy) efficacity.
      Children emotional dysregulation profile will be compared before and after this CBT
      intervention.
