  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a peer-led intervention intended to promote the
      community living and participation of individuals with psychiatric disabilities entitled
      &quot;Bridging Community Gaps Photovoice&quot; (BCGP). The intervention targets increasing community
      involvement of individuals with psychiatric disabilities through reduction in self-stigma and
      perceived stigma, enhancing opportunities for community participation, and support to achieve
      community participation goals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BCGP intervention is 6 months long and the investigators expect that participants will
      experience lower self and perceived stigma, increased community participation and sense of
      belonging, and improved psychosocial functioning and personal growth after the intervention.
      The intervention is comprised of a 12-week class that meets once a week for two hours,
      followed by three booster sessions - one per month in the three months following the class,
      and up to 24 sessions of individual support as needed throughout the 6 months provided on a
      weekly basis either in person or by phone. The purpose of the individual support is to
      reinforce the class activities and to ensure the participants meets their community
      participation goal. The proposed study is a randomized trial which will be conducted at
      Boston University Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation (BUCPR) in Massachusetts, the Mental
      Health Center of Denver (MHCD) in Colorado, and the Greater Bridgeport Mental Health Center
      (GBMHC) in Connecticut.
