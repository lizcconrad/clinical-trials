  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Neihulizumab (AbGn-168H) administered intravenously in
      patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis who are refractory or intolerant
      to anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α and/or anti-integrin treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label, single arm, multiple dose proof of principle study to test
      the efficacy and safety of Neihulizumab in patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative
      colitis and who has failed or are intolerant to anti-TNFα and/or anti-integrin therapy. A
      minimum of 35 patients and a maximum of 40 will be recruited in 1 dosing group. For efficacy
      evaluation, the primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with clinical response,
      defined as defined as a ≥ 3-point reduction in complete Mayo score, a 30% or greater decrease
      from the baseline score, and with a 1-point or greater decrease of the rectal bleeding
      subscale or an absolute rectal bleeding score of 0 or 1 at Week 12. Safety assessments will
      consist of evaluating physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate, body temperature and oxygen saturation), safety laboratory tests, adverse
      events and tolerability.
