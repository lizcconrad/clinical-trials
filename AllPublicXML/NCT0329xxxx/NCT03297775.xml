  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to define the phenotype of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
      in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The investigators hypothesize that there are
      common elements between other forms of ILD such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and
      sub-clinical RA-ILD that places individuals at risk for the development of lung disease.

      This is not a treatment study. It is a protocol designed to enroll individuals affected by RA
      and explore associated lung disease so that the investigators can better understand the
      clinical phenotype and genetic and molecular endotypes of this disease.

    <description>Subjects who screen positive for ILD will be followed annually until study closure.
Assessments are as follows:
Clinical - Demographics (e.g., age, sex, self-reported race, etc.), Health related behaviors, including smoking history, Co-morbidities and medications, Respiratory symptom assessment (e.g., cough, dyspnea), Rheumatologic assessment (e.g., disease duration, disease severity, treatment)
Physiologic - Forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), 6-minute walk distance
Radiologic - Assessment for airways disease, interstitial lung abnormalities
Genetic - DNA, RNA
Biologic - Serum, Plasma, Sputum</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>No evidence of interstitial lung disease</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects who screen negative for ILD will be followed five years after the initial screen and re-screened with a chest CT scan to check for evidence of new lung disease.
Assessments are as follows:
Clinical - Demographics (e.g., age, sex, self-reported race, etc.), Health related behaviors, including smoking history, Co-morbidities and medications, Respiratory symptom assessment (e.g., cough, dyspnea), Rheumatologic assessment (e.g., disease duration, disease severity, treatment)

      Depending on which one of the two cohorts subjects are assigned the following biospecimens
      will be collected either yearly or every five years:

        Subjects are selected for participation in the study because they have an active diagnosis
        of rheumatoid arthritis and are at risk fro the development of lung disease.
