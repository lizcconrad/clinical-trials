    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Respiratory-gated Auricular Vagal
      Afferent Nerve Stimulation (RAVANS) for improving motor recovery after stroke. Subacute
      stroke patients will receive RAVANS or sham stimulation concurrent with arm motor training
      during 10 intervention sessions occurring daily for 30 minutes over 2 weeks. The safety and
      improvements in arm motor function after the intervention will be compared in patients
      receiving RAVANS to those receiving sham stimulation.

      This study will evaluate the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of Respiratory-gated
      Auricular Vagal Afferent Nerve Stimulation (RAVANS) for improving motor recovery after
      stroke. Subacute stroke patients will be randomized to RAVANS or sham stimulation groups.
      Patients will receive RAVANS or sham stimulation concurrent with arm motor training during 10
      sessions occurring daily for 30 minutes over 2 weeks. Safety will be compared in patients
      receiving RAVANS to those receiving sham stimulation. Feasibility will be evaluated by
      recruitment into the study and retention of enrolled patients. Changes in arm motor function
      will be compared between RAVANS and sham stimulation groups from baseline to immediately
      after the intervention period and to function at 3-months after stroke.
