  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The continuity of the medicinal care between the city and the hospital stays a major
      organizational stake and of safety of patients' therapeutic care.This takeover is more
      complex when it concerns pathology needed lots of hospitalization and included the
      intervention of multiple healthcare practionners. This is clearly the case of cancer
      coverage.

      The optimization of the therapeutic suppor in town is based on pharmaceutical advice
      strengthening but also on the pharmaceutical analysis to check the entire treatments'
      prescription and eventual medicinal interactions which ensue from it.That's why it's
      important to have a medicinal conciliation that takes into account all the medecine taken or
      have to be taken by the patient.

      A specific support was developped by nurses , doctors and pharmacist ; it's a care
      coordiantion card that can be put easely in a pocket by the patient.

      The aim of the study is that this card can be also used as a communication tools by sharing
      the prescription done at the release of hospital by using an IT link (flea datamatrix) for
      the patients Via the use of an IT link (flea datamatrix) for the patients whose pathology is
      complex in term of extra hospital coverage.
