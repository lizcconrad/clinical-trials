  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label, randomised, multiple dose, cross-over relative bioavailability and
      pharmacokinetics trial of a novel oral liquid and capsule formulations of 13-CRA administered
      to patients from 0 months - &lt; 21 years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients requiring at least two cycles of 13-CRA therapy will be eligible for recruitment
      into the trial.

      13-CRA will be prescribed to patients according to local treatment protocols at each clinical
      site. The dose administered will be 200mg/m2/day for both test and reference product.
      Patients with a body weight of ≤12kg will receive a dose of 160 mg/m2.

      The pharmacokinetics of 13-CRA liquid (test product) and 200mg/m2/day extracted from capsule
      (reference product) will be evaluated over two months. Prior to the initiation of 13-CRA
      treatment as part of the trial, patients will be randomised to receive either liquid or
      capsule formulation in &quot;My-CRA month 1&quot;. The patients will then cross-over to the alternative
      formulation in &quot;My-CRA month 2&quot;. The patients on the trial who require further treatment will
      revert to standard therapy i.e. 13-CRA extracted from capsules according to local practice.

             commences and routinely before each course of treatment in females of childbearing
             potential. If a patient is found to be pregnant during the trial, the next course of
             treatment will not be given until the pregnancy has been discussed with the treating
             clinician, and the patient will be withdrawn from the trial whether or not treatment
