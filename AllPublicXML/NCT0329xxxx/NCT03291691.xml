  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve blocks can be conducted with ultrasound, electrical nerve stimulation or
      landmark technique or a combination of this techniques. Whether a regional block should be
      conducted with a combination of those different possibilities is highly discussed. In this
      study the investigators want to show the effectiveness of new standard way of combined use of
      ultrasound and nerve stimulation, they call protective nerve stimulation. According to
      ethical vote we are conducting an observational study.

      All patients will get the regional block they need for the elective surgery. Before starting
      the block a standard monitoring will be established. After applying the monitoring the block
      will be performed by an experienced anesthetist in supervision of another experienced
      anesthetist. The nerve stimulator is set on a fixed current of 1.0 mA and a block without
      motoric response on this current is tried. Ultrasound images are saved. After performing the
      regional anesthesia the further anesthetic procedure will be carried out and the surgery will
      take place. After surgery the patients will be transported to the recovery room or
      Postanesthesia care unit.
