    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trifluridine/tipiracil
      hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 (TAS-102) when given together with radiation therapy
      in treating patients with rectal cancer that has come back, spread to other places in the
      body, or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as TAS-102, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving TAS-102 with radiation therapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of TAS-102 when
      administered in combination with concurrent radiation therapy in patients with locally
      recurrent or metastatic rectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy
      in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic rectal cancer.

      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally recurrent or
      metastatic rectal cancer who receive concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy.

      III. To determine the overall survival (OS) in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
      rectal cancer who receive combined TAS-102 and radiation therapy.

      IV. To determine quality of life (QoL) among patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
      rectal cancer who receive concurrent TAS-102 and radiation therapy.

      V. To determine the number of patients who are able to undergo surgical resection following
      concurrent treatment with TAS-102 and radiation therapy. Of this subset of patients, the
      investigators will assess rates of pathologic complete response (pCR), tumor regression grade
      (TRG) and rates of R0 resection.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination
      agent TAS-102.

      Patients receive trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) and undergo radiation therapy in 10 fractions on days 1-5 and 8-12 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, and at 3 and 6
      months.
