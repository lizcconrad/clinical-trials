  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, dose-optimized, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel efficacy laboratory classroom study with KP415 in children with
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a Screening Period, an Open-Label Dose Optimization Phase, a
      Double-Blind Treatment Phase and a Follow-Up Visit, as follows:

        -  Screening Period: Subjects will undergo a screening period up to 49 days prior to
           entering into the Open-Label Dose Optimization Phase.

        -  Open-Label Dose Optimization Phase: During the Dose Optimization Phase, subjects will be
           titrated to doses of 20, 30 or 40 mg KP415 based on tolerability and best individual
           dose-response in the opinion of the Investigator.

        -  Double-Blind Treatment Phase: Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive single
           daily doses of KP415 or Placebo for 7 days according to a randomization schedule. The
           dose of KP415 given in the Treatment Phase will be the same as the optimized dose of
           KP415 at the end of the Dose Optimization Phase. All subjects will receive their
           assigned treatment daily for 7 days. The dose will be the same at each day of the
           Treatment Period. Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed after the last dose
           of the Treatment Period.

        -  Follow-Up Visit: 3 ±2 days after administration of the last dose of the Treatment Phase,
           subjects will enter a Follow-Up Visit to evaluate safety parameters.
