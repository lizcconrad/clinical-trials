  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During routine clinical practice, it is observed that patients with suspected obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA) often reported waking up with a dry mouth during the night or in the
      morning. This 9 week, cross-over group, randomized, single center, study will evaluate the
      efficacy of a proprietary formulation in comforting dry mouth in Sleep Apnea patients.
