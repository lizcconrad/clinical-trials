  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by
      loss-of function mutations in the LPL gene, leading to the inability to produce functionally
      active lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL is the key enzyme in the metabolism of triglyceride
      (TG)-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons (CM) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)). LPLD
      results in extremely high concentrations of circulating TG-rich lipoproteins.

      No drug therapy for LPLD is currently available. Clinical management of LPLD patients
      consists of severe dietary fat restriction and the use of medium-chain triglycerides to
      substitute for normal dietary fats.

      Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera®) received marketing authorisation from the European commission
      on 25 October 2012. Glybera® aims to correct lipoprotein lipase deficiency sufficiently to
      decrease the morbidity and lower the risk of inherent complications of LPLD, in adult
      patients genetically diagnosed with LPLD.

      The Glybera Registry is designed to collect the long-term safety and efficacy data of
      GLYBERA®

      All patients treated with GLYBERA®, in a clinical trial and when GLYBERA® was commercially
      available who are currently participating in the LPLD Registry (Long term follow up of safety
      and efficacy in LPLD), will be asked to continue their participation in this Glybera Registry
      to collect long-term safety and efficacy data.
