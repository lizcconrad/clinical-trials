      Tumor heterogeneity leads to a significant difference in the rate of response to drugs in
      patients with the same pathological type. According to the information, the current initial
      effective rate of domestic and foreign chemotherapeutic single drug is no more than 30%, even
      if treated with repeated medication or replacement treatment program, the responsive rate is
      generally not more than 10%. This heterogeneity of tumor is the biological basis of precision
      medicine, and how to predict cancer drug sensitivity is a clinical need to solve the
      practical problems.

      Traditional PDX (patient-derived engraft) technology utilizes patient's fresh tumor tissue
      (containing tumor cells, stromal cells and vascular components), and inoculates in
      immunodeficient mice to establish mouse tumor model. This method can better reflect the true
      biological characteristics of tumor, while the mouse tumor tissue can be continuously passed
      on, and greatly facilitate tumor biology research. According to the transplant site it can be
      divided into orthotopic transplantation and ectopic transplantation (mostly subcutaneous or
      renal transplantation). However, the traditional PDX model has its disadvantage of low
      success rate and long time consuming. Most of the tumor matrix after transplantation can be
      replaced by the corresponding components in mice, leading to differences in the biological
      properties of the original tumor.

      In view of this imperfection, we developed an in vitro drug susceptibility model based on
      combinational chemistry and a humanized mouse-accelerated PDX model based on tumor
      microenvironment, We want to provide physicians with individualized drug therapy through a
      new in vitro and in vivo drug-sensitive screening technique, to achieve rapid and accurate
      selection of cancer clinical treatment.

      Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is the birthplace of traditional 3D organoid culture
      and has been in the forefront of the world in recent years. The culture system introduced a
      combination of chemical technology to achieve part of the simulation of in vitro blood
      circulation, improve the reflection the real drug sensitivity so that the accuracy of
      pre-clinical test results have been greatly improved.

      In order to achieve the two key requirements of tumor tissue culture system in vitro, the
      establishment of tumor microenvironment and the simulation of blood circulation, we
      introduced the millimeter-sized microbeads, based on combinatorial chemistry in the culture
      medium. The surface of the microbeads is covered with the relevant cell growth factor active
      polypeptide fragments and can meet tumor growth requirements from different organ sources.
      These factors can be mediated by mechanisms such as tumor cells releasing hydrolases to
      promote their release, to simulate the dynamics of the human body environment. Other
      microbeads are coated with small molecules and other polypeptide molecules that can
      specifically absorb high levels of metabolites secreted by the tumor cells into the matrix,
      thereby mimicking in vivo circumstances. In short, we innovatively applied microbeads
      technology to solve the inherent limitations of 3D organoid culture - no blood circulation in
      vitro. In addition, the application of our high-throughput technology has made a breakthrough
      in in vitro culture technology. We have also developed the tumor microenvironment and immune
      gene humanized mouse model. In order to increase success rate, we applied this model on the
      tumor culture in the pre-culture stage. This process takes only three days.

      For tumor growth rate and patient status suitable for further in vivo model susceptibility
      test, we successfully developed a drug susceptibility test for humanized mouse model through
      gene editing technology in micro-environment and the immune system gene. This model overcomes
      the defect of the existing mouse PDX model: low tumor formation rate and slow growth rate
      (3-6 months to complete the drug screening). In vitro culture for three days (72 hours)
      increased tumor formation rate and achieved in vitro expansion of tumor tissue samples. At
      the same time in vitro we use high-throughput test out of about 10 alternatives. The
      establishment of a humanized mouse model significantly shortens the time of drug
      susceptibility testing in vivo and completes the final drug sensitivity test in about 30
      days.

      Purpose and design Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) Secondary endpoints:
      overall survival (OS); disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR); safety;
      blood test and gene test in the aspect of biomarkers. Expectations of exploratory markers for
      this study include the status of exploratory biomarkers associated with immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) or quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), a new
      generation sequencing method (NGS), Nanostring technique and / or other methods to evaluate
      archived and/or newly acquired tumor tissue, as well as its association with disease status
      and/or (Including but not limited to somatic mutations and other exploratory markers)
      according to qRT-PCR and NGS techniques, and to evaluate the relationship between the
      therapeutic response, the status of the biomarker during exploratory treatment and during
      treatment, and the evaluation of plasma, serum or whole blood samples (including but not
      limited to somatic mutations and other exploratory markers) The association of the above
      markers with disease status and / or therapeutic response.

      Research design This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized study
      designed to evaluate PFS, safety, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (OPR),
      disease control rate (DCR) and biomarkers of cancer therapy based on the accelerated PDX
      model screening in subjects with advanced malignant tumor.
