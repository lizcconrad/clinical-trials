      This investigation is a single site, randomized, blinded, sham controlled, parallel group
      study to identify whether EA is a beneficial anesthesia adjunct in children undergoing
      procedures on their congenital heart defects.

      Study subjects age's birth to eighteen years, undergoing cardiac surgery for their congenital
      heart lesions will be considered for entrance into the study. The randomized subjects will
      receive either EA or sham during their surgery for CHD. Subjects are expected to remain in
      the hospital 48 hours post procedure. Standard of care blood samples will be obtained
      pre-operative and post-operative. The only study specific blood sample will be Troponin I
      levels which will be obtained before surgery begins after the IV lines have been placed, and
      6 hours after bypass. Urine samples will be obtained before surgery after placement of the
      foley catheter and every 6 hours post bypass aortic cross clamp removal for 48 hours while
      the foley catheter is still in place.

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects will have electro-acupuncture pads applied at four points bilaterally: pericardial 4 (PC 4), pericardial 6 (PC 6), large intestine 4 (LI 4) and stomach 36 (ST 36). No needles will be used. (Appendix A; 1)
Group 1: Receive electro-acupuncture (EA) (treatment) frequency will be at 2Hz and 100 Hz the amplitude will be microA.
Group 2: Receive sham (control) will not have stimulation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Troponin level Change from baseline. Troponin lab levels will be measured as a marker of myocardial injury. Children undergoing procedures for their congenital heart disease will have their troponin levels prior to the procedure and 6 hours after weaning from bypass. This study will look at differences between pre and post troponin values in the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the incidence and severity of pain in the post operative period</measure>
    <time_frame>every 2 hours for 48 hours after arrival in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects less than 2 month will have their pain assessed every 2 hours for 48 hours using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS).Pain in children 2 months to 7 years or those that are unable to communicate their pain will have their pain evaluated every 2 hours for 48 hours using the Face, Legs, Cry, Consolability Scale (FLACC). Scale range 0-10. Children older than 10 will have their pain evaluated every 2 hours for 48 hours using a Visual analogue scale (0-10).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 6,12,24, and 48 hours after weaning from Cardiopulmonary bypass</time_frame>
    <description>Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) classification will be assessed using the AKIN classification system. This system uses Serum Creatinine and/or Urine output to come up with a staging of 1-3. Patients will be stage at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after bypass.</description>
