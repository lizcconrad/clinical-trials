      In this study the effect of an acute acid load on the intrarenal renin angiotensin-system is
      evaluated in patients with chronic kidney disease and healthy controls

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis is one of the metabolic complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
      Correction of metabolic acidosis in CKD has been shown to prevent further loss of kidney
      function over time. Currently, a clinical trial (the BIC-study, MEC-2013-332) is conducted in
      which patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis receive sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride,
      or no treatment (time control) to address the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of
      acidosis correction are mediated through inhibition of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin
      system (RAS). It is unknown, however, if and how acute changes in acid-base status affect the
      intrarenal RAS during CKD. In the present study it is hypothesized that an acute acid load
      increases the activity of the intrarenal RAS, and that this response is exaggerated in
      patients with CKD compared with healthy controls.

          -  Healthy male or female adults (≥ 18 years)

          -  Normal kidney function (eGFR &gt; 90 ml/min/1.73 m2, calculated using the CKD-EPI
             equation)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CKD patients

          -  Plasma bicarbonate level &lt; 20.0 mmol/l
