  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the implant success proportion of the
      Medtronic SelectSecure MRI SureScan Model 3830 pacing lead at the bundle of His for His
      bundle pacing.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate implant lead electrical measurements and changes over time, estimate
      the correlation between lead location and selective vs non-selective His bundle pacing, and
      estimate the correlation between long-term lead performance and implant characteristics. Data
      from the study may be used to standardize the implant workflow to help improve the ease and
      predictability of His bundle pacing implants.
