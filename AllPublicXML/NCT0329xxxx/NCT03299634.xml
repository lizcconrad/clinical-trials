      This cross-sectional study will assess the prevalence of oral changes among smokers in an
      Egyptian cohort (patients attending to the hospital of Faculty of Dentistry - Cairo
      University), aiming that this study can serve as a baseline for future studies with the goal
      of finding ways to improve oral health and increase awareness of the hazards of smoking in
      Egypt
