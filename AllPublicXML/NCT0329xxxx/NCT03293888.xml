  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, observational study to evaluate the intraoperative sensitivity of the Chaos
      Wand in detecting tumor tissue with glioblastoma disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate if the Chaos Wand Spectral Diagnosis Probe can be used
      to identify Glioblastoma (GBM) cancer cells in patients undergoing standard surgical
      resection. Eligible patients who have consented to the use of the Chaos Wand will be
      scheduled for surgery as standard cancer care for GBM. During the surgical procedure, the
      Chaos Wand Spectral Diagnosis Probe will be utilized. Fifteen intraoperative readings and
      signal recordings of GBM tissue will be taken. The wand will only be used in areas that have
      already been deemed in need of resection due to GBM disease. Each site identified for
      spectral analysis will be marked. The wand does not come into contact with the brain at any
      point during this procedure. Following surgical resection of the GBM tumor, tissue will be
      collected from the same 15 sites where the Chaos Wand was used. The pathology report will be
      compared with the results of spectral analysis.

    <measure>Mean ratio of detecting glioblastoma cancer between the Chaos Wand spectral readings and histopathology as ground truth</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For participants newly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme or patients who are suspected of having glioblastoma on pre-operative imaging who consent to the use of the Chaos Wand during surgery, 15-20 spectral readings will be compared to histopathology as ground truth to measure the sensitivity of the Chaos Wand to detect glioblastoma. For example, if a patient has 15 spectral readings but only 13 are histologically consistent with cancer, then the sensitivity of the wand would be 13/15*100 = 87%. A mean value with standard deviation will be reported across all participants in the study.</description>

        The study population includes adult patients from the outpatient neurosurgery clinic or
        those who have presented through the University of Oklahoma emergency department and have
        been diagnosed with glioblastoma or are suspected of having glioblastoma based on
        pre-operative imaging. The Stephenson Cancer Center will not exclude potential subjects
        from participating in this or any study solely on the basis of ethnic origin or
        socioeconomic status. Every attempt will be made to enter all eligible patients into this
        protocol and therefore address the study objectives in a patient population representative
        of the entire patient population with GBM.

             undergo surgical treatment or patients who are suspected of having glioblastoma on

             tumor resection.
