  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed regulatory post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study will be planned to collect
      the safety data of aflibercept intravitreal injection in patients with wet Age-related
      Macular Degeneration (AMD) in real-life treatment practice.

      The primary objective is:

      - To collect safety data in wet AMD patients treated with intravitreal aflibercept injection

      The secondary objective is:

      - To determine how disease activity is monitored including type and frequency of ocular tests
      and frequency of injections
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be multicenter, observational, prospective, single arm, post marketing
      surveillance study of intravitreal aflibercept injection in wet AMD patients in routine
      clinical practice and real-life conditions without any protocol mandated interventions.

      Approximately 100 wet AMD patients from up to ten ophthalmology clinics across India will be
      enrolled in this study. Each study site will be requested to enroll approximately 10
      patients, however, the sites will be asked to enrolled additional patients in case of failure
      to enroll 10 patients by other site to complete the recruitment of approximately 100
      patients.

      Patients will be observed for maximum period of 6 months after the start of intravitreal
      aflibercept treatment. The observation period should cover the entire period from initial
      visit to the last follow-up visit at six months or withdrawal of consent, or the patient is
      lost to follow up (whatever is earliest).

      The study site will be asked to enroll into the study all consecutive patients with wet AMD
      for whom the decision has been made to treat with intravitreal aflibercept injection and
      patients agrees to sign informed consent form for data collection purpose.

      Any switch to another therapy or initiated administration of other anti-VEGF (Vascular
      Endothelial Growth Factor) injection in fellow eye or the discontinuation of treatment with
      IVT-AFL before the 6 month implies the end of the observation period. However, the safety
      follow-up will continue at least 30 days after last intravitreal aflibercept injection or in
      case of the discontinuation of treatment with IVT-AFL or till the patient switch the
      treatment from IVT-AFL and received other anti-VEGF injection before the 6 month observation
      period.
