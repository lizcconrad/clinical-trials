    <textblock>
      This is pilot study involving approximately 20 subjects with at least 20 dental pockets
      between 2- 4mm with bleeding for sampling. Subjects will have up to 10 sites identified as
      &quot;sampling sites&quot; that will have supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque, and gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) collected at Baseline, 30 minutes, 24 hours, and Week 2.

             has been completed;

          -  Agree to use the acclimation products and to refrain from using any other oral care
             products (including floss and mouth rinse) between the Acclimation and Baseline Visit;

          -  Agree to use the treatment products and refrain from any form of non-specified oral
             hygiene during the treatment periods (after the Baseline Visit), including but not
             limited to the use of products such as floss, mouth rinse, or whitening products;

          -  Agree to return for all scheduled visits and follow study procedures;

          -  Must have at least 16 natural teeth;

          -  Be in good general health, as determined by the Investigator/designee based on a
