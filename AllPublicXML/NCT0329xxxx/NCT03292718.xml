      Interventional trial to study the influence of the use of MyCyFAPP (mobile application) on
      the gastro-intestinal related quality of life.

      This mobile APP has been developed during previous workpackages of the Horizon2020 Project
      and contains several modules:

        -  mathematical prediction model to calculate the needed dose for pancreatic enzyme
           replacement therapy

        -  educational games and other educational material

        -  communication with doctor/dietician through professional webtool

        -  diary to register symptoms and data on nutrition.

      The app will be introduced and used during 6 months. Primary outcome parameter will be change
      in modified PedsQL GI after 3 months. PedsQL GI is an existing questionnaire that evaluates
      gastro-intestinal related quality of life in children. We validated it for use in cystic
      fibrosis in a previous observational study.
