    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of at home thermal therapy
      with a wireless, portable device, as an effective management of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction.

      This will be done by assessing patients for improvement in symptoms and ocular oil gland
      function after 4 weeks of a daily thermal therapy application.

      This study will be a non-randomized, open label study of subjects with documented MGD. All
      subjects will be sent home with a wireless, portable thermal therapy device and examined pre
      and post treatment period. Subjects will be asked to use the device at bedtime for 5 minutes
      daily for 4 weeks. After treatment subjects will be re-examined and measured for clinical and
      symptomatic change in their MGD as well as changes to their sleep quality and anxiety index.
      Subjects will also be followed after treatment has been completed.
