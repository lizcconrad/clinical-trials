    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this prospective clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of PEP-CMV in
      patients with recurrent medulloblastoma and malignant glioma. Patients with
      histologically-proven medulloblastoma or malignant glioma who had received definitive
      chemo-radiotherapy and subsequently had tumor recurrence/progression may be enrolled any time
      after recurrence/progression regardless of prior adjuvant therapy. PEP-CMV is a vaccine
      mixture of 2 peptides comprised in two components (referred to as Component A and Component
      B). Component A is a synthetic long peptide (SLP) of 26 amino acid residues from human pp65.
      Component B consists of a neutralizing antibody epitope from human CMV glycoprotein B (gB)
      conjugated to KLH.

      Once a patient has enrolled onto this study, prior therapy will be terminated and patients
      will receive temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day x 5 days. If they are receiving bevacizumab at the
      time of enrollment, they will continue bevacizumab 10 mg/Kg every 14 days.

      Immunotherapy begins with a Tetanus (Td) pre-conditioning vaccine delivered intrademally
      (i.d.) in the right groin at the site of the vaccine injection 6-24 hours prior to the first
      vaccine on day 21. The first PEP-CMV vaccine will be administered as follows: PEP-CMV
      Component A mixed with Montanide ISA-51 intradermally administered in the right groin and
      PEP-CMV Component B mixed in GM-CSF administered i.d. in the left groin.

      The first 3 PEP-CMV vaccines will occur every 2 weeks, then PEP-CMV vaccines will continue
      monthly (+/- 2 weeks) until progression. Blood will be obtained for immune monitoring.
      Patients will be followed 10 years for tumor progression and/or death due to any cause (if
      occurs before end of 10 year follow up).
