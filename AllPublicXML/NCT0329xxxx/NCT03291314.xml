      Phase II clinical trial on the combination of avelumab and axitinib for the treatment of
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma (histologically confirmed WHO grade IV glioma), at
      documented recurrence/progression following prior treatment with surgery, radiation therapy
      and temozolomide.

      High-grade gliomas of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by profound tumor
      related neo-angiogenesis, and intracranial perilesional edema. Glioblastoma (WHO-grade IV
      glioma) expresses high levels of VEGF and frequently carries an amplified gene copy numbers
      of the VEGFR2, KIT and PDGFR or EGFR genes, key mediators of the process of cancer related
      neo-angiogenesis. In patient diagnosed with recurrence/progression glioblastoma (recGB)
      following prior therapy with surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide, cytotoxic salvage
      therapies resulted in a best overall response rate of 5 to 10%, 6-month PFS rates of 9% to
      21%, and a median OS of 25 to 30 weeks. No treatment option has demonstrated to improve the
      survival expectancy of recGB patients in a randomized clinical trial. Bevacizumab treatment
      has been registered by FDA based on objective tumor response rates and PFS results obtained
      in uncontrolled phase II trials. There is currently no treatment registered by EMA for the
      indication of recGB.

      Axitinib, a VEGFR-specific small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Tki) has demonstrated
      anti-tumor activity when evaluated as a mono-therapy and in combination with lomustine for
      the treatment of patients with recGB (EudraCT 2011-000900-16). Immunocytochemical profiling
      of the peripheral blood of recurrent GBM patients treated with axitinib or axitinib plus
      lomustine showed that axitinib treatment increases the number of naive CD8+ T cells and
      central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. There was also a reduction of TIM3 expression and an
      increased cytokine production in the patients treated with axitinib. Upon progression during
      axitinib treatment patients displayed an increased immune suppression with an increased
      number of Treg, an increased PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a reduced T cell
      functionality.

      Avelumab (MSB00107; anti-PD-L1) is a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb)
      that has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in several tumor types. Expression of PD-L1 by
      tumor cells has been correlated with a higher probability for respons to avelumab throughout
      different tumor types. Glioblastoma has been reported to expresses the PD-L1 ligand.

      In preclinical mouse models we demonstrated that axitinib reduces the immune suppressive
      microenvironment through reduction of the suppressive capacity of monocytic MDSCs (both in
      intra-cranial as well as subcutaneous tumors). Moreover, it also increased the number of
      tumor-infiltrating T cells. When we combined axitinib with active immunotherapy in the form
      of CTLA4 blockade not only a supplementary reduction of the suppressive capacity of these
      monocytic MDSCs was found, but also a reduction of the intratumoral granulocytic MDSCs and an
      increased antigen-presenting function of intratumoral DCs (manuscript accepted for
      publication in High-grade gliomas of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by
      profound tumor related neo-angiogenesis, and intracranial perilesional edema. Glioblastoma

      increased antigen-presenting function of intratumoral DCs (manuscript accepted for
      publication in American Journal of Cancer Research).

      The rational for combining avelumab with for the treatment of recGB is based on the potential
      of axitinib to normalize the glioblastoma associated neo-vasculature, counteracting the
      immunosuppressive role of VEGF in the tumor microenvironment and controlling intracranial
      edema. These features may result in a synergistic anti-tumor effect with the PD-L1 inhibitory
      mAb avelumab. In addition, axitinib may reduce the inflammatory edema related to the
      anti-tumor effect mediated by PD-L1 inhibition with avelumab.

      Patients with recGBM often develop neurological symptoms related to perilesional edema.
      Corticosteroids are considered a standard of care for controlling intracranial edema in
      patients with glioblastoma. High dose corticosteroids however are known to be
      immunosuppressive and are likely to counteract the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 antibody
      therapy. Axitinib has the capacity to control recGBM associated edema of the brain. Out of
      the 32 patients who were treated with corticosteroids at baseline in the AxiG trial (EudraCT
      2011-000900-16) 17 could lower and 5 could stop their steroids during treatment with
      axitinib. PFS was identical for patient with or without need for steroids at baseline in the
      AxiG trial but OS was numerically superior for patients not in need for steroids at baseline.

         22. Current use or anticipated need for drugs that are known strong CYP3A4/5 inducers,
             including their administration with 10 days prior to patient enrollment(eg,
             phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,
             St John's wort).

         23. Pregnant female patients, breastfeeding female patients.

         24. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory bowel
             disease, uncontrolled asthma, and pneumonitis or psychiatric condition, including
             recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
