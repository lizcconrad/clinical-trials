      This is a Phase 1b, open-label study of immune checkpoints inhibitors Nivolumab+Ipilimumab
      administered in combination with the anti-TNF-α either Infliximab or Certolizumab, in
      patients with advanced melanoma.

      The study will be conducted in 2 consecutive parts:

        -  Part 1 with 2 parallel cohorts (Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination with
           anti-TNF-α Certolizumab (Cohort 1) and Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination
           with anti-TNF-α Infliximab (Cohort 2)). 6 patients will be included in each cohort.

        -  Part 2 (expansion cohort Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination with either
           anti-TNF-α Certolizumab or Infliximab, depending on results of the Part 1 of the study).
           18 patients will be included in this cohort.
