      This study is designed as a prospective observational, non-controlled, non-interventional
      study.

      The aim of this study is to obtain a broad user perspective of the aScope™ 4 Broncho,
      focusing on the device functionalities within regular clinical practice and therapeutic use
      of flexible bronchoscopes in the OR and ICU.

      The study will include a minimum of 100 adult patients admitted to the operating room (OR) or
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) undergoing at least one bronchoscopy procedure. The inclusion will
      stop when 100 fully evaluable patients or a maximum of 150 patients have been enrolled.

      The involved sites will include patients during a five months' period, from September 2017 to
      January 2018.
