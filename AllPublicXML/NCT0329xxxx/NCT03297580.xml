  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) has heterogeneous symptoms and significant medical morbidity.
      Recently, itch was described as a symptom of SSc (prevalence of 42,6%). To the investigators
      knowledge, no study yet has examined the clinical features of itch neither had used a
      specific itch-related quality of life (QoL) scales in patients with SSc. The objectives were
      to evaluate the prevalence of pruritus, its characteristics and its impact on the QoL in
      those patients.

      In this descriptive study, patients followed for SSc in the departments of dermatology,
      rheumatology, internal medicine and pulmonology at the University Hospital of Brest were
      included. Participants received a questionnaire including questions about the clinical
      features of pruritus and 2 scores (5-D itch scale, ItchyQol).
