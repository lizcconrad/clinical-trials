      A study that compares the extent to which apomorphine becomes available in the body after
      taking either an investigational drug containing apomorphine or apomorphine that is injected
      under the skin in people with PD complicated by &quot;OFF&quot; episodes.

      This multi-center study will aim to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and comparative
      bioavailability of a single dose of APL-130277 sublingual thin film with subcutaneous (s.c.)
      APO-go® and s.c. APOKYN® in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). The dose of APOKYN® (≤ 5
      mg) will be based on the subjects' current prescribed dose. The study is designed as an
      open-label, randomized, three-way crossover. Subjects will receive all three treatment arms
      with a minimum 1-day wash-out between each visit (excluding the screening visit) and will be
      randomly assigned to one of the six sequences
