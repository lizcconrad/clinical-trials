      This is a single center, open-label study, which will examine the effect of dupilumab on the
      immunologic and genetic environment within atopic dermatitis (AD) lesions. Fifteen subjects
      with moderate to severe AD will receive dupilumab for a treatment period of 52 weeks (i.e.
      last injection on week 48). Surgical discard specimens will also be collected from fifteen
      healthy subjects. Biopsy samples from AD subjects and surgical discard samples will undergo
      molecular profiling. Skin swabs and stool samples will be collected and banked for future
      analysis. The reason to treat patients for 52 weeks is to have the ability to correlate early
      molecular events with clinical outcomes (EASI, IGA, itch score) at week 52. In addition,
      collection of microbiome samples will be performed at week 52.

          -  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) ≥ 3

          -  10% body surface area (BSA) or greater

          -  Subject is unlikely to conceive due to male, post-menopausal, or using adequate
             contraceptive (barrier, hormonal, implant, or permanent sterilization methods).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is unable to provide written informed consent or comply with the protocol.

          -  Subject is younger than 18 years of age.

          -  Subject has had atopic dermatitis for less than 3 years prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject with mild atopic dermatitis (EASI&lt;16 and IGA&lt;3) or is not a candidate for
             phototherapy or systemic treatments.

          -  Subject with current, or a history of, severe atopic dermatitis well controlled on
             current therapy.

          -  Serious known infection.

          -  History of immunosuppression (including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV))

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before the screening visit, except completely
             treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, completely treated and resolved
             non-metastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Severe concomitant illnesses.

          -  Having used immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs (eg, systemic corticosteroids,
             cyclosporine, mycophenolate-mofetil, IFN-γ, Janus kinase inhibitors, azathioprine,
             methotrexate, etc.) or phototherapy within 4 weeks before the baseline visit.

          -  Subjects possess other diagnoses that, in the investigator's opinion, preclude him/her
             from safely participating in this study or interfere with the evaluation of the
             subject's atopic dermatitis.

          -  History of known or suspected intolerance to any of the ingredients of the
             investigational study product.
