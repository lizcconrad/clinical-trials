  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and often debilitating
      complication of cancer treatments. There is presently no known treatment which can prevent
      the onset of CIPN, with treatment of existing symptoms limited to reducing the dose intensity
      of the offending agent. Clinical research has shown that complementary/integrative medicine
      (CIM) modalities such as acupuncture and reflexology may be effective in relieving
      CIPN-related symptoms. The present study will included 120 patients suffering from
      CIPN-related symptoms, and will take place at 3 medical centers in Israel which provide CIM
      treatments to oncology and hemato-oncology patients. Participants will be allocated to either
      the control arm (standard conventional supportive care; n=40) or to the intervention arm of
      the study (standard care with CIM treatments; n=80), based on their preference. Patients in
      the treatment arm of the study will be randomly allocated to either twice-weekly, single
      modality acupuncture treatments (n=40), or to a multi-modality treatment program (n=40),
      which will include acupuncture and additional CIM modalities (i.e., manual-movement and
      mind-body therapies), for a 6-week period.

      The effect of CIM treatments in reducing the severity of CIPN-related symptoms will be
      assessed at baseline and at 6- and 9-week follow-up visits, using the Functional Assessment
      of Cancer Therapy -Taxane (FACT-Tax) tool; the European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30); and the Measure
      Yourself Concerns and Well-being (MYCAW) questionnaire. Interim assessment of symptom
      severity will be conducted by the study nurse throughout the study period, through either
      telephone or e-mail. Additional study outcomes will include the safety of the CIM treatments;
      QOL-related concerns which may affect CIPN-related symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, sleep
      disturbances, etc.), as well as issues related to body image and coping with CIPN;
      physiological assessment of CIPN using a von Frey test (with hairs of varying diameters to
      assess the threshold for touch evoked sensations); and adherence to the planned oncology
      treatment regimen, as measured by the Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) calculation.
