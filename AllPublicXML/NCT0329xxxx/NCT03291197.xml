  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder-hand syndrome (SHS) in stroke patients is painful and lowers quality of life.
      Unfortunately, the cause of SHS is not known, diagnosing SHS can be difficult, and treating
      it can be hard. Recent research has shown that certain nerve blocks are good for treating
      shoulder pain for stroke patients, but no one has looked specifically as SHS. Investigators
      think that specific nerve blocks involving a shoulder nerve (the suprascapular, or SSc nerve)
      and a hand nerve (the median nerve) will be helpful in reducing SHS pain. Investigators will
      use ultrasound guidance to accurately inject these nerves. These injections have never been
      described for SHS patients however, so investigators want to make sure people with SHS can go
      through with the injections without too much pain or discomfort. That is, the investigators
      want to test the tolerance of these injections for people with SHS. Investigators are also
      hoping to better understand how consistent a set of diagnostic criteria, called the Budapest
      criteria, are at diagnosing SHS in order to be able to accurately diagnose this condition.

    <measure>Tolerability of Suprascapular and Median Nerve Blockade</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the tolerability of ultrasound-guided suprascapular and median nerve blocks in stroke patients with SHS as determined using the Budapest criteria. Since tolerability is a subjective measure, it will be defined by a composite outcome including: A) Pain score prior to, during, and immediately following the procedure as measured by the visual analog scale (VAS); B) the rate of serious adverse events associated with this procedure; and C) the level of patient acceptance and satisfaction as determined by a validated post-procedure survey.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inter-rater Agreement of Budapest Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess the reproducibility of the Budapest clinical criteria for newly suspected cases of SHS. This will be achieved by estimating the level of inter-rater agreement between a resident and a staff physician working in stroke rehabilitation. Investigators will thus determine if there is variability in the clinical diagnosis among physicians with different levels of expertise.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are required to be 18 years of age or older and have a presumptive diagnosis
             of SHS post-stroke with a minimum visual analog scale of 40mm (greater than 40mm is
             considered moderate pain).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they have significant cognitive impairment
             (mini-mental state examination &lt;23) and language deficits (difficulty cooperating due
             to aphasia) as this may affect their response to the outcome measures. Subjects with
             uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;180/110), septicemia, and brachial plexus injuries will be
             excluded. Patients who are blind and deaf will also be excluded, as they will be
             unable to adequately complete the post-procedure survey and VAS. Patients on
             anticoagulation medications will also be excluded on a case-by-case basis and
             medications will be held prior to injection if required for safety. Patients with INR
             &gt;1.5 will be excluded.
