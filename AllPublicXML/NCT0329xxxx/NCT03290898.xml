    <textblock>
      To evaluate if physical exercise intervention leads to an improved asthma control as measured
      by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) in such a magnitude that inhaled corticosteroid can
      be reduces in asthmatics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 102 asthmatics will be randomized 2:1 (2 to training group; 1 to control) and
      undergo 6 months of intervention or usual lifestyle.

      Subjects must have confirmed asthma diagnosis, on a stable treatment with inhaled
      corticosteroid, symptomatic and untrained.

      At enrollment and during the study asthma medicine is adjusted based on asthma symptoms
      evaluated by ACQ-5. 6 treatment steps are pre-defined, and if well controlled asthma,
      subjects are down-titrated one step, if uncontrolled, subjects are uptitrated one step.
