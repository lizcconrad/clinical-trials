  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of about 1
      per cent, the symptoms can be very disabling and causing a heavy medical and socioeconomic.

      There are significant variations from one population to another. Clinical manifestations of
      schizophrenia (symptoms, evolution, severity of disability) are highly variable. This
      variability, both epidemiological and clinical, is due to genetic and environmental factors.

      Environmental factors may be either risk factors or modifying factors (changing clinical
      presentation but do not alter the risk of disease) for schizophrenia.

      Environmental risk factors have been identified (eg: urbanity, cannabis, migration), but the
      investigators don't know neither the components directly responsible, nor the mechanisms by
      which they increase the risk of schizophrenia.

      To date, there is no study has systematically evaluated the role of environmental modifying
      factors in schizophrenia.

      Environmental factors may be individual, unique to each person (eg cannabis, migration.), or
      population-based (eg ethnic density, socio-economic difficulties.) The identification/
      identifying of environmental risk factors or modifiers, both individual and population, may
      have theoretical implications (understanding of etiopathogenic mechanisms) and practical
      (implementation of preventive measures). The potential effectiveness of preventive measures
      is even greater than the risk attributable to certain environmental factors is important.

      Most studies on environmental factors in schizophrenia were conducted in Anglo-Saxon
      countries and northern Europe, but no study of these risk factors has been conducted in
      France.

      There are important differences environment based on study populations, these results are not
      generalizable to other countries, including France.
