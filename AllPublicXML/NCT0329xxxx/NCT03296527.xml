          -  Hysterosalpingography, hysteroscopy, saline infusion sonography, or transvaginal
             ultrasound documenting a uterus consistent with expected normal function (e.g. no
             evidence of clinically interfering uterine fibroids defined as submucous or intramural
             fibroids larger than 3 cm in diameter, no polyps and no congenital structural

             ovaries, without evidence of significant abnormality (e.g. enlarged ovaries which
             would contraindicate the use of gonadotropins) and normal adnexa (e.g. no
             hydrosalpinx) within 1 year prior to randomisation. Both ovaries must be accessible
             for oocyte retrieval.

          -  Known abnormal karyotype of subject or of her partner / sperm donor, as applicable,
             depending on source of sperm used for insemination in this trial.

          -  Any known clinically significant systemic disease (e.g. insulin-dependent diabetes).

          -  Known inherited or acquired thrombophilia disease.

          -  Active arterial or venous thromboembolism or severe thrombophlebitis, or a history of

             which would contraindicate the use of gonadotropins.

          -  Known moderate or severe impairment of renal or hepatic function.

          -  Any abnormal finding of clinical chemistry, haematology or vital signs at screening
             which is clinically significant as judged by the investigator.

             cycle before randomisation.

          -  Known history of chemotherapy (except for gestational conditions) or radiotherapy.

          -  Current or past (1 year prior to randomisation) abuse of alcohol or drugs.
