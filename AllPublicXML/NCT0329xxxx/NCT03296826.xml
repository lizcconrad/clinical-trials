      To determine the incidence and risk factors in the development of ovarian, fallopian tube,
      and peritoneal cancers in Japanese women carrying Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene (BRCA)1/2
      variants.

      1. To estimate the incidence of ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers in women
           carrying BRCA1/2 variants.

        2. To investigate risk factors concerning the development of ovarian, fallopian tube, and
           peritoneal cancers (loci of BRCA1/2 genetic variants, modifier genes, genetic
           polymorphism, hormones, and lifestyle habits.) in women carrying BRCA1/2 variants.

        3. To estimate the detection rates of occult cancer based on histopathological evaluations,
           using risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO).

        4. To examine the risk-reducing effect of RRSO on the development of ovarian, fallopian
           tube, and peritoneal cancers in women carrying BRCA1/2 variants, and compare with those
           not undergoing RRSO.

        5. To identify clinicopathological features in women carrying BRCA1/2 variants who had
           undergone RRSO.

        6. To identify the appropriate interval or degree of surveillance.
