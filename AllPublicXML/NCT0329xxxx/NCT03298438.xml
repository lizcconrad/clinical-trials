    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common autosomal dominant genetic
      disorders. The aim of our study was to evaluate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in
      patients and their families following the disclosure of sporadic NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 was
      retained according to NIH criteria, familial forms were excluded. The French version of the
      Impact of Event Scale-Revised was used for the diagnosis of PTSD.
