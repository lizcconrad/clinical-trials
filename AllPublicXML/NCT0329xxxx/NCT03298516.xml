  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ia/Ib, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      preliminary efficacy of DCLL9718S as a single agent (Phase Ia, Arm A) in participants with
      relapsed or refractory AML or in combination with azacitidine (Phase Ib, Arm B) in
      participants with previously untreated AML who are not eligible for intensive induction
      chemotherapy. Each arm will consist of two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion
      stage. The dose-escalation stage is designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for DCLL9718S alone (Arm A) or in combination with
      azacitidine (Arm B). The dose-expansion stage is designed to characterize the long-term
      safety and tolerability of DCLL9718S.
