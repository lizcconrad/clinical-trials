  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infection causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and is involved
      in the development of gastric cancer.

      Current accepted strategies to eliminate the infection in children are a 10 days sequential
      treatment (proton pump inhibitor + amoxicillin 5 days followed by proton pump inhibitor +
      metronidazole + clarithromycin 5 days) or a triple therapy 14 days (proton pump inhibitor +
      amoxicillin + clarithromycin or metronidazole).

      However, there is a concern due to the growing resistance of Helicobacter pylori strains to
      antibiotics, especially clarithromycin, and the decreased efficacy of first line treatment
      regimens to satisfactorily eliminate the infection in children.

      Recent data show that combinations using bismuth salts must be considered in adults. Indeed,
      the efficacy of a 10 days of quadruple therapy with omeprazole plus a single three-in-one
      capsule containing bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole and tetracycline was shown to be highly
      superior to the standard triple therapy combining omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin
      without related severe adverse events.

      The possibility of re-using bismuth salts on a more regular basis in pediatrics is being
      restudied through a monocentric, prospective, open label, single arm clinical trial to assess
      the safety and efficacy of a 10 days colloidal bismuth sub-citrate as an adjunctive therapy
      in combination with esomeprazole, amoxicillin and metronidazole in children aged 6-17 years,
      infected by Helicobacter pylori.
