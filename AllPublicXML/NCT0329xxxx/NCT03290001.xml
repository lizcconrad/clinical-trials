      This is a prospective, observational cohort study aimed to explore the influence of anxiety
      and depression to long term survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in Southern China and Southeast Asia. Radiotherapy
      (RT) and chemotherapy are the mainstays of therapy for NPC because these tumors are
      biologically highly radiosensitive and chemosensitive. Anxiety and depression symptoms were
      common psychological symptoms around the time of cancer diagnosis and were often persistent
      during cancer treatment. Psychological symptoms are associated with prolonged hospital stays,
      lower quality of life, and worse treatment adherence among patients with cancer. Depressive
      symptoms have been demonstrated to predict early mortality among patients with some kinds of
      cancer. But among NPC patients, the influence of anxiety and depression symptoms to long term
      survival have not be explored. Therefore, this prospective, observational cohort study aimed
      to explore the influence of anxiety and depression to long term survival in NPC patients.

    <measure>Overall Survival(OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The OS was defined as the duration from the date of registration assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival(LRFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The LRFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of registration until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit.</description>

    <measure>Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete Response (CR)</measure>
    <time_frame>completion of radiation therapy (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>CR assessed by independent reviewers, according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Disease response evaluated after the completion of the treatment. Complete response defined as the complete disappearance of the target and non-target lesion(s) identified at baseline after radiological evaluation by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) only.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, completion of radiation therapy (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Weight loss was calculated as the relative percent of weight changes between weight measurement before and after the nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment. Weight loss was calculated from the following formula:（ pro-treatment body weight - post-treatment body weight）/ pro-treatment body weight.</description>
