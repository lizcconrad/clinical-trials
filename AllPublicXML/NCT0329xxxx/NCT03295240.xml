      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Venetoclax in combination with FDA
      approved treatments Bendamustine, Rituximab and Ibrutinib (BR-I). This study will examine the
      effects Venetoclax has on participants when it is given in combination with BR-I.

          -  Patients who have been previously treated with BR are eligible, provided they did not
             progress during or within 6 months of completing BR treatment

          -  Patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant more than 3 months prior
             are eligible

          -  Patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant within 12 months, without
             active graft-versus-host-disease, and not on immunosuppression for prevention of
             graft-versus-host disease are eligible

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per
             year during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of
             venetoclax or 18 months after the last dose of rituximab, whichever is longer

               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (&gt;/= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea

                  to avoid exposing the embryo.

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
