    <textblock>
      To analyze the HIV viral sequences present in the CD32 + CD4a + T lymphocytes of the patients
      who have participated in the ANRS 139 TRIO trial, always followed and in virological success,
      and carrying multi-resistant viruses archived in the HIV cell reservoir, in order to
      reconstruct the chronology of the installation of this reservoir.

      Objectives

      Principal objective

      To analyze the HIV viral sequences present in the CD32 + CD4a + T lymphocytes of the patients
      who have participated in the ANRS 139 TRIO trial, always followed and in virological success,
      and carrying multi-resistant viruses archived in the HIV cell reservoir, in order to
      reconstruct the chronology of the installation of this reservoir.

      Secondary objectives

      To analyze the HIV viral sequences present in the CD4 + lymphocytes with other membrane HIV
      reservoir markers, currently being identified, in these same patients

      Methodology

      Pathophysiological study, in patients infected by multi drug-resistant viruses

      Estimated enrollment

      21 participants (total and per group)

      Intervention

      167mL blood sample in EDTA tube:

        -  160mL (16 tubes of 10mL): for IGH (Institute of Human Genetics-Montpellier)

        -  7mL (1tube of 7mL): to measure HIV-RNA in centers

      Estimated planning or Study / Trial timetable

      Study start date: September 2017

      Enrollment period: 12 months

      Total study duration: 24 months (analyses included)

      Estimated study/trial completion date: September 2019 (one year after enrollment of the last
      patient)

      Study design

      Cross-sectional survey, 167mL of blood in EDTA tube will be obtained on a research visit,
      after signature of written informed consent

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who participated to ANRS139 TRIO trial, and still followed in centers

          -  Who remained in virological success since the participation at the trial: 90% of HIV-1
             RNA level less than 50 copies/mL : one or more blips less than 1000 copies/mL are
             tolerated

             not a social security system).

          -  Written informed consent signed by the person and the investigator before any exam
             performed in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 1000 copies/mL at least once since the end of the 139 TRIO trial

          -  Patient participating in another research evaluating other treatments with an
             exclusion period ongoing at the screening visit.

          -  Person under legal guardianship or deprived of liberty by a judicial or administrative
             decision.
