  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that treatment with etelcalcetide (AMG 416) is not inferior to treatment with
      cinacalcet for lowering serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels by &gt; 30% from baseline
      among subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) who
      require management with hemodialysis.
