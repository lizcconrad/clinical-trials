      Background and Objectives: Double-jaw surgery is one of the most painful oral surgery,
      requiring multimodal analgesia including controlled morphine pump and its secondary effects.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of face block (mandibulary and
      maxillary block analgesia) on the first 24 hours on morphine consumption in patients admitted
      for double jaw surgery.

      Methods: Patients undergoing double-jaw surgery between January 2015 and May 2017 were
      enrolled. Patients were separated into 2 groups: patients receiving maxillary-mandibulary
      nerve block and those no receiving it. The primary endpoint was the morphine consumption
      within 24 hours post-surgery. Secondary endpoints were the intra-operative remifentanil
      consumption, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting at 24 hours, morphine consumption
      in recovery room, length of stay in hospital.

    <description>A Pajunk SonoPlex Stim needle 22G x 55 mm was used. For maxillary nerve block, needle was introduced next to the angle of the orbitae and the zygomatic ridge. The needle was sank until coming into contact of the temporal bone. It was then orientated to the controlateral nostril and sank of 1 cm. For mandibular block, needle was introduced in the pterygoid fossa under and perpendicularly to the zygomatic arch, and sank until the pterygoid process. The needle was then orientated towards controlateral orbitae and sank with neurostimulation. After a motor response at 0.6 milliampere (mA) and the disappearance of contraction at 0.3 mA, local mixture was injected. The mixing of local anesthesia was made of ropivacaine 5 mg/mL and clonidine 30 µg. Five mL were injected in every block for a total of 20 mL.</description>

    <description>Anesthesia was standardized and provided using intravenous administration of propofol and remifentanil. Patients were mechanically ventilated with a mixture of air (50/50), and desflurane or sevoflurane, or Target-controlled infusion (TCI) propofol. One to 5 mg/kg of methyl-prednisolone were administered to reduce inflammatory response.</description>
