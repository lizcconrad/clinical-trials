    <textblock>
      This Five, Plus Nuts and Beans for Kidneys Study is a single center, randomized controlled
      trial with 2 parallel arms testing the hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to
      adopt a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-like diet and $30/week worth of
      fruits, vegetables, nuts and beans tailored to personal choices and availability in
      neighborhood stores, will reduce kidney damage in African Americans with hypertension and
      chronic kidney disease.

      This study will test the effectiveness of dietary advice delivered by a study coach and
      assistance with weekly online ordering of $30/week worth of potassium rich foods delivered by
      a local grocer to a community location for reducing urinary albumin excretion among African
      Americans with hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Participants will be recruited from
      primary care clinics in Baltimore, MD.

      150 African American adults diagnosed with hypertension and with mild/moderate chronic kidney
      disease based on the presence of albuminuria will be randomly assigned to one of two arms for
      12 months. There are 2 phases of the study. In Phase 1 (months 1-4), one study arm will
      consist of minimal guidance from the study team and a weekly allowance of $30 dollars to
      purchase food and drinks of their choosing from a local grocer. During Phase 1, the second
      arm of the study will receive dietary guidance from the study coach and assistance with
      ordering and purchasing $30/week worth of high potassium foods from the same local grocer. In
      Phase 2 (months 5-12) neither study arm will receive a food allowance, however the second arm
      will receive telephonic visits and dietary advice from the study coach.

    <description>The Self-Shopping DASH group will receive printed patient-centered materials on the DASH diet and chronic kidney disease. Participants will also receive $30/week allowance for the purchase of food and drinks of their choosing from a local grocer (Klein's ShopRite stores of Maryland) during the first four months. During the remainder of the study (months 5-12), the participants in this group will be asked to continue to follow the dietary advice provided but will not receive the food allowance.</description>

    <description>The C-DASH group intervention will be a patient-tailored program, delivered by a study coach that is trained by a dietitian, which emphasizes key self-management behaviors - diet and self-monitoring. This group will receive advice from the study coach and purchase $30 worth of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts and beans that are high in potassium on a weekly basis for the first four months.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the C-DASH diet advice group will be provided $30/week worth of fruits, vegetables, nuts and beans ordered through the study coach and delivered to a community location to reach a certain goal of potassium intake (months 0-4). During phase 2 of the study (months 5-12), a study coach will continue telephonic contact with the participants to set goals for following a DASH-like diet without the weekly food allowance.</description>
