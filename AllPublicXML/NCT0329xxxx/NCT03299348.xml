      This study examines the efficacy of a psycho-educational intervention program, AgingPLUS,
      with regard to increasing middle-aged and older adults' engagement in physical activity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AgingPLUS is a multi-component intervention program that addresses negative views of aging
      (NVOA), low internal control beliefs, and deficient goal planning as a risk cluster that
      keeps adults from engaging in health-promoting behavior. The program focuses on engagement in
      physical activity (PA) as the health behavior of choice. Engagement in PA is widely
      recognized as the best non-pharmacological, non-invasive, and cost-effective method of health
      promotion. Yet, only 20% of the adult population meets the recommended PA guidelines. This
      suggests that messages about the benefits of PA alone are not effective. Rather, it is
      essential to address the social-cognitive and motiva-tional mechanisms that prevent adults
      from adopting and maintaining a regular PA regimen. NVOA, low internal control beliefs, and
      deficient goal planning represent such a cluster of social-cognitive and motivational
      mechanisms.

      Given this background, the specific aims and hypotheses of the proposed research are:

      Aim 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of the AgingPLUS
      program.

      Aim 2: To test a conceptual model of the mechanisms underlying the intervention effects.

      Aim 3: To conduct a 6-month follow-up to examine the longer-term effects of AgingPLUS.

      Upon completion of this project, we expect to have successfully established evidence for the
      efficacy of the AgingPLUS program (Stage II of the NIH Stage Mode). The long-term goal is to
      develop AgingPLUS into a full-fledged evidence-based program that can be implemented in
      community settings (e.g., senior centers), and can serve as a fairly brief and cost-effective
      public health tool to promote healthy and successful aging.

    <description>The program consists of 2-hour meetings for a total of 4 weeks (total of 8 hours) and discusses (a) how negative views on aging and negative age stereotypes undermine adults' health-promoting behaviors; (b) how adults can take control of their own aging; and (c) how personal goals can be achieved through more effective goal planning and action plans.</description>
