  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive gestational weight gain is a major public health problem. Traditional face-to-face
      intervention programs has been shown to be succesful in order to promote healthier weight
      gains, however, they are time-consuming and expensive. The objectives of this study are to
      assess whether a 6-month smartphone application can promote healthy gestational weight gain,
      dietary habits and physical activity in pregnant women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) increases risks for pregnancy complications,
      postpartum weight retention and offspring obesity. Traditional intervention programs are time
      and cost intensive. Mobile technology (mHealth) has been successful for weight loss and
      behavior changes; however, their use in pregnancy need to be further examined. This study
      aims to evaluate the impact of a smartphone application (app) intervention on GWG, diet,
      physical activity and glucose homeostasis.

      HealthyMoms is a randomized controlled trial recruiting women at the first maternity clinic
      visit (week 6-10) in the Linköping area, Sweden. Women will be randomized to the control or
      intervention group (n=300 per group). All women will receive standard care. The intervention
      group will also receive the HealthyMoms smartphone app promoting healthy eating, activity and
      GWG during 6 months. Pregnancy outcomes are GWG (primary), food intake (web-based
      questionnaire), fat mass (BodPod), glucose homeostasis, activity (accelerometer) in week 37.
      Maternal and infant body fatness will be assessed one week post partum.
