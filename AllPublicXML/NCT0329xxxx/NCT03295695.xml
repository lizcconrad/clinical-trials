  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase 0 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PET-CT scans with
      FDG-labeled RBC in patients with breast cancer.

      Cardiac ejection fraction can be calculated and monitored in breast cancer patients during
      chemotherapy using a FDG-RBC PET-CT scan. The purpose of this study is to determine if
      calculated cardiac ejection fraction shows high concordance with results from
      echocardiography.

    <description>Study agent: 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). Fluoro-D-glucose-positron Emission Tomography: Participants will undergo a PET-CT scan with Fluoro-D-glucose-labeled (FDG-labeled) red blood cells (RBCs) within 2 weeks of obtaining an echocardiogram prior to start of chemotherapy. A repeat FDG-RBC PET-CT scan will be completed within two weeks of obtaining their follow-up echocardiogram to determine post-therapy cardiac ejection fraction. If the participant has an echocardiogram obtained prior to completion of chemotherapy, an attempt will be made to obtain a FDG-RBC PET-CT scan within two weeks of the echocardiogram.</description>

Synthesized RBCs: The cell suspension is manually infused via syringe through an indwelling peripheral venous catheter over the course of 1 minute, using an infusion method approved by the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) radiation safety officer.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed breast cancer and be scheduled for
             neoadjuvant Trastuzumab- or anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky &gt;60%).

          -  Must be able to complete an informed consent process.

          -  Must have normal organ and marrow function: leukocytes &gt;3,000/μL; absolute neutrophil
             count &gt;1,500/μL; platelets &gt;100,000/μL; total bilirubin within normal institutional
             limits; aspartate aminotransferase (AST)[SGOT] / alanine aminotransferase (ALT)[SGPT]:
             less than 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal; Creatinine within normal
             institutional limits - OR - creatinine clearance&gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with
             creatinine level above institutional normal.

          -  Echocardiogram results should be of sufficiently suitable quality (adequate acoustic
             window access) to provide a reliable ejection fraction range calculation. The cardiac
             ejection fraction on the pre-treatment echocardiogram should be 50% or higher.

          -  Participants should be naïve to Trastuzumab or anthracycline chemotherapy prior to
             enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of invasive breast cancer and treatment with anthracycline chemotherapy.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to FDG.

          -  Known symptomatic coagulopathies, bleeding diathesis, hemoglobinopathies, or hemolytic
             anemia.

          -  Participants should have no clinically significant heart disease such as congestive
             heart failure. Participants should not have other significant structural heart disease
             by echocardiogram, or cardiac dysrhythmia on standard of care electrocardiogram that
             may adversely affect the cardiac imaging results obtained with FDG-RBC PET-CT imaging.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Found to have a cardiac ejection fraction less than 50% on the pre-treatment
             echocardiogram.
