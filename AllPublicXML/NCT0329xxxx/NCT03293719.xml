  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective Post-Market Clinical Follow up study according to MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev2 of the
      European Union. Patients receiving the primary knee implant BPK-S UC as primary implant in
      either variant ceramic or CoCr (metal) are eligible for the study and will be followed up for
      5 years after implantation or until revision of the prosthesis, whichever occurs first.
      Demographic data will be collected together with data regarding safety and benefit at defined
      timepoints (preoperative, intraoperative and at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after
      implantation).

      Patients will be divided in 2 cohorts (ceramic and metal) and stratified by age.
