    <textblock>
      This is a study to test the safety and effectiveness of the study drug, daratumumab in
      combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The purpose of this study is to
      test whether giving daratumumab along with the other drugs (carfilzomib, lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone) is safe for patients.
