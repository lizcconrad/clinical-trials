      This study is testing whether stratification of the patients according to biological risk
      factors for different treatment groups will improve the outcome of patients with clinically
      high diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For young clinically high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients the optimal
      therapy has not been established. Previous Nordic phase II studies, where dose-dense
      chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOEP-14) with systemic CNS prophylaxis (HD-Mtx and HD-AraC) was given,
      demonstrated favorable outcome in comparison to historical controls. However, the patients
      with biological risk factors, such as translocation of bcl2 and myc oncogenes or and/or high
      BCL2 and MYC expression or deletion 17p and/or high P53 expression had significantly higher
      risk of death, as compared to patients without aberrations. The figures provide evidence for
      an unmet clinical need for the patients with biological risk factors, and underscore the
      importance of a clinical trial, where both biological and clinical risk factors play a role
      in the treatment planning.

      In this trial treatment intensity varies according to presence or absence of biological risk
      factors. All patients receive a prephase medication consisting of prednisone and vincristine
      and two cycles of R-CHOP and high dose (HD) methotrexate. Subsequently, depending on the
      biological risk factors either four additional cycles of R-CHOEP (standard arm with no risk
      factors) or four dose adjusted R-EPOCH courses (experimental arm with risk factors) are
      given, followed by one course of high dose cytarabine (Ara-C) and R. R-CHOEP courses should
      be given with a two-week and R-EPOCH with a three-week interval.
