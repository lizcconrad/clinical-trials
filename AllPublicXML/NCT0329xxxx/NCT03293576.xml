  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the use of implementation intentions to increase self-efficacy and reduce
      injecting risk behaviour in a sample of injecting drug users on treatment for hepatitis C
      (HCV). The overall aim is to reduce HCV reinfection rates. The primary objective is to
      identify lower injecting risk behaviour scores in patients on treatment for hepatitis C
      receiving the psychosocial intervention compared to the same patient group assigned to the
      control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will entail completing a volitional help sheet.This will create
      implementation intentions, which are self-regulatory strategies taking the form of &quot;if-then&quot;
      plans (i.e. situation-solution plan).

      Injecting risk behaviour scores and self-efficacy scores will be analysed for differences
      between intervention and control groups.

      To control for contact-time with the researchers, participants in the control group will
      spend approximately 20 minutes with the researcher exploring Zimbardo's time perspective
      constructs (ZTPI, Zimbardo &amp; Boyd, 1999) and completing the short Zimbardo's time perspective
      inventory (Orosz et al. 2017). The inventory was selected because the cognitive processes
      involved in accessing time constructs will also be activated in the intervention group for
      the planning of coping strategies and goal achievement during future injecting risk
      situations.

      The study also aims:

        -  To assess the variability in injecting risk behaviour as explained by subjective norms,
           social connectedness and group identification constructs;

        -  To assess the variability in intervention effectiveness as explained by changes in
           mental health, illness perception subjective norms, social connectedness, and group
           identification;

        -  To determine the difference in therapeutic alliance between care pathways and to
           establish its mediating role on injecting risk behaviour, SVR rates and HCV reinfection
           rates.

    <description>This brief intervention will last around 20 minutes. The participants and the researcher will read through the list of real-life solutions the participants might find applicable to them. They will then read through the list of situations one by one. The participant will draw a coloured line between the situation and the solution which seems more appropriate to them. The volitional help sheet helps create implementation intentions, which are self-regulatory strategies taking the form of &quot;if-then&quot; plans (i.e. situation-solution plan).</description>
