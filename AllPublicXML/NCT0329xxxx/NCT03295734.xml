      The purpose of this project is to conduct a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to determine
      if choice of antihypertensive medication influences changes in functional status and other
      cardiovascular risk factors among older persons with hypertension when combined with physical
      exercise.

      The purpose of this project is to conduct a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to determine
      if choice of antihypertensive medication influences changes in functional status and other
      cardiovascular risk factors among older persons with hypertension. Functional status,
      determined by measures of physical performance, is an important predictor of cardiovascular
      outcomes in older adults. Seniors with compromised function experience more CV events, have a
      higher risk of undergoing cardiac surgery and higher risk of CVD-related death than
      higher-functioning peers. Seniors with hypertension experience accelerated declines in
      function, and presently physical exercise is the primary strategy for preventing this
      decline. However, functional responses to exercise are highly variable and appear to be
      influenced by the type of antihypertensive medication(s) utilized to control blood pressure.
      Preliminary evidence suggests that, compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents,
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enhance exercise-derived improvements in
      functional status among hypertensive seniors. This RCT will test this hypothesis. Sedentary
      men and women &gt; 60 years of age with functional limitations and hypertension will be
      recruited from two sites to participate in a longitudinal intervention study. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of three first-line antihypertensive agents: (1) the ACE
      inhibitor perindopril, (2) AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, or (3) the thiazide diuretic
      hydrochlorothiazide. All participants will also participate in a structured aerobic exercise
      intervention. The primary aim is to determine if, compared to losartan and HCTZ, perindopril
      improves self-paced gait speed. The secondary aim is to determine the relative effect of
      perindopril on a) exercise capacity, b) body mass and composition, and c) circulating indices
      of cardiovascular risk. This study is expected to differentiate beneficial effects of three
      FDA-approved antihypertensive medications on an emerging cardiovascular risk factor in a
      clinically-relevant population. Thus the study has important implications for expeditiously
      influencing clinical practice guidelines in the prescription of antihypertensive drugs to
      millions of Americans.
