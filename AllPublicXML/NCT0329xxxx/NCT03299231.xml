  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sputum production increases in acute exacerbation of COPD, both in amount and consistency. It
      increases airways obstruction and hence delays improvement and prolongs hospital stay.
      oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) devices were extensively studied in cystic
      fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Only seldom studied in chronic bronchitis. This study aims to
      measure the effects of mucous clearing device in hospitalized patients with acute
      exacerbation of COPD.

      In this study, investigators will investigate the change of objective measurements of lung
      functions and exercise capacity in addition to subjective measures of quality of life.

    <description>Group of participants with COPD, hospitalized for severe exacerbation and using the active oscillating positive expiratory pressure device (OPEP). The device is a hand held one. Used mostly in subjects with bronchiectasis for mucus clearing. Estimated number of subjects in this arm is 80. The device has an adjustable resistance which will be set by a health care provider in the study team. The device is to be used three times daily from 10 to 20 minutes according to subject's effort.</description>
