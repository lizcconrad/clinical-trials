  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute leukemia relapsing after allotransplant and who respond to anti-leukaemia
      interventions are at high-risk of a second relapse. Previous studies from investigators
      reported an association between a positive minimal residual disease (MRD)-test after
      transplant and an increased risk of subsequent relapse. Also, patients developing chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after receiving DLI (donor lymphocyte infusion)for leukemia
      relapse after a first allotransplant have a lower likelihood of a second relapse compared
      with similar patients not developing chronic GvHD. And, our previous study also reported
      patients with chronic GvHD after DLI was associated with a greater frequency of a negative
      MRD-test and lower likelihood of subsequent relapse compared with similar persons not
      developing chronic GvHD. Based on these data the investigators designed a randomized control
      study to determine whether giving additional consolidation chemotherapy and DLI might
      decrease likelihood of second relapse in persons without chronic GvHD or with a positive
      MRD-test after initial post-relapse therapy with induction chemotherapy and DLI.
