    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention, to reduce
      the risk of metabolic syndrome in patients with serious mental illness who receive treatment
      with antipsychotic medications.

      The hypothesis of the study is that: the application of a physical health promotion program
      in people with serious mental illness, who receive treatment with antipsychotic medications,
      carried out by a mental health nurse, will decrease the presence of metabolic syndrome and
      contribute to improve their quality of life.
