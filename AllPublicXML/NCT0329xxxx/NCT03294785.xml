    <textblock>
      A multi-center randomized controlled, parallel, assessor-blinded trial will be conducted to
      evaluate the comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Chuna manual
      therapy for chronic neck pain patients compared to usual care as assessed using pain,
      functional disability, health-related quality of life, economic evaluation, and safety
      measures.

    <description>The Chuna manual therapy group will receive Chuna manual therapy alone. Chuna manual therapy will employ a semi-standardized treatment plan of Chuna manual therapy through Chuna technique selection based on physician judgement of techniques from Chuna Medicine (Korean Society of Chuna Manual Medicine for Spine &amp; Nerves: Chuna Medicine: Seoul: Korean Society of Chuna Manual Medicine for Spine &amp; Nerves; 2017) and osteopathic manipulative medicine. The Chuna techniques employed in this study are divided into cervical, thoracic and rib cage, lumbar, pelvic, sacral, pubic, and hip joint area techniques. Chuna manual therapy sessions will be administered 2 sessions/week over a period of 5 weeks (total 10 sessions). The time duration of 1 Chuna manual therapy session will consist of approximately 10-20 minutes of diagnosis and approximately 10 minutes of treatment.</description>

    <description>The usual care group will receive usual care alone. Usual care will be limited to physical therapy and conventional medication in this study. Usual care will be provided with reference to a list of most frequently used treatments in neck pain-related patients from Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) 2014 statistics. Frequency and types of physical therapy used will be recorded in a separate electronic case report form for outcome assessor blinding purposes.</description>

    <description>Chuna is a Korean manual therapy that has absorbed and incorporated aspects of osteopathic manipulative medicine. Chuna manual therapy utilizes spinal manipulation techniques for joint mobilization including high-velocity, low amplitude thrusts to joints slightly beyond the passive range of motion and gentle force to joints within the passive range of movement, muscle energy, and fascial techniques.</description>
