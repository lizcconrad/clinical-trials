  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, randomized controlled trial which compares continued treatment
      with high dose prednisone (standard therapy) to treatment with rituximab in patients with
      minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis unresponsive to 8 weeks of high
      dose prednisone .

      patients either receive 2 doses of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv at time 0 and 14 days with
      termination of prednisone or standard therapy which consist of 8 additional weeks of high
      dose prednisone treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are important
      causes of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. First-line treatment with high dose prednisone up to
      16 weeks is associated with serious side effects. Especially if treatment continues for more
      than 8 weeks.

      Retrospective studies suggested that Rituximab may be more effective in patients unresponsive
      to 8 weeks of high dose prednisone. Treatment with rituximab was associated with a higher
      proportion of patients attaining remission of proteinuria and with fewer side effects.

      This will be an open-label, randomized controlled trial which compares continued treatment
      with high dose prednisone (standard therapy) to treatment with rituximab in patients with an
      idiopathic nephrotic syndrome due to biopsy proven MCD or FSGS age 18 years or older.

      All patients will be treated with high dose prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks.

      Patients can be included in the trial in case of persistent persistent proteinuria ≥ 2 g/ 24
      hours or a protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 2 g/10mmol (2 g/g) after 8 weeks of treatment with
      high dose prednisone

      Patients either receive 2 doses of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv at time 0 and 14 days with
      termination of prednisone or standard therapy which consist of 8 additional weeks of high
      dose prednisone treatment. In the Rituximab group, B-cells will be monitored weekly, and if
      no complete depletion is achieved, additional dose(s) of Rituximab will be given at a weekly
      interval (maximum of 2 additional doses) until complete B cell depletion.

      Expected duration of the follow-up is 12 months, consisting of 9 visits.
