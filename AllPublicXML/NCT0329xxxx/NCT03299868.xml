    <textblock>
      To establish the IV access strategy for terminally ill cancer patients, using comparisons of
      the safety, efficacy, and patient-perceived satisfaction between the initially routine PICC
      insertion group (routine PICC group) and general IV access group (optional PICC group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reliable intravenous (IV) access is an important issue in terminally ill cancer patients,
      however, they have limited or no peripheral venous access due to edema or long period of IV
      therapy. Thus, intravenous access has been provided by Central venous catheter (CVC).

      There are some options for applying CVC in cancer patients; subclavian venous catheter (SVC),
      chemo-port (CP), and the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC).

      When considering the characteristics of terminally ill cancer patients, such as poor general
      condition and a limited period of survival, PICC could be a safe and effective method for
      intravenous access.

      There are two previous studies concerned about PICC study in terminally ill cancer patients.
      They showed that PICC might be overall safe and efficient in terminally ill cancer patients.
      However, these studies did not evaluate superiority of PICC insertion compared to no
      insertion and the appropriate time for PICC insertion due to limitation of their design, such
      as retrospective or single-arm observational study. Thus, strategies of PICC insertion for IV
      access in terminally ill cancer patients have not been determined until now.

      Considering the favorable results of PICC insertion in previous studies and limited survival
      time of terminally ill cancer patients, the investigator postulated that routine PICC
      insertion at the time of admission for terminal care would be effective for IV access.

      Thus, the investigator assumed that initially routine PICC insertion would be non-inferior in
      maintenance success rate / and complication rate compared to general IV access. In addition,
      it would be superior in patient-perceived satisfaction. The inveistigator will undertake a
      randomized phase II study to confirm the hypothesis.
