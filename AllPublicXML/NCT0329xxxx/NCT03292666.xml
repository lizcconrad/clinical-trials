  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research seeks to provide insights on the contemporary epidemiology, treatment,
      and outcomes of VTE, including examining the uptake of new treatment strategies, the efficacy
      and safety of different anticoagulant options, and the impact of venous thromboembolism on
      patient-defined outcomes, such as quality-of-life, symptom burden, and treatment
      satisfaction. This information is crucial to helping clinicians and patients choose between
      various treatment options for venous thromboembolism in order to achieve the best possible
      balance between the risks, benefits, and impact on health.

    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular death and continues to be a
      major public health issue in the United States. The cornerstone of current VTE treatment is
      anticoagulation, typically given for ≥ 3 months during the acute phase of thrombosis.
      Afterwards, extended-duration anticoagulation can be considered for selected higher-risk
      patients. Treatment options for VTE have expanded substantially in recent years, most notably
      through the availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Yet there are many remaining
      gaps in the understanding of how to manage VTE to maximize net clinical benefit.

      The long-range objective of this project is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated
      with VTE in adults and evaluate contemporary treatment patterns and long-term outcomes after
      VTE. This study will assemble an observational cohort of adults with VTE diagnosed between
      2010-2018. Study subjects will be identified from two integrated healthcare delivery systems
      (Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Kaiser Permanente Southern California) and
      followed until December, 2019. Data will be obtained from administrative and electronic
      health records, supplemented with a cross-sectional patient survey.

      The first two aims of this study are to compare the rates of recurrent VTE and hemorrhage
      between (1) extended anticoagulation vs. no extended anticoagulation after VTE; and (2) DOAC
      vs. warfarin treatment of VTE. The third specific aim is to describe patient-defined outcomes
      in adults with VTE in the current treatment era. This will be accomplished by surveying
      subjects with VTE to collect data on generic and disease-specific quality-of-life as well as
      on anticoagulant treatment satisfaction. Combining clinical, outcome, and survey data with
      administrative data will create a contemporary cohort of VTE patients that can serve as a
      rich source of information for use in facilitating comparative effectiveness research
      addressing optimal VTE management within real-world practice settings.
