    <textblock>
      This study shed light on an under-researched area by examining the prognostic associations of
      pre-treatment QoL with overall survival and distant metastasis free survival among patients
      with head and neck cancer who underwent free flap reconstruction. In addition, a validated
      instrument specific to head and neck cancer, i.e. the University of Washington Quality of
      Life Questionnaire (UW-QoL) was adopted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The importance of patient-related outcomes, especially quality of life (QoL) has been
      recently emphasized in the field of oncology. In conjunction with traditional biomedical
      indicators, QoL is recognized as a reliable parameter to reflect the health status of
      patients with malignancy. A growing body of evidence even points out that QoL can produce
      prognostic information which goes beyond biomedical indicators. In particular, since QoL may
      decline before any possible deterioration in health can be detected by existing biomedical
      measures, assessing pre-treatment QoL possibly helps identify the patients who are
      susceptible to a higher risk of mortality after they receive cancer treatment, which may
      greatly facilitate the process of clinical decision making. Despite the importance of
      pre-treatment QoL, its prognostic associations with overall survival and distant metastasis
      free survival still remain relatively under-explored.
