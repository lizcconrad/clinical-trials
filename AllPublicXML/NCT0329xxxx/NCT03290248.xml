      This is a Prospective, Controlled, Double Blinded, Single Center, Randomized, 3 Arm, Parallel
      Assignment, Phase 1b/2a Study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of
      B244 delivered as an intranasal spray in healthy volunteers and subjects with seasonal
      allergic rhinitis. This will be a 2-part study. In Part 1, safety and tolerability will be
      evaluated during 14 days of study treatment twice-a-day followed by 4 weeks of follow-up in
      healthy volunteers. In Part 2, preliminary efficacy will be evaluated in subjects with a
      history of seasonal allergic rhinitis outside of the local pollen season.

      For Part 1 (safety and tolerability evaluation in healthy volunteers) we will enroll 24
      subjects. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by reporting of AEs, physical examination
      and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate) during 14 days of treatment
      and up to 28 days of follow-up.

      An internal safety committee meeting will review the 2 week Part 1 safety data and, if there
      are no safety concerns, the study will proceed to Part 2 to evaluate preliminary efficacy in
      subjects with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR)

      For Part 2 (preliminary efficacy evaluation in subjects with a history of SAR to ragweed
      pollen) will enroll 42 subjects. Safety and tolerability will be assessed in subjects with
      allergic rhinitis by reporting of AEs, physical examination and vital signs (blood pressure,
      heart rate, respiratory rate) during 14 days of treatment.

      For Part 2, study will be paused for safety review using the same stopping criteria as in
      Part 1.

      Rescue medications will not be allowed during the study.
