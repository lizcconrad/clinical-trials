  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although most ground studies showed that an egocentric reference frame better supports
      spatial orientation, it is not proven it will be the same during weightlessness.

      Although it might justify that visuomotor performance will be better supported by egocentric
      target cueing under altered gravity conditions, the fact that exocentric target cueing
      induces less head movements and called for least attentional and physiological workload could
      be the key factors for a more efficient task localization process. Moreover, weightlessness
      can induce spatial disorientation, which can be additionally influenced by the intrinsic and
      extrinsic spatial reference frames (Gurfinkel et al., 1993; Glasauer &amp; Mittelst√§dt, 1997,
      1998; Harm et al., 1998; Lipshits et al. 2005). We expect that during weightlessness the
      workload will be the key factor and thus we hypothesize that an exocentric target cueing will
      outperform egocentric target cueing.

      To test this hypothesis, and find out which presentation scheme for target cueing (EGO, EXO,
      ED) contributes most to an efficient visual search, performance to a visuomotor task will be
      evaluated during parabolic flights in normogravity (1g), hypergravity (1.8g) and microgravity
      (0g). The visuomotor performance will be assessed by a multi-directional tapping task as
      defined by ISO9241-9, which requests for motor responses by aimed pointing movements. Besides
      analyzing the pointing performance, different workload indices will be additionally assessed
      to evaluate the effort spent on visuomotor coordination. The attentional workload will be
      evaluated by the performance of a secondary task (visual reaction-time task), which needs to
      be conducted in parallel to the visuomotor task. Furthermore, the workload will be also
      assessed subjectively by the NASA TLX rating scale and physiologically, by analyzing the
      heart rate variability (HRV).
