  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if among infants &lt;30 weeks gestational age on nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), whether discontinuing CPAP after gradual
      reduction in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressure leads to successful weaning
      off CPAP when compared to discontinuing CPAP without weaning pressure.

    <description>After randomization, CPAP pressure will be weaned by 1 every 24hours as long as the subjects continue to meet stability criteria after each wean, until CPAP of 4. If after decrease in CPAP pressure, the subject meets CPAP failure criteria (described below) pressure will be increased back to the previous level and after stabilization for 24 hours weaning process will be started again. Once the subject meets stability criteria on CPAP of 4, NCPAP will be stopped and subject will be placed on nasal cannula (NC) according to unit guidelines (max 1L flow, 30% FiO2).</description>
