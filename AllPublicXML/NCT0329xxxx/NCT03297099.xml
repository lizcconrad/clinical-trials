  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The indication of laparoscopic surgery is mainly for early regional type hepatolithiasis.
      Open surgery is the traditional treatment method for heptolithiasis. Da Vinci surgical robot
      can overcome limitations of conventional laparoscopic surgery in terms of vision and
      instrumentation flexibility, making the minimally invasive treatment of complex
      hepatolithiasis possible. The study aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy
      of robot assist laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of complicated hepatolithiasis by
      contrast of open procedures.

    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted laparoscopic operation is a safe and feasible treatment for selected patients
      with complicated hepatolithiasis, with an advantage over open surgery in the field of
      intraoperative blood loss, less hilar occlusion, lower transfusion rate, less postoperative
      hospital stay.

    <description>Thirty patients with hepatolithiasis were selected and divided into robot group as described in the detailed description. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine 30-degree reverse Trendelengburg position with both legs separating. The surgeon work on the console, and assist surgeon stand between legs. Operation began with division of liver ligaments, liver mobilization, followed by intrahepatic access to the Glissonian pedicle . A endoscopic stapler devices was used for Glissonian pedicle cutting and suture. Liver parenchyma was divided by harmonic scalpel combined with vascular stapler.</description>

    <description>surgery group as described in the detailed description.Open surgery was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in the supine position. Routinely, a reversed L-shape incision was performed. Operation began with division of liver ligaments, liver mobilization, followed by intrahepatic access to the Glissonian pedicle . A endoscopic stapler devices was used for Glissonian pedicle cutting and suture. Liver parenchyma was divided by harmonic scalpel combined with vascular stapler.</description>
