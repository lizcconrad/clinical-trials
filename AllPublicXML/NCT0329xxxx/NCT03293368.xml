  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After signing the informed consent, the participant will be allocated to either intervention
      or control group, then each participant in the intervention group will receive intralesional
      injections of platelet rich plasma extracted from their own blood in each visit as following:

        1. 12 ml of blood will be assembled from the veins of antecubital fossa

        2. PRP preparation will be done according to Mostafa et al., 2013

        3. 0.5 ml of PRP will be injected per 1 cm2 of ulcerated mucosa

      The second group will receive triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg injected 1 ml per 1 cm2 of
      ulcerated mucosa

      Both groups will receive a total of 4 injection, the injections will be carried out once a
      week.

      Pain, lesions size and remission time are the outcomes will be assessed using a numerical
      rating scale (Seymour, 1982), clinical score according to Thongprasom et al., 1992 and binary
      scale for remission time according to Conrotto et al., 2006, respectively.

      Assessment of the outcomes will be carried before the trial (baseline records) and before
      receiving the treatment in each visit by the primary investigator (H.A.) and the blinded
      assessor (Dr. A.W.) separately.

      Each participant will have a total of 11 visits during the trial, 5 visits will be once every
      week during the trial and every 2 weeks for 3 months treatment free.
