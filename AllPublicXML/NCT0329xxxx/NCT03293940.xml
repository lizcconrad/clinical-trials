      This is a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, treatment control trial with cross-over
      options performed at four sites. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and
      safety of cryoablation therapy for the treatment of post mastectomy pain syndrome.

      Participants will be randomized to receive cryoablation or a therapeutic peripheral nerve
      block injection (tPNB). All participants will be evaluated at baseline and after treatment at
      10 days, 90 days, and 180 days via clinical visits.

      The option to undergo cryoablation or tPNB will be offered to all participants at the end of
      the 90 day post-procedure assessment. Each subject that elects the crossover intervention
      will be assessed over the same time period and in an identical fashion to the initial
      intervention, including a final long term follow up (LTFU) assessment at 180 days
      post-cryoablation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Breast Pain Intensity assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (24 Hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' ratings of perceived pain intensity will be captured with the VAS, a 10cm horizontal line with the extremes labeled, &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;Worst Possible Pain. Participants mark a point along the continuum and it is scored by measuring the distance, in mm, from the &quot;no pain&quot; end to the participant's mark. A greater the distance from the &quot;no pain&quot; mark to the participants mark indicates greater pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of Pain Intensity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (24 Hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS is an 11-point rating scale with 0 = &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 = &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Total scores range from 0-10 points, with higher scores indicating greater pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (Up to 24 Hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is a comprehensive, single-item estimate of treatment-related improvement that asks participants to consider their current status compared to pre-treatment and rate it on a 7-point scale (very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse). Total scores range from 1 to 7; 1 representing no change and 7 representing considerable improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (Up to 24 Hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI captures two broad pain domains: 1) the sensory intensity of pain, and 2) the degree to which pain interferes with different areas of life. Scores are based on the two domains: the pain severity score is the mean of items 3-6 (pain at its worst, pain at its least). The pain interference score is the mean of items 9A-9G (interference of pain with: general activity, mood, walking, normal work, relations, sleep,enjoyment of life). Higher pain scores indicate greater pain and greater interference with daily activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire Short Form 2 (MPQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (Up to 24 Hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The MPQ consists of 24 assessments: 22 questions list a qualitative description of pain symptoms that patients may have felt during the past week and 1 question evaluates present pain intensity, both of which are rated on a numerical rating scale with 0= &quot;None&quot; and 10= &quot;Worst Possible&quot;; the final question evaluates the patient's overall total pain experience on a 6-item scale (no pain, mild, discomforting, distressing, horrible, excruciating). Total scores are on a continuum. The higher the total score, the pain experience for the participant increases.</description>

    <description>The cryoablation procedure, a needle will be inserted and directed toward the target pain area. More than one needle may need to be used. A CT scan will be done during the procedure to help guide the needle which will be held in position by the study doctor(s) once it reaches the target area. With the needle(s) in place, the study doctor(s) will freeze the nerve over 5 minutes. A 3 minutes thaw will follow, then a second 5 minutes freeze and a final 3minute thaw. This portion of the procedure can last from 25 to 45 minutes. Once the nerve has been properly treated, the cryoablation needle(s) will be withdrawn.</description>
