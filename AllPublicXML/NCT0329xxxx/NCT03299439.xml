  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture at highly sensitive
      points, compared with lowly/non-sensitive points or no acupuncture (waiting-list), in
      improving pain, joint function and quality of life, among patients with KOA. The safety of
      acupuncture will also be assessed during the study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the high sensitization group receive acupuncture treatment at the five highly
      sensitive points; Participants in the low/non-sensitization group receive acupuncture
      treatment at the five low/non-sensitive points and all other treatment settings will be the
      same as in the high sensitization group. Patients in the waiting-list group will receive
      standard acupuncture treatment after the study is completed.

    <measure>The change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index total score from baseline to 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 16 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 24 items assessing the knee osteoarthritis patients pain, stiffness, and physical function. Each of the 24 items will be graded on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores reflecting more pain, stiffness and poorer physical function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of Short Form (SF)-12 health survey score from baseline to 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 16 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>It includes 12 items: 2 items on physical functioning, 2 items on role limitations because of physical health problems, 1 item on bodily pain, 1 item on general health perceptions, 1 item on vitality (energy/fatigue), 1 item on social functioning, 2 items on role limitations because of emotional problems, and 2 items on general mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The changes of knee ranges of motion (ROMs) from baseline to 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 16 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The knee ROMs will be assessed both actively and passively by using a standard goniometer. It will include flexion, extension, internal rotation and external rotation.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 16 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The pressure-pain threshold of the five selected acupuncture points will be measured using the electronic von Frey detector.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants aged 40 years or older and diagnosed with mild or moderate knee
             osteoarthritis(KOA) are eligible to participate in the study

          -  The following criteria are used for diagnosis of KOA:

               -  refractory knee pain for most days in the last month;

               -  joint space narrowing, sclerosis or cystic change in subchondral bone (as
                  demonstrated in X-ray);

          -  unable to walk properly due to foot deformity or pain;

          -  present with mental disorders;
