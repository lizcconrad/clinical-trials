    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study: To identify if an intervention focused on decreasing fear of falling
      (FOF) in a geriatric primary care setting implemented by an occupational therapist (OT) has
      the potential to decrease falls and improve physical, psychological and social factors
      related to FOF.

      The primary research question: Is there an association between fear of falling among
      geriatric populations and fall prevention interventions that are offered by occupational
      therapist in a geriatric primary care setting?
