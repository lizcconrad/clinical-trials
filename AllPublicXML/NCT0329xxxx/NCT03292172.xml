    <textblock>
      This is Phase IB, open label, non-randomized study designed to investigate the dose, safety,
      pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of RO6870810 in combination with a fixed dose of
      atezolizumab. The study consists of two groups, Group 1 (Dose Escalation Group) and Group 2
