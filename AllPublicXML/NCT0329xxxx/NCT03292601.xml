  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to utilize a novel device and smartphone application in order
      to improve measurement of patient compliance with at-home bracing for scoliosis as well as
      create a more accurate assessment of brace fit via continuous and objective measures of
      tension. These ground-breaking metrics will provide analyzable data to more accurately
      reflect and predict actual patient compliance as well as allow for further exploration of how
      to increase compliance, and thus, efficacy of bracing; it will additionally allow both
      physicians and patients to have a more reliable measure for brace fit by providing them with
      continuous data of fit via tension, and provide built-in feedback mechanisms to the patient
      to ensure proper tightness of the brace.

      Additionally, the study will investigate whether providing the wearer's own brace-wear
      compliance information directly to the patient and their caregiver(s) via the mobile app will
      further improve rates of compliance as compared to those who do not receive the same feedback
      mechanism.

    <textblock>
      The current method to set brace tension is subjective; it is limited to the attending
      clinician making a mark on the brace straps, to which the patient tightens the straps during
      daily wear. Once the strap is set in place, the current standard-of-care does not involve any
      more monitoring. Therefore, ideal strap tension is unknown and the effectiveness of bracing
      may be unknowingly compromised by many as yet unidentified variables. In recent years, a
      small number of studies have emerged related to the strap tension of bracing yet no clear
      guidelines on correct strap tension currently exist. Considering the potential effects on
      preventing scoliosis progression and brace-associated complications, the need for guidelines
      regarding optimal brace fit are greatly needed for clinical use. Via this brace monitoring
      study, continuous monitoring of tension at brace fitting, throughout the day, and related to
      positional changes will be possible with a very minimal device and smartphone application.
      The tremendous amounts of data generated by the device and its app will be used to create a
      database from which our team will gather information about brace wear compliance and use
      tension information for the development of standards for effective strap tension associated
      with greater scoliosis curve correction. Lastly, the effect of a patient's engagement with
      his or her brace - through the smartphone app - will be examined. It is well established in
      the literature that observation increases compliance, but no studies investigating patient
      self-monitoring through personal devices currently exists. This is a vital area of
      investigation given the recent explosion in personal health-assessing devices e.g. the Apple
      watch, Up band, fitbit, etc.

    <description>The study device is a small (with dimensions of 1.5&quot; x 2&quot; x 3/8&quot; and weighing approximately 0.9-oz) Bluetooth-enabled and battery-powered monitor with Velcro strap that attaches to orthopaedic braces for scoliosis in place of the traditional strap and buckle. When the Velcro strap is tightened, the device measures tension in Newtons with the vector of force parallel to and away from the device, reflecting the pulling force required to keep the brace fitted on the patient.</description>
