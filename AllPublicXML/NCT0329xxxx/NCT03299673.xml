    <textblock>
      The present non-interventional observational study in the Greek population aims at collecting
      the characteristics of COPD patients selected to be given the inhaled combination of
      fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in doses of 100 μg mcg (250 μg) mcg (500 g) mcg through
      the Elpenhaler® device, to investigate (a) the effectiveness of the treatment for compliance
      and the quality of life of the patients; and (b) the safety of the drugs in patients whose
      disease is treated either in a hospital or in a private physician.

      Rolenium® is an inhalable combination the active ingredients of which is the inhaled
      combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in doses (100 + 50) mcg, (250 + 50) mcg,
      (500 + 50) mcg administered via the Elpenhaler ®, developed by ELPEN. It has been approved as
      a bronchodilator therapy for COPD (a fast-exiting volume in the first second (FEV1) after a
      bronchodilator less than 60% predicted) with a history of repeated seizures that have
      significant symptoms despite regular bronchodilator therapy. For COPD in adults an inhalation
      of 500 micrograms of fluticasone propionate and 50 micrograms of salmeterol twice daily is
      recommended4. More information on the efficacy and safety of the investigational medicinal
      product is provided in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).
