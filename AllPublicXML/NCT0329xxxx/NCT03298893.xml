  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the majority of clinical trials on checkpoint inhibitors have tested these agents as
      monotherapy, and the next logical step is to evaluate rational therapeutic associations. The
      aim of the NiCOL study is to assess the safety of nivolumab in association with
      chemoradiation therapy and to gain initial insight into its efficacy in association with the
      current standard of care, including chemoradiation.

    <description>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (including volumetric-modulated arc therapy and tomography) will be used. A dose of 45 Gy will be delivered to the pelvis in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy using a 6-MV photon energy.
An additional dose of 54 Gy in 25 fractions of 2.16 Gy may be delivered to invaded lymph nodes using SIB-IMRT.
An additional lateral pelvic dose may be delivered if coverage of the target volumes is judged insufficient. The volumes, doses and techniques will be those usually used in each center.</description>
