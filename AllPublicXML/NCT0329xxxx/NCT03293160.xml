  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of a care management program on the health and health
      spending outcomes of patients residing in Michigan's Washtenaw and Livingston Counties.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, the State of Michigan will offer enrollment in care management services to a set of
      patients in Washtenaw and Livingston Counties who are predicted to be high-frequency users of
      emergency departments. This is a quality improvement initiative. The Center for Healthcare
      Research and Transformation (CHRT) will administer this enrollment and collect patient data.
      The Principal Investigators will conduct a study that uses the data from this quality
      improvement initiative to compare the outcomes of the treatment and control groups.
      Specifically, the study will examine whether the care management services had an effect on
      the number of emergency department visits and the total healthcare spending of the patients
      in the treatment group.

      The present study therefore is the second of two related projects - the first is the
      CHRT-administered random assignment and enrollment of patients into care management services.
      The present study is a secondary analysis of the data produced by the first project.

      This Protocol Registration and Results submission refers to the secondary analysis component
      wherever applicable, and where not applicable, describes the information relevant to the CHRT
      project. For example, while the present study does not assign anyone into treatment or
      control groups, the Sample Description indicates &quot;Probability Sample&quot; to describe the way in
      which CHRT intends to enroll patients.
