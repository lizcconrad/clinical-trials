  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, single-blind post market clinical follow-up study for which 65
      patients will be imaged at Rouge Valley Centenary Hospital (Scarborough and Rouge Hospital)
      who present with a chronic wound and are receiving standard wound care treatment. The
      MolecuLight i:X imaging device will be used by the study clinician as an adjunctive tool in
      the assessment of the wound and will be used to guide the targeted sampling of a wound (with
      curettage scraping), as per current standard of care in the principal investigator's wound
      care clinic. The acquired tissue sample will then be analysed using conventional gold
      standard semi-quantitative culture methods to determine bacterial species present, also as
      per current standard of care in this clinic.

Capture and save ST-image Capture and save FL-image Identify discrete locations of cyan (blue/green) fluorescent bacteria (FL_C) Acquire sample of tissue where cyan fluorescent bacteria are present (using curette method) Consent patient for inclusion in this study Note location of sample acquisition by annotating FL-image obtained in step 2 Send sample for microbiology analysis Note naming of microbiology sample on Case Report Form</description>

        Patients will be treated at the Scarborough and Rouge Hospital as per the standard of care,
        which includes use of the MolecuLight i:X imaging device and targeted sampling of regions
        with bacterial fluorescence for microbiological analysis. Patients will be identified as
        candidates and consented by the study's principle investigator. The images which would be
        acquired for this study are currently part of the routine clinical wound care assessment
        process in the principle investigator's wound care clinic. However, during study enrollment
        subjects will be given as much time as required for their understanding of the basic study,
        to understand that their participation is optional, to understand that they will receive
        standard of care wound treatment whether or not they choose to participate, and to have any
        potential questions addressed.

          3. Any contra-indication to routine wound care and/or monitoring

          4. Prior participation of the patient in this study (for the same wound or a different
             wound).
