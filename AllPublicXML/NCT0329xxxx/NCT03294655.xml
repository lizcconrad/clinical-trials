  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, a pre-post experimental design will be used, in which 60 community
      dwelling adults aged 50+ will recruited from a larger parent study, and will then be
      randomized to either a no-contact control or intervention condition. Those in the
      intervention condition will receive a psychoeducational intervention in which they will
      receive scientific literature-based information on resilience and strategies to bolster
      resilience, as well as developing an individualized plan on areas to engage in at home over
      the next four weeks. All participants will return for an immediate posttest using an
      abbreviated version of the baseline battery from the parent study.

    <description>The intervention will include a brief one-on-one visit in which psychoeducational information on building resilience will be given via a PowerPoint presentation, which will include exercises for the participants to engage in over the following four weeks in their daily lives. After the presentation participants will also develop a personalized intervention plan where they will choose at least five areas of the American Psychological Association 10 Strategies for Building Resilience on which to specifically focus. Participants will also receive a pamphlet of abbreviated information from the PowerPoint presentation.</description>
