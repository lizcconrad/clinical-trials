      Investigators hypothesis is that as human age increases, the size of the carpal tunnel
      decreases.

      Participants will be taken to a hand examination room where a portable ultrasound (US)
      machine is present. A previously determined wrist will be examined for each of the
      participants. The US will be used to obtain measurements of the subjects carpal tunnel and
      median nerve at multiple levels in order to define its size.
