  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This initial clinical study in the US will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      single-dose, dose-escalation, and sequential cohort study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD of D-0120-NA in fasting, healthy volunteers (HVs).

      In food effect cohort, subjects will each receive 2 doses of D-0120-NA in an open-label
      manner; once in the fasted state and once in the fed state.
