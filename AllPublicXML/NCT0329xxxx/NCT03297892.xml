    <textblock>
      Cushing's disease is a rare disease that can reduce patients' expectations or quality of
      life, and for which predictive factors for cardiovascular mortality and recurrence are not
      well defined.

      The primary objective is to determine the rates of remission and recurrence of patients with
      Cushing's disease diagnosed between 1990 and 2015 in the French region of the West (Angers,
      Brest, Nantes, Rennes, Poitiers , Tours) focusing on remission particularly at two periods :
      that after the first pituitary surgery and that on the day of the last news.

      The secondary objective is to study the possible prediction of clinical and biological data
      perioperative of remission and recurrence during follow-up.

      Investigators are interested in the prevalence of complications of the pathology
      (cardiovascular, metabolic, neuropsychological, infectious, rheumatological, etc.) within
      this cohort, the mortality rate, the rate of remission and recurrence and the quality of life
      history using the history of patient illness and a questionnaire.

      All patients over the age of 18 years at the time of inclusion, formerly or currently being
      monitored for Cushing's disease diagnosed between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2015, in
      one of the six university centers in the West part of France can be included.
