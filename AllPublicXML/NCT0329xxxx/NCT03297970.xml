  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study investigates the associations of nutritional indicators, biomarkers,
      sociodemographic conditions, and infections with child health, as well as physical,
      behavioral, and cognitive development. Investigators recruited a random sample of 3202
      children from primary public schools in Bogota, Colombia in February 2006 and followed them
      for a median of 6.5 years. Investigators hypothesized that poor nutritional status at the
      time of recruitment in middle childhood would be related to adverse health outcomes through
      adolescence.

    <description>Adolescent behavior problems were ascertained with the Youth Self Report (YSR) questionnaire. The YSR is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 112 statements addressing behaviors or feelings that adolescents rate as false, sometimes true, or very/often true. From responses to these questions, an Assessment Data Manager (ADM) software calculates continuous scores for aggressive behavior and rule breaking behavior. The sum of the aggressive and rule breaking behavior subscale scores constitute the total externalizing problems score.</description>
