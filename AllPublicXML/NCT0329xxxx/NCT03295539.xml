      International Multi-Centre registry recording comprehensive data on the use of 'Indigo'
      Mechanical thrombectomy system by Penumbra Inc for the removal of acute clot causing acute or
      critical limb ischaemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A detailed registry has been designed and approved to be used world wide in vascular and
      trauma centres, already providing endovascular service for the management of critical limb
      ischaemia (CLI).

      Recent campaigns have shown little is done to improve flow to the lower limbs (legs) of
      patients to avoid amputation rates. During this time many devises have been used and
      available on the market. The 'Indigo' system by Penumbra was originally designed from the
      acute stroke system &quot;ACE&quot;. Similar principles were applied in designing the 'Indigo' system.
      This is currently being used in many centres to manage acute clot causing lower limb
      ischaemia, however no official registry or international clinical trial has been done to show
      its significance in managing this disease.

      The investigator groups, have created this to come up with enough data to evaluate the Indigo
      system in the management of (ALI) and offer tips and tricks to other clinicians. The aim is
      for a single arm, multicenter, retrospective analysis of patients in whom (ALI) was performed
      with the Penumbra/Indigo System (study device), and gather greater data and information than
      the PRISM trial in 2013-2014 which obtained only 79 patients.

    <time_frame>Time to event anaylsis. Primary patency results are immediate after the case on the final angiogram images.</time_frame>
    <description>Intraoperative technical success defined as the restoration of antegrade blood flow with complete or near complete (95% by volume) removal of the thrombus or embolus (70% threshold). This is assessed using imaging modalities (USS/Doppler/Fluroscopy) and clinical assessment of the affected limb.
See for this definition the enclosed citation. In conclusion, the primary outcome measure will be improvement in blood flow across a lesion assessed by the improvement in Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score that was adapted to peripheral arteries. Concomitant balloon angioplasty or stent placement in addition to VAT was considered a complementary treatment. Additional thrombectomy treatments, such as thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, were considered technical failures.Target lesions were grouped anatomically into above-the-knee(ATK) or below-the-knee(BTK) lesions.</description>
