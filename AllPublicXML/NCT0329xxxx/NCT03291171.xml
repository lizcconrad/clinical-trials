    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how 'MyPlan 2.0' helps adults with type 2
      diabetes to be more physically active or less sedentary. Two groups will be created, an
      intervention group and a waiting-list control group.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how 'MyPlan 2.0' helps adults with type 2
      diabetes to be more physically active or less sedentary. Two groups will be created, an
      intervention group and a waiting-list control group. Both groups will be tested during three
      testing waves: pretest, posttest and follow-up test. Only the intervention group will be
      given acces to 'MyPlan 2.0'. 'MyPlan 2.0' consists of a website and mobile application
      targeting physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The intervention has a duration of five
      weeks.
