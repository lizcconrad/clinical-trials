      This is a randomized (to each eye, within patient), double-blinded, placebo-controlled study
      of the efficacy of AFED in patients with hematologic malignancies who have undergone
      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and have been diagnosed with
      chronic GVHD of the eye.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic ocular GVHD diagnosed within 3 years after allogeneic
             hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for any hematological malignancy, with any
             graft and any conditioning regimen, with dry eye (patients may be using PROSE lenses
             at the time of accrual).

          -  Patients must be â‰¥ 18 years of age at enrollment.

          -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved
             consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have any other reversible cause for dry eye at the time of accrual.

          -  Patients treated with more than 2 lines of systemic therapy beyond corticosteroids
             with or without calcineurin inhibitors or sirolimus.

          -  Patients with a relapsed malignancy after transplantation.

          -  Patients with difference in dryness between both eyes of more than 2 points of the
             grading provided by the International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) 2007 report (Based on
             the single highest category score in the DEWS grading scale)

          -  Patients with any active ocular infection

          -  Patients with a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
