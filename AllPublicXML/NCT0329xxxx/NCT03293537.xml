  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want to determine if patients with dementia show any kind of Emotion while they look at a
      defined selection of photos. These are photos taken from a international image-platform and
      mixed with photos (of the patients) that show personal objects, personal events, etc.

      While the photos will be presented each a few seconds the skin conductance and the heart rate
      will be measured. We want to find out if there is any emotion measurable while showing the
      photos.

      The lack of overt behaviour in individuals exhibiting dementia-associated apathy is not only
      stressful to family members and caregivers, it is also a major challenge for medical and
      nursing staff. Knowing whether apathy arises from an impaired function of the neural network
      of affect due to neurodegenerative processes accompanying dementia provides a neural
      explanation of this condition. Somatic indicators of affective responses (e.g., changes in
      skin conductance, or heart rate) are an effective means to uncover covert emotional responses
      in nursing home residents suffering from dementia associated apathy.

      The overall objective is to determine whether dementia associated apathy is the result of an
      impaired functioning of the neural macro-network of affect. We want to compare the
      quantitative change in physiological parameters for each image category between individuals
      of the two subgroups: 1. Individual with dementia only and 2.individuals with dementia and
      dementia-associated apathy.

      The primary objective is to uncover a covert emotional response using changes in skin
      conductance in patients with dementia and patients with dementia + dementia associated
      apathy.

      The secondary objective is to uncover a covert emotional response using changes in the heart
      rate in patients with dementia and patients with dementia + dementia associated apathy.

      Diagnosis of dementia, age at initial dementia diagnosis, age at initial apathy diagnosis,
      time since initial diagnosis of dementia and apathy will be obtained from medical records.
      The type and daily dose of medication as well as the type and frequency of occupational,
      physio- and psychosocial therapy will be drawn from medical records. The SMMSE (Severe Mini
      Mental State Examination)score will determine severity of dementia and the AES (Apathy
      Evaluation Scale )score the severity of apathy. Using the FAST (Functional Assessment
      Staging) will assess the capacity of performing the activities of daily life.

      Measurements will be conducted in a familiar environment and in the presence of a family
      member or a member of staff to avoid any kind of stress and concern for the participant. The
      subject will be informed of the procedure and their task before the sensors are attached.
      Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) will be continuously monitored while the
      subject views the image sequence on a PC monitor. EDA will be measured using electrodes
      attached to the middle (D3) and ring finger (D4). Heart rate will be measured using an
      infrared pulseoximeter attached to one of the free digits of the hand. A pulseoximeter is a
      non-invasive sensor, using tissue absorption of infrared light to determine blood-oxygen
      saturation (SaO2). EDA and HR will be recorded concurrently using commercial software. Data
      analysis will involve both commercial and in-house software. All data will be stored on a
      hard disk, in a compressed and encrypted format.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  existing medical diagnosis of dementia, independent of the presence or absence of
             neuropsychiatric symptoms.

        We include nursing home residents with Informed Consent as documented by signature from the
        German speaking part of Switzerland with moderate to severe dementia.

        The presence or absence of apathy serves to assign participants into the appropriate
        experiments group.

          -  Known or suspected non-compliance, drug or alcohol abuse,

               -  Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to language problems,
                  psychological disorders
