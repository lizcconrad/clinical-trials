      Hypothesis: An occupational 6 months physical exercise training will lead to better health
      behaviour and improve the severity of the metabolic syndrome.

      300 subjects will be assigned to either an intervention or a waiting-control-group. The
      intervention group will receive instructions with the aim to perform 150 min exercise
      training per week. Exercise consists of endurance, strength and coordination training. A
      feedback system guided by sports scientists will be installed for all subjects in the
      intervention group using activity monitoring (wearable). After 6 months training subjects
      from the intervention group will be assigned to one of the following groups for follow-up
      observation from month 6 to months 12:

        -  training with personal/individual feedback from sport scientist

        -  training with automated feedback using activity monitoring Tools (wearable)

        -  training without further feedback Subjects assigned to the control group will be
           provided with information on low intensity motion exercises. After 6 months in the
           control group subjects will be provided with the same exercise intervention as the
           intervention for a duration of 6 months.

      Study visits will be conducted at month 0, month 6 and month 12.

    <description>Exercise training will consist of 3 - 6 sessions per week and will cumulate in 150 min net exercise time per week. Heart rates during exercise sessions will be monitored with the aim of physical activities at moderate-intensity. Exercises will be individualized to reach the best possible improvements to the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system. Possible disciples will include but are not limited to: cycling, rowing (ergometer), swimming, walking, nordic-walking, running, arm-cycle-ergometer or cross-trainer as well as fitness courses offered from occupational or private providers. Everyday activities which reach an effective heart rate range can account for exercise training on a home-based basis .
Advise on complementary individual strength and coordination exercises will be added to the training program. A nutrition analyses will be completed by every subject to account for special needs of the metabolic syndrome.</description>
