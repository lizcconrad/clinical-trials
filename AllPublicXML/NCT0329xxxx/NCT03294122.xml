  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main idea behind MICRO-LEARNER is to provide new insights about the response of healthy
      tissues to radiation by using information from the micro-environment obtained by biological
      measurements and imaging. This new knowledge will be included in current available predictive
      models of radio-induced toxicity, thus allowing to add unique biological characteristics of
      patients to dosimetry and treatment/clinical related variables.

      MICRO-LEARNER focuses on prostate cancer (PCa) and head-and-neck cancer (HNCa). For both
      cancers, radiotherapy is effectively used as curative treatment, in single modality or within
      a multidisciplinary approach including surgery (PCa) and/or chemotherapy (HNCa). Prediction
      and reduction of radio-induced side effects are becoming a priority: for PCa, high survival
      rates should be accompanied by a very low rate of moderate/severe toxicities; for HNCa, there
      is the need to tailor radiation dose according to disease recurrence risk profile. The shared
      aim of both cancers is to balance the improvement in outcome with a well-tolerated toxicity
      profile.

      Recent research indicates that the intestinal/salivary bacteria are strongly suspected of
      being very important in mediating the response to inflammation and lesions. Although their
      balance deeply changes during radiotherapy, studies done so far in the field of the
      microbiota-host relationship in radiotherapy have not addressed their role in insurgence of
      radiation toxicity.

      In this study, the investigators will assess how microbial populations evolve and how this
      influences the host and radiation induced toxicity in a significant number of patients.
      Moreover, the individual response at the tissue microstructure level, through analysis of
      images with advanced bioengineering techniques, will be determined.

      Results from this research, besides suggesting new ways to predict patients at risk of
      relevant side-effects, may also suggest possible treatments to change the baseline microbiota
      of patients at high risk or to modify it during therapy, in order to mitigate toxicity.
      Understanding the microbiota-radiotherapy interaction may thus lead to novel, effective and
      inexpensive ways of assessing and managing complications of cancer treatment.

      **Prospective Clinical Trial: discovery population**

      130 PCa and 130 HNCa consecutive patients will be enrolled in 18 months. All patients will
      receive radiotherapy at radical curative doses at the National Cancer Institute in Milan, and
      follow-up visits at the same centre.

      Detailed pre-treatment evaluation will include: recording of demographic features, clinical
      history, comorbidities and habits, evaluation of normal tissue functioning by the health
      practitioner (CTCAE scoring system), evaluation of quality of life and normal tissue
      functioning through validated patient reported outcome (PROs) questionnaires, evaluation of
      organ functioning by instrumental measures (i.e. baseline swallowing screening with flexible
      endoscopic evaluation of swallowing - FEES - and unstimulated salivary flow for HNCa
      patients), biochemical examinations, gut (PCa)/salivary (HNCa) microbiome measurement,
      determination of baseline level of plasma/salivary inflammatory markers, baseline
      multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Patients will receive radiotherapy and possible adjuvant (hormone or chemo) therapies as
      foreseen by international guidelines. In this aspect the here proposed trial is an
      observational study, no modification to standard regimens is considered. Radiotherapy is
      performed with 6 MV photon beams delivered with Volumetric Modulated arc Therapy (VMAT)
      technique at conventional fractionations.

      Evaluation during treatment will include weekly assessment of toxicity, as measured by the
      clinician (according to CTCAE v 4.0) and by PROs and biochemical measurements, and evaluation
      of inflammatory markers (plasmatic and salivary cytokines) after a dose of 20 Gy. For a
      subpopulation of 60 oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy +/-
      chemotherapy an additional MRI study during the second week of treatment is foreseen.

      Assessment at the end of radiotherapy will include evaluation of toxicity by the clinician
      and by PROs, FEES and unstimulated salivary flow for HNCa patients, biochemical examinations,
      gut/salivary microbiome measurement.

      Evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months will include: evaluation of toxicity by the clinician and by
      PROs, FEES and unstimulated salivary flow for HNCa patients and biochemical examinations.

      Minimum follow-up is set to 12 months for the specific purpose of evaluation of acute and
      mid-term toxicity, which are the endpoints considered in this project. Nevertheless,
      follow-up will continue until 3 years after the end of radiotherapy (beyond the end of the
      project) in order to allow evaluation of incidence, prevalence and patterns of late
      side-effects, as well as for survival outcome assessment. After 12 months, follow-up will be
      performed every 6 months and limited to assessment of toxicity by the clinician and by PROs.

      Follow-up MRI studies will be performed at 3, 12 and 24 months for HNCa patients and at 12
      months for PCa patients.

      **Prospective Clinical Trial: validation population**

      70 PCa and 70 HNCa consecutive patients will be enrolled in 12 months, starting immediately
      after the end of enrolment of the discovering population.

      The specific aim of this second phase is validation of results on microbiota, specifically on
      association between selected baseline microbiota profiles and the risk of acute toxicity (for
      the purpose of this project) and for mid-term/late toxicity (beyond this projects). This
      result should be the more significant from the clinical point of view, allowing development
      of a therapeutic algorithm to be used before treatment and permitting introduction ways of
      changing the make-up of gut/salivary bacteria in patients at high risk of toxicity.

      Baseline assessment, treatment and follow-up evaluation of toxicity by the clinician and by
      PROs will follow the scheme described for the developing population. Microbioma measurement
      will be only performed at baseline, due to the higher clinical interest in having a test
      determining patient radiosensitivity before treatment. Imaging and assessment of inflammatory
      marker levels will not be accomplished in the validation population.
