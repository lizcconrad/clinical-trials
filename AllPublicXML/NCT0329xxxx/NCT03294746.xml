  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug induced interstitial lung disease (DIILD) is caused by iatrogenic injury to the lung
      parenchyma and can be caused by over four hundred different drugs in humans. Diagnosing DIILD
      is a challenge for clinicians and radiologists as a positive diagnosis depends on exclusion
      of other causes including respiratory infection, occupational, recreational, and
      environmental exposures, specific respiratory disorders, and systemic diseases.

      The aim of this study is to qualify an objective CT scoring system for DIILD assessment. In
      addition, the quantitative information obtained from CT scans with densitometry and texture
      analysis will be explored.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to qualify an objective semi-quantitative CT scoring system looking at the correlation between the change in the semi-quantitative CT score at 6 weeks relative to baseline (DIILD diagnosis) against the change in Forced vital capacity (FVC) at 6 weeks relative to baseline (DIILD diagnosis). The semi-quantitative CT score will be calculated based on CT features: 1)ground-glass opacity 2) reticular/septal lines 3) honeycombing 4) nodular opacity 5) consolidation.</description>

          -  New onset symptoms (e.g. cough, fever, dyspnoea, and hypoxia) at any time during or
             within 4 weeks of the last dose of anti-cancer treatment

          -  New onset radiological (CXR or CT) abnormalities within the lungs at any time during
             or within 4 weeks of the last dose of anti-cancer treatment (e.g. diffuse lung
             changes, infiltrative opacification in the periphery of the lung or ground glass

             such as occupational exposure)

          -  Previous extensive thoracic surgery (e.g. lobectomy)
