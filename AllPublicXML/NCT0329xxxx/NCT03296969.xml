      We include in our study 200 pregnant women, primigravidas, at term who underwent elective
      lower segment Cesarean section for the first time among the age group of 20 ̶ 35 years.

      The patients are divided randomly into two groups as follows:

        -  Group (A): undergoing rectus muscle re-approximation

        -  Group (B): not undergoing rectus muscle re-approximation

      We include in our study 200 pregnant women, primigravidas, at term who underwent elective
      lower segment Cesarean section for the first time among the age group of 20 ̶ 35 years.

      The patients are divided randomly into two groups as follows:

        -  Group (A): undergoing rectus muscle re-approximation

        -  Group (B): not undergoing rectus muscle re-approximation

        -  Examination for diastasis recti abdominis is done for all included patients before
           delivery, at 6 weeks, and 6 months postpartum. The women are tested in a standardized
           supine position with arms crossed over the chest. They are instructed to perform an
           abdominal crunch till the shoulder blades are off the bench. Then we measure the
           inter-recti distance. If there is no separation or separation ˂ 2 finger breadths so,
           there is no diastasis recti abdominis. But if the separation is more than 2 finger
           breadths or more than 4.5 cm so, this is considered diastasis recti abdominis.

      The same surgical techniques are used for both groups. All women underwent Pfnannenstiel
      incision under general or spinal anaesthesia, with a combination of sharp and blunt
      dissection to open the abdomen. The rectus muscles are dissected off the fascia, and the
      muscles are separated in the midline by pulling. Then the uterus is opened followed by fetal
      and placental extraction. The transverse lower uterine segment incision is closed in two
      layers of continuous Vicryl number 1 suture. The parietal peritoneum is closed using a
      continuous absorbable suture. In group (A): rectus muscle re-approximation is done by 3
      interrupted sutures, but muscle is not closed in the other group. The rectus sheath is
      sutured using continuous absorbable sutures. Finally, skin is sutured with subcuticular
      sutures with Vicryl Rapide.

    <description>• Post-operative pain is analyzed by using 4 point verbal rating scale (VRS) which consists of a list of adjectives describing different levels of pain intensity i.e (no pain =1, mild pain = 2, moderate pain = 3, severe pain = 4), patients are asked to read this list of adjectives and select the word that best describes their level of pain on the scale</description>
