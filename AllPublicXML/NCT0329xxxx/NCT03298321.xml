  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genomic studies on atrial fibrillation patients have identified polymorphisms in regions
      surrounding the PITX2 gene, suggesting it could be the locus responsible for atrial
      fibrillation. The PITX2 gene is essential for establishing the asymmetry between systemic and
      pulmonary blood flow, which is absolutely required for proper heart functions. In addition,
      PITX2 is required for the development the atrium myocardium. Investigators have performed
      transcriptomic analysis on left atrium tissues from atrial fibrillation patients and identify
      genes whose expression is altered in atrial fibrillation. Among affected genes, PITX2
      expression is strongly decreased in the left atrium of atrial fibrillation patients.
      Moreover, investigators observed that the PITX2 promoter region is hypermethylated in atrial
      fibrillation patients. Interestingly, DNA methylation is a key actor of gene expression and
      directly regulates RNA transcription either by directly modulating transcription factor (TF)
      binding to gene promoters or by modifying local chromatin structures, therefore limiting
      access of TFs to DNA. These epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore represent
      an interesting therapeutic target. Hence, many compounds that inhibit DNA methyl-transferase
      are currently tested in different disease models. Recently-designed hypomethylating molecules
      are available, such as the 5'azacytidine (Vidaza®, Celgen Inc.) or the 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
      (Decitabine) (Dacogen®, Janssen Cilag). Investigators have performed preliminary studies on
      the effect of Decitabine on DNA methylation and proper cardiac function recovering in a SHR
      model. Results indicate that the chronic delivery of Decitabine improves the arrhythmia
      profile by reducing tachyarrhythmia, fibrosis, as well as the oxidative stress in SHR left
      atrium submitted Acute Leukemia is a rare pathology with an incidence of 4 per 100,000 in
      France. Azacytidine, which is closely related to Decitabine, is commonly used for treating
      Acute Leukemia and possesses anti-neoplastic effect through multiple mechanisms, including
      direct cytotoxicity of blood cancer cells and DNA hypomethylation. The goal of this study is
      to evaluate the effects of azacytidine on arrhythmia and left atrium fibrosis as well, which
      are the two mains phenotypic manifestation of atrial fibrillation in humans. Investigators
      hypothesize that azacytidine decreases PITX2 promoter methylation and increases PITX2
      expression. Hence, investigators expect to ameliorate the duration of atrium action potential
      and to observe a decrease of atrium fibrosis.
