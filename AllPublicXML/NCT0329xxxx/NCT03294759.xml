      Collagen based -membrane derived from amniotic tissue can be used to help reestablish the
      natural synovial lining of the reconstructed ACL, in effect acting as both a barrier from the
      synovial fluid and as a scaffold to contain autologous mesenchymal stem cells and growth
      factors contiguous with the graft, thus aiding and perhaps accelerating the natural
      maturation and ligamentization process of the implanted graft tissue. Acceleration and
      improvement in graft maturation and strength would be a significant advancement in sports
      medicine allowing safer and earlier return to sports and activity

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Histologic studies have determined that graft ligamentization following anterior cruciate
      ligament (ACL) reconstruction may take from 6 to 18 months. (1) It has been reported that
      incomplete graft maturation and incorporation is one cause of clinical graft failure. Animal
      studies have illustrated improved tendon healing/integration in ACL models augmented with
      stem cell technologies. (2-4). Basic scientists theorize that optimization of stem cell
      treatments for tissue regeneration requires that a &quot;regenerative triad&quot; be employed, i.e.,
      use of a scaffold, stem cells and growth factors. In the intra-articular environment,
      research has shown that a scaffold such as an amnion wrap is necessary to contain the stem
      cells and growth factors in close proximity to the ACL graft. (2, 4, 5)

      The normal, uninjured human ACL is covered by a layer of synovial tissue which contributes to
      the blood supply and nutrition of the native ACL. It is theorized that the lack of a synovial
      lining after injury and following traditional ACL reconstruction contributes to slow
      ligamentization and possible failure of reconstructed grafts.(5) Two studies have
      demonstrated accelerated maturation and ligamentization of human ACL graft augmented with
      point of care blood products. (6, 7) In one, leucocyte poor platelet rich plasma was injected
      directly into the body of the graft. (6) In the other, the platelet derived growth factors
      were loaded in a gelatin carrier which was wrapped around the graft. (7) In both studies
      accelerated and increased ligament maturation was documented compared to the controls.
      Collagen membranes derived from amniotic tissue have been successful to aid healing when used
      in difficult wounds and meniscal repair surgery. (8, 9)

      The use of a collagen based -membrane derived from amniotic tissue may be used to help
      reestablish the natural synovial lining of the reconstructed ACL, in effect acting as both a
      barrier from the synovial fluid and as a scaffold to contain autologous mesenchymal stem
      cells and growth factors contiguous with the graft. Thus aiding and perhaps accelerating the
      natural maturation and ligamentization process of the implanted graft tissue. Acceleration
      and improvement in graft maturation and strength would be a significant advancement in sports
      medicine allowing safer and earlier return to sports and activity.
