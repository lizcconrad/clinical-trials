  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women have problems with oral antibiotics, including vagina and bowel infections. Also,
      bacteria causing urinary infections are becoming more resistant to oral antibiotis. Placement
      of antibiotic directly into the bladder does not cause these problems and are at doses that
      are may be able to stop bacteria from being resistant to antibiotics.

      Each participant once enrolled returns with an active Urinary Tract Infection (UTI),
      confirmed by urine void. Participants will complete an UTI questionnaire, and if consistent
      with a simple non-febrile UTI will be randomized to one of two arms: oral nitrofurantoin
      treatment for 7 days, or intravesical gentamicin instillation once a day for three days.
      Patients will be followed for symptom relief with a repeat voided urine in 7 to 10 days, and
      with a repeated questionnaire for symptom relief.
