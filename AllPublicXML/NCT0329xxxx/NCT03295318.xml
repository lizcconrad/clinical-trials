  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out of the 13 identified serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) the six serogroups (A, B,
      C, W, Y and X) are responsible for majority of infections. Presently available vaccines
      effectively protect against A, B, C, W and Y serogroups; but no vaccine that is protective
      against serogroup X is available yet.

      Serum Institute of India Private Limited (SIIPL) has developed a conjugate vaccine against
      serogroups A, C, Y, W and X (NmCV-5).

      The first-in-human Phase 1 study was among 60 healthy adults in USA did not show no any
      safety issues.

      This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the non-adjuvanted
      and adjuvanted formulations of NmCV-5 in healthy children 12-16 months of age, in comparison
      with the licensed quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Menactra®).

      Both vaccines will be administered in two dose schedule 3 months apart. among vaccine-naïve
      healthy subjects in Mali. Safety will be assessed by collecting solicited reactions till day
      7 post each dose whereas adverse events will be collected throughout the study. Each subject
      will be followed up for 84 days post each vaccine dose.

      The vaccine immunogenicity will measured using a rabbit complement serum bactericidal
      activity assay (rSBA).
