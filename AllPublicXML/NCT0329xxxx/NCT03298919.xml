  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm trial to compare exercise videogames versus traditional standard exercise
      using stationary bikes and treadmills versus a control condition. Results will examine
      minutes of physical activity at 12 weeks and 6 month follow up between conditions. We will
      also examine changes in indicators of cardiovascular health (e.g., body mass index, lipids)
      and changes in psychological factors that may be predictive of continued exercise engagement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the efficacy of a 12-week supervised, laboratory based program of an exercise
      videogame (EVG) program to increase time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
      (MVPA) and improve cardiovascular health and fitness indices compared to Standard and Control
      programs. Participants will be randomly assigned to (1) a supervised program of Exercise
      Videogames (EVG); (2) a supervised standard exercise program (Standard), using aerobic
      exercise equipment (e.g., treadmill, stationary bike); or (3) a Control condition. We will
      also examine the effect of home-based exercise videogames compared to a home-based standard
      PA program on MVPA maintenance during the 6-month follow up period. We will examine changes
      in cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., estimated VO2max), blood pressure, resting heart rate,
      body composition and blood lipids at baseline, week 12 and at 6-months follow up. We will
      also examine changes in theoretically-based cognitive and affective constructs associated
      with physical activity including: enjoyment, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, motivation,
      and goal-orientation.
