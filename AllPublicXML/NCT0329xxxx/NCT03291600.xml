  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression occurs in 15% of pregnant women and new mothers, yet as few as 1 in 5
      receive adequate treatment. It has a negative impact on the woman herself, as well as a
      potential for serious consequences for her child. Virtual psychiatric care is a potential
      model that may provide accessible mental health care during this time, as barriers to
      in-person care often include unpredictable infant schedules, competing childcare demands, or
      travel/cost challenges. The Virtual-PND intervention consists of 12-weeks of the option of
      supplementing in-person psychiatric care with secure, in-home real-time video-visits through
      the Ontario Telemedicine Network. This pilot RCT will demonstrate the feasibility of
      proceeding to a future large-scale RCT evaluation of virtual psychiatric care for this
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-site pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the feasibility of a
      Virtual Psychiatric Care for Perinatal Depression (Virtual-PND) intervention protocol,
      comparing virtual care to in-person care only. Participants will be pregnant or postpartum
      women with a major depressive disorder who are referred for care at one of the participating
      study sites. Each study site is a specialist reproductive psychiatric program where women
      from the greater Toronto area are referred, and generally treated with in-person care. Those
      randomized to the virtual care group will be able to receive psychiatric visits with
      video-based visits. Those randomized to the in-person care group will receive in-person care
      only, as per usual clinical practice at the study sites. The length of the active treatment
      phase will be 12 weeks from enrolment. The secondary end-point will be 1 year postpartum, as
      participants are followed clinically to 1-year postpartum at both study sites. The overall
      objective of this pilot RCT is to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT to
      evaluate the efficacy of the treatment model, comparing outcomes among those with and without
      access to virtual care, and cost-effectiveness.

Virtual care will be delivered by video-based visits through the Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN). The treating psychiatrist may request that an intervention group participant present for in-person care at any visit, and this may include need for behavioural activation, or another health-related indication at the discretion of the treating psychiatrist.</description>
