    <textblock>
      This RCT is a feasibility study to evaluate the Lois Hole Hospital for Women's Urogynecology
      Clinic's ability to recruit and randomize SUI patients to the proposed RCT, and to test the
      study procedures and follow-up schedule for participants.

      The study interventions used in the feasibility study will be training of (1) Hip Extension
      Rotation (HER) exercises alone, (2) HER exercises in combination with Pelvic Floor Muscle
      (PFM) exercises, or (3) PFM exercises alone (control/usual care) in the treatment of SUI.

      Background: Hip External Rotation (HER) exercises are being adopted into physiotherapy
      practice for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) despite little evidence
      compared to the proven effective standard of care treatment, pelvic floor muscle (PFM)
      exercises. A randomised clinical trial (RCT) is needed to determine whether HER exercise
      alone or in combination with PFM is more or less effective than PFM exercises alone.

      Objective: Before designing an RCT, a feasibility study is needed to evaluate the Lois Hole
      Hospital for Women's Urogynecology Clinic's ability to recruit and randomize SUI patients to
      the proposed RCT, and to test the study procedures and follow-up schedule for participants.

      Interventions: The interventions used in the feasibility study will be training of (1) HER
      exercises alone, (2) HER exercises in combination with PFM exercises, or (3) PFM exercises
      alone (control/usual care) in the treatment of SUI.

      Study design: RCT in which participants are randomly allocated 1:1:1 to each intervention.

      Outcome Measures: Feasibility outcomes will pertain to recruitment, adherence to training,
      appropriateness of outcome measures and completion rates. The design of the proposed RCT will
      be based on these feasibility outcomes.

      Outcome measures for the proposed RCT will include pelvic floor muscle strength, external hip
      rotator muscle strength, diary-reported urinary incontinence, incontinence related quality of
      life, and (to test patient mobility) six minute walk test and timed up and go test.

      Sample size: The proposed sample size is 30 participants. Duration of study: After
      recruitment, each woman will undergo 12 weeks of training, with the first outcome measure at
      the end of that period, and a further follow up at 24 weeks from recruitment.
