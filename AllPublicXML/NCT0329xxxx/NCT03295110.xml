  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease and related diseases (ADRD) are a major public health issue. In France,
      nearly 900,000 people have ADRD, which represents about 70% of dementia cases, and the
      expected prevalence for 2020 is 1.2 million.

      Patients with ADRD have cognitive, behavioral and functional impairments that lead to
      progressive impairment of quality of life and autonomy. Maintaining them at home depends
      predominantly on their caregivers, mainly family, spouse or child. By definition, the
      caregiver is &quot;the person who provides partial or total support to an elderly dependent person
      or a person with a disability in the vicinity of the victim for the activities of daily
      life&quot;.

      The investment of caregivers is therefore both human and financial, representing a greater or
      lesser burden. This burden can significantly affect their quality of life. Indeed, studies
      have shown that caregivers suffer from depletion, anxiety, depression and sleep disorders
      resulting in a deterioration of their health, leading them to greater care consumption. They
      would be more prone to cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

      A review of the literature from 2009 examined 66 studies evaluating the contribution of
      various technologies targeting demented patients and their caregivers. Of these, only 10
      dealt with independence at home and the well-being of the patient and his / her caregiver.
      The main limitations of these studies are the small samples (ranging from 1 to 6 patients),
      the degree of cognitive degradation (mainly moderately severe) and the lack of standardized
      assessment.

      Although new technologies promise powerful home-based solutions, studies evaluating their
      efficacy for patients with ADRD and their caregivers remain scarce and fragile at the level
      of evidence due to methodological biases.

      Description of the intervention: Lili Smart solution consists of an application for
      caregivers (web / mobile), a GSM watch worn by the patient, smart sensors placed at different
      locations of the patient's home and a support service 24 / 24 and 7/7.

      Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the impact of the Lili Smart solution on the
      burden felt by caregivers of patients with ADRD at 3 months and at 6 months of follow-up.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of the Lili Smart solution at 3 months
      and 6 months of follow-up on:

        -  The anxiety of the caregiver of the patient with ADRD;

        -  Depression of the caregiver of the patient with ADRD;

        -  The quality of life of the caregiver of the patient with ADRD;

        -  The quality of life of the patient with ADRD,

        -  The level of functional autonomy of the patient with ADRD.

        -  The risks associated with the functional decline (falls, run aways) of the patient with
           ADRD.

      In addition to the social impact measurement, the study aims to demonstrate the
      medico-economic impact of Lili smart solution as follow:

        -  The direct and indirect medical costs of the patient and the caregiver.

      Patient and caregiver adherence to the Lili Smart solution will also be assessed as a
      secondary objective.

      Methodology : This study is an interventional research on the human person meeting the
      definition 1 Â° of article L1121-1 of the CSP and not relating to the products mentioned in
      article L. 5311-1 It is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group,
      interventional, randomized, controlled trial in N = 60 patients and their primary caregiver
      with an observational phase (inactive device), and one interventional phase (activated
      device).
