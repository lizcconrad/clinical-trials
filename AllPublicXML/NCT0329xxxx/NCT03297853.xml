      The demand for addiction care for patients with addiction to analgesics increases with the
      number of prescription of analgesics grade 2; this is a public health problem There is no
      support for repositories to date in the context of addiction analgesics grade 2.

      Risk factors of misuse as well as diagnostic tools were identified.

      The demand for addiction care for patients with addiction to analgesics increases with the
      number of prescription of analgesics grade 2; this is a public health problem There is no
      support for repositories to date in the context of addiction analgesics grade 2.

      Risk factors of misuse as well as diagnostic tools were identified. The objectives of our
      research are to determine the characteristics of the individuals suffering from an addiction
      to analgesics of level 2 followed in consultation of addictology in the hospital of
      Montpellier and Nimes and to describe the type of follow-up proposed to the patients in these
      two centers. It is a retrospective and descriptive study.

      As part of this research, we will solicit all the patients followed in consultation of
      addictology or in hospitalization to the hospital of Montpellier or Nîmes for an addiction to
      the analgesics of grade 2 between the 1st of January 2014 and the 10th of July 2017 with
      requests of management for withdrawal or reduction of doses, opioid analgesics in the absence
      of pain or in chronic non-cancer pain, opioid analgesics to avoid withdrawal syndrome or
      hyperalgesia and consumptions chronic to dosages inadequate to the functional complaint
      evaluated by the rhumatology or algology services.

      The data are collected in the medical file at the two participating institutions (Montpellier
      and Nîmes) and if necessary, patients not seen in consultation for more than 6 months will be
      recontacted.
