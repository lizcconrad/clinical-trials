  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measuring brain perfusion is biased by a inter- and intrasubject variability, caused by
      physiological and lifestyle factors. In this study, the investigators want to investigate the
      variations in cerebral perfusion and other brain parameters (grey matter, resting-state brain
      activity, brain connectivity and white matter diffusion) caused by the female sex hormones
      and hormonal contraception.
