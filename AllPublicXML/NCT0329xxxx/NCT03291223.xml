  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Gaucher Outcomes Survey (GOS) is an ongoing observational, international, multi-center,
      long-term Registry of Patients with Gaucher Disease irrespective of their treatment status or
      type of treatment received. No experimental intervention is involved. Patients undergo
      clinical assessments and receive care as determined by the patients' treating physician.

      The objectives of the registry include to evaluate the safety and long-term effectiveness of
      velaglucerase alfa, to characterize patients receiving velaglucerase alfa or other Gaucher
      Disease-specific treatments, to gain a better understanding of the natural history of GD and
      to serve as a database for evidence-based management of Gaucher Disease over time in
      real-life clinical practice.
