      Background:

      People with the brain disease AUD (alcohol use disorder) have a serious problem with
      drinking. Researchers want to study how different people react to alcohol, and how genes
      affect this. They will focus on a nicotine receptor gene that may increase a person s AUD
      risk.

      Objectives:

      To see if people with variations of a nicotine receptor gene take alcohol differently and
      have different brain responses to alcohol cues.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy Caucasian adults ages 21 - 60 who do not smoke

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in another protocol.

      Participants will have three 9-hour visits. They must have no alcohol or non-prescription
      drugs before all visits and no food or drink before 2 visits.

      At every visit, participants will:

        -  Get a light meal

        -  Have breath and urine tests

        -  Get taxi rides there and back

      At visits 1 and 3, participants will:

        -  Have a thin plastic tube inserted in an arm and connected to a pump for alcohol
           infusion.

        -  Have sensors on their chest to monitor heart rate.

        -  Sit in a chair for 2.5 hours and get alcohol by pushing a button. Their breath alcohol
           level will be monitored.

        -  Answer questions about mood and effects of alcohol

        -  Give blood samples

        -  Relax at the clinic while their breath alcohol level drops

      At visit 2, participants will:

        -  Answer questions and do computer tests

        -  Have an alcoholic drink and a snack

        -  Have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. They will lie in a machine that takes
           pictures of the brain. They will do computer tasks.

        -  Have another drink and snack

        -  Relax until their alcohol level drops

      Participants will have a follow-up call after each visit.

      Objectives:

      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic disease that has a tremendously negative impact on
      individuals and their families and a substantial burden on society. Research on quantitative
      endophenotypes such as alcohol response, and their genetic and environmental determinants, is
      critical to understanding the risk for AUD. There has been a great interest in examining
      variation in target genes that may play a mechanistic role in the expression of these
      endophenotypes, such the missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding
      the 5 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA5) - rs16969968. Studies have
      shown that CHRNA5 A-allele carriers are at greater risk for nicotine addiction and
      smoking-related consequences. However, little work has been done to examine the effect of
      this SNP on alcohol use, dependence, or alcohol response. Given the high prevalence of
      nicotinic receptors on dopamine (DA) neurons in brain reward regions, these receptors may
      play a critical role in modulating incentive salience and reward responses to alcohol. Thus,
      the goal of this project is to examine the influence of CHRNA5 variation on alcohol-related
      phenotypes, including intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA) behavior and
      neuroimaging responses to cues signaling alcohol rewards.

      Study Population:

      This study will include 60 male and female Caucasian, non-smoking, non-dependent drinkers,
      21-60 years of age. Participants will be stratified into 2 equally-sized groups based on
      their rs16969968 genotype: 1). A-allele carriers (AA or AG genotype), and 2). G-allele
      homozygotes (GG genotype). Participants will be in good health as determined by medical
      history, physical exam, ECG, and lab tests.

      Design:

      Following screening, participants will undergo three study visits. The first visit will
      include an IV alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA) session using the Computer-Assisted
      Infusion System (CAIS), which employs a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
      model-based algorithm that allows participants free access to standardized alcohol infusions.
      During this session, breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) and subjective responses will be
      measured as markers of the rewarding effects of alcohol. In another visit, participants will
      undergo a second IV-ASA session where they will have free-access to alcohol infusions along
      with the ability to control the rate of each individual self-administered infusion. This will
      provide an operant measure of sensitivity to rate of change of BrAC as an additional marker
      of the rewarding effect of alcohol. Finally, participants will undergo a magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) session where they will be scanned while performing the Alcohol-Food Incentive
      Delay (AFID) task, which assesses neural processing while responding to cues signaling
      alcohol reward. Additional fMRI task-based scans and a resting-state scan will also be
      obtained.

      Outcome Measures:

      The following measures will be examined as a function of CHRNA5 genotype. The influence of
      sex, age, and recent drinking history will be examined as covariates. Primary outcome
      measures include: (1a) BrAC exposure (peak BrAC, number of infusions, time to binge-level
      BrAC) during the free-access IV-ASA; (1b) BOLD response during the AFID task in neural
      regions associated with alcohol reward processing, including ventral striatum, amygdala, and
      insula. Secondary outcome measures include: (2a) resting state functional connectivity (rsFC)
      between the regions associated with the salience network, including dorsal anterior cingulate
      cortex, ventral striatum, and extended amygdala; (2b) preferred rate of self-infusion during
      the second IV-ASA session.

                  identification provided to Clinical Center Admissions office)

               2. Caucasian ethnicity. Justification: There is a wide variation in the target SNP
                  frequency across ethnicities, with very low frequencies in African-Americans and
                  Asians making it unfeasible to ensure a balance of ethnicities across the
                  genotype groups. (assessment: self-report questionnaire of demographic
                  information)

                  method of contraceptive; use of an approved IUD or other long-acting reversible
                  contraceptive (LARC); have a male sexual partner who is surgically sterilized; or
                  have exclusively female sexual partner(s). Justification: To minimize the risk of
                  administering alcohol to pregnant women, given the known effects of alcohol
                  exposure on fetuses. (assessment: medical history)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Current or prior history of major medical illness, including CNS, cardiovascular,
             respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, or reproductive disorders.
             Justification: Many illnesses may alter the neuropsychological effects of alcohol as
             well as MRI measures. (assessment: clinically significant findings on medical history
             and physical exam, ECG, laboratory tests)

          2. Positive hepatitis (A, B, or C), or HIV test at screening. Justification: Hepatitis
             can alter liver function and alcohol pharmacokinetics. HIV infection can alter brain
             function. (assessment: laboratory tests)

          3. Current (past 12 months) history of psychiatric disorders, including depressive
             disorder, bipolar disorder, or anxiety disorders. Justification: Concurrent
             psychopathology can alter brain function and alcohol response. (assessment: SCID
             interview)

          4. Lifetime history of psychotic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),
             post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or eating disorder. Justification: These
             disorders can have long-term effects on brain function and alcohol response.
             (assessment: SCID interview)

          5. Current or lifetime diagnosis of alcohol or substance use disorder. Justification:
             History of alcohol or substance use disorder will impact brain function and alcohol
             response. (assessment: SCID interview)

          6. Currently seeking treatment for alcohol use disorders. Justification: It would be
             unethical to administer alcohol to individuals seeking treatment for alcohol problems.
             Also, this study does not provide treatment for individuals with alcohol use disorder.
             (assessment: medical history)

          7. History of significant withdrawal symptoms or presence of clinically significant
             withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score &gt; 8) at
             screening. Justification: Withdrawal symptoms would be indicative of alcohol use
             disorder, which is already an exclusion criteria. Additionally, withdrawal symptoms
             would be a major safety concern for participants, and a major confound in the
             assessment of alcohol response and brain function. (assessment: CIWA assessment)

          8. Non-drinkers (alcohol-na(SqrRoot) ve individuals or current abstainers) or individuals
             with no experience drinking 5 or more drinks on one occasion in their lifetime.
             Justification: It would be unethical to administer alcohol to individuals that do not
             drink alcohol. (assessment: medical history)

          9. Positive result on urine drug screen or positive breathalyzer during screening visit.
             Positive urine drug screen or breathalyzer reading during more than 1 study visit will
             result in participant withdrawal from the study. Justification: Current or recent
             exposure to alcohol or drugs of abuse could impact brain function and alcohol
             response. (assessment: laboratory tests and breathalyzer test performed at screening
             or update visit under 14-AA-0181 most proximal to enrollment)

         10. Current or prior history of alcohol-induced flushing reactions, including rapid
             reddening of the face, rapid heart rate and breathing, and nausea after 1 or 2 drinks.
             Justification: It would not be safe to administer alcohol to individuals with the
             highly aversive flushing response to alcohol. (assessment: alcohol flushing
             questionnaire)

         11. Medication exclusion criteria:

               1. Use of prescription or OTC medications known to interact with alcohol within 2
                  weeks of the study. These include, but may not be limited to: isosorbide;
                  nitroglycerine; benzodiazepines; warfarin; anti-depressants such as
                  amitriptyline, clomipramine and nefazodone; anti-diabetes medications such as
                  glyburide, metformin and tolbutamide; H2-antagonists for heartburn such as
                  famotidine, cimetidine and ranitidine; muscle relaxants; anti-epileptics
                  including phenytoin and phenobarbital; codeine and opioid analgesics including
                  Darvocet, Percocet and hydrocodone; regular or prescribed use of anti-histamines,
                  pain medicines, and anti-inflammatories such as aspirin, ibuprofen,
                  acetaminophen, celecoxib, and naproxen.

               2. Use of medications known to inhibit or induce enzymes that metabolize alcohol for
                  4 weeks prior to the study. These include chlorzoxazone, isoniazid,
                  metronidazole, and disulfiram.

               3. Use of drugs known to affect hemodynamic response. These include
                  antihypertensives, insulin, and thyroid medications.

             Note that any discontinuation of medications will only be done at the recommendation
             of a physician.

             (assessment: medical history and physical exam)

         12. Exclusion criteria for MRI:

               1. Left-handedness (Edinburgh Handedness Scale). Justification: To avoid lateralized
                  effects on brain function measures and reduce potential variance in MRI signals.

               2. Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI of
                  the head (including but not limited to pacemakers or other implanted electrical
                  devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips,
                  metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel
                  fragments).

               3. Fear of enclosed spaces. Justification: To minimize risk and discomfort.

               4. Inability to lie comfortable on back for up to 2 hours in the MRI scanner.
                  Justification: To minimize risk and discomfort. (assessment: NIAAA MRI Safety
                  Screening Questionnaire)

         13. Exclusion criteria for women: Justification: To minimize the risk of administering
             alcohol to pregnant or nursing women, given the known effects of alcohol exposure on
             fetuses and infants.

               1. Pregnant (assessment: urine beta-hCG test at screening). Women must also test
                  negative on urine beta-hCG test at the start of every study visit.
