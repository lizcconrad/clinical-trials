  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world and
      accounts for more than 9% of all cancer outcomes. Global mortality from colorectal cancer is
      approximately half the incidence. An estimated 394,000 colorectal cancer deaths occur
      worldwide each year, making colorectal cancer the fourth most common cause of cancer death.
      Overall survival rates after surgical resection of hepatic colorectal metastases were 10-18%
      higher than in patients treated with systemic therapy. Hepatic metastases occur in 45% of
      patients with colorectal cancer. Surgery is the standard of care for resectable diseases,
      with overall survival rates of 5 years (OS) of 28% -58%. Unfortunately, only 10-20% of
      patients have a resectable disease at the time of diagnosis. The current approach to treating
      nonresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) promotes the use of combined cytotoxic
      therapy. First-line treatments include cytotoxic combinations. The role of radiotherapy in
      metastatic cancer is historically palliative, conventional radiotherapeutic techniques
      causing radiation-induced liver disease (RLID). With the advent of extracranial stereotactic
      radiotherapy (SBRT), equivalent doses can be safely administered in 3 to 5 fractions, which
      can result in the removal of all affected tissues in the treated area while limiting the
      irradiation of the host organ and the healthy tissues surrounding the tumors. The efficacy
      and safety of SBRT for liver metastases has been confirmed by retrospective studies showing
      local control rates of about 80% or more. Retrospective studies indicate that approximately
      20% of patients remain disease-free 2 to 4 years after SBRT. For patients treated with SBRT,
      some authors found that half of the patients had no metastatic progression or very little
      progression in numbers and metastasis sites. These results confirm the idea of an
      oligometastatic state in which aggressive local therapy could improve progression-free
      survival (PFS). We propose in this study to evaluate the impact of SBRT on progression-free
      survival in patients with mCRC with 1-3 oligometastases of the liver. Two arms will be
      compared: the standard arm treated with chemotherapy; to the experimental arm combining
      chemotherapy and SBRT. The chemotherapy will be left free at the choice of the investigator
      according to the recommendations of national treatments.
