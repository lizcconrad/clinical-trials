  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to examine whether the effects of intranasal oxytocin on
      eye-gaze behavior towards social stimuli are modulated via individual differences in trait
      autism

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double-blind, within subject, placebo controlled design a total of n = 40 healthy
      male subjects will receive either 24 IU of oxytocin or placebo (interval between
      administration &gt; two weeks). 45 minutes after treatment subjects will undergo a total of 7
      eye-tracking paradigms examining eye-gaze behavior during social processing: (1) dynamic
      social-nonsocial visual preference task during which movies of dynamic geometric images (DGI)
      and dynamic social images (DSI) will be presented; (2) non-biological versus biological
      motion task; (3) social attention and motivation of sharing enjoyment; (4) preference for
      emotional faces versus schematic faces (emoticons); (5) shared social attention - shared gaze
      direction with an actor shifting his attention to different objects; (6) preferred visual
      scanning of face regions in emotional faces; and, (7) eye gaze in response to empathy
      eliciting visual stimuli. Autistic and associated traits will be assessed using the Autism
      Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Social Responsibilities Scale (SRS) and the Interpersonal Reactivity
      Index (IRI). Within-subject differences in the effects of oxytocin on social eye gazing
      behaviour will be related to individual differences in autistic traits.
