  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on studies of &quot;Inherited Susceptible Genes Among Epithelial Ovarian Cancer&quot;
      (NCT03015376, clinicaltrials.gov) and &quot;Cohort Study of Universal Screening for Lynch Syndrome
      in Chinese Patients of Endometrial Cancer&quot; (NCT03291106, clinicaltrials.gov), we provide
      risk-reducing surgeries of salpingo-oophorectomy with/without hysterectomy for healthy
      carriers with mutation genes of hereditary ovarian cancer, which is defined ovarian cancer
      with relevant pathogenic mutations.
