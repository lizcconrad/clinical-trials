  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human health comprises many different states, ranging from perfect health to critical
      illness, so medical facilities should be able to provide medical assistance tailored to the
      patient's degree of disease.

      The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) serves as a place for monitoring and care of patients with
      potentially severe physiologic instability requiring technical and/or artificial life
      support. The level of care in an ICU is greater than that available on the floor or
      Intermediate Care Unit.

      Because of the utilization of expensive resources, ICUs should, in general, be reserved for
      those patients with reversible medical conditions who have a &quot;reasonable prospect of
      substantial recovery&quot;.

      About one third of hospital mortality occurs in critically ill patients in the intensive care
      unit. On the other hand, critically ill patients are responsible for 10 - 20 % of global
      hospital costs.

      It is well accepted that early appropriate referral of patients to an ICU can significantly
      reduce early and possibly late mortality in the critically ill.At the same time improper
      selection of patients for ICU who block ICU beds often limits bed availability in ICUs. This
      in turn adversely affects the dynamics the whole hospital.

      The Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) is an area that provides closed monitoring and
      intensive treatment for patients with acute or exacerbated respiratory failure caused by a
      disease that is primarily respiratory.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with the following conditions are candidates for admission to the respiratory
        Intensive Care Unit. The following conditions include, but are not limited to:

          1. Acute respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support

          2. Acute pulmonary embolism with haemodynamic instability

          3. Massive haemoptysis

          4. Upper airway obstruction

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who are generally not appropriate for respiratory ICU admission:

          1. Irreversible brain damage

          2. End stage cardiac, respiratory and liver disease with no options for transplant

          3. Metastatic cancer unresponsive to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy

          4. Patients with non-traumatic coma leading to a persistent vegetative state (7,8,9,10)
