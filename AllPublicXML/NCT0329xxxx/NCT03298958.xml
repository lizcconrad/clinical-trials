  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-site Phase 3 double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial.
      Subjects are randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or oral Sirolimus: 0.5 mg daily.
      All subjects will be treated for 2 years or until disease recurrence. Patients will undergo
      endoscopic evaluation of the bladder every 3 months for the first 2 years following
      enrollment and then every 6 months for an additional 2 years on study. Selection of BCG
      immune therapy is at the discretion of the treating urologist but in general is reserved for
      high-risk patients. Patients concurrently receiving BCG immune therapy will receive standard
      BCG therapy including induction (weekly for 6 weeks) and maintenance (weekly for 3 weeks at 3
      months, 6 months, and then every 6 months following tumor resection).
