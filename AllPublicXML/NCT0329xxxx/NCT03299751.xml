  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS), occurring in newborn of at least 7 days of life, is
      frequently observed in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) and potentially severe
      (mortality, neurologic and respiratory impairments).

      Despite its high prevalence, a reliable diagnostic remains difficult. Currently, nonspecific
      clinical signs that might be linked to other neonatal conditions, such as prematurity and
      birth defects are used to determine the diagnosis of LOS. Laboratory results of biological
      markers, such as C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) are often delayed in
      comparison with LOS onset. Blood culture results are too late and lack sensitivity.

      Excessive antibiotic use is observed in a large proportion of NICU hospitalized newborns.
      This results in an increased antibiotic resistance, microbiota modification, neonatal
      complications (pulmonary, ophthalmologic and neurologic) and mortality.

      The primary objective is to identify, on a cohort of 200 patients, the optimal biomarker
      combination with good diagnostic performance (i.e. with maximal Area Under the ROC Curve) to
      early exclude a LOS diagnostic in newborns of at least 7 days of life with suggestive signs.

      This identification will be carried out, as a secondary objective, with a sub-group of
      pre-term neonates whose birth weight is less than 1500 grams. The diagnostic value of the
      clinical signs that are suggestive of LOS will also be determined (sensitivity, specificity,
      negative and positive predictive values).

      Once identified, the biomarker combination is expected to reduce unjustified antibiotic use.
