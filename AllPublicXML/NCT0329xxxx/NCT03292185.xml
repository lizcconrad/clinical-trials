  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the trial is to compare the bioavailability (extent of drug absorption
      into the circulation) of insulin degludec and liraglutide as part of a combination product
      insulin degludec/liraglutide compared to the corresponding doses of single, separate
      injections of insulin degludec and liraglutide. Participants will receive all three test
      substances. The order of trial administration will be allocated by chance. During the trial
      period, serials of blood samples will be collected from the participants at three dosing
      periods, in order to determine the concentration of insulin degludec and liraglutide. The
      total volume of blood taken throughout the whole trial period will be less than 400 mL.
      Participants will be asked to stay on daytime and overnight in the trial sites on some
      predefined days. For other outpatient days, participants need to attend the trial site as
      required for drug administration or required assessments.
