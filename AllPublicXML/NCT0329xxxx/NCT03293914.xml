  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is examining the feasibility of implementing an occupational therapy intervention
      addressing diabetes management in a primary care clinic within the Los Angeles County
      Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS), as well as the impact of this intervention approach
      on clinical outcomes, efficiency and patient-centeredness of care. This implementation
      science study is evaluating two emerging trends in healthcare delivery: (1) the integration
      of nontraditional providers into primary care medical home (PCMH) settings to facilitate the
      delivery of high-quality, comprehensive primary care while reducing the burden on physicians;
      and (2) the potential value of using occupational therapists to address chronic disease
      management in this setting
