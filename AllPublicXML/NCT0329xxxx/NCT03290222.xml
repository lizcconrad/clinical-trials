      The TRACK (&quot;Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids&quot;) questionnaire is the only
      instrument developed and validated so far to evaluate the control of respiratory symptoms in
      young children under five years of age. The TRACK questionnaire consists of five questions,
      scored from 0 to 20, given to caregivers of children with asthma or recurrent respiratory
      symptoms, and addresses respiratory symptoms, nocturnal awakenings and limitation of daily
      activities in the last four weeks, use of bronchodilator medications over the past three
      months and systemic corticosteroids in the last year.

      The TRACK questionnaire was developed in English and has already been translated and
      validated into Spanish and Arabic. At the moment there is no translation and validation of
      the TRACK questionnaire for the Portuguese language, purpose of the present project.
