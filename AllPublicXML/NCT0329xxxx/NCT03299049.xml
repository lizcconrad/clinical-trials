  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Antiretroviral Therapy as Long Acting Suppression every 2 Months (ATLAS-2M) study is
      designed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity and safety of CAB LA + RPV LA
      administered every 8 weeks (Q8W) compared to CAB LA + RPV LA administered every 4 weeks (Q4W)
      over a 48-week treatment period in approximately 1020 adult HIV-1 infected subjects. Subjects
      will be divided in 2 groups; Group 1 will include subjects receiving current anti-retroviral
      (ART) standard of care (SOC) therapy whereas group 2 will include subjects currently
      receiving CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W in ATLAS study. Subjects in both groups will be randomized to
      receive CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W or Q8W. The study will be carried out in 3 phases including
      screening phase, maintenance phase and extension phase. Subjects choosing not to enter the
      Extension phase can complete their study participation at the Week 100 visit and enter into
      the 52-week Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Phase as required.

          -  Any pre-existing physical or mental condition (including substance use disorder)
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to
             comply with the dosing schedule and/or protocol evaluations or which may compromise
             the safety of the subject.

          -  Subjects determined by the Investigator to have a high risk of seizures, including
             participants with an unstable or poorly controlled seizure disorder. A subject with a
             prior history of seizure may be considered for enrollment if the Investigator believes
             the risk of seizure recurrence is low. All cases of prior seizure history should be
             discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrollment.

          -  All subjects will be screened for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]). Subjects with
             untreated secondary (late latent) or tertiary syphilis infection, defined as a
             positive RPR and a positive treponemal test without clear documentation of treatment,
             are excluded. Subjects with a false positive RPR (with negative treponemal test) or
             serofast RPR result (persistence of a reactive nontreponemal syphilis test despite
             history of adequate therapy and no evidence of re-exposure) may enroll after
             consultation with the Medical Monitor. Participants with primary syphilis or early
             latent secondary syphilis (acquired within the preceding year) who have a positive RPR
             test and have not been treated may be treated during the screening period and if
             completion of antibiotic treatment occurs during the screening period, may be allowed
             entry after consultation with the Medical Monitor. If antibiotic treatment cannot be
             completed before the screening window ends, subjects may be rescreened once following
             completion of antibiotic therapy for primary or early latent secondary syphilis.

          -  Subjects who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a significant suicide risk.
             Subject's recent history of suicidal behavior and/or suicidal ideation should be
             considered when evaluating for suicide risk.

          -  The subject has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the gluteus
             region which may interfere with interpretation of injection site reactions.

             (DNA) as follows:

        Subjects positive for HBsAg are excluded; Subjects negative for anti-HBs but positive for
        anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for HBV DNA are excluded. Note: Participants
        positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for anti-HBs (past and/or
        current evidence) are immune to HBV and are not excluded.

          -  Asymptomatic individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will not be
             excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV
             infection is required; participants who are anticipated to require HCV treatment
             within 12 months must be excluded. (HCV treatment on study may be permitted post Week
             52, following consultation with the medical monitor).

          -  Subjects with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into this study if: liver enzymes
             meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, and is not
             advanced, and will not require treatment prior to the Week 52 visit. Additional
             information (where available) on participants with HCV co-infection at screening
             should include results from any liver biopsy, Fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis
             evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior
             treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment; In the event that recent biopsy or
             imaging data is not available or inconclusive, the Fib-4 score will be used to verify
             eligibility: Fib-4 score &gt;3.25 is exclusionary; Fib-4 scores 1.45 - 3.25 requires
             Medical Monitor consultation; Fibrosis 4 Score Formula:

        (Age x AST ) / ( Platelets x ( square [ ALT ])

             result.

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. A single repeat test is allowed during
             the Screening phase to verify a result.

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound.

          -  Subjects has estimated creatine clearance &lt;50mL/minute per 1.73 meter square (m^2) via
