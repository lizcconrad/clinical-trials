    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center Phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of nivolumab when
      given in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) prior to standard of care radical cystectomy. Patients
      will receive neoadjuvant treatment with nivolumab in combination with gemcitabine-cisplatin
      (GC) every 3 weeks for 4 treatment cycles over 12 weeks followed by standard of care radical
      cystectomy.
