    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to generate safety and performance data for the 4Tech TriCinch
      Coil System in symptomatic patients suffering from significant functional tricuspid
      regurgitation with annular dilatation.

      The TriCinch Coil System is a percutaneous catheter-based medical device for tricuspid valve
      repair.
