  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study of AG10 in healthy
      adult subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 48 healthy volunteers will be given a single dose of AG10 or placebo and be monitored
      for safety and tolerability over a 5-day period. Up to 48 healthy volunteers will be given
      multiple doses of AG10 or placebo and be monitored for safety and tolerability over a 15-day
      period.
