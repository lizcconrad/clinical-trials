      To date, the different biopsy methods, such as CT-guided pleural biopsy, mediastinal biopsy,
      endosonography and thoracoscopy have their limitations in diagnosing pleural malignancies,
      such as mesothelioma. Sampling errors frequently occur resulting in the common histological
      finding of 'non-specific pleuritic/fibrosis', which presents a great uncertainty for
      clinicians and patients. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) provides real-time imaging on a
      cellular level, however data of CLE in pleural malignancies are lacking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel optical imaging techniques such as confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) have emerged in
      recent years as techniques that actually enable in vivo real-time microscopic analysis of
      malignancies of the GI-tract and lung cancer. Through recent advances the probe became small
      enough to fit through a biopsy needle and can be used during CT-guided and endosonographic
      guided biopsies (EUS-FNA). Patients with intra-thoracic malignancies often require invasive
      procedures such as bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, transthoracic needle
      aspiration or surgical exploration to obtain a diagnosis. Intra thoracic malignancies
      encompass lung cancers, thymomas and malignant pleural mesothelioma. These tumors often
      present with pleural thickening, unilateral pleural effusion, mediastinal enlargement or a
      peripheral located mass in the lungs. Tissue collection of the suspected pleural thickening
      is required to assess a diagnosis and differentiate between the tumor types, to classify and
      to stage in a proper manner. To date, the different biopsy methods, such as CT-guided pleural
      biopsy, mediastinal biopsy, endosonography and thoracoscopy have their limitations in
      diagnosing these malignancies. Sampling errors frequently occur resulting in the common
      histological finding of 'non-specific pleuritic/fibrosis', which presents a great uncertainty
      for clinicians and patients. Novel microscopic imaging techniques such as CLE are capable of
      real time imaging on a cellular level. Data of CLE in intra-thoracic malignancies are
      lacking.
