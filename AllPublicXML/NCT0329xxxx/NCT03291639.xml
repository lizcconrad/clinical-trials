  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Tc17 cells (IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells) have been found to contribute to different
      kinds of human inflammatory and malignant diseases. Previous studies indicate that Tc17 cells
      can convert to Tc1 cells (IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells) in tumor bearing mice to exert
      anti-tumor effect. Base on these results in murine models, human Tc17 may have potential in
      developing cancer immunotherapy. However, there is limited evidence to reveal the
      characteristics and functional plasticity of human Tc17 cells. In this proposal, we aim to
      optimize the differentiation of Tc17 cells and then investigate whether the reprograming of
      Tc17 to Tc1 cells can promote the anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Preliminarily, we isolated CD8+ T
      cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors to induce Tc17
      differentiation. Human CD8+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies,
      TGF-β, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23, IL-2, anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-4 antibodies. After 10 days in
      culture, there were 4% of IL-17A+IFN-γ- and 7% of IL-17A+IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells. However, IFN-γ+
      CD8+ T cells still represented high percentage, although it's significantly lower than that
      in Tc1 cells. Our preliminary study demonstrated that Tc17 cells expressed lower levels of
      cytotoxic molecules than Tc1 cells. We will further test if the expressions of cytotoxic
      molecules, including perforin and granzyme B, and EOMES will be enhanced by various
      cytokines. Ultimately, we will evaluate the functional plasticity of Tc17 cells under various
      cytokine stimulation. Collectively, success of this project will establish more insight for
      human Tc17 cells and provide the information for future developing human CD8+ T cell-mediate
      immunotherapy.
