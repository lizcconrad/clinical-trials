  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the rate and amount of nicotine uptake with 10-minute ad libitum use of five
      different marketed electronic cigarettes, or one combustible cigarette (CC). Furthermore, to
      measure overall product liking by subjects to assess potential willingness to seek out the
      Electronic Cigarette (EC) again in the future.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel study during which up to 210
      healthy adult subjects, consisting of 35 subjects per product group, will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be evaluated for plasma nicotine uptake, as well as overall product liking. The
      study will involve the use of five different marketed ECs or one CC in tobacco consumers who
      are exclusive smokers (i.e., naïve EC users) or dual users of cigarettes and ECs (i.e.,
      intermittent EC users).

             attempt, or clinical study participation will be allowed at the discretion of the PI;
             and ii. Using a nicotine-containing &quot;cig-a-like&quot; EC or a tank system EC either daily
             or at least weekly for at least 3 months prior to Screening Visit.

          4. Willing to be confined overnight and abstain from tobacco- and nicotine-containing
             product use (with the exception of study IP use) for 12 hours prior to IP use through

          5. Willing to use assigned IP during the study according to protocol.

          6. Expired breath carbon monoxide (ECO) level is ≥ 10 parts per million (ppm) at the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of clinically significant or unstable/uncontrolled acute or chronic medical
             condition at the Screening Visit, as determined by the PI, that would preclude a
             subject from participating safely in the study (e.g.,, uncontrolled hypertension,
             chronic lung disease, cardiac disease, neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders)
             based on safety assessments such as clinical laboratory tests, pregnancy tests,
             medical history, and physical/oral examinations.

          2. At risk for heart disease, as determined by the PI.

          3. Systolic blood pressure of &gt; 160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of &gt; 95 mmHg,

             Medical Monitor.

          8. Any history of cancer, except for primary cancers of skin such as localized basal
             cell/squamous cell carcinoma that has been surgically or cryogenically removed.

          9. Use of any medication or substance that aids in smoking cessation, including but not
             limited to any nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge,
             patch), varenicline (Chantix®), bupropion (Wellbutrin®, Zyban®), or lobelia extract,
             within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit.

         10. History or presence of hemophilia or other bleeding disorders.

         12. Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to the time of consent.
             The 30-day window for each subject will be derived from the date of the last study
             event in the previous study to the time of consent of the current study.

         13. Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV).

         14. Females who have a positive pregnancy test or who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or
             intend to become pregnant during the course of the study.

             or hormone replacement therapy.

         16. A positive urine drug screen without disclosure of prescribed corresponding
             concomitant medication(s) at the Screening Visit or on Study Day 1.

         17. A positive alcohol breathalyzer result at the Screening Visit or on Study Day 1.
