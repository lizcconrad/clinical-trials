  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the evolution of visual functional and structural
      changes and other associated symptoms in patients with LHON. The relation between genetic,
      lifestyle and/or environmental factors and the LHON disease will be described, and a better
      understanding of the natural history of LHON disease and the healthcare associated to with
      the disease will be sought.

      In addition, we would also like to understand the economic burden for patients and their
      families with LHON resulting from direct and indirect costs they may have because of their
      disease.

        The study will recruit at least 50 affected LHON subjects (both adult and pediatric) from
        global clinical sites at the following countries, but not limited to: Spain, Italy, France,
        United Kingdom, and the United States. Efforts will be done to maintain the population of
        at least 50 affected LHON subjects.

        Recruitment efforts of recruiting approximately 75% of eligible subjects with 11778/ND4
        mutation and 30% of eligible subjects under the age of 18 at the time of index date,
        wherever possible, will be done at the study level.
