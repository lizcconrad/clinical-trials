  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal supplementation with fish oil, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is
      widely recommended in Canada. The aim of this observational, prospective cohort study is to
      determine the effects of maternal fish oil supplements on the development of their infants'
      gut microbiota and immunity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During infancy, the gastrointestinal tract is colonized with microbiota, a community of
      microorganisms, which play a significant role in the development, regulation, and maintenance
      of immune functions. Fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), are thought to
      be anti-inflammatory and consequently may increase susceptibility to infection by hindering
      their body's ability to produce an adequate inflammatory response in defense against
      infectious disease. Currently, women in Canada are supplementing their diets with n-3 PUFA
      during gestation and lactation despite their being conflicting clinical evidence regarding
      the beneficial effects on infant development. It is currently unknown how maternal fish oil
      supplementation impacts the offspring's gut microbiota and immune functions. Considering that
      diet influences microbiota and maternal microbiota is passed from mother to infant, the
      investigators hypothesize that maternal fish oil supplementation will affect the
      participants' infant gut microbiota and immunity.

      This study will evaluate the effects of postnatal n-3 PUFA supplementation in breast milk on
      the fecal microbiome in infants over a six-month period. The investigators will analyze the
      fecal microbiome of infants born to mothers in the fish oil and non-fish oil groups via next
      generation sequencing. As short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced by gut bacteria and
      affect immunity, the investigators will analyze SCFA in stool through gas chromatography.
      Markers of inflammation like fecal calprotectin and sIgA in stool samples will also be
      identified.

        Healthy women in the Okanagan Valley who predominantly breastfeed their healthy, full-term
        infants while self-administering fish oil supplements or not.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All mothers of infants in the Okanagan Valley are invited to participate in the study
             between the first day of delivery to until solid food is introduced into the infant's
             diet.

          -  Healthy, full-term infants, who are predominantly breastfed by mothers who are or are
             not supplementing with fish oil. Mothers must also be healthy, i.e., asymptomatic and
             with no clinical indication of disease.

          -  To remain within the inclusion criteria for this study, participants will be expected
             to be consistent (i.e. maintain the same type and amount of omega-3 PUFA intake or no
             intake) with whichever supplementation group they have decided to join for the
             entirety of the breast milk and infant stool donation period. In other words, the
             investigators will be asking the participants not to switch from one group to another
             which would happen by changing their omega-3 PUFA supplementation patterns.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any infants who are ingesting juice or solid foods as part of their regular diet will
             be excluded from the study.

          -  Any infants who are clinically ill (fever, contagious diseases, or active diarrhea)
             will be excluded from the study.

          -  Any participants who decide to drastically change their omega-3 PUFA supplementation
             intake patterns (i.e. causing them to switch between study groups) will result in all
             subsequent samples to be excluded from the study.
