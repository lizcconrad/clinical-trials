    <textblock>
      Evaluate a multi-faceted training program to improve short-term smoking cessation rates (&lt;14
      days post-visit) and short (3 months) and sustained abstinence (6 months) among 1,114
      enrolled smokers who present for LDCT lung cancer screening in 26 community-based practices.

      We utilize an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, employing a cluster, randomized
      control trial of community-based NCORP sites to study the effectiveness of a multi-faceted
      intervention to improve smoking cessation among lung cancer screening patients, as well as
      dissemination and implementation (D&amp;I) science to optimize and accelerate translation of
      findings into clinical practice. We will: (1) Evaluate a multi-faceted training program to
      improve short-term smoking cessation rates (1-week post-visit) and sustained abstinence (6
      months) among 1,114 enrolled smokers (557 in each trial arm) who present for LDCT lung cancer
      screening in community-based lung cancer screening practices; (2) Characterize the adoption
      and adaptation of the evidence-based tobacco cessation strategies in 26 community-based LDCT
      lung cancer screening programs; and (3) Develop and evaluate an implementation toolkit for
      integrating evidence-based tobacco cessation strategies in community-based LDCT lung cancer
      screening programs. Qualitative data will be collected from key informants at participating
      screening programs during and after intervention implementation. Quantitative survey data
      (baseline, &lt;14 days, 3 months, and 6 months) and saliva specimens (6 months only) will be
      collected from smoking patients receiving screening within these programs.

    <description>Each site will have a coaching team: two members of our research team including an expert in tobacco cessation and an expert in lung cancer screening. Active coaching includes six, 1-1 ½ hour video exchanges among program sites and coaching teams, once every 4-6 weeks over an 8-month implementation phase. One week prior to the call, each site will be prompted with an email to inform the coaching team of any challenges associated with implementation.</description>

             to serve as the cessation program champion.

          -  Agrees to participate in all aspects of the intervention, randomization, and
             evaluation.

          -  Agrees to participate in a confidential 1-on-1 semi-structured interview with the

          -  Agrees to have the interview taped, transcribed and qualitatively analyzed.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Potential participants will be screened using the following question: &quot;Do you smoke
             cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?&quot; (BRFSS). A current smoker is anyone
             responds &quot;every day&quot; or &quot;some days&quot;.
