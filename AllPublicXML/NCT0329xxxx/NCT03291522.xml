  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to use ultrasound-guided rete testis flushing and aspiration
      technique to retrieve sperm, non-surgically, from the testes of azoospermic men. If sperm are
      retrieved by this method, it will provide a direct benefit to the infertile men. This
      protocol will also establish the safety and feasibility of the ultrasound-guided rete testis
      injection approach in consenting men before the approach is translated to teenage boys.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that ultrasound-guided rete testis aspiration is a
      safe and effective method to flush and aspirate rare sperm from the testes of men with
      azoospermia (no sperm in the ejaculate). Current methods to recover sperm from men with
      azoospermia range from surgically invasive and time consuming micro testicular sperm
      extraction (microTESE) to fine needle aspiration (FNA), which is less invasive and less time
      consuming, but also less effective because it is a blind approach. Our approach is not
      surgical; it involves the percutaneous insertion of a hypodermic needle into the rete testis
      space. This approach is also not blind because the needle is accurately positioned under
      ultrasound guidance into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous
      tubules (where sperm are made).

      Patients who are scheduled to undergo testicular sperm extraction (TESE) will be approached
      about the experimental procedure. The investigators will first perform the experimental
      ultrasound-guided rete testis flushing and aspiration on both testis and then perform the
      standard TESE procedure for sperm retrieval also on both testes. For the ultrasound-guided
      rete testis flushing and aspiration, the investigators will flush and aspirate the tubules
      with 500ul of physiological saline, containing methylene blue and Optison ultrasound contrast
      agent in sterile 0.9% saline (both routinely used in clinics). The investigators will examine
      the aspirate for presence of sperm. After the flushing/aspiration procedure, the
      investigators will perform the standard of care TESE procedure on both testicles. With this
      experimental design, the investigators can compare the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided
      aspiration technique to the effectiveness of the standard TESE procedure employed at the male
      fertility clinic at Magee-Womens Hospital. The ultrasound-guided rete testis approach will
      not interfere with the TESE approach, as the ultrasound-guided procedure accesses the tubules
      in the middle of the testis, but TESE accesses the tubules on the surface of the testis. The
      investigators hypothesize that sperm recovery using the ultrasound-guided rete testis
      injection/aspiration approach will at least as effective as TESE approach employed in the
      Magee male fertility clinic (10%) and it will be less invasive.
