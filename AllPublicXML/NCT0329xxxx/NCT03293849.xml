  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized clinical trial, patients with Stage IV solid tumors will be enrolled in a
      patient navigator-led generalist palliative and supportive care intervention or in usual care
      led by their treating physician. The patient navigator will assess the patient's palliative
      and supportive care needs using standardized quality of life and symptoms questionnaires and
      present this assessment to a multidisciplinary team composed of oncologists and palliative
      care specialist. The multidisciplinary team will develop a personalized supportive care plan
      for the patient which will then be presented and discussed by the patient navigator. Those
      interventions which are accepted by the patient will be implemented by the patient navigator,
      who will also provide education and teaching. The patient navigator will also help eligible
      patients complete advanced directives according to local rules and regulations. The patient
      navigator will follow the patients both in person and by telephone to ensure that the
      recommended interventions have been implemented. Three months after enrollment the patients
      will undergo quality of life and symptom assessment once again, and the implementation of
      interventions will be recorded.

    <description>After an assessment of supportive care needs, a patient navigator will present assessment results and develop and implement a personalized supportive care intervention plan based on the findings in collaboration with a multidisciplinary supportive care team, formed by oncologists and pain and palliative care specialists. The developed plan will be sent to the treating oncologist and oncology team.</description>

    <description>The patient navigator will discuss the results and supportive care recommended interventions of the multidisciplinary team with the patient. Those interventions which are accepted by patient are initiated when possible, and referrals are made as planned. The study patient navigator will review advance directive planning with those patients who are candidates to complete an advanced directive under Mexican law, and will facilitate the resources to complete the advance directive.</description>
