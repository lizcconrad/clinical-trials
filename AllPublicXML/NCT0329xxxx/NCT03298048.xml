  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, parallel assignment, double-blinded, safety and efficacy
      study to be conducted in subjects with recurrent CDI. Approximately 300 subjects will be
      enrolled in the study and randomized at 1:1:1 ratio to receive lyophilized donor intestinal
      bacteria with various doses in capsules. All subjects will be followed for approximately 180
      days following FMT for safety.
