  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to perform a review of medical records a single urology department to
      identify patients with febrile perioperative infection who underwent radical cystectomy and
      urinary diversion for bladder cancer from January 2014 to July 2017.

      Investigators plan assess a potential variables to find correlation with infections after
      surgery.

      Characteristics, including age, sex, length of hospital stay, body mass index (BMI),
      diabetes, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), preoperative
      hydronephrosis, smoking status, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pathological stage, lymph node
      involvement, types of urinary diversion, operative method (open/laparoscopic), operative time
      and receipt of a perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) will be asses as potential risk factor
      for perioperative infection.
