        Inclusion Criteria:

               -  Histologically confirmed advanced refractory solid tumor that is measurable or
                  evaluable per RECIST 1.1 criteria.

               -  Histologically confirmed NHL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular
                  lymphoma (Grade 1-3A) that has progressed following at least 1 line of prior
                  anticancer therapy.

          -  Phase 2a: Patients with various solid tumors or NHL who have received prior therapy.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2

          -  Life expectancy ≥3 months in the judgement of the investigator

          -  Adequate organ function as appropriate for the disease under study. All screening
             laboratory tests should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             Screening (≤7 days prior to 1st study drug dose) and must agree to use an effective
             form of contraception from the time of the negative pregnancy test up to 6 months
             after the last dose of study drug. Effective forms of contraception include
             abstinence, hormonal contraceptive in conjunction with a barrier method, or a double
             barrier method. Women of non-child-bearing potential may be included if they are
             either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥1 year.

          -  Fertile men must agree to use an effective method of birth control during the study
             and for up to 6 months after the last dose of study drug.

          -  All associated clinically significant drug-related toxicity from previous cancer
             therapy must be resolved prior to study treatment administration (alopecia is
             allowed).

             with controlled atrial fibrillation are not excluded.

          -  Inability to take oral medication or significant nausea and vomiting, malabsorption,
             or significant small bowel resection that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would

             previous treatment

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Receipt of anti-cancer therapy prior to Cycle 1 Day 1: no chemotherapy, radiation
             therapy, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), or hormonal therapy for the

             Day 1. No immune therapy or other biologic therapy (other monoclonal antibodies or
             antibody-drug conjugates [ADCs]) for the treatment of cancer within 28 days of Cycle 1
             Day 1.

          -  Subject is receiving systemic steroids at doses greater than the equivalent of
