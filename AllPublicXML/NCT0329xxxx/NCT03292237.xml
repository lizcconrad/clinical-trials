  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the widespread use of nutrition therapy, no large scale randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) have demonstrated positive outcomes with delivery of nutrition therapy early in
      critical illness, with some showing no effect with delayed nutrition or even harm.

      There are several possible reasons for the lack of observed benefit from RCTs to date;
      interventions have been short in duration (usually 3-10 days after intensive care unit (ICU)
      admission), perhaps applied at the incorrect time in regards to the patients metabolism and
      recovery, do not consider the patients nutrition risk, and have not addressed what happens to
      nutrition intake post ICU in critically ill individuals. This may explain why RCTs to date
      have not observed any positive associations with the delivery of nutrition; our focus to date
      may have been on the wrong stage of illness. A future study is thus urgently needed, which
      addresses the deficiencies in current RCTs by optimizing nutrition delivery for the whole
      hospital stay and collecting meaningful clinical, process and outcome data, which will
      potentially inform a larger trial of a similar nature.

      This initial study aims to determine whether optimization of energy and protein using a
      pre-tested supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN) strategy in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
      and an intensive nutrition intervention in the post ICU period will deliver more total energy
      and protein than standard nutrition care during hospital admission in a group of critically
      ill patients with at least one organ system failure.

      It is hypothesized that use of a supplemental PN strategy in ICU and an intensive nutrition
      intervention in the post ICU period will lead to a minimum increase of 15% in daily energy
      delivery for the whole hospital admission compared to standard nutrition care.

      Fifteen percent has been estimated as the minimum acceptable clinical difference between the
      two groups.

    <description>In ICU:
After enrolment, patients allocated to the standard nutrition therapy (control) group will commence or continue nutrition via an enteral tube to a target rate according to unit protocol including the use of promotility agents and the placement of nasojejunal feeding tubes if required.
PN will only be used if the above methods have been attempted, or an absolute contraindication to EN develops.
Unless there is specific indication for a compounded PN solution, the PN used in the standard care group will be the same as used in the intervention arm.
After ICU:
Nutrition management will be as per usual site management at that hospital.
Nutrition intake amounts will be recorded 3 times per week using provided study documents and assessment tools.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Intensive Arm</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In ICU:
Supplemental PN will be commenced within 2 hours of randomisation. The starting dose of PN will be determined by the amount of energy received in the 24 hours prior to randomisation
The need for the intervention will be based on the adequacy of nutrition provision from both PN and EN and assessed daily until ICU discharge
If there is an actual or anticipated interruption of EN for greater than 2 hours the PN must be run at 20 kcal/kg calculated body weight until EN is recommenced. After the interruption, EN should be recommenced as per local protocol.
After ICU:
An intensive nutrition intervention will be provided on the ward in the intervention group. This will include daily review from dedicated study dietitians and a clearly protocolized hierarchical management plan which reflects best practice clinical management.</description>
