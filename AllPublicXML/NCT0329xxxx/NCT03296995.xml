  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective monocenter, non-randomised, open-lable single-group intervention
      diagnostic trial on the accuracy, reliability and feasibility of the continuous glucose
      monitoring system in critically systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Newly developed
      technologies for continuous glucose monitoring in critically SLE patients may improve
      glycemic control and reduce glucose variability. Critically SLE patients will be performed by
      continuous glucose monitoring. The subcutaneous glucose will be continuously monitored in
      critical SLE patients by freestyle libre glucose monitoring system for 14 days. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate accuracy feasibility and acceptance of these methods. To analyze
      accuracy sensor glucose levels will be validated due to venous blood measurements with
      glucose oxidase methods. The influence of several factors like oedema, perspiration, BMI,
      body temperature, pH-value application of vasoconstrictors on accuracy and feasibility of the
      particular system would be evaluated. Furthermore the acceptance of physicians and Nursing
      staff would be evaluated by a questionnaire.
