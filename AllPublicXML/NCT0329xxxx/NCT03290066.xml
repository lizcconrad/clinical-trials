  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen occurring just before
      or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases.

      Dysmenorrhea is estimated to occur in 45% to 90% of women of reproductive age. It is a common
      cause of absenteeism and reduced quality of life in women.

      Treatment for dysmenorrhoea aims to relieve pain or symptoms either by affecting the
      physiological mechanisms behind menstrual pain (such as prostaglandin production) or by
      relieving symptoms.

      First line treatment for dysmenorrhoea is oral contraceptives, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol or aspirin. However these present side effects and some
      women have contraindications to these treatments. Consequently, it´s necessary to study
      alternative treatments to drug treatments. Alternative treatments like heat, massage therapy,
      acupuncture also are used.

      The Kinesiotaping uses an adhesive elastic cotton tape color invented by Dr. Kase in the
      1970s. It is water resistant and retains its properties up to 5 days.

      It has the characteristic to cause elevation of the epidermis and thereby reduce the pressure
      on the mechanoreceptors below the dermis. This would have the effect of reducing nociceptive
      stimuli.

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for 2 menstrual cycles, an expected average of 3 months. Evaluations will be performed before, and just after 2 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after treatment</time_frame>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction with Visual Analogic Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for 2 menstrual cycles. Evaluations will be performed at the end of each treatment, when menstrual pain disappears (4-5 days after the beginning of the menstrual bleeding).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will note the self-care applied to relief menstrual pain indicating the VAS is a method of representing subjects' satisfaction with treatment on a 10 cm linear scale. In this study, a score of 0 means 'a very low degree of satisfaction with treatment' and 10 means 'a very high degree of satisfaction with treatment.'</description>

    <description>Kinesiotape will be applied as a self-treatment. All participants will be instructed in an indvidual session and will receive a tutorial video to remember the kinesiotaping procedure. 3 band of a special and hypoallergenic tape (Kinematix Tex) will be attached to the abdominal (2 strips) and lower back (1 strip).
Patients will be taped for four days , ıt will start at the beginning of the menstruation.</description>

A tape of 20cm in length will be placed horizontally to the lower back.</description>
