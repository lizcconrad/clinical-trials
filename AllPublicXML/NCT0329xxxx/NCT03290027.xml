  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enrollment of subjects with mild to moderate facial acne. Subjects with acne lesions of any
      severity on the chest and/or back (including shoulders) may be enrolled provided they have
      mild to moderate acne on the face. During the 12-week treatment period subjects will use the
      study product twice daily. Subjects will be instructed to treat the entire face (and chest
      and/or back including shoulders, if applicable).

      Efficacy will be assessed by using an Investigator's Global Assessment scale (IGA 5 point
      scale) and by counting the number of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions on the face at
      Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12.

      Safety assessments will include the investigator's assessment of local cutaneous tolerance of
      the treated skin (dryness, non-lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and itching;
      assessed separately on the chest and/or back including shoulders (if applicable), vital signs
      (blood pressure and pulse rate), and adverse events (AEs). Urine pregnancy tests will be
      performed at Baseline and at every visit through Week 12 for all female subjects. A physical
      examination will be performed.
