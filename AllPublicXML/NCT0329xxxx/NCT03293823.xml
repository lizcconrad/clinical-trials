  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence from social neuroscience suggests that prefrontal cortex (PFC), insular and
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) regulate social and emotional responses to acute threats to
      social connectedness among young adults. Deficient neural reserve or overused neural
      compensation resulting from neurodegeneration is commonly observed in these frontal regions
      in old age. This aging-related &quot;neural depletion&quot; may have implications for how older adults
      respond to social threats, potentially increasing maladaptive emotional and social behavioral
      responses, such as social anxiety and social avoidance, which contribute to social
      disconnectedness. The central hypothesis is that cognitive deficits and associated
      aging-related 'neural depletion' in the frontal regions will contribute to maladaptive
      social-emotional responses to a social stressor -- social exclusion. Ultimately, maladaptive
      responses to acute social stress, such as social anxiety and avoidance, can compromise social
      connectedness by increasing social strain and isolation. The investigators have recently
      developed a neuroplasticity-based cognitive training program, called vision-based speed of
      processing (VSOP) training, targeting multiple aspects of cognitive capacity (e.g.,
      attention, working memory and inhibition) and incorporating the speed component to improve
      the efficiency of these cognitive processes. VSOP training also targets several neural
      networks seeded in ACC and insular (default mode network) or PFC (the frontal-striatal
      network and central executive network). These networks also overlap with neural substrates of
      emotion regulation. Notably, VSOP training appears to improve emotion regulation, as
      depressive symptoms were reduced in older adults following VSOP training. Finally, the
      autonomic nervous system (ANS), critical to stress adaptation, is regulated by these frontal
      regions. The objective of the proposed pilot study is to provide proof-of-concept for the
      hypothesis that improvements in older adults' cognitive capacity, frontal regions' neural
      efficiency, and ANS function via the VSOP training will be associated with more adaptive
      social-emotional response to social exclusion, which, in turn, should confer longer-term
      protection for older adults' sense of social connectedness. Randomized Controlled Trial
      Design: 30 older adults will be randomly assigned to engage in 6-week VSOP training, or to an
      active control group. Differential changes from baseline to post-training in cognitive
      capacity, neural efficiency, and ANS function, and sense of social connectedness, will be
      compared between VSOP control groups. A social exclusion paradigm ('cyberball' task) will be
      conducted post-training to evaluate VSOP training effects on social-emotional responses to
      social exclusion, including anxiety and motivation for social affiliation.

    <description>use the INSIGHT online program (Posit Science), which includes five training paradigms (Eye for detail, Peripheral challenge, Visual sweep, Double decision, Target tracker) that practice processing speed and attention. All exercises share visual components and focus on accuracy and fast reaction times. Participants respond either by identifying what object they see or where they see it on the screen. The training will automatically adjust the difficulty of each task based on the participant's performance, ensuring that the participants always operate near their optimal capacity. The training programs will automatically record the percentage of completion of each game and scores.</description>
