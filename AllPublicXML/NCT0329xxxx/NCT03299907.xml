  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The agricultural environment presents a unique profile in terms of epidemiology of pulmonary
      diseases. Certainly due to persistent exposure to organic particles, the prevalence of COPD
      is higher in farmers than in the general population, despite less smoking. It is likely that
      the risk of COPD depends on several factors, such as the type of farm, local conditions and
      the region where the farm is located. It is important to diagnose COPD at an early stage in
      order to initiate appropriate therapy, and implement secondary prevention with a view to
      limiting deterioration of respiratory function and reducing complications. In this context,
      the aims of BM3R project were: (1) to study the epidemiology of COPD in a large
      representative sample of French farmers, in order to identify the types of farming, working
      conditions and regions that are associated with the presence of COPD; and (2) to develop a
      score to identify patients at risk and optimise diagnosis of COPD in the context of a
      screening programme.

        Data were collected between October 2012 and May 2013 in two French regions (Brittany and
        Franche-Comté) among affiliated members (farmers and administrative workers of both sexes)
