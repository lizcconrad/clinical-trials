    <textblock>
      NK cells are lymphocytes who play a role in the control of viral infections , tumor and fœtal
      tolerance. They belong to innate immune cells but they have a link with adaptative immunity.
      Indeed, after some viral infections such as CMV, Chikungunya, B hepatitis etc, a subset of
      NKG2C+ NK cells expands and can transfer, in murine models, a &quot; memory &quot; that can better
      control CMV infections. CMV reactivation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after
      allogeneic hematopoietic ste cell transplantation in humans. The aim of this prospective
      study is to evaluate the role of NK cells, in particular NKG2C+ NK cells in the control of
      CMV but also Adenovirus after allo HSCT. Peripheral NK cells from 30 and 10 patients who
      reactivated respectively CMV and AdV are prospectively studied (extensive phenotyping and
      functional studies before and after administration of anti viral drugs) and compared with 30
      allotransplanted patients who didn't reactivate CMV in a pair analysis, and 30 healthy donors
      serologically + for CMV.

      For both groups: 28ml of peripheral blood samples are collected at different points. Group 1
      : before and after anti viral treatment . Control group 2: one point after allo-HSCT; Control
      group 3: 1 point before transplant. Phenotypical study of NK cells: activating and inhibitory
      receptors, activation and differentiation's markers. Phenotypical studies of the ligands on
      infected cells. Genotypic study of KIR receptors (Kirotype); functional studies:
      polyfunctionality essay (flow cytometry): degranulation CD107a, IFNg, TNFa production).
