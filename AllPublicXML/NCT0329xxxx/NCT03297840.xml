    <textblock>

      compared to a waitlist control group.

      Participants will be recruited from the Dialectical-Behavioral-Therapy (DBT) unit. DBT is a
      treatment approach that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Borderline
      Personality Disorder. DBT integrates different psychotherapeutic interventions as well as
      Mindfulness Meditation exercises. Mindfulness is a meditation practice that can improve
      present moment awareness. When applied as therapeutic intervention mindfulness meditation can
      help patients to stay with their attention in the present moment, to be aware what is
      happening in the here and now, and to better identify and regulate upcoming emotions.

      The current observational study investigates changes in symptom severity and mindfulness
      skills during DBT treatment. A treatment group will be compared to a waitlist control group.
      The two groups are predefined by routine medical care.

      Symptom severity and mindfulness skills will be assessed at baseline (before treatment or
      when accepted for the waitlist) and after 12-weeks. A within and between group analyses will
      be performed.
