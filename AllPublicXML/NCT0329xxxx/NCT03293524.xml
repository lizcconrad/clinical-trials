    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of GS010, a gene
      therapy, in improving the retina functional &amp; structural outcomes in subjects with LHON due
      to the G11778A ND4 mitochondrial mutation when vision loss duration is present up to one
      year.
