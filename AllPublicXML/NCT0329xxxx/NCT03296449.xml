    <textblock>
      This study compares two ventilatory techniques (continuous positive airway pressure vs high
      frequency jet ventilation) during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in video-assisted thoracic
      surgery (VATS). All patients were ventilated with both ventilatory techniques and parameters
      of gas exchange were determined through arterial blood gas test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-lung ventilation is mandatory during most thoracic surgery procedures. During OLV,
      collapsed lung develops an intrapulmonary shunt leading to arterial hypoxemia. Since arterial
      hypoxemia is a critical intraoperative problem, many times , anesthesiologists have to use
      rescue ventilation strategies on non-dependent lung to improve arterial oxygen levels. The
      use of continuous positive airway pressure on non-dependent lung has become the most common
      technique to achieve that aim.

      High-frequency jet ventilation on non-dependent lung may be considered as an alternative way
      of ventilation of the non-dependent lung during one-lung ventilation because it provides a
      suitable gaseous exchange while facilitating minimizing surgical field motion. However, this
      ventilation maneuver is rarely use by thoracic anesthesiologists.

      Over the last years, video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become widely utilized. This
      surgical technique becomes even more dependent on immobilization of the operation field than
      open-chest thoracic procedures. There is a lack of evidence in the current literature
      regarding the use of HFJV in VATS.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of HFJV as an alternative for the
      treatment of hypoxemia in VATS.
