      Introduction: Giant thoracic disc herniation is a rare condition for which surgical treatment
      is indicated when there are signs of spinal cord injury. To date, several surgical techniques
      have been described in the treatment of this condition on small patient series. The main
      objective is to evaluate the long-term results of a series of 53 patients treated with a
      minimally invasive endoscopic procedure. The secondary objective is to explain our
      pre-operative planning and the technical details of our procedure. METHOD: Retrospective
      monocentric study on a cohort of patients treated in our department. The following medical
      data from our database are analyzed: Morbidity of operative gesture (duration of procedure,
      bleeding, postoperative complications), clinical results at the last follow-up visit
      (thoracic Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, Frankel score, parietal pain , ability
      to walk, wish to carry out the same intervention again if necessary). On the radiological
      level, we evaluated the quality of the resection (total, subtotal, incomplete and
      impossible), the reappearance of a border of cerebrospinal fluid perimedullary and the
      presence of an intramedullary T2 hyperintense signal MRI post- operative. All these data are
      collected and analyzed anonymously. Expected Results: We believe we can demonstrate that
      thoracoscopy is a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of thoracic disc herniation
      responsible for spinal cord compression. This with a low morbidity given the minimally
      invasive nature of the approach.
