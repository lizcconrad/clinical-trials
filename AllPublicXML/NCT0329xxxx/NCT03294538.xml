  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of the Test
      formulation, Estradiol Vaginal Cream 0.01% (Teva Pharmaceuticals, USA) to the marketed
      product, Estrace® Cream (estradiol vaginal cream, 0.01%) in patients with atrophic vaginitis,
      demonstrate the superiority of the Test and Reference (active) treatments over Placebo
      (vehicle) cream in patients with atrophic vaginitis, and compare the safety of Test,
      Reference and Placebo treatments in patients with atrophic vaginitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic (oral/transdermal patch) estrogen therapies have been shown to effectively treat
      symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, but bear undesirable side effects including increased risk of
      heart attacks, stroke, endometrial cancer and breast cancer. Topical therapies (creams,
      transvaginal delivery systems) provide low doses of estrogen to the vaginal mucosa to provide
      local relief for the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, while reducing the unwanted side effects
      associated with systemic delivery systems. Low dose, topical estrogen therapy is considered
      most appropriate and convenient for the treatment of vaginal symptoms associated with
      menopause, particularly when other symptoms including bone loss or vasomotor dysfunction do
      not need to be targeted.
