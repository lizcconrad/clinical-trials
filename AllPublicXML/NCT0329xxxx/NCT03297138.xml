  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anal complex fistula constitutes a challenge in proctologic surgery because of the of its
      therapeutic care complexity due to the frequency of recurrences and the necessity to protect
      the sphincter function.

      For several years,differents techniques were developed &quot;said sphincter sparing techniques&quot; to
      handle fistulas at risk on the anal continence.

      Recently there is one of them , named FiLAC using a clip system not yet evaluated.

      The purpose is to assess the success rate of his new surgery technique.

    <description>The technique consists in applying in a radial way to 360 Â° an energy laser in the fistulous route. This energy allows a thermal destruction by coagulation of the wall of the fistula and the fabrics of granulations in a circular and regular way as well as a shrinkage of neighbouring fabrics. The repair is made by a call of macrophages and fibroblasts of neighbouring healthy fabrics so ending in a closure of the fistulous route</description>
