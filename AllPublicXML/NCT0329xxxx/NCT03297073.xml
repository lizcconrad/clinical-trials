  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the 5-day kinetics of plasma paracetamol
      levels in postoperative major hepatic surgery (resection greater than or equal to three
      hepatic segments) compared with less extensive liver resection and hepatic re-intervention.
      The clearance of indocyanine green is a marker of hepatic perfusion but also of the proper
      hepatocyte functioning, if hemodynamic conditions are stable.

      Some patients may be operated on up to four or five times in the liver. Moreover, these
      patients probably present an increased risk of postoperative hepatocellular insufficiency due
      to a quantitative and qualitative decrease in their hepatic parenchyma. It is therefore
      interesting to evaluate the use of paracetamol in this situation.
