  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and an automatically Adjusting
      Positive Airway Pressure (APAP) device with new technology called SensAwake™. This requires
      experimental confirmation in a randomised controlled trial with crossover design, comparing
      compliance on standard APAP with compliance using APAP modified by the addition of the
      SensAwake™ modification on consecutive nights in participants with moderate−to−severe OSA.

    <description>Patients will receive CPAP treatment with SensAwake™ activation for two weeks The SensAwake™ modification to the Fisher and Paykel automatically titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) device aims to sense whether the patient is awake via respiratory patterns that differentiate between sleep and wake. Upon sensing that the patient is awake the device is able to reduce positive airway pressure PAP aiming to improve patient comfort which should result in more consolidated sleep.</description>

    <description>SensAwake™ is a new design based on the research of Doctor Ayappa 5 years ago. The SensAwake™ modification to the Fisher and Paykel automatically titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) device aims to sense whether the patient is awake via respiratory patterns that differentiate between sleep and wake. Upon sensing that the patient is awake the device is able to reduce positive airway pressure PAP aiming to improve patient comfort which should result in more consolidated sleep.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Participants will be recruited from OSA patients who will remove CPAP himself without
        any notable reasons.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable cardiovascular disease (untreated or resistant hypertension acceptable).

          2. Inability to tolerate CPAP due to nasal obstruction or claustrophobia as determined by
             the study investigator.

          3. Any known factor or disease that might interfere with treatment compliance, study
             conduct or interpretation of the results such as psychiatric disease, history of non
             compliance to medical regimens, or unwillingness to comply with study requirements.

          4. Any known factor that result in mask taken of such as skin discomfort, nasal
             obstruction, water dripping inside the tubing system etc.
