  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current curative treatment of digestive peritoneal carcinomatosis consists of complete
      cytoreduction surgery associated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy. This treatment has
      important limits: a high morbimortality and the impossibility of repeating the sessions. The
      majority of patients are therefore treated with systemic chemotherapy, which despite its
      progress, remains palliative.

      Pressurized Intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) has many advantages: under
      laparoscopy, low morbidity, good intratumoral penetration of cytotoxics, possibility of
      repeating the sessions and low financial cost.

      Therefore, the investigator propose a phase 1 study, in colorectal and stomach cancer, with
      oxaliplatin doses escalation in Pressurized Intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy. It would
      allow a better tumor response, with potentially few risks and thus improve survival in
      patients with digestive peritoneal carcinoses, increasing access to cytoreductive surgery.
