  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients admitted to London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) are asked to indicate their
      preferences for CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and other life-sustaining treatments that
      necessitate an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission.

      Complex, high-risk patients at LHSC require multiple admissions to the hospital towards their
      end-of-life (EOL). Documentation of their resuscitation status should be a part of a broader
      dialogue with patients around their goals of care (GOC) and advance care planning (ACP), but
      rarely is this the case.

      The innovation will involve the use of trained nurse facilitators to have meaningful
      conversations with patients and their families in an effective way that bridges the gap
      between resuscitation status, GOC discussions and ACP across the continuum of care.

      1. On admission, the usual LHSC process will be followed whereby the patient's wishes for
           resuscitation are documented on the resuscitation record in the patient's chart. This
           constitutes the &quot;original&quot; resuscitation status.

        2. After referral or screening and written consent, the RA will conduct semi-structured,
           face-to-face interviews with the patient and or SDM as appropriate. If the RA has
           concern about a discordance, he/she will then provide verbal feedback to the health-care
           team (Attending Physician or the Senior Medical Resident (SMR)) immediately and request
           them to communicate with the patient/SDM again. A case of discordance shall be recorded
           ONLY if the health-care team (Attending Physician or Senior Medical Resident) confirms
           that a change in resuscitation status is needed. The output of this intervention will be
           the &quot;revised&quot; resuscitation status. This &quot;standardized&quot; process for determining this
           outcome has worked well in our pilot study. Any disagreements between RA and SMR on
           patient/SDM preferences will be reported to Team#1 Attending and recorded. It will be up
           to the team to reconcile the &quot;revised&quot; resuscitation preferences on official records
           (Resuscitation status can only be filled in only by an MD as per hospital policy).

      4. Advanced Clinical Notes: These will be typed by the RA and a note be made of the &quot;revised&quot;
      resuscitation preferences along with GOC and ACP discussions.

      5. A pilot study related to this work started in August 2016 and has allowed the research
      team to evaluate barriers and facilitators of conducting this intervention on Internal
      Medicine patients.
