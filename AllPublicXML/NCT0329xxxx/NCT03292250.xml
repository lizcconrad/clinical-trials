      This study will be conducted as a part of umbrella trial by Korean Cancer Study Group. The
      brief scheme of this umbrella trial is as follows:

      R/M HNSCC 2nd line

        1. PI3K inhibitor - BYL719 (from Norvatis)

        2. EGFR/HER2 inhibitor - poziotinib (from Hanmi pharmaceutical)

        3. FGFR inhibitor - nintedanib (from Boehringer ingelheim)

        4. Cell cycle (CDK4/6) inhibitor - abemaciclib (from Lily)

        5. Others- anti PD1/PD-L1 - durvalumab+/-tremelimumab (from AZ)

      During or after palliative 1st line platinum based chemotherapy, we will perform prescreening
      NGS based molecular characterization. The molecular characterization will be done by
      following three methods.

        -  NGS : Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment (245 genes)

        -  Nanostring nCounter including immune signature

        -  IHC : PD-L1, CD8 TIL, p16

      Mutation will be analyzed by NGS, fusion and amplification will be determined by Nanostring
      methods, and PD-L1/p16 status will be determined by immunohistopathology. Molecular tumor
      board to determine characterization will be held for every patients. Once each patients have
      relevant genetic pathway, the patients will be allocated each treatment arm (see below
      figure). If the patients have no relevant genetic alteration, such a patients will allocated
      to durvalumab+/- tremelimumab arm regardeless of PD-L1 positivity. If the patients who
      allocated to poziotinib, BYL719, nintedanib, and abemaciclib experience disease progression
      but still meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria for durvalumab+/- tremelimumab arm, the
      cross over to durvalumab+/- tremelimumab arm will be permitted. Vice versa (cross over from
      durvalumab+/- tremelimumab arm to another arms) is not permitted.
