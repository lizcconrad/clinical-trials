  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke places a major burden on health care and society. It often leads to a hemiparesis.
      Intensive stroke rehabilitation speeds up recovery. In daily practice, the financial and/or
      human resources to provide this intensive rehabilitation are often lacking. Applying
      modern-day tracking and feedback technology to encourage a self-administered, context
      specific training is expected to offer significant potential to increase intensity of
      practice. Up until now, there has been no randomized trial examining the effect of such an
      intervention on daily arm usage.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of wearing an activity
      tracking and multimodal feedback device for six weeks on self-reported daily life use of the
      paretic arm after stroke, when compared to control group stroke subjects wearing a
      hardware-wise identical sham device providing no feedback. The secondary aim is to examine
      compliance to use the device and the quantitative, qualitative and functional improvement of
      the paretic arm. It is hypothesized that participants in the experimental group show a higher
      change in self-reported daily life use of the paretic arm when compared to the control group
      both post intervention and at 6-week follow-up.

      ISEAR is a multicenter, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial of 62 subjects beyond
      the first 3 months poststroke.
