  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minority women and women of lower socioeconomic status are at significantly increased risk of
      unintended pregnancies, short inter-pregnancy interval, and short duration of breastfeeding.
      The consequences of poorly timed pregnancies and short duration of breastfeeding for the
      health of mothers, infants and children are well documented.

      To decrease rates of poorly timed pregnancies, increase breastfeeding duration and address
      other postpartum concerns women must be engaged in their postpartum care outside of the
      traditional postpartum visit. In addition to contraceptive counseling and breastfeeding
      support, providers discuss a number of important maternal and child health issues at the
      postpartum visit. These include (1) screening and referral for postpartum mood disorders (2)
      screening for cardiometabolic consequences of pregnancy complications, (3) discussing
      inter-conception care and (4) connecting women with a primary care provider. Thus, as
      recommended by numerous professional societies, the standard postpartum visit at 4 to 6 weeks
      after delivery has considerable value to women's postpartum care.

      Attendance rates for the postpartum visit are markedly lower for women with limited resources
      contributing to racial and economic health disparities. Despite receiving excellent prenatal
      care, only 40% of the economically disadvantaged women who receive prenatal care at the Magee
      outpatient clinic return for their postpartum visit. These parallel national trends, where
      60% of women with Medicaid insurance return for a postpartum checkup compared with over 82%
      of women with private insurance. Medicaid programs serve pregnant women who are particularly
      vulnerable to poor health outcomes and thus this gap is critical. Additionally, minority
      women disproportionally receive Medicaid and thus interventions that focus on Medicaid
      recipients have the potential to address racial as well as economic disparities. These data
      demonstrate that the current care model does not engage all women to make good health care
      decision postpartum and is disproportionately failing our most vulnerable moms and babies.

      Empirically derived concepts from behavioral economics can be leveraged to design
      interventions that support participants to make better health decisions and may be
      particularly useful for postpartum care.

      The feasibility trial will focus on four tenants of behavioral economicsâ€”bounded rationality
      (information overload), status quo bias (lack of self-control), hovering (limited attention),
      and framed incentives-- that have been successfully used to tackle stubborn health problems
      such as smoking and obesity. Importantly, unlike tobacco cessation or weight loss, many
      aspects of postpartum care such as compliance with the visit or uptake of LARC, do not
      require on-going action on part of the patient and thus may be particularly amenable to the
      lessons of behavioral economics.

      Specific Aim 1: To conduct a pilot trial evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a
      future randomized trial to determine the efficacy of Healthy Beyond Pregnancy on adherence
      with the postpartum visit.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of Healthy Beyond Pregnancy on adherence with the
      postpartum visit.
