  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The alteration of iron metabolism is reported in animal models of amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS) as well as in sporadic and genetic forms (SOD1 and C9orf72) of ALS. The high
      iron concentration of the brain, due to its high energy demand (high oxygen consumption),
      makes motor neurons particularly vulnerable to energy deficit and oxidative stress.
      Post-mortem examinations and MRI scans in patients with ALS have found signs of iron
      accumulation in the central motor tract; and a high level of serum ferritin, which is a
      marker of iron levels, is associated with a lower prognosis. In ALS mouse models, the use of
      iron chelators has demonstrated neuroprotection and increased life expectancy, suggesting
      that elimination of excess iron from the brain can prevent neuronal loss and, consequently, a
      slow progression of the disease. Conservative chelation of iron refers to a modality whereby
      much of the iron that binds to the chelator is redistributed in the body rather than
      exhausted. Using a chelator, deferiprone, with this feature, in a safety pilot study, a very
      good safety profile was observed. Deferiprone eliminated excess iron from brain regions,
      reduced oxidative damage and cell death associated with regional iron deposits with no
      apparent negative impact on the iron levels needed. Now, the efficacy of this new therapeutic
      modality of neuroprotection is being evaluated in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

             addiction, bipolar disorder, severe depression, suicidal ideation), in accordance with
             the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Before entry into the
             study, exclusion or stabilization of conditions must occur for patients suffering from
             mild or moderate depressive episodes (not in remission) or severe and uncontrolled
             anxiety.

             agranulocytosis (as described in the IB) will not be allowed. Such medicinal products
             include clozapine as well as some NSAIDs (e.g. Phenylbutazone or Metamizole),
