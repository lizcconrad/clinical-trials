  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this mechanistic study is to evaluate the effects that maternal
      buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance have on the neurobehavioral development of the fetus and
      infant. To accomplish this, the investigators will study a sample of 120 opioid dependent
      pregnant women that will receive buprenorphine-naloxone as part of substance abuse treatment
      at a comprehensive care treatment facility for pregnant and parenting women with substance
      use disorders. Fetal neurobehavior and maternal physiology will be assessed, via an
      established maternal-fetal data acquisition system, at 4 points during gestation: 24, 28, 32
      and 36 weeks. Infant birth parameters and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) spectrum display
      will be evaluated at birth, and infant neurodevelopment will be assessed during the first
      month of life. The investigators will compare the neurodevelopment of the
      buprenorphine-naloxone-exposed fetuses and infants to that of methadone and
      buprenorphine-only exposed fetuses and infants.

      The project population will be 80 pregnant women with opioid use disorder, 40 inducted as
      outpatients to buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance, and 40 matched methadone controls. Subject
      treatment data, including medical and obstetric histories, drug use histories, demographic
      information and psychosocial information will be extracted from patient charts. Weekly urine
      toxicology testing will provide information regarding other substance use/misuse during the
      time of study participation. Study participants will undergo 2 60 minute maternal and fetal
      neurophysiologic monitoring sessions on one day at 4 points during gestation: 24, 28, 32 and
      36 weeks, at times of trough (just before sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone or methadone
      daily dose) and peak (2 1/2 hours after dosing) maternal drug levels. Fetal cardiac (heart
      rate, heart rate variability, heart rate accelerations) and movement (total fetal movement,
      number and duration of movement bouts) and the correlation between the two (fetal heart
      rate-movement coupling) will be determined. Maternal physiologic measures will include heart
      period and variability, vagal tone, skin conductance and respiratory data. All maternal and
      fetal measures, with the exception of blood pressure, will be computed in 1-minute intervals
      and averaged over the 60 min recording. Infant birth data and birth parameters, and neonatal
      abstinence syndrome scores will be extracted from patient charts. Infants will undergo
      neurobehavioral testing using the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral
      Scale, a 30 minute harmless assessment of infant functioning, on days 3, 14 and 30 of life.

    <description>NAS lists 21 symptoms most frequently observed in opiate-exposed infants. Baseline score is recorded two hours after birth or admission to the nursery. If the infant's score at any scoring interval is ≥ 8, scoring is increased to 2-hourly and continued for 24 hours from the last total score of 8 or higher. If the 2-hourly score is ≤ 7 for 24 hours then 4-hourly scoring intervals may be resumed. If pharmacotherapy is not needed the infant is scored for the first 4 days of life at 4-hourly intervals. If pharmacotherapy is required the infant is scored at 2- or 4-hourly intervals, depending on whether the abstinence score is less than or greater than 8 throughout the duration of therapeutic period. If after cessation of pharmacotherapy the score is less than 8 for the following 3 days, scoring may be discontinued.</description>
