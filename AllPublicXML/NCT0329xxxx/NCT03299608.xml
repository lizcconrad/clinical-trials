        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hematological disease beyond the specified inclusion criteria

          -  Signs of active respiratory infection

          -  If previously enrolled: incomplete clearance of all signs of respiratory infection
             (both clinically, microbiologically and radiologically).
