  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a persistent
      problem that limits activities and causes distress. Considering the high prevalence of CRF
      among HCT survivors and the limitations of currently existing treatments, there is a pressing
      need for establishing safe and effective options for reducing CRF after HCT. Based on
      evidence supporting the use of yoga for CRF in non-HCT populations, yoga is one option worthy
      of evaluation for ameliorating CRF in HCT patients. Yoga is easy to implement, may be
      appealing to HCT patients, and can be self-administered, which would encourage long-term use
      and potentially lead to a better control of persistent CRF in HCT survivors. The primary aim
      of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of a yoga intervention for HCT survivors
      with CRF. Outcomes from this feasibility study will provide the information needed to design
      a larger, adequately powered randomized controlled trial to evaluate yoga for CRF in HCT
      survivors. This study will employ a mixed-methods, single-arm, pretest-posttest design with
      focus groups. Twenty HCT survivors who report at least moderate fatigue will be recruited
      from the HCT clinic, Michigan Medicine. Participants will be enrolled in a six-week
      Restorative yoga program. The program will consist of a weekly, 60-minute yoga group class
      led by a certified yoga instructor along with twice-weekly home practice using yoga DVD.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective: To assess the feasibility of an organized yoga intervention for HCT
      survivors with CRF.

      Hypothesis: A trial of yoga in the HCT survivor population will be deemed feasible if at
      least 75% of study subjects demonstrated protocol adherence rate of at least 80%.

      Secondary Objectives:

      - Explore participants' perceptions regarding yoga and physical activity

      Hypothesis: HCT survivors will be positive about yoga and will express satisfaction with the
      yoga program, as will be shown during focus groups that will be held at the end of the yoga
      program.

      - Evaluate the association between yoga practice and self-efficacy and self-regulation

      Hypothesis: Adherence to yoga will be associated with higher self-efficacy and selfregulation
      scores.

      - Evaluate the changes in CRF scores from baseline to the end of the yoga program.

      Hypothesis: CRF scores at the end of the yoga program will be lower than CRF scores at
      baseline.

      - Evaluate whether changes in CRF are associated with changes in depression, sleep
      disturbances, physical activity, and pain.

      Hypothesis 5: Improvement in CRF will be associated with increased physical activity and
      decreased depression, sleep disturbances, and pain.

      - Evaluate the safety of yoga practice in HCT survivors.

      Hypothesis: Yoga will be considered as a safe intervention for CRF in HCT survivors as
      demonstrated by the absence of adverse events or serious adverse events related to or
      associated with yoga practice.

    <description>Yoga practice at home will be documented on a log sheet to be filled out by participants at the end of each practice week. We will check class attendance during the weekly telephone call with the study participants. We will use a log sheet to document in-class yoga practice and location of the yoga performance. At the end of the program, the number of yoga practice hours per participant will be tabulated. This number will be used to evaluate participants' adherence to yoga practice.</description>
