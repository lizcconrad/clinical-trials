      Retrospectivly follow-up the outpatients for H pylori eradication failures more than 2 times
      in the digestive department of Changhai hospital from 2015-2017,analyse the eradication rates
      and adverse effects of the therapy with 2w's compound lactobacillus acidophilus followed by
      10d's bismuth, furazolidone, tetracycline contained quadruple scheme.

    <textblock>
      H pylori infection rate has been up to half of the world population. H pylori infection is
      associated with various diseases, especially gastric cancer.

      With the increasingly resistant to antibiotics,the eradication rate has decreased a lot with
      traditional triple therapy. Exploring a valid scheem for patients who have failed multiple
      times is important.

      Probiotics can improve gastrointestinal microenvironment, then release the adverse effects
      during the eradication process.Additionally,there is also a lot evidence that probiotics can
      inhibit H ploriï¼Œbut still controversially.

      There is a low resistant rate about furazolidone and tetracycline. In this study
      investigators observe the efficacy of the therapy 2w's compound lactobacillus acidophilus
      followed by 10d's bismuth, furazolidone, tetracycline contained quadruple scheme on patients
      who have failed more than 2 times. 4 to 6 weeks after the therapy, if Urea Breath Test (UBT)
      is nedative which means eradicating H plori successfully.
