  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preformed metal pediatric crowns (CPPm) are currently considered the best method of restoring
      temporary molars affected by severe carious lesions compared to restorations made with
      various restorative materials (amalgams, composites, CVI-based materials). Due to their
      unsightly appearance, denounced by many parents, more aesthetic zirconia (CPPz) preformed
      pediatric crowns have been recently marketed. In the absence of an evaluation of the latter,
      this multi-center fractional oral clinical trial proposes to evaluate clinically and
      radiographically the success rate of pediatric preformed zirconia and metallic crowns.

      One hundred children aged at least 4 years must be recruited in eight departments of
      odontology pediatric hospital-university (Bordeaux, Lille, Nancy, Nantes, Nice, Paris,
      Strasbourg, Toulouse). They will be included if they have two similar temporary molars of the
      same arch (eg first right maxillary temporal molars left) and equally affected, to be
      crowned. The two types of crowns to be used in the same child, CPPm (3M Espe) and CPPz
      (Ezpédo), will be affected by drawing lots. The children will be checked every 6 months for a
      period of 2 years after the placement of the two types of crowns at one week intervals.
      During these four control visits, the success associated with an absence of signs and
      symptoms of irreversible pulpitis or periodontal complications will be sought (main
      endpoint). At the same time, the rate of retention and fracture of CPPs, the gingival
      condition in the vicinity of the analgesics, the antagonist tooth wear and the parental
      satisfaction and that of the children related to each treatment (judgment criteria
      secondary). Each center has a trained and / or calibrated operator and evaluator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children of at least 4 years of good general health (ASAI or II),

          -  Child with at least two temporary molars of the same type, 1st or 2nd molar,
             contralateral (fractional mouth), meeting the following criteria:

        The two temporary molars are affected by a cavitary carious lesion or a hypoplastic defect
        of at least 2 faces,

          -  the two temporary molars of the pair (54-64, 55-65, 74-84 or 75-85), should or should
             not be subjected to pulpotomy prior to the realization of the CPP,

          -  the two molars must have an antagonistic tooth.

               -  Consent of parents (legal guardians) and child,

               -  Child and parents (legal guardians) speaking French,

               -  Child covered by his parents' social security cover,

               -  Child cooperating in the vigilant or sedated state (cooperation evaluated with a
                  Venham score 0, 1, 2).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child who does not cooperate in care under vigil or under conscious sedation, who must
             therefore be treated under general anesthesia.

          -  Child allergic to local anesthetics, chromium or nickel.

          -  Temporary molar whose physiological fall must occur within the next 24 months or when
             root resorption has already involved more than one-third of the root length.

          -  Temporarily dilapidated temporary molar prohibiting retention and waterproofing of the
             restoration.

          -  Temporary molar associated with a vestibular arch.

          -  Molar whose cementum has been exposed.

          -  Molar with spontaneous pain.

          -  Temporary molar in infraclusion.

          -  Temporary molar, the radiographic examination of which reveals an enlargement of the
             periodontal space, the presence of a radioclay image in the furcation and / or
             periapical regions, or even an internal or external resorption.
