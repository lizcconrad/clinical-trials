  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT) for insomnia conducted face-to-face with a therapist versus CBT for insomnia conducted
      using Internet-based videoconference technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of telemedicine
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for insomnia [via the American Academy of Sleep Medicine
      Sleep Telemedicine (AASM Sleep TM) platform] to gold standard face-to-face CBT for insomnia.
      The central hypothesis is that CBT for insomnia delivered by AASM SleepTM will be comparable
      to face-to-face CBT for insomnia for clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction, but AASM
      SleepTM will be a more cost effective treatment modality (primarily through reduced costs
      associated with facility use and patient time). The rationale for the proposed project is
      rooted in the critical need to disseminate CBT for insomnia using the most effective and
      efficient modalities, with recognition that therapist involvement likely produces the most
      favorable outcomes.

    <time_frame>Post-treatment (about 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CSQ-8 is an 8-item, easily scored and administered measurement that is designed to measure client satisfaction with services. The items for the CSQ-8 were selected on the basis of ratings by mental health professionals of a number of items that could be related to client satisfaction and by subsequent factor analysis. The CSQ-8 is unidimensional, yielding a homogeneous estimate of general satisfaction with services.
Scores range from 8 - 32, with high scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-treatment (about 6 weeks), follow-up (about 12-weeks post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The MFI-20 is a 20-item scale with five subscales representing dimensions of general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue.</description>
