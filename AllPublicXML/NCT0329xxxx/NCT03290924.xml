    <textblock>
      This study assesses the effect of a low-dose, high-frequency training approach on long-term
      evidence-based skill retention among skilled birth attendants and impact on adverse birth
      outcomes at hospitals in Ghana.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In-service training for skilled birth attendants (SBAs) is one of the most common
      interventions to address lack of knowledge and skills. However, these training interventions
      are seldom evaluated for effectiveness in improving learning or performance.

      This study study is a cluster-randomized waitlist trial implemented in 40 public and mission
      hospitals in Ghana. It assesses the effect of a low-dose, high-frequency (LDHF) training
      approach to update hospital-based SBAs in key evidence-based intrapartum and immediate
      newborn care practices, using current global guidelines.The LDHF approach includes two 4-day
      onsite sessions (low dose) with weekly practice sessions, SMS quizzes and reminders, and
      mentoring via mobile phone and onsite visits between trainings (high frequency). The low-dose
      sessions include competency acquisition through simulation, case-based learning, and small
      content packages spread over short time intervals.

      Eligible hospitals will be stratified by geographic region and caseload, and then randomly
      assigned to one of four implementation waves. The pipeline randomization allows for rigorous
      evaluation while the program is rolled out to all facilities.
