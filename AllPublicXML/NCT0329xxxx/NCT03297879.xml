    <textblock>
      The present study was a prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study.The drug-naïve,
      overweight or obese patients with newly diagnosed T2D were consecutively enrolled. The
      inclusion criteria: 1) age 20 - &lt;65 years, 2) body mass index (BMI) ≥ 24 kg/m2 [7], and 3)
      HbA1c ≥ 7% (53mmol/mol). An oral glucose tolerance test was performed during the screenings.
      All of the patients have no diabetes antibodies and were diagnosed with T2D within the
      previous 3 months, according to the ADA diagnostic criteria. None of the patients had
      administered anti-diabetic drugs or diet therapy before participation. Neither of the
      patients presented any history of pancreatitis, coronary artery disease, liver function
      impairment, renal function impairment, intestinal surgery, chronic hypoxic diseases
      (emphysema and cor pulmonale), infectious disease, hematological disease, systemic
      inflammatory disease, or cancer. Patients who were pregnant, possibly pregnant, or ingesting
      agents known to influence glucose or lipid metabolism were also excluded.
