    <textblock>
      The study is to determine the safety of human neural stem cell transplantation for the
      treatment of paralysis and related symptoms due to chronic motor stroke and to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of human neural stem cell transplantation for the treatment of
      chronic motor stroke. This single-site, Phase I, open-label study may enroll up to 18
      patients across 5 cohorts of ascending doses of human neural stem cells to define maximal
      tolerated dose.
