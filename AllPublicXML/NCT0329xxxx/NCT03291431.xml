  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent theta burst repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) as a treatment for Veterans with an alcohol use
      disorder (AUD) to decrease the exceedingly high rate of relapse associated with this
      condition. iTBS has demonstrated equivalent efficacy and safety to repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation employing 10Hz stimulation protocols in treatment of depressive
      disorders. The advantage of iTBS is that it can be delivered in approximately 5 minutes where
      conventional 10Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols are typically
      20-25 minutes. It is hypothesized that Veterans with AUD who receive active iTBS applied to
      the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), compared to controls (i.e., Veterans with
      AUD who receive sham iTBS), will show significant decreases alcohol craving, depressive
      symptomatology and cigarette consumptions, as well as improved neurocognition, a longer
      period of abstinence, and a lower overall rate of relapse over 6 months following standard
      psychosocial treatment for AUD at VA substance treatment clinics. In exploratory analyses, it
      is also predicted that magnetic resonance measures of left DLPFC glutamate concentration,
      volume of anterior frontal cortical brain regions, and performance on fMRI tasks
      interrogating the function of the salience/reward circuits will serve as biomarkers of iTBS
      treatment response. The goal of this proposal is to implement treatment that effectively
      promotes sustained abstinence in Veterans with AUD, given long-term abstinence is related to
      optimal neurobiological, neuropsychological and psychosocial recovery and functioning.
