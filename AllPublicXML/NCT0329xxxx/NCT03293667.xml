  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the clinical response to anti-TNFα is related to an increase in
      the number or in the function of Treg lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients. This
      observation suggests the central role of Tregs in homeostasis of the immune response during
      RA.

      In the literature the Tregs frequency and phenotype in the peripheral blood are well
      documented, however the analyses done on the Tregs in inflamed environment are still
      fragmentary or disparate.

      In this project Tregs phenotype as well as expression of several transcripts will be analysed
      in order to better characterize the Treg cell subsets within the synovial fluid. Moreover,
      the local inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6 and IL-1) may affect both the phenotype and the
      suppressive function of these Tregs and a comparison between peripheral and tissue Tregs will
      allow us to better understand the cause of functional loss.

      Outcomes:

      Primary outcome: Identification and characterization of the Tregs subpopulation present in
      the synovial fluid for RA patients suffering an episode of acute arthritis.

      Secondary outcomes: compare the phenotypic and expression profile of the Tregs present in the
      synovial fluid with the Tregs present in the peripheral blood of RA patients suffering from
      an episode of acute arthritis.

      Transverse observational, monocentric exploratory study based on physiopathological
      evaluation Phase of identification/characterization of biomarkers. In a second phase,
      investigators might also considered a multicentre study with a greater number of patients as
      well as with osteoarthritis patients in order to validate the specificity of the results
      obtained in RA.

      Investigators will prospectively recruit 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis suffering from
      an episode of acute arthritis and requiring joint puncture. Investigators will analyse the
      cellular component of the joint fluid. It is an interventional clinical trial since one extra
      blood sample of 30 ml of blood will be collected.
