      Prospective, randomised, double-blind study to assess the Therapeutic Potential of Omega-3

    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in developed
      countries. By the year 2040, the number of people suffering from AMD is estimated to increase
      by 50%. Stargardt disease is the most prevalent form of macular dystrophy in children, with
      an estimated prevalence of 1 in 10000.

      There is no effective treatment available that stops progression or improves vision in
      patients with dry AMD or Stargardt disease.

      Considering the success in animal studies and observational human studies with omega-3 fatty
      acids supplementation when the blood ratio AA (arachidonic acid)/EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)
      is &lt;2, the sponsor hypothesizes that, when the blood ratio of AA/EPA is maintained below 2,
      the visual acuity in the group with active supplements will improve, in comparison to the
      control group, in patients with moderate and severe dry AMD and moderate and severe
      Stargardt.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women ages from 18 to 75 years old.

          -  Group 1: For moderate dry macular degeneration the BCVA must be between 50 and 70
             (ETDRS). There must be a large drusen &gt;125 µm within 1mm from the centre of the fovea.
             Geographic atrophy can be present but must be &gt;300 µm away from centre of fovea;

          -  Group 2: For severe dry macular degeneration the BCVA must be between 41 and 49
             (ETDRS). Geographic atrophy can involve the fovea but must be &lt;2500 µm in diameter or
             any size GA but &gt;200 µm from centre of fovea anywhere;

          -  Group 3: For moderate Stargardt disease the BCVA must be between 50 and 70 (ETDRS) and
             the geographic area must be &lt;2.0 mm in diameter anywhere;

          -  Group 4: For severe Stargardt disease the BCVA must be between 41 and 49 (ETDRS). The
             geographic area must be &lt;2.5 mm in diameter anywhere;

          -  Willingness to take the randomised trial investigational product for 6 months;
