    <textblock>
      FORCE is a randomized home-based resistance training/strength training (RT) intervention
      study for Stage II and III colon cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      Participants will be 180 newly diagnosed Stage II and III colon cancer patients from Kaiser
      Permanente of Northern California (KPNC), the Penn State Cancer Institute (PSCI), and the
      Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The intervention will begin within the first weeks of
      adjuvant chemotherapy and continue exercise through the completion of post-operative
      chemotherapy. Specifically, the investigators will examine between group differences for RT
      versus waitlist control for chemotherapy outcomes including dose delays, dose reductions,
      early stoppage and Grade 3 and 4 toxicities. The investigators will also study changes in
      muscle mass (MM) and changes in specific inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6 and TNF-RII) as
      potential markers of change in response to RT. To determine effects of change of MM on
      chemotherapy-specific drug clearance, the investigators will examine the impact body
      composition changes on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 5-FU and oxaliplatin, two of the most
      commonly used drugs for colon cancer.

    <description>Participants randomized to the resistance training (RT) group will receive an in-person and telephone-based intervention to promote home-based resistance training. The exercise intervention will begin within the first 4 weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy and continue exercise through the completion of post-operative chemotherapy.

    <description>Participants randomized to the usual care (U) group will be instructed to refer to their physician regarding what forms of exercise are safe for them, given their medical history. The U group will be told to continue whatever exercise program they have been undertaking up to enrolling in the study, but not to increase exercise or begin weight-lifting over the period of study participation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Resistance training</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention goal is for study participants to exercise with progressively higher weights for resistance training to achieve a 1-kg increase in lean body mass by the end of the intervention. During an in-person visit on the same day as a chemotherapy infusion session, exercise professionals will teach participants a series of exercises to be completed at home twice weekly throughout the intervention. Participants will also receive protein powder, which they will be instructed to consume with meals twice a day. During subsequent infusion sessions, the exercise professional will meet in-person with participants to evaluate their ability to increase weights, and adjust exercises appropriately. In between visits, the exercise professional will check-in with participants by phone.</description>
