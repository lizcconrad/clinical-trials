      A Double-Blind, Controlled Study to Compare the Gastrointestinal Safety of a 14-Day Oral
      Dosing Regimen of ATB-346 to Sodium Naproxen in Healthy Subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy male and female subjects (n=240) are randomized into two dose groups of 120 subjects
      each. Gastroduodenal endoscopies are performed pre-dose and post-dose, i.e., after 14 days of
      either ATB-346 (250 mg once daily) or naproxen sodium (550 mg twice daily) and the incidence
      of gastric mucosal damage is recorded for comparison between the two treatment arms.
