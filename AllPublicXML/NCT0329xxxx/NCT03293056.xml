  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: water aerobics involves the practice of specific aquatic exercises that are
      based on the use of water resistance as a load and on thrust as an impact reducer, making it
      possible to perform physical exercise with a lower risk of injury even at a high intensity.
      Objective: The overall objective of this study will be to compare the effectiveness of high
      intensity interval versus moderate continuous water aerobics to improve health outcomes in
      apparently healthy individuals.

      Method: randomized clinical trial will be performed in the premises of the College of
      Physical Education of the Federal University of the São Francisco Valley. 100 adults, of both
      sexes, will be randomized into two groups, high intensity interval hydrogynastic (HIAI) or
      moderate continuous aquatic gymnastics (HCM). Individuals will be evaluated for primary
      endpoints of muscle strength and endurance, aerobic fitness, flexibility and body
      composition. The secondary outcomes evaluated will be the quality of life, functionality and
      perception of improvement by a Likert-type Improvement Scale, at the following moments:
      initial, final and follow-up of one month after the end of the training. Individuals will be
      assisted for three months, often weekly twice, with sessions lasting 50 min. In order to
      identify differences between and within the groups, an equation of generalized estimates will
      be used as regression model with the syntax according to the multivariate model.
