      This Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, first-in-human study will
      evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses of
      NDX-1017 in healthy young and elderly subjects, and elderly subjects with mild Alzheimer's
      disease or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NDX-1017 is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      This Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, first-in-human study will
      evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses of
      NDX-1017 in healthy young and elderly subjects, and elderly subjects with mild AD. The study
      contains the following two parts:

      Part A:

      A single-ascending dose (SAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting for 3 days in healthy
      young male and healthy elderly male and female volunteers evaluated in up to 7 dose cohorts
      to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) within the single dose range studied. Up to 56
      subjects (aged 18 to 45 years for young and 60 to 85 years for elderly) may be enrolled in
      Part A.

      Part B:

      A multiple ascending dose (MAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting for 10 days in male
      or female healthy elderly volunteers (aged 60 to 85 years) or subjects with mild AD or
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (aged 40 to 85 years) in up to 5 dose cohorts that
      were proven tolerable in the SAD part of the study to identify the MTD within the multiple
      dose range studied. Up to 36 subjects (aged 60 to 85 years) may be enrolled in Part B.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 28 days (or 90 days for mild AD and amnestic
      MCI) prior to enrollment. Those eligible will be admitted to an inpatient facility for
      investigational product administration, safety monitoring, and collection of blood or urine
      for pharmacokinetic evaluations.
