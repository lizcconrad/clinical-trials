      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of postural exercise program added to
      pulmonary rehabilitation program on quality of life, exercise tolerance and postural
      stability in children with Cystic Fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, multisystem involvement disease. The most
      important cause of mortality in CF is pulmonary complications. Prevention of pulmonary
      complications is only possible with pulmonary rehabilitation. Pulmonary rehabilitation
      methods used in CF are called airway cleaning techniques that include postural drainage,
      breathing techniques and use of devices. These techniques have not been proven to be superior
      to each other. Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) is one of the breathing techniques
      used to remove secretions from the lungs.

      Pulmonary disease progression in CF causes postural impairment and decrease of exercise
      tolerance, which can reduce effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation. The aim of this study
      is to investigate the effects of postural exercise program added to pulmonary rehabilitation
      program on quality of life, exercise tolerance and postural stability in children with CF.
