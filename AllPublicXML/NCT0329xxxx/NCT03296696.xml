      This is a Phase 1 Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and
      Pharmacodynamics of AMG 596 in Subjects with Glioblastoma Expressing Mutant Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor Variant III (EGFRvIII). This is a first in human (FIH), open-label,
      sequential-dose-escalation study in subjects with EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma. This study
      will enroll 2 groups of subjects according to disease stage, recurrent disease (Group 1) and
      maintenance treatment after SoC in newly diagnosed disease (Group 2).

             Organization (WHO) grade 4, glioblastoma

          -  Must have recurrent disease confirmed by MRI (Group 1) or completed SoC therapy such
             as surgery with adjuvant radiochemotherapy with or without maintenance temozolomide
             according to local standards for newly diagnosed disease (Group 2)

          -  Renal function and Hepatic function

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History or evidence of central nervous system bleeding as defined by stroke or
             intraocular bleed (including embolic stroke) not associated with any antitumor surgery
             within 6 months before enrolment

          -  Known hypersensitivity to immunoglobulins or to any other component of the IP
             formulation

          -  Infection requiring intravenous antibiotics that was completed &lt; 1 week of study
             enrollment (day 1) with the exemption of prophylactic antibiotics for long line
             insertion or biopsy

          -  Unresolved toxicities from prior antitumor therapy, defined as not having resolved to
             CTCAE, version 4.0 grade 1 (with the exception of myelosuppression, e.g., neutropenia,
             anemia, thrombocytopenia), or to levels dictated in the eligibility criteria with the
             exception of alopecia or toxicities from prior antitumor therapy that are considered
             irreversible (defined as having been present and stable for &gt; 2 months) which may be
             allowed if they are not otherwise described in the exclusion criteria AND there is
             agreement to allow by both the investigator and sponsor

          -  Antitumor therapy (chemotherapy, antibody therapy, molecular-targeted therapy, or
             investigational agent) within 14 days (Group 2 subjects) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
