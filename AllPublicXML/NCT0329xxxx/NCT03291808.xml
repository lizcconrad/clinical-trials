  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is to pilot test a weight loss intervention in obese patients with poorly controlled
      asthma.

      Obesity is a risk factor for the development of asthma (approximately 250,000 cases per year
      of asthma in the U.S. are related to obesity).

      Investigators' ultimate purpose is to test the hypothesis that weight loss through an
      intensive life style intervention will improve asthma control. But investigators first need
      to establish whether the weight loss intervention is effective in patients with asthma.

      Objectives

        1. The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an
           internet-based weight loss intervention in producing weight loss in obese patients with
           poorly controlled asthma.

        2. The ultimate purpose is to implement a multi-center weight loss intervention trial for
           obese patients with poorly controlled asthma.

      This will be a pilot study of a weight loss intervention at two centers, the University of
      Arizona and the University of Vermont. The primary outcome of interest will be the percent of
      participants achieving a 5% weight loss, which is the amount of weight loss that prior
      studies suggest is required to improve asthma control.

      This will be a single arm-phase II futility trial; the &quot;futility&quot; to be assessed is the
      ability to produce weight loss. Such designs are widely used in efficiently informing
      decisions to proceed to Phase III clinical trials. This trial design is appropriate when the
      effect of the placebo arm can reasonably be estimated (weight loss is likely to be close to
      0), and the toxicity of the treatment is minimal (no toxicity is anticipated related to
      weight loss). This is a 6-month study of 40 participants (20 at each site). All participants
      will be assigned to the weight loss intervention, which is described in detail below

    <description>This 6-month intervention will include restricted calorie intake and increased physical activity. Key behavioral strategies to facilitate changes in dietary habits and activity patterns will be introduced, promoted and reinforced throughout the program. Weekly &quot;group meetings&quot; in a synchronous chat (i.e., in real time) led by a facilitator will be the venue for the group process. Extensive web-based resources to support behavior changes will be offered. Group chat sessions will meet online weekly for 6 months.</description>
