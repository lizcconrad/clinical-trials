  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study consisting of 2 parts: Part 1 aims to investigate the relative
      bioavailability of tablet formulation (test treatment) and Powder in capsule (PiC)
      formulation (reference treatment) of M7583 under fasted conditions. The aim of Part 2 is to
      determine and compare the single dose Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of M7583 tablet under
      fasted and fed conditions to assess the food effect.
