  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The projects will try and optimise the risk stratification for patients with Long QT syndrome
      by investigating how the exposure of physical and acoustic stress will affect the QT-dynamics
      and if beta blockers protect against arrhythmias by suppressing this dynamic QT-prolongation.
      Furthermore, the project will investigate the effects of Spironolactone on the QT-dynamics
      tested by &quot;Brisk Standing&quot;.

      First, patients are tested with known arrhythmic triggers and they are then administered
      thier normal dose of beta blockers. Hereafter, &quot;Brisk Standing&quot; test is performed and the
      patients are on Spironolactone for seven days. After seven days treatment the &quot;Brisk
      Standing&quot; is repeated.
