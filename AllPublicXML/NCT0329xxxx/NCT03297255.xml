      This longitudinal observational cohort study was designed to investigate factors that
      influencing the occurrence and long-term survival of patients with primary liver cancer.
      Basic informations and detailed diagnosis informations (AJCC/TNM stage, MELD score,
      Child-Pugh score, and BCLC stage) were collected by professional doctors. Clinical outcomes
      (death, recurrence, and metastasis) will be followed up every two years after therapy.
