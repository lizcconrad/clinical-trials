  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a investigator-initiated pilot clinical trial to ascertain the safety and efficacy of
      application of ex-vivo cultivated limbal stem cells in human eyes for treating Corneal Haze
      after Photo-Therapeutic/Refractive Keratectomy (PTK/ PRK) and Collagen Cross Linking (CXL).
      Instead of using adjunctive medical therapy like application of MMC (Mitomycin), a technique
      of cell delivery with fibrin sealant can be used. These cells are harvested from
      therapeutically accepted and serologically tested cadaveric corneas. The isolated limbal
      epithelial and mesenchymal or stromal cell suspension will then be cultured in CGMP
      laboratories and be tested for sterlity. These cells have also been shown to be effective in
      treating haze in laser refractive surgery in an animal model. Our initial experience of using
      these cells in a previous clinical trial showed that they were effective in preventing
      corneal haze in patients with burns and ulcers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot clinical trial, patients undergoing Photo Therapeutic/Refractive Keratectomy
      (PTK/ PRK) and Collagen Cross Linking (CXL), will be given human Limbus-derived Corneal Stem
      cells to assess the safety of these cells. Cells will be cultivated in a cGMP laboratory
      using standardized culture technique; from the limbal rims of cadaveric corneoscleral donor
      tissues that are therapeutically accepted and serologically tested. Briefly the limbal tissue
      will be cut up into small pieces and digested overnight using an enzyme (Collagenase L). The
      cells obtained from the digest will be cultured on a petri-dish using 2% serum and growth
      factors. A mixture of limbal epithelial cells and limbal stromal cells obtained from these
      cultures will be used in surgical procedures in a ratio of 2:1, after all the sterility
      checks. Mixed suspension of the limbal epithelial and the stromal cells at a concentration of
      50000 cells/uL diluted in the thrombin component of fibrin sealant (TISEEL, Baxter) will be
      applied. The primary outcome measure is safety of this treatment and the secondary outcome
      measure is their efficacy that will be assessed at 1 month time points by (1) Clinical
      photography using a standard method where multiple blinded observers will grade the
      clinically apparent change in haze and (2) Objective quantification of the amount of light
      scattering using densitometry analysis function in Oculus Pentacam (OCULUS Optikgeräte GmbH).
