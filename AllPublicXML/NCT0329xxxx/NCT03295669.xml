  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Close analysis of right ventricular function is still not done by all clinicians, even though
      it is indispensable; notably in cardiovascular ICUs.

      Right ventricular dysfunction is responsible for increased morbidity and marks a turning
      point in the patient's prognosis.

      It is difficult to analyse, and is principally assessed using echocardiography and by
      measuring the peak of the S' wave with pulsed Doppler and by measuring the tricuspid annular
      plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) in the TM mode. New studies have shown the interest of using
      2D strain as a marker of systolic and diastolic function of the right ventricle. Finally, the
      use of 3D ultrasound seems to be more reliable than cardiac MRI for fine analysis of the
      right ventricle, even though it is rarely used in routine practice.

      Study of the right ventricle using ultrasonography alone requires experienced and available
      operators for closely repeated evaluations making it possible to detect right ventricle
      dysfunction quickly.

      US monitoring of left and right heart function is done systematically and repeatedly during
      post-operative care following heart surgery. This US evaluation could be optimized by finding
      a way to monitor the right ventricle continuously.

      From a physiological point of view, we know about the tight relationship between the aspect
      of the central venous pressure curve and more precisely the C-X segment (tricuspid bulging
      into the atrium and start of contraction of the right ventricle) and right ventricular
      function. We wish to analyse this segment, combined with a US evaluation, and to look for a
      possible correlation so as to allow continuous, easy-to-interpret monitoring of right
      ventricular systolic function.

      This will be facilitated by the systematic presence of a central venous catheter in every
      patient undergoing heart surgery, thus allowing central venous pressure to be monitored.

      To this end, we wish to collect different data from patients in the cardiovascular ICU,
      especially the central venous pressure curve, the ventilatory pressure curve and settings of
      the respirator, and to carry out an echography evaluation of each patient.
