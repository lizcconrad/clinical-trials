      Primary Objectives:

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin in hemodynamically stable patients
           with worsening of heart failure, compared to placebo.

        -  Estimate the effects of sotagliflozin on plasma volume changes in hemodynamically stable
           patients with worsening of heart failure, compared to placebo.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Explore the effect of sotagliflozin on erythropoiesis, as assessed by changes in plasma
           erythropoietin levels, in hemodynamically stable patients with worsening of heart
           failure, compared to placebo.

        -  Explore the effect of sotagliflozin on changes in plasma NT-proBNP levels, in
           hemodynamically stable patients with worsening of heart failure, compared to placebo.

             due to an official or court order.

          -  Current admission or visit for Worsening HF that is clearly and primarily triggered by
             causes such as tachyarrhythmia (example: sustained ventricular tachycardia, or atrial

             active malignant tumor or other major systemic disease (including any diseases with
             evidence of malabsorption), making implementation of the protocol and/or the
             interpretation of the study results difficult.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 times the upper
             limit of the normal laboratory range (ULN) (1 repeat lab allowed);

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.7 times the ULN (except in case of Gilbert's syndrome) (1 repeat
             lab allowed);

          -  Amylase and/or lipase &gt;3 times the ULN (1 repeat lab allowed).

          -  Patients with a severe or persistent in spite of optimal treatment genitourinary tract
             infection at time of randomization.

          -  Patient is the Investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of
             the protocol.

          -  History of diabetic ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma within 3 months
             prior to the screening visit.

          -  Lower extremity diabetic complications (such as skin ulcers, infection, osteomyelitis
             and gangrene) identified during the Screening period, and still requiring treatment at
             Randomization.
