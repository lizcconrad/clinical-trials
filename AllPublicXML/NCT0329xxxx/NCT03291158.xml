      This is a phase 1, safety and PK Open-Label trial evaluating the plasma, epithelial lining
      fluid, and alveolar macrophage concentrations of intravenous Minocin® (Minocycline) for
      injection in healthy adult subjects.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Minocin IV and measure plasma,
      epithelial lining fluid, and alveolar macrophage drug levels after six doses of Minocin IV
      given 12 hours apart, administered as 1-hour infusions in healthy adult subjects.

          1. A signed informed consent form, the ability to understand the study conduct and tasks
             that are required for study participation, and a willingness to cooperate with all
             tasks, tests, and examinations as required by the protocol, whether in the hospital or
             after discharge, for the duration of the study;

          2. Healthy adult male or female between 18 and 55 years of age (inclusive) at the time of

             (inclusive) at Screening;

          4. Subject is in good health based on medical history and physical examination findings
             and has no clinically meaningful safety laboratory abnormalities (hematology, blood
             chemistry, and urinalysis) or 12-lead ECG results, as assessed by the Principal
             Investigator (PI);

          5. Vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse, and temperature) measured at
             Screening/baseline must be within the following ranges: systolic BP ≥90 to ≤150 mm Hg,
             diastolic BP ≥45 to ≤90 mm Hg; Heart Rate ≥ 45 to ≤90 bpm (taken after resting in a
             supine position for at least 5 minutes);

          6. Expectation that intravenous access will be sufficient to allow for ease of study drug
             infusion and for all protocol-required blood sampling to take place;

          7. Subject commits to remaining under observation of the study staff for the course of
             the study;

          8. Female subject is surgically sterile (bilateral tubal occlusion), postmenopausal, or
             if of childbearing potential, agrees to abstinence or to use a highly efficient method
             of birth control (i.e., intrauterine device [IUD] or intrauterine hormone-releasing
             system [IUS] or vasectomized male partner, or hormonal contraceptives [estrogen and
             progestogen combined or progestogen only] with inhibition of ovulation; oral hormonal
             contraceptives must be supplemented with the use of condoms), between inclusion and
