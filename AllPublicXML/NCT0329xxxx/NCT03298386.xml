  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general practitioner (GP) is confronted, for a part of his clientele, with the management
      of patients suffering from multimorbidity, leading most often to a polypharmacy. It has five
      major consequences: increasing the number of inappropriate treatments, increasing the risk of
      potentially dangerous drug interactions, increasing the risk of contraindications associated
      with several concomitant pathologies, decreasing adherence to treatments by patients and the
      increased cost of care. Drug misuse in the elderly is particularly common, due to the
      age-related physiological changes and physiological alterations, with the consequent increase
      in the risk of adverse events, particularly hospitalizations. Several tools have been
      proposed to decrease morbimortality in elderly patients with polypharmacy. The studies
      concluded that the STOPP/START tool was the most structured, sensitive and had the most
      appropriate use format for clinical practice. However, there are currently no ambulatory
      studies demonstrating the impact of prescription revision with STOPP/START on the
      morbimortality of persons aged 75 years and over. This study aims to assess the effectiveness
      of an intervention targeting GPs to decrease morbimortality in elderly patients with
      polypharmacy. Volunteer GPs will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or to
      usual care (control group) and they will be followed one year. The intervention consists in
      systematic medication review by GP with STOPP/START. In both groups, patient morbimortality
      will be measured at the end of the study.

      STOPP/START criteria for potential inappropriate prescribing in older people recognise the
      dual nature of inappropriate prescribing by including a list of potentially inappropriate
      medications (STOPP criteria) and potential prescribing omissions (START criteria).

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be a composite criterion comprising unplanned hospitalization, death regardless of cause, emergency department visits and institutionalization after 12 months of follow-up.
Unplanned hospitalization is defined as either hospitalization decided after a visit to the emergency department (whether the patient was sent by a doctor or not) or hospitalization decided on the same day by the general practitioner.</description>
