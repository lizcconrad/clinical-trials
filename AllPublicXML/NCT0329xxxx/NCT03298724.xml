  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two aims of this study (a) to examine the effect of Teachers and Parents as
      Partners on student, parent, and teacher outcomes in middle school and (b) identify barriers
      and facilitators to implementing Teachers and Parents as Partners in middle school for
      students with behavior concerns.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Teachers and Parents as Partners will occur in a series of stages comprised of approximately
      four structured meetings over approximately 8 weeks. A Teachers and Parents as Partners
      consultant will meet together with a student's parent(s), teachers, other school personnel
      (as appropriate), and the student (as appropriate). The Teachers and Parents as Partners team
      will collaboratively address behavior problem solving objectives. Specific CBC objectives
      include: identifying strengths and specific behaviors of concern, specifying alternative
      prosocial behaviors, creating measurable behavior goals, co-constructing behavior
      intervention/support plans to address the target concerns, creating sustainable conditions to
      support plan implementation at home and school, and evaluating the plan to assess progress
      toward goals.

      Treatment integrity in multiple dimensions (e.g., engagement, dosage, adherence) will be
      assessed at the two tiers of implementation (i.e., Teachers and Parents as Partners
      procedural integrity and behavior support plan implementation) to determine the extent to
      which procedures are implemented as designed.

      During each structured meeting, Teachers and Parents as Partners consultants will inquire
      with parents, teachers, other school personnel, and students about barriers and facilitators
      to implementation.
