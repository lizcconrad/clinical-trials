  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study compares the efficacy and safety of the Agili-C implant to Surgical
      Standard of Care treatment in patients suffering from joint surface lesions of the knee. The
      patient population is heterogeneous, involving different kinds of joint surface lesions:
      focal cartilage lesions, osteochondral defects and mild to moderate osteoarthritis, including
      multiple defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, and controlled trial of Agili-C™
      vs. SSOC for the repair of joint surface lesions.

      Follow-up visits will be performed at 2 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months
      post-procedure to evaluate the patient's knee condition and clinical health. The following
      questionnaires: KOOS, IKDC Knee Examination Form 2000, IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation ,
      SF-12 Health Survey, Tegner Activity Score will be completed at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and
      24 months. Anterior-Posterior (A/P) and Lateral knee X-rays will be taken at 2 weeks and at
      6, 12, 18 and 24 months post procedure. MRI according to specific protocol will be performed
      at 12 and 24 months.
