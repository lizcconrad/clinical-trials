  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spontaneous gastrorenal shunt is occluded in the Balloon Occluded Retrograde Transvenous
      Obliteration (BRTO) procedure resulting in diversion of blood flow toward the portal
      circulation and in turn the liver. According to this investigator hypothesise that BRTO
      improves liver volume and function along with beneficial effect on other organ systems by
      decreasing ammonia and improving hepatopetal flow. All cirrhotics with large shunt(&gt;10mm) and
      raised ammonia levels and will be randomized to receive standard medical treatment and those
      with BRTO. Investigator will assess organ functions and liver regenerative potential pre and
      post(after 3months) procedure.

    <description>Catheterization of the gastrorenal shunt via the left renal vein will be accomplished using a catheter with a mounted occlusion balloon. Balloon occlusion venography is then performed to define the type of varix/varices and the anatomy of the venous drainage followed by infusion of sclerosant. The occluded balloon were inflated and remained in place for a maximum of 24 hours and deflated under fluoroscopy the next day. Followed by repeat CT abdomen to look for occlusion of shunts.</description>
