    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the examine the feasibility of and estimate the efficacy of a
      preoperative exercise (i.e. prehabilitation) program in 40 up to sedentary older adults (i.e.
      age 60 and over) undergoing abdominal, urologic or gynecologic surgery under the Enhanced
      Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol at Duke, using a variety of techniques to measure the
      possible effect of this intervention. Study patients will undergo a program of
      prehabilitation exercise for 6 days per week prescribed for them by an exercise physiologist,
      for up to 4 weeks prior to surgery. Study participants will undergo four types of
      assessments: Functional/Cognitive testing; Blood/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and Muscle
      biopsies; Brain Imaging; and Brain Activity Recording. Clinical Outcomes will also be
      obtained from the Duke electronic medical record system. The risks of the exercise
      intervention are generally mild, since moderate exercise in this patient population generally
      results in improved health outcomes. Data from these patients will be analyzed in comparison
      to propensity matched patients from the Duke Markers of Alzheimer's Disease and
      neurocognitive Outcomes after Perioperative Care (MADCO-PC) study who did not undergo this
      prehabilitation exercise intervention. Taken together, the results of this study will allow
      the investigators to estimate the possible effect of prehabilitation exercise on multiple
      domains of postoperative recovery (cognition, brain connectivity, biomarkers, brain activity,
      etc) and will provide important preliminary data.
