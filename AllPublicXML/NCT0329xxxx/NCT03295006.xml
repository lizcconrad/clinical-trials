  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective, multinational, single-arm study will be conducted in at least 8 sites. An
      interim analysis will be conducted with data from 100 patients with up to 10 well defined HCC
      tumor(s) and with at least one tumor ≥3 cm. Normal tissue absorbed dose using pre-procedural
      99mTc MAA SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging will be measured to allow the mean absorbed normal tissue
      dose corresponding to a ≤15% probability of CTCAE grade 3 or higher hyperbilirubinemia (in
      the absence of disease progression) to be calculated. Total bilirubin will be recorded and
      graded according to CTCAE version 4.02. All dose-related SAEs at 3 months follow-up will be
      followed until resolution, death or lost-to-follow-up. AEs related to disease progression
      will not be considered related to TheraSphere.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently published evidence indicates a correlation between yttrium-90 dose delivered to the
      tumor and normal tissue with safety and efficacy outcomes but there are no validated methods
      to consistently measure dose delivered to the tumor and normal tissue. In contrast to the
      standard clinical approach based on average dose to one target volume, this trial, sponsored
      by Biocompatibles UK, will explore an alternative two-compartment TheraSphere dosimetry
      methodology to calculate absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissue
