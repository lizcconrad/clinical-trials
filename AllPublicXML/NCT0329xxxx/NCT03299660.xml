  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is investigating the inclusion of avelumab post long-course chemo-radiotherapy in
      patients with resectable locally advanced rectal cancer. It is hypothesised that this may
      enhance the pathological and imaging response rates whilst potentially reducing the relapse
      rates. Participants will receive standard long course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT) treatment
      with radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil (5 FU)/Capecitabine for 6 weeks, this then followed by 4
      cycles of Avelumab and then surgical resection. The trial will measure disease response just
      prior to surgery and participants will be followed up for a minimum of 18 months (from study
      entry) and up to 42 months.
