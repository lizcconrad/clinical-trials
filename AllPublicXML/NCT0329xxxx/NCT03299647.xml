  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate to identify specific polyunsaturated fatty acids that show
      significant differences between ADHD and control groups. In addition, these findings may
      offer more biological understanding in explaining the relationship between polyunsaturated
      fatty acids and visual memory among children with ADHD. The results will significantly
      contribute to the knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD, especially the
      polyunsaturated fatty acids related to the behavioral/visual memory deficits of ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early onset and long-term
      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies, detection
      and diagnosis are very important for ADHD. According to the investigators' previous work,
      children with ADHD have visual memory deficits as well as inattentive deficits. Previous
      studies show that polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with cognitive problems in
      children. Analyzing differences in polyunsaturated fatty acids between children with ADHD and
      healthy controls could provide insight into underlying disease pathology of cognitive
      deficits. In this one-year project, the researchers will perform an analysis of
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum to identify potential biomarkers for the visual memory
      deficits of ADHD.

      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. To identify the specific polyunsaturated fatty acids of ADHD symptoms;

        2. To identify the relationship between specific polyunsaturated fatty acids and visual
           memory deficits of ADHD.

      This is a one-year project. After careful calculation of sample size, the study will recruit
      35 children with ADHD, aged 7-18, and 35 healthy controls with matched age, sex and BMI. The
      investigators will quantify the polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum. The behavioral measures
      include ADHDRS-IV, SNAP-IV, CBCL, CGI-ADHD-S, SAICA, and Family APGAR-C. The Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) will be used to assess the visual memory
      of all participants. Conditional logistic regression and partial least squares discriminant
      analysis will be applied to identify significant polyunsaturated fatty acids for ADHD and
      visual memory deficits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with ADHD are eligible to be included in this study only if they meet all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Patients will be outpatients who are between 7 and 18 years of age.

          2. Patients must have ADHD that meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) disease diagnostic criteria assessed by the
             investigator's clinical evaluation, as well as confirmed by the Chinese version of the
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age
             Children-Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E).

          3. Patients must have a Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) score &gt; 4
             at baseline.

          4. Patients must be psychotropic drug-naïve. Patients will be considered to be drug-naïve
             if they have never received medications specifically to treat ADHD.

          5. Patients and parents (or legal representative) must have a degree of understanding
             sufficient to be able to communicate suitably with the investigator.

          6. Patients must be of normal intelligence in the judgment of the investigator. Normal
             intelligence is defined as achieving a score of 80 or more when IQ testing is
             administrated.

          7. Patients must have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep appointments
             for clinic visits and all tests, including neuropsychological testing and
             venipunctures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Patients with current or past history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective Disorder,
             organic psychosis, bipolar I or II disorder, autism, or autism spectrum disorder.
             Other comorbid psychiatric disorders are not excluded if the ADHD symptoms are the
             primary source of impairment for the patient.

          2. Patients with a history of any seizure disorder (other than febrile convulsion) or
             patients who are taking anticonvulsants for seizure control.

          3. Patients have been at serious suicidal risk, determined by the investigator.

          4. Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 3 months, or who are
             currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any described or over-the-counter
             medication in a manner that the investigator considers indicative of abuse.

          5. Patients with cardiovascular disease or other conditions that could be aggravated by
             an increased heart rate or increased blood pressure.

          6. Patients who are likely to need Chinese medicine or health-food supplements that have
             central nervous system activity.
