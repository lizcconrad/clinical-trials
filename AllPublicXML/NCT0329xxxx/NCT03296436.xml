    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to Johns Hopkins with a diabetic ulcer classified by the UT Grade 2 or 3
      who meet all of the inclusion and none exclusion criteria and give their informed consent,
      will receive an application of NEOX CORD 1K in addition to standard of care procedures. Those
      patients will be seen in follow-up at weekly visits until the wound closes and epithelize,
      achieving complete closure. Subjects that do not achieve complete ulcer closure prior to or
      at the end of the 16 treatment weeks will exit the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective investigator initiated trial will be conducted in diabetic patients with lower
      extremity wounds managed with NEOX CORD 1K umbilical cord product supplied by Amniox (a
      subsidiary of TissueTech, Inc.). The patient population will be comprised of Type 1 or Type 2
      diabetics presenting to our hospital for the treatment of lower extremity wounds occurring on
      the dorsal and plantar foot. The wounds will be treated in the Operating Room (OR) arena
      including surgical debridement, resection of bone necrosis, biopsy, etc. to treat the
      associated morbidity. These wounds are classified utilizing the University of Texas (UT)
      Classification System as Grades: 2 (wounds penetrating to tendon or capsule) and 3 (wounds
      penetrating to bone or joint) with Stages: A (no infection or ischemia), B (Infection
      present), C (ischemia present) and D (Infection and ischemia present). This morbidity will
      comprise of complex wounds that exhibit exposed muscle, tendon, bone and may include the
      presence of treated osteomyelitis. This patient population oftentimes include diabetics with
      lower extremity ischemia or end stage renal disease and their associated comorbidities. These
      wounds are challenging in their care being they trend towards a poor prognosis including high
      morbidity and mortality as well as high major limb amputation rates. Hence, this trial will
      provide associated data to the efficacy of the above referenced material towards evaluating
      its effectiveness in these wound types towards enhancing wound healing and subsequently
      reducing amputation rates.

    <description>NEOX CORD 1K is a cryopreserved human umbilical cord product derived from donated human placental tissue following healthy, live, caesarian section, full-term births after determination of donor eligibility and placenta suitability. NEOX CORD 1K is manufactured by TissueTech Inc. utilizing a proprietary CRYOTEK® process, which devitalizes the living cells but retains the natural structural and biological characteristics relevant to this tissue. NEOX CORD 1K is aseptically processed in compliance with current Good Tissue Practices (cGTP). NEOX CORD 1K of various sizes is stored in a medium of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Glycerol (1:1) containing Amphotericin B (an anti-fungal agent). NEOX CORD 1K will be applied to completely cover the wound area and is maintained stationary with sutures or even negative pressure wound therapy after adequate sharp debridement.</description>
