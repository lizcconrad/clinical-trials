  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two components. The first component is designed to assess and compare the
      awareness, attitudes and clinical eligibility of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) in criminal
      justice (CJ) involved women. The second component is designed to evaluate the acceptability
      and feasibility of strategically delivering PrEP to CJ involved women and their risk network
      members.

    <textblock>
      Risk networks can be leveraged to maximally disseminate effective interventions to women,
      including PrEP, and thereby potentially avert some of the 50,000 annual incident HIV
      infections in the U.S. Few studies to date have capitalized on risk networks as a way to
      identify and engage high-risk individuals, like CJ-involved women, who could markedly benefit
      from PrEP. This study advances the field by: 1) Using an innovative network-based framework
      (a non-traditional model of care delivery) to engage a high risk population in PrEP
      dissemination as HIV prevention; 2) Incorporating a syndemic approach to PrEP that addresses
      HIV prevention in the context of substance use, psychiatric comorbidities, IPV, and stigma;
      and 3) Recruiting, enrolling, and retaining high risk networks of CJ-involved women who are
      difficult to reach by other means. In doing so, this proposal addresses key funding
      priorities of the Gilead Investigator Sponsored Research program, which includes research on
      PrEP implementation targeted to high risk populations and delivered in non-traditional
      clinical settings.

    <description>Subjects on PrEP will be followed for 1 year with quarterly assessments by trained research assistants. Study visits will take place at in New Haven and Hartford. At every scheduled visit, participants will receive a comprehensive package of preventive services, including a prescription for the next 30-day supply of TDF/FTC (with 2 refills), a symptom screen for acute HIV, risk-reduction counseling, PrEP adherence support, bleach for cleaning injection equipment, and condoms. HIV rapid testing with OrasureÂ® will be performed quarterly; participants testing newly positive for HIV (representing seroconversions) will be followed with confirmatory testing and referred to care as needed.</description>
