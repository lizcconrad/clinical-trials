  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation trial of Pexa-Vec plus REGN2810
      in patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The trial consists of
      a dose-escalation stage, where the maximum feasible dose of Pexa-Vec in combination with
      REGN2810 will be determined, followed by an expansion stage. During the expansion patients
      will receive REGN2810 alone or in combination with Pexa-Vec, which will be administered
      either through intravenous (IV) or intratumoral (IT) injection.

          -  Clinically significant and/or rapidly accumulating ascites, pericardial and/or pleural
             effusions.
