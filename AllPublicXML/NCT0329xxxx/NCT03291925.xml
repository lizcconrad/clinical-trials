  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a prospective, randomized, open-label trial that aims to assess the
      feasibility of comparing a primary Computed tomography/Cardiac computed tomography
      angiography (CT/CCTA) strategy (test arm) to a strategy combining routine use of CT/CCTA and
      invasive CA (control arm) prior to a Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
      procedure. The study will also estimate the rate of composite coronary adverse events
      (myocardial infarction, post procedural coronary revascularization and cardiovascular
      mortality) between the two arms at 90 days follow-up. The primary endpoint will be the
      feasibility of recruitment and compliance with the study protocol at 2 sites in Canada and 1
      site in Denmark. Additional clinical endpoints including: all-cause death at 90 days post
      procedure, myocardial infarction at 90 days post procedure, unplanned PCI or CABG at 90 days
      post procedure, stroke at 90 days post procedure, CA and PCI related cumulative vascular
      complications events. This information will be used to inform the design of the definitive
      efficacy trial.
