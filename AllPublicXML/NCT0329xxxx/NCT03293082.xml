  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) use on glucose variability (GV) in preschool children with T1D treated with
      CSII.

      Downloads from CGM and CSII saved in pdf from will be retrospectively reviewed and analysed
      for all preschool children with type 1 diabetes in Slovenia. Glucose variability and other
      glycemic parameters will be analyzed separately for periods when CGM was used (CGM and SMBG
      data) and compared to periods when CGM was not used (SMBG only data).
