    <description>Participants will self-administer one 14 milligram (mg) spray of intranasal esketamine into each nostril at Time 0 and again 5 minutes later on Day 1, a total dose of 56 mg (Treatment A) in Treatment Period 1.

A washout period of greater than or equal to (&gt;=)10 days will separate the esketamine selfâ€‘administrations between 2 treatment periods.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening

          -  A woman must be either:

               1. Not of childbearing potential defined as:

                    1. postmenopausal (it is defined as no menses for 12 months without an
                       alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level
                       [greater than {&gt;}40 International Unit per Liter {IU/L} or
                       milliinternational Unit per milliliter {mIU/mL}] in the postmenopausal range
                       may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal
                       contraception or hormonal replacement therapy, however in the absence of 12
                       months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient)

                    2. permanently sterile (permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy,
                       bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, and
                       bilateral oophorectomy)

               2. Of childbearing potential, heterosexually active, and

                    1. practicing a highly effective method of contraception (failure rate of less
                       than [&lt;]1 percent [%] per year when used consistently and correctly)

                    2. agree to remain on a highly effective method throughout the study and for at
                       least 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug

          -  For women, must have a negative serum Beta- human chorionic gonadotropin (Beta-hCG)
             pregnancy test at screening

          -  During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as
             approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of intranasal study medication, a
             man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential

               1. must be practicing a highly effective method of contraception with his female
                  partner

               2. must use a condom if his partner is pregnant, and

               3. must agree not to donate sperm

          -  Have a creatinine clearance greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 60 milliliter per minute
             (mL/min) (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a current significant psychiatric disorder including but not limited to psychotic,
             bipolar, major depressive, or anxiety disorder

          -  Has a clinically significant medical illness including (but not limited to) cardiac
             arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease, coagulation disorders
             (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid abnormalities,
             significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes
             mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, thyroid disease, neurologic disease,
             infection, hypertension or vascular disorders, kidney or urinary tract disturbances,
             sleep apnea, myasthenia gravis, or any other illness that the investigator considers
             should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the interpretation of the
             study results. Participants with medical conditions that are stable with treatment may
             be included and should be discussed with the medical monitor before inclusion

          -  Has clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, serum chemistry, or
             urinalysis at screening as deemed appropriate by the investigator

          -  Has any contraindication to the use of ticlopidine, ketamine, or esketamine per
             prescribing information

          -  Has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or tests
             positive for HIV at screening
