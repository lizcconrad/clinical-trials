  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3 year clincal study, to test the efficacy of a parent-targeted text message-based
      intervention program on caries incidence and oral health behaviors (child and parent).
      Parents (n= 850) across all pediatric clinic sites (Boston Medical Center and Community
      Health Centers (CHCs); DotHouse CHC and Codman Square CHC) will be randomized to receive
      either text messages (TMs) regarding oral health or TMs regarding child wellness. The study
      will enroll English and Spanish speaking parents and their youngest child who is &lt; 7 years
      old, has at least one tooth showing, and attends the targeted pediatric clinic to receive
      primary care (n= 1700). Parents will complete self-report surveys at baseline, and 2, 4, 12,
      and 24-months after baseline; receive and respond to TM assessments during the 4-month
      intervention; and will also receive TMs during a 'booster' period of one month, which will
      occur 12-months post baseline. Parent's children will be assessed for caries by a clinical
      oral examination performed by licensed Clinical Examiners at baseline, 12-and-24-months
      post-baseline.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dental caries</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth surface level data in children, collected by calibrated clinical examiners (blind to treatment condition), utilizing the OHDC Modified ICDAS methodology, will allow calculation of caries incidence rates (development of a new cavitated lesion or filled surface in a previously sound tooth surface or tooth surface without a cavitated lesion).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy to perform oral health behaviors (12 items)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of treatment (4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall self-efficacy score represents how sure participants are that they can engage in recommended behavior to take care of their children's teeth. The overall self-efficacy score is the mean response. The 12 items are scored on a 1-7 scale, 1 = not sure at all to 7 = extremely sure. HIgher scores are favorable. A one-item measure of this construct will be assessed during the TM program.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation to perform oral health behaviors (12 items)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of treatment (4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall motivation score represents how much participants want to engage in recommended behavior to take care of their children's teeth. The overall motivation score is the mean response. The 12 items are scored on a 1-7 scale, 1 = do not want to at all to 7 = very much want to. Higher scores are favorable. A one-item measure of this construct will be assessed during the TM program.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome expectations regarding oral health behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of treatment (4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses the degree to which participants perceive that performing the oral health behaviors (e.g., brushing) will lead to the desired outcome (e.g., reduced dental caries) in their children (Stewart et al., 1997). A one-item measure of this construct will be assessed during the TM program.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of goals set and completed during the OHT program</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment (4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>OHT will set goals to brush (or supervise brushing) their children's teeth. Goals set and completed are automatically tracked in the TM platform system. Whether or not participants 'opt in' to participating in 'challenge weeks' will also be assessed. For OHT, this will entail setting a goal of brushing every day, twice per day. Both groups will be assessed each day for their adherence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment (4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was adapted to oral health and modified to measure satisfaction with the text messaging program (e.g., would you recommend this program; '1'= not at all to '5' definitely); showing the TMs to others (yes/no); perceived helpfulness of TMs to family/friends; how much longer they want to receive the program; and satisfaction with each of the proposed program components (e.g., setting goals, choosing topics) and structure (e.g, time of day TMs received, frequency). The MARS also measures perceived impact of the intervention on parents' attitudes towards their child's oral health measured with six items on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree; e.g., iSMILE has improved my attitude toward my child's oral health) Perceived impact on oral health practices are measured with six items on a scale of 1 'not at all' to 10 'very much.' Higher scores are favorable.</description>
