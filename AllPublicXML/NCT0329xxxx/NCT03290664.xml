  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial of related donor HLA-haploidentical NK-cell based therapy for the
      treatment of newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (except acute promyelocytic
      leukemia) in persons who failed to achieve a complete remission (CR) after one or two
      standard induction attempts. Failure is defined as ≥ 30% bone marrow blasts in a bone marrow
      of at least 20% cellularity at the mid-cycle (~day 14) bone marrow biopsy or residual AML on
      ~day 28 bone marrow biopsy by morphology, flow, PCR or FISH.

    <intervention_model_description>The first twenty-four patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to CD3-/CD19- or CD3-/CD56+ in a parallel comparison of the two products. Twelve patients will be randomized to each product. The chosen product will then be given to an additional 17 patients based on success of the primary endpoint. If one of the products achieves the necessary number of complete remissions during stage 1 (6 or more out of 12) but the other product does not, that product will continue onto stage 2. If neither product achieves the necessary number of CRs, then this approach will be deemed unworthy of further study.</intervention_model_description>
