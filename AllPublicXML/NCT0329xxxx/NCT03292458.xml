      Using a comprehensive approach of clinico-behavioral testing, neuroimaging and
      pharmacogenetics, the researchers will examine the clinical effects of sodium oxybate and the
      matched placebo on voice symptoms in spasmodic dysphonia and voice tremor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasmodic dysphonia (SD), or laryngeal dystonia, is a chronic debilitating condition that
      selectively affects speech production due to involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles. SD
      often extends beyond the impairment of vocal communication causing significant occupational
      disability and life-long social isolation. SD becomes even more incapacitating when it is
      associated with dystonic voice tremor (VT), which is present in about 1/3 of SD patients and
      is characterized by the inability to sustain a vowel for more than a few seconds. Current
      treatment of these disorders is limited to the temporary management of voice symptoms with
      repeated injections of botulinum toxin into the laryngeal muscles. These injections, however,
      are not fully effective in all SD patients and even less so in combined SD and VT cases.
      There is, therefore, a critical need to identify alternative therapeutic options that
      specifically target the pathophysiology of these disorders. On the other hand, the design and
      the use of such novel therapeutic approaches will be largely unattainable if their central
      mechanisms of action remain unknown. The objective of this study is to elucidate the primary
      determinants of clinical response to a novel oral medication, sodium oxybate (Xyrem®), in
      alcohol-responsive SD and VT patients. Using a comprehensive approach of clinico-behavioral
      testing, neuroimaging and pharmacogenetics, we aim to determine the clinical response of SD
      and VT symptoms to sodium oxybate and identify the primary markers of its clinical benefits.
      This study will use a controlled experimental design that focuses on detailed
      characterization of primary effects of a novel oral medication, sodium oxybate, for treatment
      of SD and VT symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with SD and combined SD and VT will have a clinically documented adductor or
             abductor form of disorder, either with or without positive effects of alcohol on their
             voice symptoms;

          2. Patients with vocal fold nodules (VFN) will have clinically documented vocal fold
             nodules;

          3. Healthy controls will be healthy volunteers with a negative history of laryngeal,
             neurological, or psychiatric problems (existing neuroimaging data will be used);

          4. Age from 21 to 80 years.

          5. Native English speakers.

          6. Right-handedness (based on Edinburgh Handedness Inventory).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are incapable of giving an informed consent will be excluded from the
             study.

          2. Pregnant and breastfeeding women until a time when they are no longer pregnant or
             breastfeeding will be excluded from the study. All patients of childbearing potential
             will be required to agree to use a reliable method of contraception prior to and
             during the study. The method of contraception will be documented in the patient's
             research chart. All women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy
             test, which must be negative for study participation.

          3. All patients with a past or present history of the following conditions will be
             excluded from the study;

               1. Except for SD and dystonic VT, any neurological disorders, such as stroke,
                  movement disorders, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury with loss of
                  consciousness, ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases,
                  alcoholism, drug dependence. Patients with tremor affecting other body parts will
                  be excluded from the study. All patients who have dystonic movements in the body
                  regions other than the larynx will be excluded from the study. This will allow
                  maintaining the homogenous patient population and evaluating central drug effects
                  without confounding by the presence of other neurological conditions.

               2. Any psychiatric problems, such as schizophrenia, major and/or bipolar depression,
                  obsessive-compulsive disorder, will be excluded to maintain the homogenous
                  patient population and allow for the evaluation of central drug effect without
                  confounding by the presence of psychiatric conditions.

               3. Except for VFN in the VFN group, any laryngeal problems, such as vocal fold
                  paralysis, paresis, carcinoma, chronic laryngitis, will be excluded from the
                  study.

               4. Patients with a known past or present history of grade 2 or higher hepatic and
                  renal dysfunction according to the NCI criteria will be excluded.

               5. Patients with a known past or present history of moderate to severe congestive
                  heart failure will be excluded.

               6. Patients with a known past or present history of cognitive impairment and active
                  suicidal ideations will be excluded.

          4. Patients who are not symptomatic due to treatment with botulinum toxin injections into
             the laryngeal muscles will be excluded from the study until the time when they are
             fully symptomatic. The duration of positive effects of botulinum toxin vary from
             patient to patient, lasting on average 3-4 months. All patients will be evaluated to
             ensure that they are fully symptomatic prior to the entering the study.

          5. To avoid the possibility of confounding effects of drugs acting upon the central
             nervous system, all patients will be questioned about any prescribed or
             over-the-counter medications as part of their initial intake screening. Those patients
             who receive medication(s) affecting the central nervous system (except for sodium
             oxybate) will be excluded from the study.

          6. Patients will be asked whether they have undergone any head and neck surgeries,
             particularly any brain surgery and laryngeal surgeries, such as thyroplasty, laryngeal
             denervation, and selective laryngeal adductor denervation-reinnervation. Because both
             brain and laryngeal surgery may potentially lead to the brain structure and function
             re-organization, all subjects with a history of brain and/or laryngeal surgery will be
             excluded from the study.

          7. Patients who have tattoos, ferromagnetic objects in their bodies (e.g., implanted
             stimulators, surgical clips, prosthesis, artificial heart valve, etc.) that are not
             MRI comparable and/or cannot be removed for the purpose of MRI study participation
             will be excluded from the study.
