  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal wound dehiscence elicit high morbidity and mortality. This complication may arise
      in more than 8.5% of high-risk patients. Addressing risk factors and optimizing surgical
      technique are guarded as mainstay measures for prevention, but their efficacy is
      questionable. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of using a polypropylene
      onlay prophylactic mesh on the incidence of abdominal wound dehiscence and associated
      complications.

    <textblock>
      Abdominal wound dehiscence is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. It occurs
      in more than 8.5% of high-risk patients. Current preventive measures described are control of
      risk factors and optimization of surgical technique. Despite that, the incidence of such
      complication remained stable in the last decades, highlighting the low efficacy of such
      measures. Polypropilene onlay mesh has been used to avoid incisional hernias in selected
      elective patients, and could be useful in the prevention of abdominal wound dehiscence. In
      emergency situations, especially in contaminated and infected surgical procedures, safety and
      efficacy of mesh is controversial. In this study the investigators aimed to evaluate the
      influence of polypropilene prophylactic onlay mesh on the incidence of abdominal wound
      dehiscence in high-risk patients undergoing midline laparotomy. As secondary outcome, the
      associated morbidity, including wound complications, will be analyzed. The study design will
      be a randomized controlled trial.
