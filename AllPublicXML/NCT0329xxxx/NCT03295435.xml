  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various definitions of poor dentition in older adults has been linked with inadequate intake
      of nutrients and poor diet quality. This study aims to look at the associations between poor
      dentition as defined by the composition of functional tooth units, and dietary intake of
      nutrients in community dwelling older men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor dentition, defined by numbers of teeth, functional tooth units or edentulism has been
      previously shown to be associated with poor intakes of nutrients in older adults, including
      but not limited to vitamin C, calcium, fibre, protein, zinc and folate. Similar findings have
      been found when poor dentition is defined by the presence of a prosthesis. Reasons for this
      inverse relationship include poor denture quality, reduced chewing capacity, or the
      inadequacy of prosthesis to replace natural teeth.

      However limited studies have looked at how the composition (natural verses prosthetic) of
      functional tooth units is associated with nutrient intake. A cross sectional analysis of a
      cohort of male older adults, participating in an ongoing longitudinal study, was conducted to
      investigate nutrition and oral health associations, including the relationship between the
      composition of functional tooth units and nutrient intake.

        The study population is a subset of a ongoing longitudinal study, that start in 2005. Men
        over the age of 70 years on the electoral roll for geographical locations within the Canada
        Bay area of Sydney, NSW were invited to participate. The only exclusion criteria was living
        in an aged care facility at time of recruitment.

        The follow up this study is based on, invited participants to be involved in a fourth wave
        of assessments. Anyone who had moved into an aged care facility was included. However those
        who had moved outside of the Sydney, had died, previously withdrawn or refused to
        participate, (but remained active), were excluded.
