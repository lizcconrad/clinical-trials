  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an online study that aims to test the effectiveness of Interpretative Nutrition
      Rating Systems (INRS) such as the Health Star Rating System (HSR or Star System), traffic
      light system and warning labels (high sodium, saturated fat and sugar) proposed by Health
      Canada. The study will incorporate the use of a Smartphone application (app), FoodFlip®, to
      help educate consumers on each INRS prior to their exposure on food packages.
