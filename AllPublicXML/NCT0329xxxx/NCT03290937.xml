      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of irinotecan
      that can be given in combination with PF-05082566 and cetuximab to patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer. Researchers also want to learn about possible side effects of the study
      drugs and if the study drug can help to control the disease.

      This is an investigational study. PF-05082566 is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Cetuximab and irinotecan are FDA
      approved and commercially available to treat several types of cancers, including colorectal
      cancer. Their use in combination with PF-05082566 is investigational.

      The study doctor can describe how the drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 32 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of irinotecan based on when you join this study. Up to 3 dose levels of irinotecan will
      be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of Irinotecan is found.

      After the highest tolerable dose level of irinotecan is found, an additional 20 participants
      will be enrolled on the study and will receive this dose.

      All participants will receive the same dose of cetuximab and PF-05082566.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive irinotecan and cetuximab by vein on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The
      first time you receive cetuximab, it will be given over about 2 hours. If you tolerate it
      well, you will receive it over about 1 hour each time after that. Irinotecan will be given
      over about 90 minutes.

      On Day 2 of each cycle, you will receive PF-05082566 by vein over about 1 hour.

      You will also be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask
      the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue receiving the study drugs for as long as your study doctor thinks it is in
      your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each Cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and biomarker testing. If
           you can become pregnant, part of this sample will also be used for a pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 2 of each Cycle:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PD testing
           measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease. At Cycle 1,
           this will be done before and 3 times over the 6 hours after the dose. At Cycles 2 and
           beyond, this will only be done before the dose.

        -  You will have an EKG before you receive the study drug.

      On Days 3, 4, 9, and 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for PD
      testing.

      On Day 15 of each Cycle, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and PD
      testing.

      If you had a core needle biopsy at screening, you will have another biopsy about 6-8 weeks
      after screening.

      Every 8 weeks, you will have the same imaging scan(s) you had at screening.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After you stop receiving the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, PD testing, and biomarker
           testing.

        -  You will have the same imaging scan(s) you had at screening.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months (+/- 1 month) after the end-of-study visit, you will be called and asked about
      how you are doing and any other treatments you may be receiving. These calls should last
      about 10 minutes each time.

             severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any of the substances included in the
             study drug (including excipients).

         13. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
