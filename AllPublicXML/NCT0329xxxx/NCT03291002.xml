        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients enrolled into Cohorts A and B (single agent CV8102) must have:

               -  histologically confirmed advanced cutaneous melanoma, cutaneous squamous cell
                  carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or adenoid cystic carcinoma
                  with documented disease progression

               -  not amenable to resection or locoregional radiation therapy with curative intent

               -  failed approved standard therapies or for whom no standard therapy is available

               -  at least 1 line of anti-cancer therapy for advanced disease (except adenoid
                  cystic carcinoma)

          2. Patients enrolled into Cohorts C and D (CV8102 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy)
             must have:

               -  histologically confirmed advanced melanoma or head and neck squamous cell
                  carcinoma currently receiving SOC anti-PD-1 therapy

               -  stable or slowly progressing disease after at least 12 weeks of anti-PD-1 therapy

               -  intention to continue anti-PD-1 therapy

          3. Presence of at least one injectable lesion that is measurable acc. to RECIST 1.1

          4. Recovered from prior toxicities to grade ≤ 1

          5. ECOG PS 0 or 1

          6. 18 years of age or older

          8. Use of effective contraception

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Rapidly progressing multi-focal metastatic or acutely life threatening disease

          2. Prior use of topical/localTLR-7/8 agonists within the past 6 months

          3. Clinically active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis

             first dose of study drug

          6. Tumors to be injected lying close to major blood vessels or nerves, or whose injection
             could potentially result in clinical adverse effects if post-treatment tumor swelling
             or inflammation were to occur

          7. Lesions that are to be injected in previously irradiated areas unless progressive
             tumor growth has been demonstrated (no prior irradiation of injected lesions on
             patients with melanoma)

          8. History of active coagulation or bleeding disorder or full dose anticoagulation within
             one week prior to enrollment; patients with melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell
             carcinoma with controlled oral anticoagulation are eligible

          9. Treatment with any investigational anticancer agent within 4 weeks prior to the first
             dose of study drug

         10. Acute hypophysitis or endocrinopathies that are not adequately controlled by hormonal
             replacement therapy or thyreostatic treatment

         11. Use of immune modulating drugs or immunologically active topical therapies within 28
             days of administration of the first dose of study drug

         12. Systemic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication within
             28 days of the first dose of study drug (except physiological maintenance/replacement
             steroid doses, topical steroids outside the injected lesion or inhaled steroids);
             patients are eligible if steroid requirement is &lt; 10 mg/day of prednisone (or
             equivalent) for at least 2 weeks

         13. History of active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive medication (except
             vitiligo)

         14. Known malignancies or other types that have occured or reoccurred within the previous
             5 years

         15. Recent thromboembolic complications, or clinically significant cardiovascular disease,
             or any other uncontrolled illness that would pose a risk to patient safety
