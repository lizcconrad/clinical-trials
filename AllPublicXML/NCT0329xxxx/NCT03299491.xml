  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ethiopia has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality among all countries in Africa and
      indeed worldwide, with a maternal mortality ratio of 676 per 100,000 live births in 2011
      (UNFPA, 2012). The majority of maternal deaths are preventable through early detection and
      management of complications, and access to adequate obstetric care (Say et al, 2014).
      However, in 2011 only 34% of women received antenatal care, 10% of births were delivered at a
      health facility and 7% of women received postnatal care during the first two days after
      delivery (Ethiopian DHS, 2011). Large distances and poor access to transport are two major
      obstacles that women face when trying to access services. In order to facilitate timely
      access to obstetric care, the Ethiopian Government introduced Maternity Waiting Areas (MWAs)
      at health centres to enable women to stay close to health facilities as they await delivery.
      Utilization of MWAs has generally been low due to the poor state of the homes and lack of
      adequate community support. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two
      interventions to promote safe motherhood in increasing coverage of maternal health care
      services: (i) upgraded MWAs (ii) community and religious leader sensitization using
      information, education and communication (IEC) materials. The IEC materials are expected to
      increase leader awareness and support of antenatal care, facility deliveries, postnatal care
      and MWA use. Together with increased use of functional MWAs, improved support from leaders is
      expected to increase the proportion of facility-based births in interventions area. The
      interventions are also expected to positively impact antenatal care and postnatal care use in
      the study districts.

      A three-arm cluster trial design will be used to measure the impact of the intervention
      packages in three districts (Gomma, Seka Chekorsa, Kersa) in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia.
      Twenty-four clusters with 160 individuals each are required to detect a 17% change in the
      primary outcome (proportion of facility-based births) with 80% power,assuming a cluster
      autocorrelation of 0.8 and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1. Primary health
      care units (PHCU) which consist of a health centre and several community-based health posts
      will serve as trial clusters. All PHCUs with maternity waiting areas (MWAs) constructed will
      be eligible for selection. Eligible women will be randomly selected from PHCU catchment areas
      stratified by MWA functionality and health centre basic emergency obstetric care (BEmOC)
      capacity. This is to ensure balanced distribution of poorly functioning MWAs and facilities
      with diminished BEmOC capacity between trial arms.

      Cross-sectional household surveys will be conducted with eligible women to collect
      information on socio-demographics, knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding maternal
      health services, reproductive history and maternal health service utilization. Surveys will
      be administered by trained interviewers on tablet computers programmed using Open Data Kit at
      baseline prior to intervention roll out and at endline. Multilevel regression models will be
      used to quantify the effect of the intervention packages on outcomes of interest. Random
      effect terms for PHCUs will be included to account for the clustered nature of the data.

    <description>Community and religious leaders will each attend one-day workshops designed using participatory, adult learning methods to help participants better understand the importance of maternal health care services, identify barriers to accessing care and to strategize how to promote utilization of services. Half-day workshops will conducted in subsequent years to build on shared experiences.
Health extension workers will attend 3-day workshops to identify enablers and barriers to implementation of the safe motherhood components of the health extension program and strategize on how to engage community and religious leaders to support access to maternal health care services in their communities.
Half-day workshops will conducted in subsequent years for each of the participant groups to build on shared experiences.</description>
