        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female adults (≥ 18 years old)

          2. Patient with resectable HCC (Child Pugh A, INR ≤1.5) or resectable liver metastases
             from CRC and a candidate for liver surgery

          3. Patients with low risk for surgical morbidity and mortality from liver surgery
             according to the investigators judgement

          4. WHO performance status 0, 1 or 2

          5. Adequate haematological function with Hb &gt;90 g/L, absolute neutrophil count &gt;1.5 x
             10^9/L, Plt &gt;100 x 10^9/L

          6. Adequate liver function with serum bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN, ALT (or AST if ALT not
             available) ≤5 x ULN, ALP &lt;5 x ULN

          7. Adequate renal function with serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN and calculated creatinine
             clearance (GFR) ≥50 mL/min estimated using a validated creatinine clearance
             calculation (e.g., Cockroft-Gault or Wright formula).

          8. Patient is willing to provide blood samples, and tissue samples at surgical resection,
             for research purposes

          9. Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any systemic chemotherapy within 3 months of the screening visit or any plan to
             administer systemic chemotherapy prior to surgery

          2. Previous treatment with transarterial embolisation (with or without chemotherapy) of
             the liver, prior radiotherapy or ablation therapy to the liver or prior yttrium-90
             microsphere therapy

          3. Any contraindication to vandetanib according to its local label including:

               -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance

               -  Congenital long QTc syndrome

               -  Patients known to have a QTc interval over 480 milliseconds

               -  Concomitant use of medicinal products known to also prolong the QTc interval
                  and/or induce Torsades de pointes

          4. Any contraindication to hepatic artery catheterisation or hepatic embolisation
             procedures (e.g. portal venous thrombosis, severely reduced portal venous flow or
             hepatofugal blood flow, untreated varices at high risk of bleeding)

          5. Women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception or women who are
             breast feeding

          6. Confirmed allergy to iodine-based intravenous contrast media

          7. Patients who cannot have CT, MRI or DCE-MRI Imaging (according to site policy)

          8. Active uncontrolled cardiovascular disease

          9. Any co-morbid disease or condition or event that, in the investigator's judgment,
             would place the patient at undue risk and would preclude the safe use of BTG-002814

         10. Levels of potassium, calcium, magnesium or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) outside
             the normal ranges, and that in the investigator's judgement are clinically
             significant, or other laboratory findings that in the view of the investigator makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study

         11. Patients who have participated in another clinical trial with an investigational
             product within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit
