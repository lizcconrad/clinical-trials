      A prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Chimeric antigen receptor T cells
      combined with Eps8 peptide specific dendritic cell for patients with relapsed/refractory
      leukemia. There are options for CAR-targets: CD19, CD20, CD22 and CD10 for acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia; CD33, CD38 CD56, CD117, CD123, CD34 and Muc1 for acute myeloid
      leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Progression free survival, overall Survival, overall
      response rate, and duration of response were monitored.
