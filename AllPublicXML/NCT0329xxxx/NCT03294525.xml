      The project is a multi-center, prospective cohort study. The study's total targeted

      Four hundred patients with a primary diagnosis of depression and HAMD-17 scores ≥18 at
      baseline visit are to be assigned to one of the second-generation antidepressant drugs.
      Initial treatment consists of a 8-week course with one of these monotherapies. Patients who
      meet criteria for full remission are followed for a 22-month follow-up phase to monitor for
      depression recurrence. Patients who do not remit are offered another 8 weeks of acute
      treatment, during which they receive combination therapy with aripiprazole. The clinical
      assessment (HAMD/CGI/PANAS/subtypes of depression), early life stress, neuropsychological
      test, and biological examination (MRI, genetics, neurochemistry, and immunology) were
      conducted to identify the biomarkers associated with diagnosis, treatment efficacy prediction
      of depression. Among the 400 patients, 100 receive MRI scans.

      Four hundred patients with a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder and HAMD-17 scores≥18 at
      baseline visit are to be assigned to mood stabilizers or a combination of mood stabilizers
      and SSRI antidepressants for 8 weeks. The clinical assessment (HAMD/CGI/PANAS), early life
      stress, neuropsychological test, and biological examination (MRI, genetics, neurochemistry,
      and immunology) were conducted to identify biomarker associated with diagnosis, treatment
      efficacy prediction of bipolar depression. Among the 400 patients, 100 receive MRI scans.
