    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well intravital microscopy works in evaluating patients
      with primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, or stage IA-IV ovarian cancer. Intravital
      microscopic evaluation of tumor blood vessels, blood flow, immune cell interactions, and drug
      uptake may be eventually visualized and may lead to valuable prognostic information.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of performing intravital microscopy on accessible human
      ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers during their standard course of
      treatment (i.e., surgical debulking).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the blood flow velocity of the tumor vessels and tissue penetration of
      fluorescein as a marker of tumor vessel permeability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorescein sodium injection intravenously (IV). Patients also undergo
      observation of primary and metastatic tumors via microscopy over 15-20 minutes during the
      course of standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days, at 1-3 weeks, and then up to
      2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2

          -  Ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer that requires a standard of care
             surgical resection in the operating room; this may include any stage of ovarian cancer
             from stage IA to stage IV that requires resection in the operating room

          -  Have measurable disease on standard of care pre-operative imaging studies (computed
             tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or positron emission tomography
             [PET] scan); to perform a microscopic observation, the lesion will have to be visible
             by the naked eye, lined-up visually, and be able to interface with the microscope
             objective; a measurable lesion in the pelvis or abdomen, at a minimum of 0.5 cm in
             diameter, is proposed for this study

          -  Subject or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved
             written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Renal dysfunction as defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 70
             (Cockcroft-Gault).

          -  Any known allergy or prior reaction to fluorescein

          -  Nursing female subjects

          -  Liver dysfunction; normal liver function defined as total bilirubin within normal
             institutional limits and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic
             transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate
             transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the subject an unsuitable
             candidate to undergo observational study (may also include preoperative testing
             results including electrocardiography (EKG), chest x-ray, or pulmonary function tests
             that preclude a wide excision in the operating room)
