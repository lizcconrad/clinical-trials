      Prospectively evaluate newly established guidelines and make clinicians aware of inter-racial
      difference in propofol sensitivity.

      The primary motivation in conducting this study is to conduct the implementation science,
      i.e., formalize and train, and retrain if needed, anesthesia providers in the standard
      practice of titrating infusion rate to effect and clinically evaluate the effect of race and
      ethnicity on propofol monotherapy sedation during GI endoscopy. The ultimate goal is to make
      it less likely that patients from races known to be sensitive to propofol experience
      inadvertent overdosing.
