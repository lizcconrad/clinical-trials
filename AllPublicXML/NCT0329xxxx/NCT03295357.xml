  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no clear recommendations concerning the management of patients on ECLS
      (Extra-Corporeal Life Support). Many teams keep patients sedated until removal of the ECLS so
      as to avoid accidents, notably decannulation. Moreover, there are few publications on the
      subject, all the more so as the extubation of patients on ECLS (Extra-Corporeal Life Support)
      is a recent practice. Nonetheless, it is becoming more and more frequent in the
      cardiovascular ICU of Dijon University Hospital. We therefore wished to evaluate the benefits
      of this practice by comparing 2 populations: those with extubation while on ECLS
      (Extra-Corporeal Life Support) and those without.
