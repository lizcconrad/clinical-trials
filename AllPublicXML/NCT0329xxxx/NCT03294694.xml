  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying the drug Ribociclib (LEE011) in combination with an
      immunotherapy drug called PDR001 (a therapy that uses the body's own immune system to control
      cancer) as a possible treatment for metastatic hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative
      breast cancer (in combination with fulvestrant) or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer.

      The names of the medications involved in this study are:

        -  Ribociclib (LEE011)

        -  PDR001

        -  Fulvestrant
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      -  This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an
           investigational combination of drugs (LEE011 with PDR001), and tries to define the
           appropriate dose of the above combination of investigational drugs to use for further
           studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.

        -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved LEE011 as a treatment for
           hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.

        -  The FDA has not approved PDR001 as treatment for any type of cancer.

        -  The FDA has approved fulvestrant as a treatment for hormone receptor positive metastatic
           breast cancer.

        -  When given separately these medications work in different ways to try and stop cancer
           cells from growing and spreading.

             -  LEE011 is a drug designed to block certain proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases
                (CDKs) that are required for cells to divide. These proteins may also control the
                ability of certain cancers to grow.

             -  PDR001 is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins usually produced by the body that
                help protect against foreign matter, such as bacteria and viruses. PDR001 blocks a
                protein called PD-1 which is present on cells called T-lymphocytes, which are
                involved in the immune response. PDR001 is being tested to see if it will allow the
                body's immune system to work against tumor cells. Other studies have shown that
                blocking PD-1 may result in reduced tumor cell growth in a variety of solid tumors.

             -  Fulvestrant is an estrogen receptor antagonist that is indicated for the treatment
                of postmenopausal women with HR+ MBC.

        -  In this research study, the investigators are looking for a safe and tolerable dose of
           LEE011 that can be given in combination with PDR001 for participants with metastatic
           hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer (in combination with
           fulvestrant) or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer.

               -  Any condition that would prevent the patient's participation in the clinical
                  study due to safety concerns, compliance with clinical study procedures or

                  nitrosoureas, 4 weeks is indicated as washout period. For patients receiving
                  anticancer immunotherapies such as CTLA-4 antagonists, 3 weeks is indicated as
                  the washout period

               -  Participants who have received thoracic radiotherapy to lung fields ≤ 4 weeks
                  prior to starting the study treatment or patients who have not recovered from
                  radiotherapy-related toxicities. For all other anatomic sites (including
                  radiotherapy to thoracic vertebrae and ribs) radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to
                  starting the study treatment or has not recovered from radiotherapy-related
                  toxicities. Palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting
                  study treatment is allowed.
