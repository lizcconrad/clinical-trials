  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are considered as a one of the most malignant cancers. It
      has prognosis due to its distant metastasis and obvious destruction which lead to low
      survival rate.

      The conventional treatment modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are only
      the suitable strategies until now. Investigators cannot ignore the serious side effects of
      chemotherapy such as gastrointestinal upset, bone marrow suppression which cannot be
      overcome. For all these complications, there is a great need and demand to discover a new
      agents and strategies for treating OSCC.

      Licorice extract, especially Licochalcone A, is one of many natural extracts that have used
      as a traditional in treatment of inflammation, microbial infections. Regarding antitumor
      effect, Licochalcone A reveals interesting results in programmed cell death and apoptosis in
      cancer cells such as prostate, bladder, colon and gastric cancer.

    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is considered the most common human body malignant tumor.
      It has poor prognosis regarding its distant lymph node metastasis and local destruction which
      lead to low survival rate.

      Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic drug of the taxols group that is used in the treatment of
      lung, ovarian and prostate cancer. It is also used to treat breast, head and neck cancer as
      well as sarcoma and leukemia. Recent studies and researches explored that Paclitaxel has an
      important role in mitotic arrest activation and induction, which subsequently lead to cell
      death.

      The conventional treatment strategies such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy come
      with low levels of expectations regarding prognosis and survival rate. On the other hand,
      serious side effects of chemotherapy such as renal toxicity, gastrointestinal upset and bone
      marrow suppression remain hazards which cannot be avoided.Thus, there is a great need to
      discover new agents and strategies for treating OSCC or even enhancing the effect of
      chemotherapy in order to reduce the dose given.

      Licorice extract, Licochalcone A, is one of many natural extracts of Glycyrrhiza inflata
      plant. It has been used in treatment of inflammation, infections and cancer.
