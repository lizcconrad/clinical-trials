  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are increasing throughout the developing world and are the cause of
      almost 16.7 million deaths each year, of which 80% occur in low and middle-income countries.
      As more than three fourth of the global burden of cardiometabolic diseases are related to
      risk factors connected with lifestyles or behaviors, such as smoking, unhealthy eating, low
      physical activity, and harmful consumption of alcohol. This burden could be dramatically
      reduced by changing individual behaviors. This study is focused on interventions that are
      aimed to improve the adherence to treatment in cardiovascular disease (hypertension), based
      on a Behavioral Economics approach. Most of public policies targeted to tackle
      Noncommunicable diseases utilize a rational economic model of behavior.

      Behavioral economics, by using insights from cognitive psychology and other social sciences,
      has drawn a lot of attention for its potential to increase healthy behaviors. Interventions
      informed by Behavioral economics principles seek to rearrange the social or physical
      environment in such a way to 'nudge' people towards healthier choices and behaviors. This is
      an individual controlled randomized trial which will be conducted to assess whether the
      implementation of two strategies, blood pressure self-monitoring plus signing a &quot;contract of
      commitment&quot;, and peer mentoring are effective to reduce blood pressure values over a period
      of 3 months, compared to usual care. This randomized trial will enroll 430 patients from 10
      public primary care clinics in Argentina.
