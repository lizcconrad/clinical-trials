  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the time interval following the last
      treatment dose of enoxaparin at which the amount of anti-Xa level activity is reliably less
      than 0.2IU/mL in patients presenting for elective surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enoxaparin is a factor Xa inhibitor commonly used for both prophylaxis against and treatment
      of thromboembolism. It is also frequently used off-label as a perioperative bridge for
      patients that are chronically anticoagulated prior to surgery, such as those taking Warfarin.
      It is an attractive option for perioperative use secondary to its predictable pharmacologic
      profile and the lack of recommended routine blood monitoring. Therefore, it is common to
      encounter a patient who has recently received a treatment dose of Enoxaparin prior to
      presenting for surgery. For these patients, and those on other anticoagulant medications,
      published guidelines have been developed to help guide clinical decision-making when the
      anesthetic/analgesic plan includes regional anesthesia.1 Currently, these guidelines
      recommend that a minimum of 24-hours should elapse following the last treatment dose of
      Enoxaparin before a neuraxial procedure is performed. However, a recently completed quality
      improvement project conducted at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center found that almost 60% of
      patients presenting for surgery while on treatment dose enoxaparin still had significant
      anticoagulant activity 24-hours following their last dose, as demonstrated by anti-Xa level
      assay testing. Given that the risk of epidural hematoma formation is increased in the setting
      of abnormal coagulation parameters2, the significance of this finding is that the risk of
      bleeding complications following a neuraxial procedure may still be increased 24-hours after
      the last treatment dose of enoxaparin.

      While the routine use of anti-Xa level testing may be a viable option to determine when
      residual enoxaparin activity is present before proceeding with a neuraxial procedure on a
      patient-by-patient basis, it is not universally available at all hospitals. Therefore, it is
      important to determine the time interval following the last enoxaparin dose at which the
      likelihood that a clinically relevant amount of residual anti-Xa level activity no longer
      persists, so that providers can confidently proceed with a neuraxial procedure when anti-Xa
      level testing is not available.

    <description>Group one will be instructed to administer their last dose of enoxaparin at 07:00 in the morning on the day prior to their scheduled surgery date. This will mean that patients who have their surgery scheduled for 07:00 the following day will be 24-hours removed from their last dose. Patients presenting for surgery later in the day would be slightly farther removed from their last dose, however this is currently considered normal clinical practice.</description>

Patients presenting for surgery at 07:00 two days later will be 36-hours removed from their last dose. Patients presenting for surgery later in the day would be slightly farther removed from their last dose, but again this mimics normal clinical practice in which the timing of the last dose of self-administered enoxaparin is not routinely adjusted based on the scheduled surgical start time.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligible patients need:

          -  to be on treatment dose (1mg/kg twice daily or 1.5mg/kg daily) enoxaparin at the time
             of presentation for elective surgery

          -  and must be able to accurately report the timing of their last dose and the
             administered dosage.

          -  Patients must also be between the ages of 18-100 years of age

          -  and must be able to give written consent to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt;30ml/min) will be
             excluded from the study, as the elimination of enoxaparin is known to be affected in
             this patient population.

          -  Pregnant patients will also be excluded, as the elimination and metabolism of
             enoxaparin is known to be altered in this patient population, and dose adjustments are
             recommended if treatment dose enoxaparin is used during pregnancy.

          -  Patients who are receiving enoxaparin as a bridge from another anti-Xa inhibiting
             medication will be excluded as this could unpredictably affect the results of anti-Xa
             testing. These medications include: Apixaban, Edoxaban, Fondaparinux, and Xarelto.
