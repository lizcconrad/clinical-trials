  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying cryoablation (a treatment to kill cancer cells with extreme
      cold) combined with continued treatment with current immune checkpoint inhibitor as a
      possible treatment for lung cancer.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved each aspect of this therapy,
      however this research study is unique because it combines them as a treatment option for the
      participant's disease. That has not been approved by the FDA.

      In this research study, The investigators are...

        -  Continuing the participant on the participant's immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy even
           though the participant's doctor believes that the participant's cancer is growing. Since
           the participant's cancer is growing, there is only a small chance the participant will
           respond to continued drug therapy.

        -  Taking a biopsy of the participant's cancer to confirm there is cancer growing in the
           location to be treated.

        -  Performing cryoablation on an enlarging tumor. This involves passing a special needle
           into the participant's body (cryoprobe) to freeze tumor and kill a small part (not all)
           of the participant's cancer. Your immune system will respond to the damage caused by
           freezing part of the participant's tumor.

        -  The investigators are hoping to demonstrate that combining post-progression immune
           checkpoint inhibitor therapy with cryoablation is safe, and may induce and/or restore an
           immune response to cancer in other places in the participant's body

    <description>The safety and feasibility of the procedure will be determined based on observed adverse events. Cryoablation will be determined safe and feasible to implement in this study population if the cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) related to cryoablation is no higher than 20%. Adverse events are assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4).</description>

    <measure>Radiologic Response Rate Of Cryoablation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants that achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) following cryoablation.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (age &gt; 18) with stage IV lung cancer receiving commercial supply immune
             checkpoint inhibitor therapy with progression of disease, and for whom an additional
             4-6 weeks of current therapy (post-progression therapy) is acceptable as standard
             therapy

          -  Must have a growing tumor amenable to percutaneous image-guided cryoablation based on
             routine Interventional Radiology criteria

          -  Must have measurable disease (by RECIST) independent of the lesion to be ablated.
             Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured
             in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and
             short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with
             spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See Section 11 for the evaluation
             of measurable disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are receiving an investigational agent(s)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because immune checkpoint inhibitors have
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with immune checkpoint inhibitors, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
