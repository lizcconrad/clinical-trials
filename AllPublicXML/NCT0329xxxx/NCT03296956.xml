  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a dietary supplement (DS) is effective in
      protecting against sad mood in postpartum as compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double blind placebo controlled randomized trial will evaluate the effect of
      administration of a dietary supplement (DS) on the intensity of postpartum blues. It is
      expected that the administration will result in less sadness in day-5 postpartum women after
      negative mood induction in those receiving the dietary supplement compared to placebo.

    <description>VAS uses a 10-cm scale for participants to indicate the extent to which each of them feel happy or sad. The change in VAS before versus after sad mood induction is the change score in VAS.

          -  Diastolic blood pressure between 51 and 90 mmHg (inclusive)

          -  Orthostatic blood pressure change &lt;20 mmHg (based on the difference between supine and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has been diagnosed with any axis 1 and 2 disorders based on Structured
             Clinical Interview (SCID) for DSM-V interview within the past 10 years.

          -  Subjects who have been smoking cigarettes in the past 5 years (to reduce variability
             in mood attributable to cigarette withdrawal and MAO-A).

          -  Intolerance to any of the components of the intervention.

          -  If in the principal investigator's judgement the obstetric or neonatal complications
