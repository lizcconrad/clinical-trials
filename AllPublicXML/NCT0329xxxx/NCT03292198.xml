      Primary Objective

        -  To compare the effectiveness of 2 treatment protocols for patients with breast
           cancer-related subclinical lymphedema identified through bioimpedance spectroscopy,
           L-dex scores

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the necessary duration of intervention to reverse L-dex scores back to a
           normal range in patients with breast cancer-related subclinical lymphedema

        -  To determine the time elapsed post-surgically to the development of subclinical
           lymphedema identified by bioimpedance spectroscopy, L-dex scores

        -  To identify risk factors for the development of subclinical lymphedema in patients with
           breast cancer

        -  To identify factors associated with the progression to clinical lymphedema following
           treatment of subclinical lymphedema as identified by bioimpedance spectroscopy, L-dex
           scores

      Women with breast cancer diagnoses and planned axillary lymph node procedures will receive
      pre-operative screening of arm volume with bioimpedance, which will capture baseline
      measurements. Then, subjects will undergo periodic screenings for the first 3 years following
      surgery. If a significant change in volume compared to baseline is detected with
      bioimpedance, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. The outcomes of 2
      treatment protocols will be compared. Additionally, subjects will be screened each week
      during their treatment interventions to determine the necessary quantity of intervention
      before L-dex scores normalize.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial tissues resulting from an
      impairment of the normal lymphatic drainage of the affected region. Lymphedema is often a
      side effect of breast cancer treatments such as axillary lymph node surgery and radiation, as
      these procedures are damaging to the lymphatic structures. Due to poor awareness of the
      condition, minimal education is given to patients about their risk for lymphedema as a result
      of cancer treatments. With inconsistent diagnostic methods, many cases of breast
      cancer-related lymphedema are diagnosed after the condition has progressed to its
      irreversible and chronic form, i.e. clinical lymphedema.

      Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) uses a low frequency electrical current to assess
      extracellular fluid of the limbs. BIS has proven to be a sensitive and specific tool for
      detecting subclinical lymphedema (Stage 0) and has been validated in its use within a
      surveillance model. Recent literature supports the use of a surveillance model to identify
      breast cancer-related subclinical lymphedema to allow for early intervention and improved
      patient outcomes.

      Despite the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of early identification of
      lymphedema in the subclinical stage, there is limited evidence to guide treatment of this
      patient population. Treatment parameters for subclinical lymphedema stem primarily from a
      study by Stout et al. indicating that a short compression trial (mean duration of 4.4 weeks)
      of 20-30 mmHg garments effectively treated subclinical lymphedema identified by perometry by
      preventing progression to late-stage lymphedema.

      Surveillance of arm volume will be performed using bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) testing
      with the ImpedimedÂ® L-dex U400. Subjects will receive BIS testing (1) pre-operatively, (2)
      post-operatively at 6 weeks, (3) 3 months, (4) 6 months, (5) 12 months, (6) 18 months, (7) 24
      months, and (8) 36 months. The outcome measure will be the L-dex score.

      Only subjects who have an abnormal result will be enrolled in the experimental portion of the
      study. If an L-dex score is abnormal (defined by a change of +7 units from her pre-operative
      baseline), the subject is determined to exhibit subclinical lymphedema. As a result, these
      subjects will be randomized into one of two intervention groups. The group receiving only
      compression intervention will be referred to as the compression group (CG). The group
      receiving Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) and compression will be referred to as the therapy
      group (TG).

      Subjects will be followed through screenings for a maximum of 3 years post-surgically.

      The investigators hope that this study will take the next step in the surveillance model by
      answering questions about how patients with subclinical lymphedema should be clinically
      managed.

    <description>Subjects in the Compression Group will wear 20-30 mmHg sleeves and gauntlets daily for a maximum of 4 weeks. L-dex will be performed at the end of each week. If the L-dex score has reversed back into normal range, intervention (garment wearing) will be discontinued and the subject will resume the surveillance schedule of screenings. If the L-dex score is still abnormal, garment wearing continues. If L-dex score is abnormal even at the end of the 4 weeks, the subject will be removed from the study and referred to standard lymphedema therapy.
An abnormal L-dex is defined by 7 or more units change compared to the subject's pre-surgical baseline.</description>

    <description>Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) is a gentle skin-stretch massage that stimulates the lymphatic system and assists in creating collateral drainage pathways out of non-intact (damaged) lymphatic territories. MLD is a critical part of Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT), which is accepted as the international standard of care in the treatment of lymphedema.
The MLD sessions will be performed by 2 Certified Lymphedema Therapists, Megan Klote and Sarah Stolker, both trained through the Norton School of Lymphatic Therapy. The therapists have completed reliability meetings regarding MLD sequencing and techniques.</description>
