  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized clinical study was to evaluate the use of dehydrated human
      amnion-chorion membrane as an exposed barrier for guided bone regeneration (GBR) after tooth
      extraction and to determine whether intentional exposure of this membrane to the oral
      environment compromises ridge dimensions and bone vitality for implant placement.

      Forty-three patients requiring extraction of at least one tooth and delayed implant placement
      were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. For both groups,
      demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft was used to graft the socket. For the control
      group, Type I bovine collagen was used as a membrane; for the experimental group, human
      amnion-chorion membrane was used. For both groups, the barrier membranes were left exposed,
      and no primary closure was achieved. Patients returned for implant placement after a mean
      healing period of 19.5 weeks, at which time a core bone biopsy specimen 2 mm in diameter was
      obtained for histomorphometric analyses. Clinical ridge dimensions were measured at the times
      of extraction and implant placement.
