  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is the comparison of frequency of vomiting episodes (number of
      episodes per year) observed during the year after the begin of Q10 coenzyme treatment to
      frequency observed during the year before the begin of this treatment in children with cyclic
      vomiting syndrome.

      Secondary purposes are the evaluation of life quality of parents and children, of treatment
      safety and its economic cost compared to other recommended treatments.
