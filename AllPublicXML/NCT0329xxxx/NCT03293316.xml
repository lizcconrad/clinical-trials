      Inter-individual variability in responsiveness to interventions poses great challenges for
      translational neuroscience, and health care in general. The investigations sought to examine
      the potential for high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to modulate
      sustained attention in a manner that was informed by individual differences in EEG indices.

      Inter-individual variability in responsiveness to interventions poses great challenges for
      translational neuroscience, and health care in general. Reliable and cost- effective
      screening procedures that can identify individuals who are more likely to benefit from an
      intervention could have substantial real-world benefits. Here, the investigators sought to
      examine the potential for high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to
      modulate sustained attention in a manner that was informed by individual differences in a
      well-studied electrocortical marker, spontaneous theta/beta ratio. The investigators
      hypothesized that individuals with relatively high theta/beta ratios, putatively reflecting
      suboptimal cortical arousal, would be more likely to benefit from the gains in cortical
      excitability afforded by tRNS. Seventy-two young healthy adults were administered 1mA, 2mA
      and sham tRNS in a double-blind, randomised, cross-over manner, while they performed a
      continuous monitoring paradigm. Electroencephalography was acquired before and after each
      stimulation condition.

      This approach may constitute a feasible means of using individual differences in
      neurophysiology to inform predictions about outcomes from targeted cognitive interventions.

    <description>The sham tRNS condition involves 30 seconds of 1.5 mA tRNS, with a ramping period of 30 seconds at the onset and offset. This procedure ensures that, in both the Active and Sham conditions, participants experience the sensations associated with the onset of transcranial electrical stimulation (e.g., tingling sensation)</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>1mA Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The 1mA tRNS condition consists of 1 mA peak-to-peak (-.5 mA to .5 mA) high frequency noise (100-500 Hz), with amplitude values that are normally distributed and have a mean of zero. The stimulation is delivered for 20 minutes, with a ramping period of 30 seconds at the onset and offset.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>2mA Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The only factor that varies for the 2mA tRNS condition is that the high frequency noise has a peak-to-peak of -1 mA to 1mA as opposed to -.5 mA to .5 mA. Again, the stimulation is delivered for 20 minutes, with a ramping period of 30 seconds at the onset and offset.</description>

    <description>The transcranial random noise stimulation was delivered using a StarStim device (NeuroelectricsÂ®, Barcelona, Spain). The electrodes were encased in a pair of saline-soaked sponges (25 cm2 ), and were secured within a Neurolectrics EEG cap over right DLPFC (F4) and right IPL (P4), according to the 10-20 international EEG system. Other details are stated under the 'intervention arm' descriptions.</description>
