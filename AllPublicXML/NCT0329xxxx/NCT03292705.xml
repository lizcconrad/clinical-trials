  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computerized cognitive interventions (CCIs) have been increasingly widely implemented among
      older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the efficacy of CCIs in
      maintaining or improving older adults' cognitive and functional health has been modest and
      highly variable. Older individuals' attitudes toward technology use may help explain some of
      the variability in CCI effects. The goal of this R21 is to generate proof-of-concept for an
      intervention that may improve attitudes toward computers among those with MCI, in turn
      improving engagement with and efficacy of a subsequent CCI. Person-centered careâ€”that is,
      integrating individuals' preferences throughout the process of intervention--has improved
      intervention engagement among older persons, including those with MCI. A recent intervention
      predicated on this person-centered approach is called &quot;personalized engagement program&quot;
      (PEP). PEP involves a database of individualized computer-led leisure activities. The
      investigators' recent pilot data in senior living facilities suggest that PEP promotes
      psychological well-being among older persons with MCI, and may shift computers from
      dauntingly complex or personally irrelevant devices to familiar, enjoyable technology. These
      results are consistent with a number of theories indicating that exposure to pleasurable
      experiences with an object or task improves several dimensions of attitudes, including
      affective and cognitive components, as well as behavior and motivation. Grounded in both this
      pilot data and the theory around it, the investigators seek to take the next step in an arc
      of research ultimately intended to improve the efficacy of CCIs. A small randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) is proposed to assess whether an initial period of PEP, followed by a
      standard CCI, improves a) attitudes toward computers, b) engagement with the CCI, and c)
      cognitive outcomes, compared to an attention control period followed by CCI. Our design
      involving stratified random assignment of 50 assisted living residents with MCI from 4 senior
      living facilities to these two groups. The initial phase involves 4 weeks of either attention
      control or PEP, a &quot;dose&quot; suggested by prior work on attitude change and computers, followed
      by 6 weeks of CCI for both groups (a period our prior work indicates is sufficient for change
      in key cognitive domains among this population). This application is the first of which we
      are aware striving to augment CCIs, which are now ubiquitous, by addressing an attitudinal or
      affective element of the person, which are often ignored in the cognitive intervention
      literature. The adjuvant of PEP also answers increasing calls for &quot;personalized&quot; or
      &quot;person-centered&quot; behavioral interventions with older persons.

    <intervention_model_description>A single-blinded, multi-site (4 SLCs) randomized controlled trial of PEP+CCI, vs. control + CCI is involved. For PEP+CCI group, PEP will be implemented for the first 4 weeks, and CCI for the following 6 weeks. For the control + CCI group, an inert control condition, consisting of nothing outside of the ordinary, will be implemented for the first 4 weeks, and CCI for 6 more weeks. Assessments will be conducted by our research team. Separate staff blind to group assignment will conduct post-training and follow-up assessments. All intervention and assessments will occur in private rooms in relevant SLCs.</intervention_model_description>

PEP allows users to explore and participate in entertainment, educational, spiritual, and other recreational activities and content personalized according to their interests and preferences. It provides easy access to the Internet and communication applications, and has hundreds of modules spanning music, travel, trivia, games, and religious and inspirational domains. For instance, if music is among a person's lifelong interests, the system provides access to multiple music genres through jukebox, karaoke and therapeutic music applications that can be tailored to a particular activity and by individual interest (for instance, a preference for classic jazz). As another example, for someone who likes travel or visiting new places, the interface offers access to Google Earth, guided tours, slide shows and regional facts and history.</description>

    <description>VSOP training will use five training paradigms (Eye for detail, Peripheral challenge, Visual sweep, Double decision, Target tracker) that practice processing speed and attention. All exercises share visual components and focus on accuracy and fast reaction times. Participants respond either by identifying what object they see or where they see it on the screen. The training will automatically adjust the difficulty of each task based on the participant's performance, ensuring that the participants always operate near their optimal capacity. The training programs will automatically record the percentage of completion of each game and scores.</description>
