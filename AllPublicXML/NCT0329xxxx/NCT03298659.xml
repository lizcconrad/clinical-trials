  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 40-60% have multi-vessel
      disease with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although it is not
      recommended to revascularize noninfarct lesions during the acute intervention, recent
      investigations suggest the opposite and show improved outcome after direct revascularization
      of noninfarct lesions. It is undesirable to risk procedure-related complications by treating
      noninfarct lesions without impaired flow. It is currently unknown whether pressure guided
      revascularization of noninfarct lesions in the acute phase improves outcome compared to the
      current guidelines.

      The iMODERN trial aims to compare an iFR-guided intervention of noninfarct lesions during the
      acute intervention with a deferred stress perfusion CMR-guided strategy during the outpatient
      follow-up, to determine the optimal therapeutic approach for STEMI patients with multivessel
      lesions.

      Study design:

      The study is a prospective, randomized controlled, multicentre study.

      Study population:

      The research population will be recruited from the general patient population presenting with
      an acute STEMI. Patients treated with successful primary PCI and one or more additional
      significant coronary lesions in another coronary artery will be enrolled in the study. A
      total of 1,146 consecutive patients will be included.

      Intervention:

      The patients will be randomized 1:1, to (A) an active treatment arm with complete, iFR-guided
      revascularization of every noninfarct coronary lesion &gt;50% and iFR ≤0.89; (B) a deferred
      treatment arm, in which patients will undergo an adenosine stress perfusion CMR scan within 6
      weeks after STEMI, with revascularization of the noninfarct coronary lesions with associated
      perfusion defects.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The primary end point consists of a combined outcome, including all-cause death, recurrent MI
      and hospitalization for heart failure at 12 months follow-up.

      Duration:

      Anticipated recruitment is 2 years. Follow-up will be performed at 6 months, 12 months, 3
      years and 5 years.
