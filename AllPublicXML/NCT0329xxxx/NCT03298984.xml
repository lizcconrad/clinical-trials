    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine the safety and tolerability including the
      maximum dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of alvocidib when administered over a
      range of doses on Days 1-3 followed by cytarabine/daunorubicin (7+3) on Days 5-11 in adults
      with newly diagnosed and previously untreated AML

      Primary Objective:

      • To determine the safety and tolerability including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of alvocidib when administered over a range of doses on Days
      1-3 followed by cytarabine/daunorubicin (7+3) on Days 5-11 in adults with newly diagnosed and
      previously untreated AML

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To observe patients for any evidence of antileukemic activity of alvocidib plus 7+3
           using the 2017 ELN response criteria

        -  To study the correlation between the benefit from alvocidib and sequential 7+3 therapy
           and BH3 profiling for MCL-1 dependency and other potential biomarkers including, but not
           limited to, NOXA, MS1, or TMS1 using bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples

        -  To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with alvocidib in
           combination with 7+3

      Exploratory Objective:

      • To assess levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) using standardized techniques

    <description>The starting dose of alvocidib will be 20 mg/m2 as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) bolus followed by 30 mg/m2 over 4 hours as an IV infusion administered daily on Days 1-3 of Induction. Patients will have a one day drug holiday (Day 4) before initiation of the 7+3 regimen. Beginning on Day 5, cytarabine will be administered as a 100 mg/m2/day continuous IV infusion for seven consecutive days (Days 5-11) plus daunorubicin administered at a dosage of 60 mg/m2 IV on Days 5-7.</description>
