  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti Mullerian hormone (AMH) is gaining place as ovarian marker, chiefly in infertility
      assistance.

      Investigators explored its correlation with oocytes retrieval after long GnRH agonist
      protocol for stimulation, in younger and older infertile population. Methods: This
      prospective analysis compiled data of 66 females, receiving ICSI treatment from April 2016 to
      October 2017. Serum FSH, LH, Estadiol, AMH and antral follicle count were assessed. Outcomes
      were measured as good (5 to 19 oocytes) and bad responders.
