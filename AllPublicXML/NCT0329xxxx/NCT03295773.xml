  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to elucidate the morphologic evolution and remodeling of ICAD under stringent
      control of cardiovascular risk factors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator has conducted extensive research on ICAD by transcranial Doppler ultrasound,
      CT angiography and perfusion studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital
      subtraction angiography (DSA) respectively. Currently, the investigator applied 3-dimensional
      rotational angiogram (3DRA), a selective intra-arterial catheter-based imaging technique that
      had a superior spatial resolution compared with CT, MRI or DSA in depicting minute (&lt;3mm)
      angio-architecture. Through 3DRA, the investigator could appreciate the ICAD patho-anatomy
      from a near-infinite number of planes, analyzing the stroke mechanisms and morphological
      changes with much improved precision. A neuro-radiologist and a stroke neurologist blind to
      time sequence will measure the geometric parameters and the luminal narrowing by WASID
      method.

    <description>Patients who are found signal void in a relevant intracranial internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (stenosis &gt;60%) will proceed to a 3-Dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) at baseline and in 12 months. All recruited patients will receive dual antiplatelet agents for 4 weeks, followed by aspirin alone. The investigator or neurologists shall regularly review the patients and treat the conventional cardiovascular risk factors based on four pre-specified goals, for example, LDL &lt;1.8, HbA1c &lt;6.0, blood pressure &lt;140/90 and no smoking. The morphologic changes of the cerebral plaques with the intensity of the risk factor control in pre and post will be correlated.</description>

        Patients who have acute cerebral ischemic symptoms attributed to a high-grade (≥60%)
        stenosis at a middle cerebral artery or intracranial segment of an internal carotid artery
        (ICA) would be reviewed by neurologists. If their stroke etiology and relevance to ICAD
        based on clinical syndrome, vascular imaging features and concurrent cardiovascular risks
        are eligible, they would be invited to join the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is 30 to 85 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Patients who have an acute infarct in diffusion-weighted MRI compatible with
             artery-to-artery thrombo-embolism and a relevant intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis
             ≥60%.

          3. Patient who has no contra-indication for the proposed imaging tests.

          4. Patient understands the purpose and requirements of the study, and has provided an
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient with any of the following conditions would be excluded:

          1. Stroke etiology uncertain or unrelated to intracranial atherosclerosis, such as
             cardioembolism, Moyamoya disease, small vessel disease or primary angiitis of CNS.

          2. A tandem stenosis &gt;50% at extra-cranial internal carotid artery.

          3. Bleeding propensity: active peptic ulcer disease, major systemic hemorrhage within 30
             days, thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;100 x 109/L), coagulopathy (INR &gt;1.5).

          4. A medical condition that would not allow the patient to adhere to the protocol or
             complete the study.
