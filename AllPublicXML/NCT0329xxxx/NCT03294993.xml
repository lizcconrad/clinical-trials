      The investigators designed a study to assess whether there were any blood flow indexes change
      before and after radial artery puncture with doppler ultrasonography.The indexes include
      Arterial Diameter,Peak Systolic Velocity,End Diastolic Velocity,Resistive Index,Pulsatility
      Index,Systolic/End Diastolic Ratio,Time AverageMean Velocity and Blood Flow.
