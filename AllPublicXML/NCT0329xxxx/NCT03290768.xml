    <textblock>
      This study allows Type 2 diabetics to receive feedback from a continuous glucose monitor
      (CGM) as part of an educational program designed to help them better manage their glucose
      levels. Subjects will also wear an activity tracker to monitor their activity and observe its
      effect on their glucose levels. The educational program will involve calls from coaches to
      check subjects' progress and answer questions.
