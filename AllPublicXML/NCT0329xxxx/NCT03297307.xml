  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity has been a growing problem with more than 30% of children between 6 and 19
      years old being considered overweight or obese. Obese children are at increased risk of
      developing diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and are susceptible to the
      sociological effects of being overweight. Obesity is a multifactorial disease, is often
      familial and multi-generational, and studies have shown that parental obesity can increase
      the risk of a child becoming obese. Currently, one of the most successful treatment options
      for obesity is bariatric surgery. The Nebraska Medicine Bariatric Center offers patients
      counseling in improved dietary management, methods to increase physical activity, and
      psychological support. As part of the programs standard-of-care, each bariatric surgical
      patient receives consultation with a dietician, psychologist, and an exercise physiologist.
      We propose that mothers who are enrolled in the surgical weight loss program bring their
      children to attend the presurgical specialist consultation. Subjects enrolled in the study
      will have their height, weight, and physical activity assessed at preoperative and
      postoperative study visits. Study subjects will also complete questionnaires of their
      self-reported physical activity and eating habits at these study visits. The goal of this
      pilot study is to examine whether this behavioral intervention will have an impact on the
      overall health and weight of children whose mothers have received bariatric surgery.

      This is a prospective intervention study of female bariatric surgical patients and their
      children. The dyads, consisting of one female bariatric patients and one child living in the
      home, will be enrolled in the study. Half of the children will attend the dietary, physical
      activity, and psychological counseling with the mother prior to her surgery, and the other
      half of the children will not receive the behavioral intervention. Outcomes from each
      mother-child dyad will be measured at baseline, and 3 and 6 months postoperatively (Visit
      BL-2, Visit PO-3, and Visit PO-6). The primary outcome measured from each dyad will be BMI,
      and secondary outcomes will be physical activity and energy expenditure (as measured by an
      accelerometer at each research study visit) and self-reported diet and physical activity (as
      measured by questionnaires completed at each research study visit).

      Each bariatric surgical patient will receive a consultation with a dietician, psychologist,
      and an exercise physiologist as standard-of-care. These specialist consultations usually take
      place sequentially in the same day. The intervention aspect of this study is to include the
      child with the mother for these specialist consultations. The dietician will educate the
      patient as to dietary modifications that will be needed both before and after bariatric
      surgery. The psychologist will review any existing psychological conditions with the patient
      and discuss behavioral and pharmaceutical management of these conditions in conjunction with
      the bariatric surgery. The exercise physiologist will discuss physical restrictions to
      exercise and modifications to an exercise regimen that can be properly performed by the
      patient.
