  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess and analyze the characteristics and usage of
      conventional and Korean medical services in postoperative patients. This study therefore
      investigates the proportion of patients with a history of surgery out of patients visiting a
      spine-specialty Korean medicine hospital, and the prognosis and preference for conventional
      and Korean medicine treatment by previous treatment history in postoperative patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A considerable number of patients suffer prolonged chronic pain that does not retract or
      diminish after surgery, and are thus unable to achieve the desired results in receiving
      surgical treatment. Postoperative pain is gradually being perceived as a social issue as
      opposed to a personal health condition. Meanwhile, although efforts to address chronic pain
      with integrative medicine are continued in answer to the lack of success of pain management
      through surgery, there is still a lack of supporting evidence.

      The objective of this survey study is to assess the characteristics, usage of conventional
      and Korean medical services, and prognosis by period before and after surgery in
      postoperative patients visiting a Korean medicine hospital, and analyze the associations
      between the preference for conventional and Korean medicine treatment. This study therefore
      investigates the usage of conventional and Korean medical services in postoperative patients,
      and is expected to provide information that will potentially aid patient decision making.
