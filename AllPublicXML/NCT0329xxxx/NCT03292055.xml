  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of a newly developed FFQ specified
      for northern Chinese CHD and their high risk patients (CHD-FFQ). The psychometric properties
      include test-retest reliability, content validity, convergent validity, discriminant
      validity, concurrent validity and predictive validity. Particularly, this study will measure
      the physiological indicators, including plasma lipid profile (i.e. TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C), BG,
      BP and BMI twice at baseline and the end. The level of these physiological indicators will be
      compared with the fat intake measured by the CHD-FFQ, i.e. the baseline intake to test its
      convergent validity. It is also expected to predict the diet-related progression of CHD risks
      among high-risk individuals, i.e. patients with two or more CHD risk factors as following:
      raised fasting blood glucose (BG) level, increased blood pressure (BP), increased
      triglycerides (TG), decreased HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C), increased LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C),
      smoking and central obesity (International Diabetes Federation, 2015). In addition, this
      study will provide the FFQ's concurrent validity in assessing the intake of energy and
      nutrients against the CDC-FFQ. Moreover, whether the FFQ could detect the known differences
      in energy intake between men and women will be established for its discriminant validity.
