    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to continue the evaluation of antibody persistence through 11 to
      15 years after first booster with Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) vaccine. This study will
      further investigate the booster response in subjects who will receive their second booster
      dose* in this study.

      * Any booster given in this study will be the second that the subject has received (with
      regard to the follow-up of the previous study).

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects will come to the yearly scheduled blood draw visit for investigation of 11 to 15 year persistence of Neutralization Test (NT) titres. Subjects who have an NT titre below 10 at one of the scheduled visits will receive a second booster dose 6 months after this visit at an unscheduled visit.
