  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Edema, commonly called swelling, is a common medical condition, with many causes. Clinicians
      generally find edema by pressing against a patient's skin, usually on the feet or shins, and
      observing how much dimpling there is in the skin. Most clinicians estimate the amount on a
      scale of mild to severe, or perhaps state the amount as 1 to 4. There is little agreement
      between observers, and it is hard to judge different clinicians' use of these scales. The
      first part of this experiment will demonstrate this inconsistency. After clinicians are shown
      a new technique for measuring edema, the second part of the study will show more accurate and
      consistent measurements. This will help clinicians to measure edema better, and to
      communicate their findings to other clinicians more effectively.

      The research team will recruit as many clinicians who are conveniently available for the
      study. Clinicians will include attending physicians from any specialty, residents, medical
      students, physician assistants, physician assistant students, nurses, certified nurse
      practitioners, and certified nurse practitioner students.

      Once patients and clinicians have been recruited, the research team will maintain a list of
      the patients and a grid of which clinicians are to examine which patients. Each clinician
      will be given a data collection sheet, listing the patients' room numbers, and a grid for
      recording results for each of the patient's affected limb(s). The first data collection sheet
      (before instruction on the quantitative method) will just show a blank free text field so
      that clinicians can record their results as they normally do.

      After instruction in the novel quantitative technique, the clinicians will receive another
      data collection sheet now indicating the intent to have the clinicians record their findings
      in millimeters.

      The expectation is that a minimum of 6 examiners will determine the extent of edema on at
      least 38 limbs. If possible, the research will continue until approximately 100 limbs have
      been examined by a total of at least 10 to 20 clinicians.
