  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common maligancies of China. In the era of
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the 5-year overall survival (OS) has now reached
      85.0% or more. However, even after chemoradiation, the 5-year distant-metastasis rate of
      patients with N2-3 NPC is still 36.7%. Aspirin is proven in lab and clinical studies to have
      the abilities of inhibiting the inflammation which could enhance metastasis of breast and
      colorectal cancers. And before this study, it was discovered that regular aspirin intake
      might be associated with distant-metastasis-free survival (MFS) and OS independently. So this
      Phase 2 trial was conducted to validate the impact of aspirin on prognosis of N2-3 NPC.

      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common maligancies of China. In the era of
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the 5-year overall survival (OS) has now reached
      85.0% or more. However, the prognosis of the patients with late N (N2-3) diseases remains
      poor. Even after chemoradiation, the 5-year distant-metastasis rate of these patients is
      nearly 36.7%. Additionally, these patients occupies about 30.0% of the whole NPC population.
      To improve the prognosis of the patients with N2-3 NPC, there is a need to explore a new,
      practical and effective method to eliminate the distant metastasis.

      Aspirin is proven in lab and clinical studies to have the abilities of inhibiting the
      inflammation which could enhance metastasis of many malignant tumors, such as breast and
      colorectal cancers. And before this study, patients with N2-3 nonmetastatic NPC between 2008
      and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed, to discovered that regular aspirin intake might be
      associated with distant-metastasis-free survival (MFS) and OS independently. So this Phase 2
      randomized controlled trial was conducted to validate the impact of aspirin on prognosis of
      N2-3 NPC.

      This study aim to enroll patients with T1-4N2-3M0 NPC. All the patients will be treated with
      IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy of the PF (Nedaplatin + 5-flurouracil) regimen. After
      randomization, patients in the Experimental Group will also receive daily aspirin of 75mg.
      The 5-year MFS is the primary endpoint. And the 5-year OS and aspirin-related toxicities are
      the secondary endponits.
