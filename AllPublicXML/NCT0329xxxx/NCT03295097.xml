  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the feasibility, acceptability, usability and outcomes of
      a new clinical decision support system for clinicians of opioid therapy in the context of
      specialist palliative care for serious chronic illness. The system provides clinicians with
      patient-specific genetic information on opioid responsiveness and multi-drug interactions.
      This clinical decision support system should improve the clinician's ability to identify the
      optimal pain medication and dosage, and reduce risks associated with multi-drug treatment.
      Investigators will conduct clinician survey's to collection information about the clinical
      decision support system. Investigators will also conduct patient related questionnaires to
      determine any benefits or improvements in quality of life and symptom management from the
      clinical decision support system.
