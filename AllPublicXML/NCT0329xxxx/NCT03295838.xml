  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of a psychological treatment, Mentalization-Based Treatment, was studied using a
      research protocol with patients with mood swings and impulsive behavior (borderline
      personality disorder).

      Background: Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) in borderline personality disorder (BPD) has
      a growing evidence base, but there is a lack of effectiveness and moderator studies. The
      present study examined the effectiveness of MBT in a naturalistic setting and explored
      psychiatric and psychological moderators of outcome. Method: Borderline and general
      psychiatric symptoms, suicidality, self-harm, alexithymia and self-image were measured in a
      group of BPD patients (n=75) receiving MBT; assessments were made at baseline, and
      subsequently after 6, 12 and 18 months (when treatment ended). Borderline symptoms were the
      primary outcome variable.

    <description>Key psychiatric and borderline symptomatology as measured by the Karolinska Borderline And Symptoms Scales (KABOSS-S) was the primary outcome measure. The KABOSS-S consists of three general symptom scales (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms) derived from the Comprehensive Psychopathological Self-rating Scale for Affective Syndromes and one specific borderline scale compromising the items &quot;Mood swings&quot;, &quot;Ability to understand own emotions&quot;, &quot;Self-control&quot;, &quot;Self-soothing&quot;, &quot;Feelings of abandonment&quot;, &quot;Feelings of emptiness&quot;, &quot;Self-image&quot; and &quot;Reality Presence&quot;. Each item is scored on a Likert scale from 0 (&quot;no presence&quot;) to 6 (&quot;severe&quot;).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidality</measure>
    <time_frame>0-18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidality was measured by the Suicide Assessment Scale, Self-Report (SUAS-S), which covers factors known to influence suicide risk, such as affect, bodily states, control and coping, emotional reactivity, as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviour.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Psychiatric Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>0-18 months</time_frame>
    <description>General psychiatric symptoms were measured using the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R), an established instrument with well-known reliability and validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-harm</measure>
    <time_frame>0-18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-harm was measured by the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory-9 (DSHI-9), which has well-known reliability and validity. This measure was introduced halfway through the study period (N=42).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alexithymia</measure>
    <time_frame>0-18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) was used to measure alexithymia. It comprises 20 items divided into three subscales: Difficulty Identifying Feelings, Difficulty Expressing Feelings and Externally Oriented Thinking. TAS-20 was used to measure affective mentalization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-image</measure>
    <time_frame>0-18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-image was assessed using Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB). SASB is based on a circumplex model, measuring self-image and interpersonal interactions in relation to three interpersonal &quot;surfaces&quot; (i.e. actions of others, reactions to others and the introject, or what can be called the self-image. The third surface (self-image) was used, which comprises eight clusters of self-image: 1) Autonomy; 2) Self-affirmation; 3) Active self-love; 4) Self-protection; 5) Self-control; 6) Self-blame; 7) Self-attack; and 8) Self-neglect.</description>

    <description>MBT was conducted according to the treatment manual developed by Bateman &amp; Fonagy. Patients were offered individual sessions with a psychotherapist and group sessions with 6-8 participants and 1-2 group therapists for 18 months. An introductory psycho-educational component (9-12 sessions) was also offered focusing on explicit mentalising skills (i.e. understanding one's own or others' intentions). Group and individual MBT focused on implicit mentalising towards self and others.</description>
