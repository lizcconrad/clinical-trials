  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pragmatic, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial to explore the
      effectiveness of an adjuvant Chuna manual therapy (CMT) for cervicogenic dizziness of
      Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) ≥ 16 at baseline. Participants will be randomized and
      allocated to either CMT combined with usual care (UC) group or UC group with 1:1 ratio. They
      will receive 12 sessions of CMT or UC treatment for 6 weeks. UC consists of physical therapy
      and patients education.

    <description>Chuna manual therapy (CMT), 2 sessions/week, 6 weeks (12 sessions in total)
Usual care therapy (UC), 2 sessions/week, 6 weeks (12 sessions in total)
Usual care consists of physical therapy and patients education. Physical therapy consists of meridian muscle interferential current electricity (or meridian transcutaneous electricity) and hot pack (or infrared lamp).
Patients will be educated about cause and risk factors of cervicogenic dizziness, general neck muscle functions, self-exercising for relieving the symptoms.
CMT and UC group will receive the same UC regimen.</description>
