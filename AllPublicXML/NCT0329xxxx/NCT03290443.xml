    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study to assess the PK of single 100 mg oral dose of
      enasidenib (CC-90007) in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, and in matched
      healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function.

      Degrees of hepatic impairment will be determined during screening by the subject's score
      according to Pugh's Modification of Child's Classification of Severity of Liver Disease
    </textblock>

      Subjects will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 4 as follows:

        -  Group 1: Approximately 6 to 8 male and female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 1.

        -  Group 2: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male and female subjects with normal hepatic
           function will be enrolled in Group 2. Subjects in Group 2 will be matched to subjects in
           Group 1 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 30 pounds).

        -  Group 3: Approximately 6 to 8 male and female subjects with severe hepatic impairment
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 3.

        -  Group 4: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male and female subjects with normal hepatic
           function will be enrolled in Group 4. Subjects in Group 4 will be matched to subjects in
           Group 3 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 30 pounds). This study
           employs a staged design as follows.

        -  At least 4 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory
           safety and tolerability for up to 8 days after dosing, before subjects with severe
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.

        -  Two subjects with severe hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory safety and
           tolerability for up to 8 days after dosing, before the remaining subjects with severe
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.

             50 to 100 mmHg, and pulse rate: 40 to 100 bpm.

          5. Female subjects NOT of childbearing potential must:

             a. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
             documentation required) at least 6 months before screening, or be postmenopausal
             (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before screening, with a

          6. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)1 must have a negative pregnancy test at the
             Screening and Baseline Visits. While receiving IP and for at least 4 months after
             taking the last dose of IP, FCBP who engage in activity in which conception is

             ECG, and clinical laboratory safety tests. Clinical laboratory safety tests (ie,
             hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) and 12-lead ECGs must be within normal limits
             or clinically acceptable as judged by the Investigator.

         19. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at screening. In addition:

             enrollment:

         18. Subject has any unstable medical condition occurring within 3 months prior to signing
             the ICF (excluding hepatic impairment and associated comorbidities per Investigator
             discretion).
