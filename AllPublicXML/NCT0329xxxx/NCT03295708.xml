    <textblock>
      In this proposed study, the investigators will evaluate the effects of fish oil add-on in
      treatment of major depressive disorder(MDD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are randomly assigned to two groups (n=60): control (placebo, soybean) and fish
      oil (containing EPA 1440mg, DHA 960mg). The experimental groups will be compared to placebo
      to evaluate if it may benefit clinical symptoms, cognitive symptoms and metabolic markers in
      MDD patients. We also plan to investigate the changes in markers of inflammation at the same
      time.

    <description>N-3 PUFAs is a kind of essential fatty acid,however the formation is too slow. Studies show that intakes of N-3 PUFAs is associated with MDD.It have to be got from food like deep-sea fishes. EPA and DHA are crucial for the body.Although studies have shown that reduced N-3 PUFAs were correlated with MDD, and patients with an elevated rate of N-6 PUFAs /N-3 PUFAs or a low level of DHA may be at higher odds for suicide. Trials on whether N-3 PUFAs is effective in the treatment of MDD is still controversial, which might be affected by several factors, such as dose, duration etc.. Now there is no large-scale randomized controlled clinical trial in determining the effects of N-3 PUFAs add-on in treatment of MDD.</description>
