    <textblock>
      Aim 1 - Determine the PKD of PMO (menthol) in children with functional abdominal pain (FAP)
      (n=30). Aim 2 - Determine effect of PMO administration on gut microbiome composition and
      contractile activity/gut transit rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with functional abdominal pain (FAP) ages 7-12 years (n=30) will be recruited.

      The study participants will be admitted to the Children's Nutrition Research Center. A
      medical history and a general physical examination performed by the investigator or the
      research nurse. The height, weight, and vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, and seated
      blood pressure) will be obtained. After application of a topical anesthetic to the site
      chosen for study-related blood sampling, a cannula will be inserted e to obtain repeated
      blood samples.

      At approximately 0900, subjects will receive one of three doses of PMO as a single oral dose.
      Immediately prior to administration of the PMO, a blood sample will be obtained to measure
      total menthol concentration and leukocytes for isolation of DNA for CYP2A6 and UGT2B7
      genotyping.

      After PMO administration, repeated blood samples will be obtained over 24 hours.

      At 2 hours after PMO administration, participants will be given a standardized meal and will
      eat ad libitum thereafter.

      After completion of the final (24 hours) blood samples, vital signs will be reassessed and
      the venous cannula removed. Parents will receive a follow-up call from the research
      coordinator to access/evaluate if any adverse effects from dose or blood sampling received at
      the overnight study visit.

      Prior to and after administration of peppermint oil (PMO) for 1 week at the dose defined
      above, children will undergo measurement of gut microbiome composition and GI motility and
      transit time. At the time of the stool collection, the child will also keep a 3 day diet
      history.

    <description>Microbiome is defined for this study as a statistically significant change from baseline after treatment with PMO, correcting for multiple testing (q value). Such changes may occur with respect to gut microbiome diversity and/or composition (e.g., phylum, family, genera). We anticipate there will be an increased bacterial diversity, as well as increases in the abundance of organisms associated with a healthy microbiome, in response to PMO administration.</description>
