    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral administration of
      irinotecan in adult patients. Oral irinotecan will be administered as monotherapy in a dose
      escalation trial to establish the Maximal Tolerated Dose. Totally 25 patients will be treated
      with irinotecan tablets as mono-therapy. As an extension trial 12 patients will be treated
      with oral irinotecan in combination with oral capecitabine

      The study is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation single center study in patients with
      solid tumors. The study will investigate safety, tolerability and Maximal Tolerated Dose as
      primary end-points of an irinotecan tablet given as single agent or in combination with oral
      capecitabine. Secondary end-points are pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor response.

      Cohorts of 3 patients will be treated on selected dose level with oral irinotecan in order to
      identify Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD). Totally 12 subjects
      will be treated at the MTD level. Patients will receive irinotecan tablets once daily in the
      morning for 14 consecutive days within 3 week treatment cycles. As an extension trial totally
      12 subjects will be treated with oral irinotecan in combination with oral capecitabine.
      Patients treated in combination therapy will receive irinotecan tablets once daily in the
      morning for 14 consecutive days in combination with capecitabine dosed twice daily for 14
      consecutive days within 3 week treatment cycles.
