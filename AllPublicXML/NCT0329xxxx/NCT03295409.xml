  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that affirming the self can help people to make changes in their health
      behavior. Typically, people affirm a personally-important value, but evidence suggests that
      affirming the values of family (&quot;familial self-affirmation&quot;) might exert stronger effects.
      The aim of the present study is to examine the effects of familial self-affirmation versus
      standard self-affirmation versus a control group on smoking cessation.
