    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 as maintenance therapy in
      participants with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who achieved clinical response
      in induction studies. This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group efficacy and safety study.

    <description>IBDQ is a psychometrically validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument for measuring the disease-specific HRQL in participants with inflammatory bowel disease, including UC. The IBDQ consists of 32 items, which are grouped into 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms, and social function. The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicates better health-related quality of life (HRQL). A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points is considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

The SF-36 consists of 36 items that are aggregated into 8 multi-item scales (physical functioning, role - physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role - emotional, and mental health), with scores ranging from 0 to 100.

             response is defined as:

               1. A decrease from the induction study baseline in the composite score of
                  patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy of at
                  least 2 points and at least 30 percent (%), with an accompanying decrease in the
                  subscore for rectal bleeding greater than or equal to (&gt;=)1 point or a subscore
                  for rectal bleeding less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1 OR

               2. A decrease from the induction study baseline in total Mayo score of at least 3
                  points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding
                  subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.

        For eligibility assessment, clinical response will be determined based on the centrally
        read endoscopy performed during screening and at Week 12 of induction study.

          -  Participants receiving any treatment(s) for ulcerative colitis (UC) are eligible
             provided they have been, and are anticipated to be, on a stable dose for the
             designated period of time.

          -  Participants are males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females who, if sexually active,
             agree to comply with the contraceptive requirements of the protocol, or females of
             nonchildbearing potential. Males and females of reproductive potential who are
             sexually active must agree to use acceptable contraception for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are
        met:

             induction study.

          -  Participants who permanently discontinued investigational product because of an
             adverse event (AE), regardless of relatedness to investigational product, in induction
             study.

          -  Participants are females who became pregnant during induction study, females who are
             planning to become pregnant during the study period, or males or females of
             childbearing potential not agreeing to continue acceptable contraception methods
             through the conclusion of study participation.

          -  Male participants who are planning to donate sperm must agree not to do so for the
             duration of the study and through 16 weeks after last dose of investigational product.

          -  Participants who, in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor, will be
             uncooperative or unable to comply with study procedures.

          -  Participants who have a newly diagnosed malignancy or recurrence of malignancy (other
             than resected cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or carcinoma in
             situ of the uterine cervix that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence).

          -  Participants who have developed any major illness/condition or evidence of an unstable
             clinical condition (example [eg], renal, hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal
             (except disease under study), endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic [eg,
             Felty's syndrome], or local active infection/infectious illness) that, in the

             or she participates in the study.

          -  Participants with any other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition
             or laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that may increase the risk
             associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Participants with known exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) since testing at
             screening in induction study and who are without a generally accepted course of
             treatment.

             staff members or participants who are sponsor employees directly involved in the
             conduct of the study.

          -  Participants who are participating in or plan to participate in other investigational
             studies (other than induction study) during study.
