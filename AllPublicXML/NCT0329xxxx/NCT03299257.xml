      It is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, 30-day study. Patients aged 35-60 years,
      with apnea and hypopnea index and respiratory disturbance index normalized with CPAP, and
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale&gt; 11. Patients undergo baseline and CPAP titration polysomnography,
      liquor and blood collection, Multiple Sleep Latency Test, anxiety and depression and
      cognitive assessments.

      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a sleep-disordered breathing characterized by recurrent
      episodes of total or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, which can lead to
      cognitive, metabolic and cardiovascular consequences. More recently, OSA has been associated
      with worsening Alzheimer's disease symptoms. Resolving respiratory events during sleep often
      has a beneficial impact on these consequences. However, even after adequate and optimized
      treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), about 6 to 10% of patients still
      remain sleepy. Given the high prevalence of OSA, this percentage represents a large number of
      under-treated and at-risk individuals. This residual excessive sleepiness (RES) may be
      related to comorbidities and cognitive alterations. Its physiopathology is still unknown. A
      few studies have tested modafinil as an adjunct treatment for RES patients. Since a) CPAP is
      ineffective in patients with RES; b) previous studies suggest some benefit with wake
      promoters; and c) cognitive impairment has also been reported associated with RES; the
      hypothesis of the present study is that donepezil improves alertness and cognition in
      patients with OSA and RES, evidencing the role of the cholinergic system in the
      pathophysiology of RES.

      Objective: To evaluate the effects of donepezil on RES in adult patients treated with CPAP.

      Thirty-six patients diagnosed with OSA and RES are estimated to be included. Participants
      will be treated with CPAP for more than 6 months with a mean use greater than 5 hours per
      day. After blood and cerebrospinal fluid collection, patients will be randomized into 2
      groups of 30 days of treatment with donepezil or placebo. RES will be evaluated by the
      vigilance test and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
