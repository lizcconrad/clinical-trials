  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the biomarker profile in diabetic macular edema patients in response to
      intravitreal aflibercept injection. Patients with diabetic macular edema who meet study
      requirements will receive monthly intravitreal injections of aflibercept as approved by FDA
      for a period of 6 months. A small quantity of fluid will be removed from the vitreous at each
      injection for laboratory evaluation of biomarkers present before, during and after treatment
      with aflibercept.

      Study objective is to better understand the pathophysiology of diabetic macular edema (DME)
      by defining the factors that participate in the disease process or may be good biomarkers for
      disease progression. Study will investigate the temporal relationship between the course of
      treatment with anti-VEGF therapy and levels of candidate biomarkers previously identified to
      determine which biomarkers are affected by anti-VEGF therapy with aflibercept. Study will
      correlate response to therapy to particular biomarkers and attempt to identify those
      associated with resistance to therapy for DME. Biomarker data will be correlated with serial
      clinical evaluation of disease progression. 40 subjects with clinically significant DME who
      plan to undergo anti-VEGF therapy will be treated with intravitreal aflibercept monthly for 6
      months. At each visit aqueous humor will be collected and stored (6 samples per patient). At
      termination of study all specimens will be analyzed for biomarkers identified from previous
      studies.
