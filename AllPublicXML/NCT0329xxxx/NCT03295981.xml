  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the clinical study is to investigate whether the local delivery of
      bisphosphonate as a surgical adjuvant can decrease the chance of a giant cell tumor of bone
      coming back to the same location. The hypothesis is that the local administration of
      bisphosphonate will decrease the rate of the tumor returning compared to traditional
      aggressive surgical removal of the tumor.

      The purpose of the clinical study is to investigate whether the local delivery of
      bisphosphonate (BP-loaded PMMA bone cement) as a surgical adjuvant can decrease the local
      recurrence rate of giant cell tumor of bone. The investigators will evaluate whether
      bisphonsphonate as a surgical adjuvant improves secondary outcomes, such as pain, function,
      fever, or wound complications. The hypothesis is that the local administration of
      bisphosphonate will decrease the recurrence rate of GCT compared to traditional aggressive
      intralesional curettage.

    <description>The surgical procedure for all patients will include extensive curettage of the lesion to remove macroscopic tumor, high-speed burring of the residual cavity, adjuvant treatment to the residual cavity, followed by packing of the cavity with either polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement (Simplex P; Stryker, Mahwah, New Jersey) alone or bone cement with subchondral allograft bone graft. The choice of cavity reconstruction will be at the discretion of the treating surgeon. Traditional local adjuvants (argon beam coagulation, phenol, ethanol, or cryotherapy) will be used depending on surgeon preference. In addition to the above standard treatment, the patients will be randomized into one of two study arms. In Arm 1, the control group, no additional local therapy will be utilized.</description>
