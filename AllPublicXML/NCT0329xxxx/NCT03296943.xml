  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhalants, which are neurotoxic central nervous system (CNS) suppressants, are frequently
      abused by young adults. Unlike other CNS depressants, including alcohol and opiates, no
      treatment is currently approved for inhalants dependence. In this report, a novel approach of
      substitution treatment for inhalants addiction was explored in a double-blinded, randomized,
      controlled crossover design to examine the effects of inhalation of essential oil (EO) and
      perfume (PF) on the reduction of cue-induced craving for inhalants in a cohort of thirty-four
      Thai males with inhalants dependence. The craving response was measured by the modified
      version of Penn Alcohol Craving Score for Inhalants (PACS-inhalants)
