    <measure>Change in weekly mean 24-hour average pain score (using the 11 point Numeric Rating Scale) from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain.
11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) ranges from zero to ten. Patients will evaluate their average pain during the past 24 hours in the evening prior to sleep by touching the appropriate corresponding number between zero (&quot;no pain&quot;) and ten (&quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;) on the eDiary device.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) is a 12 item patient reported outcome measure that contains 10 descriptors representing 5 dimensions of pain (burning pain, deep/pressing pain, paroxysmal pain, evoked pain and paraesthesia/dysesthesia) and 2 temporal items designed to assess pain duration and the number of pain paroxysms</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) is a validated, self-administered questionnaire that assesses pain severity and its impact on daily functions.
Patients will be asked to complete the 7-item pain interference scale which assesses the degree to which pain interferes with walking and other physical activity, work, mood, relations with others and sleep using a zero to ten numeric rating scale, with zero being &quot;does not interfere&quot; and ten being &quot;completely interferes.&quot;</description>

    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain.
11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) ranges from zero to ten.

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) is a patient-reported instrument that measures change in overall status on a scale ranging from one (&quot;very much improved&quot;) to seven (&quot;very much worse&quot;).
The PGIC is based on the validated Clinical Global Impression of Change scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a validated seven-item patient questionnaire used to quantify perceived insomnia severity.
Patients will be asked to complete the ISI using five-point Likert-style scale as a measure of perceived sleep difficulties. Scores can range from zero to 28, with a cut-off score of eight suggesting the presence of sub-threshold insomnia. The questionnaire assesses the severity of insomnia, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, sleep interference, &quot;noticeability&quot; of sleeping problem to others and concern about sleeping problems.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At the time of Screening, have documented diagnosis of Type I OR Type II diabetes
             mellitus (DM) with painful distal symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy (ICD-10 code
             G63.2) of more than 6 months duration with any one or more of the following:

               -  Neuropathic symptoms (e.g. numbness, non-painful paresthesias or tingling,
                  non-painful sensory distortions or misinterpretations, etc.)

               -  Decreased distal sensation (e.g. decreased vibration, pinprick sensation, light
                  touch, etc.)

          -  Be assessed as suffering from moderate to severe neuropathic pain across the Screening
             epoch (NRS ≥ 4).

          -  A score of ≥4 on the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4) questionnaire at
             Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 3 days after stopping of study medication. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking investigational drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

          -  History or current diagnosis of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities indicating
             significant risk of safety for patients participating in the study.

          -  Major depressive episode within 6 months prior to Screening and/or a history of
             diagnosed recurrent major depressive disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical
             Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V) diagnostic criteria.

          -  Have evidence of significant renal insufficiency or pre-existing liver condition.

          -  Have platelets ≤ 100 x 10^9/L, or neutrophil count &lt; 1.2 x 10^9/L (or equivalent),
             hemoglobin ≤ 100 g/L for women or hemoglobin ≤ 110 g/L for men.

          -  Participants whose glycemic control has been unstable within 3 months immediately
             prior to screening (e.g., ketoacidosis requiring hospitalization, any recent episode
             of hypoglycemia requiring assistance through medical intervention, uncontrolled
             hyperglycemia)

          -  Patients with any differential diagnosis of PDN including but not limited to other
             neuropathies (e.g. Vitamin B12 deficiency, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating
             Polyneuropathy), polyradiculopathies, central disorders (e.g. demyelinating disease),
             or rheumatological disease (e.g., foot arthritis, plantar fasciitis).

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to complete daily eDiary.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
