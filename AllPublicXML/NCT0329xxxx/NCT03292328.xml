  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some types of chemotherapy used to treat breast cancer can cause damage to nerves with
      symptoms like tingling, numbness, muscle weakness, and pain in the hands and feet that can
      last and can affect functioning. The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of yoga
      on reducing symptoms caused by such nerve damage.
