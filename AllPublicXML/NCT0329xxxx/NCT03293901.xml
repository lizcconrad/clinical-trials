  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized cross-over study will identify physiological factors that underlie changes in
      bone metabolism that could affect skeletal injury risk, to include increases in parathyroid
      hormone (PTH) in response to militarily relevant exercise in females. The primary objective
      is to determine the hormone and calcium (Ca) response to multiple bouts of load carriage
      exercise in females. The investigators hypothesize that PTH will increase after multiple
      bouts of load carriage exercise and this increase will be due to disruption in Ca kinetics,
      specifically either a decrease in fractional intestinal Ca absorption (FCA) or changes in
      bone formation and/or resorption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial military training (IMT) results in increased risk of stress fracture, particularly
      for females as up to 21% of females may sustain a stress fracture during IMT, an incidence
      that is approximately 4-fold higher than that for males. Young female adults will undergo two
      separate study periods in random order, one will include exercise and the other will not.
      Each study period will use dual stable Ca isotope methodology in order to determine Ca
      kinetic responses to a militarily relevant exercise, and dietary intake will be controlled.
      Kinetic analyses will include fractional intestinal Ca absorption (FCA), Ca flux into bone
      (Vo+) and out of bone (Vo-), as well as renal Ca handling. Serial blood samples collected
      during the study periods will also be used to determine hormonal responses to exercise. The
      treadmill exercise will consist of a 60 minute timed trial with load carriage (30% body
      weight) completed three times during the 6 day kinetic period. At the start of the study,
      blood will be collected for analysis of Ca and bone-related genetic markers, and habitual
      food intake and exercise will be assessed. The information gathered from this trial will be
      used to identify physiological responses that can be targeted by future interventions
      designed to improve bone responses to training and decrease injury risk in female Warriors.
