  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative study using resected/ biopsied tumors samples collected from renal cell
      carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma patients who underwent surgical removal of lesions,
      followed by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment targting programmed cell death 1 (PD1)
      but developed new lesions later were also removed and stored in the biosample repository
      (BSR). The histology and genomic analysis of the pre-treatment and metastatic samples from
      the same patient would be used to find out the changes that may have lead to metastasis.
      Also, metastatic samples from ICB naive patients would be collected and compared with those
      from ICB treated patients to find out if the metastasis in treated patients was due to
      development of reistance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients will include retrospectively identified patients with RCC or UC who
             have received treatment with ICB and achieved clinical benefit but subsequently
             developed a solitary new/progressive lesion that was removed surgically. Patients with
             other tumor types who otherwise meet criteria may be included at a later time

          -  Additionally, a group of patients with RCC who have undergone a metastasectomy but who
             did not receive treatment with ICB will be identified. These patients may be
             approached for study participation to serve as a comparator group
