  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to investigate the intake of beta-glucan in relation to glucose metabolism
      and satiety in a postprandial study with healthy subjects. The potential effects will be
      related to changes in the gut microbiota, the circulating levels of short chain fatty acids,
      inflammation and gene expression in peripheral mononuclear blood cells

      The intervention study will have a fixed order, cross-over design with three test meals
      containing low (0.5 g / 100 g of product), medium (3.5 g / 100 g of product) and high (8 g /
      100 g product) amount of beta -glucans, respectively. The test meals are in the form of
      cereals. All participants will eat the three test meals three constitutive days with 2 weeks
      apart. At day four, the participants will perform a postprandial glucose test (OGTT, 75 g
      glucose in 150 ml water) at Oslo and Akershus University College. Blood samples will be taken
      before and at different time points after glucose test.

      At the screening visit the participants will be asked to limit the intake of dietary fiber
      from grains two weeks prior to the baseline visit (0) and during the study. Otherwise,
      participants will be asked not to change their diet and exercise habits during the study
      period.

      At the baseline visit (visit 0) an OGTT will be performed. OGTT will also be performed at
      visit 1, 3 and 5 after intake of low, medium and high beta-glucan, respectively.

      The participants will receive the test meals at visit 1, 2 and 4.
