    <description>Parent/child dyads attend remote counseling sessions delivered over Internet-connected device (e.g. smartphone, iPad/tablet, laptop, or desktop computer). A counselor will deliver the lesson, review progress based on the objectively measured data, and provide individualized advice and problem-solving strategies for parent and child. Families will receive weekly contact via smartphone. Each lesson will include an interactive component for parent and child related to healthy eating and active play, as well as an interactive parenting training component. Lessons are based on the family treatment methods that effectively promote child and parent weight loss that is sustained for 10 years (Epstein et al., 1990; Epstein et al., 1981).</description>
