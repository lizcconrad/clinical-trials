    <description>Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based response rate. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest). The SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Two lesions increasing from 2 mm to 3 mm, for example, does not qualify). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

    <description>Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks. Estimated average length of treatment per participant: 4 months.
Second Course Study Treatment: Participants may be eligible for up to one year of additional pembrolizumab therapy if they progress after stopping study treatment. If they meet the criteria to be eligible for the Second Course, participants will restart treatment at the same dose and dose interval as when they last received pembrolizumab.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             occurring within 8 weeks of signing informed consent

             Performance Scale.
