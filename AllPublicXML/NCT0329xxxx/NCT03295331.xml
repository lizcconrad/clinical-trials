      A Non-Interventional Retrospective Study To Assess The Level Of Asthma Control Among Adults
      at 2 Tertiary Care Centres In Malaysia; Institute Of Respiratory Medicine (IPR) And Hospital
      Serdang. The specific objective of the study is to assess, in real-life clinical practice in
      Malaysia, the level of GINA-defined asthma control and the potential risk factors for
      uncontrolled disease in asthma patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of GINA global guideline on asthma management which is widely
      referred by health care providers in Malaysia, the control of asthma is still a critical
      challenge. According to National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011, the prevalence of asthma
      in Malaysia is at 6.3%. Based on self-rated health status, 5.5% of patients were reported to
      be in good health whereas 9.9% reported poor health status although medications such as
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta agonists (LABA) are widely available for
      effective asthma management. There is limited data to assess the level of asthma control in
      Malaysia which includes current clinical manifestation and future risk of exacerbation. Given
      the lack of data on Asthma control level, the awareness on the current disease control level
      will assist to properly characterise the patients based on GINA control level thus leading to
      appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The specific objective of the study is to assess, in
      real-life clinical practice in Malaysia, the level of GINA-defined asthma control and the
      potential risk factors for uncontrolled disease in asthma patients
