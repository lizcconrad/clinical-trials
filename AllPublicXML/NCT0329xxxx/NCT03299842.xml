    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study to ZX008-1503. Subjects will be fitted with an Embrace seizure detection
      watch and seizures detected by the watch will be compared to those entered into an electronic
      seizure diary.

      This sub study will include up to 20 participants who meet the entry criteria for the main
      Study ZX008-1503 and who are willing to wear the Embrace watch and use the Embrace Alert app
      for 12 consecutive weeks. Those invited to participate will undergo all procedures included
      in the main study during their participation in this sub-study,

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing to wear the Embrace watch on the wrist (alternatively ankle, if
             needed for younger children). Subjects are asked to wear the watch for as many hours
             of the day as possible and for the entire night, if possible, for the duration of the
             sub-study.

          -  Subject's parent/caregiver is willing to use the Alert App.

          -  Subject/subject's caregiver is willing to ensure that the Embrace watch remains within
             close proximity of the paired iPod Touch running the Empatica Alert app.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to any of the Embrace device materials.

          -  Subject has a clinically significant condition, or has had clinically relevant
             symptoms or a clinically significant illness in the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1, other
             than epilepsy, that would negatively impact study participation, collection of study
             data, or pose a risk to the subject.
