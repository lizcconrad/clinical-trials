  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study designed to evaluate combination of the human T-cell cytokine
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and a checkpoint inhibitor Ipilimumab immediately following a course of
      hypofractionated palliative radiation therapy in the management of unresectable,
      relapsed/refractory metastatic melanoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sequential administration of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) following radiation therapy offers a
      rational immunologic priming strategy to expand antigen primed T cells under the growth
      promoting effects of Interleukin-2 therapy.

      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the combination of the T cell cytokine
      Interleukin-2 and the checkpoint inhibitor Ipilimumab in sequential combination following a
      course of hypofractionated palliative radiation therapy. The addition of single dose
      Ipilimumab offers rational timing of CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade to decrease activity of
      regulatory and suppressor T cell subsets following IL-2 based immunotherapy.

    <description>Phase Ib:
- Ipilimumab will be administered in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design.
The starting dose will be 0.3 mg/kg administered within 7 days of day 1 cycle 2 ALdesleukin (IL-2).
If dose limiting autoimmune toxicities (DLTs) are not observed, the next cohort will receive 1.5 mg/kg.
The final cohort will receive 3 mg/kg, in the event that cohort 2 does not exhibit DLTs.
In the event of excessive toxicity in cohort 1, then a -1 dose level of 0.1 mg/kg may be evaluated in subsequent cohorts. Cohort sizes will increase to 6 patients if 1 of 3 patients in a cohort experience a DLT.
Once the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) is declared, no staggering of enrollment is required for accrual.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding. The agents used in this study have the potential to harm a
             fetus. Radiation is a known teratogen. There is insufficient information regarding
             potential for fetal harm during immunotherapy at this time. Biological females of
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of
             registration.

             skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic transplantation

          -  Autoimmune disease

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent or psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of IL-2 and while participating
             in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, measles,
             mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine.
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are
             allowed. However, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, Flu - Mist®) are live attenuated
             vaccines, and are not allowed.
