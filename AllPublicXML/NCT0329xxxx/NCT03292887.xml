    <time_frame>Baseline to year 17</time_frame>
    <description>HS-FOCUS was developed as disease-specific measure of the impact of Hunter syndrome on HRQL. The HS-FOCUS is designed to gather information on the participant's daily life and wellbeing, satisfaction with treatment, and hospitalizations, as well as on how Hunter syndrome impacts participant's general quality of life. HS-FOCUS includes 2 validated components: a parent version and a patient self-reported version for those over age 12 years. The HS-FOCUS Version 2.0 contains 6 functional status domains: Walking/Standing, Reach/Grip, Sleeping, Schooling/Work, Activities, and Breathing. Items are scored using a response scale from 0 to 4, with =&quot;0&quot; expressing being able to complete the activity-related functions &quot;without any difficulty&quot; and &quot;4&quot; as &quot;unable to do so. Scores are averaged to calculate the 6 function domain scores and the Overall Function Score, with higher scores corresponding to a higher degree of incapacity.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants enrolled in an interventional clinical trial are not eligible.
             Participants may re-enroll once they have completed or withdrawn from the other
             clinical study.
