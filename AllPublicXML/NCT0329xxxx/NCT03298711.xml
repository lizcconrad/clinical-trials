  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients who underwent two-stage replacement of both knee joints (one knee surgery - one
      week term- the other knee surgery), postoperative pain and analgesic usage with
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) increased at the second stage, which suggests that central
      sensitization occurs within a short period (one week) in patients who undergo total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA). Neurosteroids act on NMDA and AMPA receptors, GABAa receptors, and
      voltage-dependent Ca2+ or K+ channels of sensory neurons to increase invasive or neuropathic
      pain and, conversely, to exhibit analgesic and anticonvulsant effects. These actions mean
      that the neurosteroid acts as an endogenous regulator of pain control and central
      sensitization. The purpose of this study is to confirm that the
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is the main body of endocrine neurosteroid,
      is associated with increased pain sensitivity after TKA. The concentrations of cortisol and
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in the saliva of patients who undergo two-staged bilateral knee
      replacement surgery (one knee surgery - one week term- the other knee surgery) will be
      measured at each stage and analyzed for correlation between concentration-related changes of
      HPA and postoperative knee pain variations.
