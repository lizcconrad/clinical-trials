    <description>Quality of life will be assessed with the Personal Well-Being Index-Intellectual Disability. It is an 8 question Likert scale survey that uses faces that range from unhappy to very happy to determine how satisfied a person is with their life. Each question can be scored on scale from 0-4. This is then converted to a total score out of 100 points. The normative range for individuals is 50-100. Higher scores are indicative of a higher perceived quality of life (happiness with current life situations).</description>

    <description>Data will be collected on both program (health educator time, supplies, iPads) and participant/study partner costs (time), prospectively. Participant and study partner time will be valued at the local median hourly wage. These costs, will be gathered via survey. We will conduct sensitivity analyses that vary the value of participant/study partner time from $0.00 to the median hourly wage.</description>
