  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Radiopaque Microsphere
      (T-ACE Beads with doxorubicin) interventional therapy for patients with liver cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Taiwan ACE Beads with doxorubicin used
      for chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The investigators will study the overall response rates of lesions with Taiwan ACE Beads.

      The procedure is similar with the other commercializing drug-eluting beads. At the target
      vessels, radiologists will inject doxorubicin with Taiwan ACE Beads instead of Gelfoam or PVA
      (polyvinyl alcohol). The end point of injection is also similar with conventional TACE.

      Determine the complication rates, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
      following Taiwan ACE Beads embolization.

        function at Child-Pugh class ≤ 8, and is either difficult to accept an operation or
        reluctant to accept any operation.

        D. Disease can be treated by transarterial chemoembolization, and can be evaluated by
        Ultrasound, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT).
