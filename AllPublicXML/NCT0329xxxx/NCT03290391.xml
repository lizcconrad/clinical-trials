      This study, &quot;Linking Infectious and Narcology Care - Part II (LINC-II),&quot; will implement and
      evaluate a multi-faceted intervention (LINC-II), via a two-armed randomized controlled trial
      among 240 HIV-infected PWID in St. Petersburg. LINC-II, comprised of pharmacological therapy
      (i.e., rapid access to ART and receipt of naltrexone for opioid use disorder) and 12 months
      of strengths-based case management, will assess HIV outcomes (e.g., HIV viral load
      suppression), impact on care systems and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Russia and Eastern Europe continue to have one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics in the
      world, with highest transmission risks among people who inject drugs (PWID) and their sexual
      partners. While routine HIV testing within addiction treatment systems in Russia (i.e.,
      narcology hospitals) is the norm, links between the narcology and HIV care systems are
      limited and ineffective. In St. Petersburg 50-60% of PWID are HIV-infected, yet among this
      population less than 10% are on antiretroviral therapy (ART). For Russia to make progress
      toward the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets (i.e., 90% aware of HIV diagnosis, 90% of those diagnosed
      on ART and 90% of those on ART with suppressed HIV viral load [HVL]), a bold new strategy is
      required. The objective of this study, &quot;Linking Infectious and Narcology Care - Part II
      (LINC-II),&quot; is to implement and evaluate, via a two-armed randomized controlled trial among
      240 HIV-infected PWID, a multi-faceted intervention combining pharmacological therapy (i.e.,
      rapid access to ART and receipt of naltrexone for opioid use disorder) and 12 months of
      strengths-based case management.

      The central hypothesis is that LINC-II will lead to marked progress toward the achievement of
      the 90-90-90 HIV cascade of care targets among HIV-infected PWID, relative to current
      standard of care, and that LINC-II will facilitate health system coordination of narcology
      and HIV care. LINC-II aims to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of LINC-II on undetectable HVL
      at 12 months (primary outcome), initiation of ART within 28 days of randomization, change in
      CD4 count from baseline to 12 months, retention in HIV care (i.e., ≥ 1 visit to medical care
      in 2 consecutive 6 month periods), and undetectable HVL at 6 months; 2) evaluate the impact
      of LINC-II on coordinated care across the narcology and HIV health care systems, using mixed
      methods data from health care providers, administrators, and patients; and 3) evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention to inform policy makers on scaling up the LINC-II
      approach both within Russia and other countries with HIV epidemics driven by injection drug
      use.

    <description>Participants randomized to the control group will receive the narcology hospital's standard of care, which is detoxification with or without stabilization. Prior to discharge, those identified as HIV-infected are given contact details for an HIV clinic, not an appointment. Upon discharge, patients are encouraged to receive outpatient narcology treatment, monthly, for 1 year. For this study, with regard to linkage to HIV medical care, patients will be given printed information about where to obtain HIV medical care and a resource card containing harm reduction information.</description>
