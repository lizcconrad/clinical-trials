  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of the Spy Elite System (LifeCell
      Corporation, Branchburg, NJ, USA) in planning tissue advancement flaps and reducing wound
      complications after complex ventral hernia repairs. Complex ventral hernia repairs are
      associated with a high rate of wound complications. To a large degree these complications are
      caused by creating tissue advancement flaps to close the abdomen, which can compromise the
      blood supply to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The current standard of care for
      assessment of blood perfusion to the flaps is a surgeon's clinical judgment. It is, however,
      often inaccurate. The Spy Elite System was developed to address this problem. The Spy Elite
      System is a device that enables surgeons to visualize and evaluate tissue perfusion in real
      time. It can help the surgeon to identify optimal flap design and reduce the risk of
      postoperative wound complications related to tissue ischemia. The primary goal of this study
      is to evaluate the efficacy of Spy Elite System to aid a surgeon in creating tissue flaps
      with adequate blood supply through a prospective, randomized clinical trial. The Spy Elite
      System has been used successfully for assessing the viability of mastectomy flaps in breast
      surgery and has been shown to be extremely sensitive in predicting mastectomy flap necrosis.
      However, no clinical trial has been conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of the Spy
      Elite System for assessing the viability of abdominal subcutaneous flaps in complex ventral
      hernia repairs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 90,000 ventral hernia repairs are performed in the US annually. Large ventral
      hernias often require a complex abdominal wall reconstruction including creating tissue
      advancement flaps. Complex abdominal wall reconstructions are associated with up to 20% rate
      of wound complications including skin flap necrosis and wound breakdowns. Prevention of skin
      necrosis and ischemia would significantly reduce the morbidity associated with these
      procedures.

    <description>Group A will consist of intraoperative abdominal wall imaging prior to incision, followed by ventral hernia repair with subcutaneous advancement flaps without viewing the imaging contained within the Spy Elite system. A digital photograph will be taken before and immediately after initial incision, as well as immediately prior to and after closure. The patient will have digital photographs of the surgical wound taken by the surgical team daily until discharge, and on follow-up visits at one week, two weeks, four weeks and twelve weeks. After twenty patients have completed phase I, the surgical team will be unblinded to Spy Elite imaging. The Spy Elite imaging and all digital photographs of all patients will be reviewed.</description>

All patients will have digital photographs of the surgical wound taken by a blinded member of the surgical team daily until discharge, and on follow-up visits at one to two weeks, four weeks, and 12 weeks post-operatively. Digital photographs will be reviewed by a blinded surgeon, who will assess the wound for complications.</description>

            <description>Group A will consist of intraoperative abdominal wall imaging prior to incision, followed by ventral hernia repair with subcutaneous advancement flaps without viewing the imaging contained within the Spy Elite system. A digital photograph will be taken before and immediately after initial incision, as well as immediately prior to and after closure. The patient will have digital photographs of the surgical wound taken by the surgical team daily until discharge, and on follow-up visits at one week, two weeks, four weeks and twelve weeks. After twenty patients have completed phase I, the surgical team will be unblinded to Spy Elite imaging. The Spy Elite imaging and all digital photographs of all patients will be reviewed.

            <description>Group B will have incision and advancement flap performed based on assessment of blood supply using the Spy Elite system, as well as potential flap revision if portions of the flap appear under-perfused in the pre-closure imaging. Patients will be blinded to if intraoperative Spy Elite imaging was used. Digital photographs of the surgical wound taken by surgical team daily until discharge, and on follow-up visits post-operatively. Digital photographs will be reviewed by a blinded surgeon, who will assess the wound for complications (breakdown, necrosis, erythema, infection, or dehiscence with location specified) and assessment of healing. Upon study completion, groups will be compared for wound complications, presence of flap necrosis, quantification of flap necrosis, and healing speed.
