  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical catheters are necessary for many infants admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care
      Unit (NICU)and utilized when indicated for up to 7 to 14 days. Bacterial colonization can
      occur at the umbilical stump and potentially lead to serious bloodstream infections (BSIs).
      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled feasibility trial to evaluate three types
      of hygiene products on umbilical line stumps, on the effect of line colonization and
      subsequent infections. Infants admitted to the NICU with an umbilical line(s) will be
      randomized into one of four study groups, three products against standard of care (no
      product). The three products that will be evaluated are currently being used in different
      capacities for skin care in the UVA NICU. The study hypothesizes that daily topical
      application of 1 or more antiseptic to the top of the umbilical stump will decrease
      colonization of the umbilical stump while umbilical lines are in place.

      Umbilical catheter associated infections are higher (4.4 vs. 3.4 CLABSIs per 1000 line days)
      than other central lines such as PICCs and surgically placed CVLin the NICU. (www.CDC.gov -
      NSHN 2010 Report). Routine care of the skin entry site (e.g. central line dressing care) is
      standard for other central lines, but there is no standard for care of the umbilical stump
      while umbilical lines are in place.

      In a pilot study to evaluate the relationship of umbilical stump colonization with
      gestational age, the number of days the catheter was in place, and the type of organisms,
      colonization was detected in 78% of patients. There was a direct correlation with
      colonization and line days as well as an inverse relationship with lower gestational age.

      This pilot data supported the need for the study of interventions to reduce umbilical stump
      colonization, which may help decrease blood stream infections (BSIs) associated with
      umbilical lines in the NICU. The proposed study will evaluate feasibility of once daily
      product application.

    <description>Late-onset infections include BSI, urinary tract infection (UTI), and meningitis. Catheter associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) for this study will be defined as growth in 1 or more blood cultures of any organism including CONS during or within 48-72 hours of having a central line in place, with signs and symptoms of sepsis, and treated for 7 days. Additionally we will compare the CDC definition of CLABSI between groups, and length of stay (LOS).</description>
