      THE AIM OF THE PROJECT The main aim lies in the prevention of frequent relapses typical for
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder by means of simple, highly cost-effective
      information technology-aided approach RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS A the end of 18 months study
      duration, patients in the active group enrolled in ITAREPS will demonstrate statistically
      significantly reduced risk of hospitalization, decreased number of hospitalization days and
      reduced direct inpatient costs in comparison to control group not using the program.

      The ITAREPS 2.0 program employs telecommunication and information technologies in order to
      detect fluctuations in longitudinal mental health status of patient with schizophrenia and
      thus signalize the very early stages of prodromes preceding relapse. This approach opens an
      avenue towards early pharmacological intervention. Subjects (150 patients with diagnosis of
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and their family members) will be randomized at a
      1:1 ratio into the active or control group. Participants from the active group will be
      completing two separate versions of the 10-item Early Warning Signs Questionnaire (EWSQ) upon
      a weekly SMS request generated automatically by the system during 18 months study duration.
      In this group, automatically generated e-mail alert message feedback to the investigator will
      be activated in case of prodrome detection, prompting investigator to antipsychotic dose
      increase by 20%. The control (treatment-as-usual) group will not use ITAREPS system.

    <description>Antipsychotic dose increase upon prodromes occurence detected by Device- ITAREPS system. All antipsychotics currently registered in Czech Republic will be allowed in this study. All patients will remain on antipsychotic treatment adjusted prior enrollment, so that dose adjustment will be based on their ordinary medication. Participants will be instructed to complete the 10-item EWS Questionnaire upon SMS request sent automatically weekly to their mobile phones. EWSQ detects proportional worsening of the symptoms compared to the last week's score of the questionnaire. Individual EWSQ scores will be sent by participants back to the ITAREPS system as a SMS. If the total score exceeds the given score threshold, an immediate ALERT would be declared and announced to the investigator as an e-mail message and a therapeutic intervention is requested. After detecting the early warning signs by ITAREPS, an immediate 20% increase in the dose of antipsychotic will be required.</description>
