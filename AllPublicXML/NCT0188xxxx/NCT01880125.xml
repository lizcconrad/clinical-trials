      1. Objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of an SR 75 mg tramadol/650 mg
           acetaminophen formulation compared with an immediate release (IR) 37.5 mg tramadol/325
           mg acetaminophen formulation after a single dose and at steady state

        2. Subjects: Healthy subject

        3. Methods: A phase I study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic sustained release and immediate
           release treatment profiles at steady state.

    <textblock>
      This study was open, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment multiple-dose crossover study of
      immediate release treatment and sustained release treatment was designed to assess the
      pharmacokinetics after a 2-day repeated administration in which the steady state was
      achieved.
