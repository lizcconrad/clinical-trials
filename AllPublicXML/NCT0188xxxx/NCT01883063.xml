  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-site study. Subjects with distal radius fractures will be
      enrolled. Subjects will be treated surgically with a Sonoma WRx™ device or managed
      non-operatively with a splint or cast. Subjects will be enrolled in each group according to
      physician's standard of care (either casting/splinting or surgery) for distal radius
      fractures. Subjects will be enrolled based on the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria with a
      final qualifying decision made by a group of three independent adjudicators. The final
      qualifying review should allow for similar patient groups within each arm of the study due to
      the variability that can arise in fracture classification. Review by the adjudicators should
      be completed within 1 week.
