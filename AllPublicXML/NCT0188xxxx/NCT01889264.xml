  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill children have abnormal utilization of nutrients such as glucose, lipids and
      protein. Protein synthesis is increased mainly in the form of immune and signaling proteins,
      while muscle and structural protein synthesis is decreased. The metabolism of sulfur amino
      acids through the splanchnic area and specifically methionine and cysteine have not been
      investigated in critically ill septic children, despite that sulfur amino acids have
      important roles in thiol, antioxidant and epigenetic reactions. Methionine metabolism in sick
      children will be influenced by its rate of utilization through different pathways. Our study
      aims to investigate the metabolism of methionine and cysteine when both amino acids are given
      by the enteral route in critically ill septic children. The investigators are focused on the
      rates of transmethylation, remethylation and transsulfuration in critically ill septic
      children, and if the current standard nutrition maintains methionine nutritional balance and
      functional requirements in critically ill children fed by the enteral route.

      This is a prospective, translational study on the splanchnic metabolism of methionine to
      determine the rates of the different pathways and synthesis rates of glutathione when
      critically ill children are fed by the enteral route, and the difference among various age
      groups. The study size will include 45 critically ill septic, pediatric patients (15 infants
      at 1 month-3 years of age, 15 children at 4-12 years of age and 15 adolescent at 13-19 years
      of age), males and females admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Children's
      Medical Center, Dallas. The minimal subject's weight will be 4 kg. The number of subjects
      includes an expected drop out rate of about 20%, in order to obtain 15 patients with complete
      data in each group. Patients will receive nutritional support as per standard care. This
      study will yield important knowledge and may lead in the future to changes in the current
      practice on the management of critically ill pediatric patients in the PICU.
