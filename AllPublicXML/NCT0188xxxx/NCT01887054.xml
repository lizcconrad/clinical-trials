  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate whether a specific visuospatial training task will change
      gait performance of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in doorways, specifically freezing of
      gait.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, prospective, single-blinded six-week study in PD patients with
      freezing of gait (FOG).

      This study will involve 2 study groups:

      Group A - training group; Group B - no training group/controls.

      Both groups will complete a gait evaluation and neuropsychological testing. Group A will also
      practice an in-home visuospatial task for 30 minutes, 4-6 days per week for six weeks. Group
      B will not complete the in-home tasks.

      Participation in this study is expected to last 6-8 weeks.
