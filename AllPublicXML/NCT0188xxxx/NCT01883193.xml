  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-country three-arm, individually randomized, non-masked, controlled trial to ascertain
      the benefits of ensuring optimal maternal nutrition before conception and providing an
      evidence base for programmatic priority directed to minimizing the risk of malnutrition in
      all females of reproductive age.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine the benefits to the offspring of women in poor, food-insecure
      environments of commencing a daily comprehensive maternal nutrition supplement (with
      additional balanced calorie/protein supplement for underweight participants) ≥ 3 months prior
      to conception versus the benefits of commencing the same supplement at 12 weeks gestation and
      also to compare offspring outcomes with those of a control group which receives no
      supplement.

    <description>Research assistants will obtain infant anthropometry measurements, which include length, head circumference, triceps skin folds, Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), and weight, at age 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Length-for-age Z-scores will be compared for offspring of mothers randomized to the three intervention arms.</description>

    <measure>Estimate fetal growth</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks gestation</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound measurements will be undertaken at 12 weeks gestation with the goals of confirming gestational age and estimating fetal growth.</description>

    <measure>Mean birth weight</measure>
    <time_frame>at birth</time_frame>
    <description>As a dichotomous variable, the cutoff of 2500 g does not have the power of the continuum of birth length, but is included because of the long history of use in determining which newborns are severely underweight and this association with impaired neonatal and long-term prognosis. The design of this study will allow distinction between pre-term birth (PTB) and growth retardation of the term infant (mature IUGR).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perinatal Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>From 20 weeks gestation through 1 month of age</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome is to determine, in poor food insecure communities if a daily comprehensive maternal nutrition supplement starting ≥ 3 months preconception and continuing throughout pregnancy will reduce the incidence of offspring perinatal mortality (including still births), compared with that for offspring of mothers who commence the same supplement starting at 12-16 weeks gestation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of severe neonatal and infant infectious disease</measure>
    <time_frame>birth to 6 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome measure is number of acute visits / admissions to health center/hospital for severe infectious disease. This secondary outcome will provide insight into the importance of maternal and fetal nutrition in the early prenatal development of host-defense mechanisms and, through comparison with the prenatal and control Arms, on the importance of maternal nutrition throughout pregnancy. It is further intended to collect minor morbidity data.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 34 weeks gestation, delivery, and 3 months postpartum (maternal); 2 weeks and 3 months of age (infant)</time_frame>
    <description>To compare longitudinal changes between groups in the maternal epigenome (including blood, buccal swabs, and possibly other readily obtainable samples) at baseline, 12 weeks pregnancy (prior to initiation of LNS in Arm 2), 34 weeks pregnancy, and at 3 months postpartum. Also will collect placental, fetal and cord blood epigenome at delivery by group and infant epigenome at 3 months with fingerstick blood and buccal swabs.</description>

    <measure>Deep phenotyping of maternal metabolic and nutritional status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 34 weeks gestation, delivery, and 3 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome represents deep phenotyping by measuring in maternal tissues: hormones, metabolites, measures of inflammation, oxidant stress and immune function/status, and nutrient biomarkers as possible indices of fundamental metabolic alterations resulting from improved long-term maternal nutrition in food insecure populations. Longitudinal blood samples will be collected from maternal participants in Arms 1 and 2 at baseline, 12 weeks gestation (prior to initiation of LNS in Arm 2), 34 weeks gestation, delivery and 3 months postpartum. Samples will also be collected from participants in Arm 3 at 34 weeks gestation and at 3 months postpartum.</description>

    <time_frame>12 &amp; 34 weeks gestation and delivery (maternal)</time_frame>
    <description>Based on potential long-term effects on maternal nutritional and metabolic state from preconception intervention, we hypothesize that the gut microbiota will differ between the two intervention arms at the three proposed time points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composition of breast milk</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that improved maternal nutrition at the time of greatest plasticity in early pregnancy will favorably influence maternal metabolic and nutritional status throughout pregnancy and thus potentially the composition of breast milk in terms of hormonal content, immune factors, cytokines, and gut growth factors.</description>

    <description>Arm 1 will commence the comprehensive maternal nutrition intervention at 3-7 months postpartum. Delivery of the intervention will be monitored biweekly by collection of empty and unused sachets of the lipid-based supplement (LNS), maternal report, and casual observation of household behavior.

Menstrual history will be obtained at each visit and a urine pregnancy test will be performed if menses is delayed.</description>
