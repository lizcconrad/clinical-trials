    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open label, multicenter, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      ABT-199 in relapsed or refractory subjects with CLL harboring 17p13 (TP53 locus) deletion.
      One hundred seven (107) subjects were enrolled in the main cohort, with evaluation of
      efficacy as the primary objective, and approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in the
      safety expansion cohort to evaluate safety and updated tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis and
      management measures. Enrollment into the main cohort is closed. Enrollment into the safety
      expansion cohort is closed.

                  measured urine creatinine clearance is required;

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or

             purpura despite low dose corticosteroids.

          -  Subject has previously received ABT-199.

          -  Subject has received a biologic agent for anti-neoplastic intent within 30 days prior
             to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Subject has received any of the following within 14 days or 5 half-lives as applicable
             prior to the first dose of study drug, or has not recovered to less than Common

             of the previous therapy:

               -  Any anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, or radiotherapy;

               -  Investigational therapy, including targeted small molecule agents.
