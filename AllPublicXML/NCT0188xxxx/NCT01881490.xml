  <brief_summary>

      The overall objectives of this study are to develop two indices capable of measuring
      intestinal damage, and, separately, inflammatory disease activity in Pediatric Crohn's
      disease by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Enterography protocol (MRE) and pelvic
      MRI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PICMI Score and the pMEDIC are aimed to be discriminative (at one point in time),
      evaluative (measuring damage progression over time) and predictive. The indices will be used
      as endpoint measures in clinical research and also in clinical practice to identify those who
      are at risk for rapid disease progression and surgery.

    <description>The overall objectives of this study are to develop two indices capable of measuring intestinal damage, and, separately, inflammatory disease activity means of MRE.
The indices are aimed to be discriminative, evaluative and predictive. they will be used as endpoint measures in clinical research and also in clinical practice to identify those who are at risk for rapid disease progression and surgery. The data collected will be analyzed and scored by both the radiologists and the gastroenterologists. On the basis of these scores, 2 or 3 contending versions of each index will be then subjected to head-to-head evaluation by enrolling another cohort of 120 children undergoing colonoscopy and MRE/pelvic MRI. The best version for each index will be selected according to its performance in the validity, reliability and responsiveness testing. The second group of patients will not be followed longitudinally.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children (under 18 years of age) with established diagnosis of CD involving any
             location by the presence of accepted clinical, radiologic, endoscopic and histologic
             criteria (33, 34).

          2. Enrolment at the time of performing ileocolonoscopy and esophageal-gastroduodenoscopy
             (EGD) as part of clinical care for any reason.

          3. Children will be enrolled at any phase of the disease (at diagnosis and thereafter as
             required clinically). In order to ensure enough subjects with intestinal damage and
             since damage is progressing over time, enrolment will be stratified based on disease
             duration. Enrolment for each stratum of disease duration will be closed after reaching
             the expected sample size.

               -  20% of enrolled children will be within 3 months of diagnosis.

               -  20% of children will be between 3 months and 2 years.

               -  20% will be 2.01 to 3 years

               -  40% will have disease duration over 3-years.

          4. Children may be enrolled in any disease activity state (PCDAI 0-100).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Young children requiring anesthesia for lack of cooperation will be excluded (since
             the enteric contrast cannot be administered during the 2 hours before anesthesia and
             it is crucial that the contrast be given just prior the test).

          2. For the first 120 children only, subjects not expected to be available for 18 month
             follow-up, will be excluded (the last 120 subjects may be enrolled as they are not
             followed longitudinally).
