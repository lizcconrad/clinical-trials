    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing Cesarean delivery (C-Section) with a body mass index of 30 or less will
      be given either 2 grams or 4 grams of an antibiotic before surgery. The antibiotic is
      intended to prevent infection from the surgery. It is unknown what the best dose for the
      usual medicine used for this purpose (an antibiotic medicine called cefazolin). Samples of
      the tissue just under the skin will be biopsied at the time the incision is made and at the
      time the cut is stitched or stapled closed. A sample of the muscle of the womb will be taken
      as the womb is stitched closed after the delivery. Blood tests will be done at the start and
      end of surgery to test the antibiotic level. A blood sample will be taken from the umbilical
      cord after the baby has been delivered and the umbilical cord has been cut. The umbilical
      cord blood sample will be tested for the antibiotic level. These tests will be used to find
      out if the usual dose of medicine is enough or if more medicine is needed to prevent
      infection in normal weight women undergoing c-sections.
