    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of VX-509 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      corticosteroids (prednisone or methylprednisolone) and the effect of corticosteroids on the
      PK of VX-509 and its metabolite. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      VX-509 when coadministered with each of these corticosteroids.
