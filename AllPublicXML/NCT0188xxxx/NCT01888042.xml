    <textblock>
      It is a an open label, multicentric, phase II study assessing the efficacy of everolimus
      (given per os) as a first line treatment in kidney cancer of bad prognosis.

      92 patients will be included (anticipated). The treatment by everolimus will continue until
      progression, significant toxicity or withdraw of consent

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Metastatic kidney cancer, regardless of histology (except Bellini carcinomas), with
             measurable or evaluable disease

          2. Age &gt;= 18 years

          3. With Karnofsky ≥ 60

          4. Without prior treatment for metastatic cancer (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or mTOR
             inhibitor)

          5. Bad prognosis, defined as follows: at least three of the following six criteria of
             poor prognosis:

               -  Karnofsky &lt;80

               -  LDH&gt; 1.5 ULN

               -  hemoglobin &lt;LLN

               -  corrected calcium&gt; 2.5 mmol / l (10 mg / dl)

               -  Time frame between initial diagnostic and treatment &lt;1 year

               -  More than one metastatic site

          6. medullary function: neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109 / L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 109 / L, Hb&gt; 8g/dL

          7. Hepatic function: bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 x ULN, ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x ULN in the absence of
             hepatic metastasis ≤ 5x ULN if hepatic metastasis documented

          8. Renal function: creatinine &lt;1.5 x ULN

          9. Life expectancy&gt; 3 months,

         10. Patient signed informed consent and agreeing to comply with the requirements of the
             trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or mTOR inhibitor

          9. Other cancer within the past 3 years, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma and
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix

         10. Pregnant or lactating woman, and adults refusing an effective contraceptive method
