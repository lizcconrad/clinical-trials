      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:
      Metoprolol Succinate 50 mg Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the corresponding Reference
      Product: TOPROL-XL® (Metoprolol Succinate) extended release Tablets 50 mg of Astrazenica LP,
      USA under fasting condition in healthy adult human subjects in a randomized crossover study.

      The study was conducted with 48 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 50 mg
      dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization
      schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting
      position.

      The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 11 days including washout period of at
      least 7 days between administrations of study drug in each study period.
