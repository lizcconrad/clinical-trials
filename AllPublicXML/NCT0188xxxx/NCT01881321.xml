      Study design: This is a 2-phase study. During the first phase, the investigators developed a
      contraceptive counseling intervention based on the principles of Motivational Interviewing,
      trained counselors, and conducted a small pilot study to develop skills and refine the
      intervention.

      The second phase is this feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare outcomes
      between:

      Group 1 - Women randomized to a 20-40 minute contraceptive counseling session based on the
      principles of motivational interviewing, vs.

      Group 2 - Women receiving usual clinic care.

      Population: Women, aged 15-29 years, presenting to the University of Chicago family planning
      clinic for termination of an unintended pregnancy.

      Hypothesis: A larger proportion of women who are randomized to receive the MI counseling
      intervention will be using very effective contraception 3 months after the intervention.
