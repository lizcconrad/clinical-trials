  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Close to ninety percent of older heart failure (HF) patients have some cognitive deficits at
      hospital discharge which may impact their ability to make effective decisions about their
      healthcare. However, informal care partners (CPs) may assist in managing HF when provided
      with appropriate education and support. The goal of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) is
      to evaluate an intervention which will provide 1) additional teaching on management of HF to
      the patient and CP following hospital discharge, 2) improved communication with the family
      physician, 3) a HF decision support tool for oral diuretic management, and 4) a digital
      talking scale. The investigators believe this intervention will improve outcomes and be cost
      saving.

      The investigators hypothesize that enhanced education and support for the CPs to assist older
      HF patients following hospital discharge, combined with improved communication with family
      physicians, contact with a HF nurse, and simple decision support tools, will lead to earlier
      recognition of clinical deterioration, and improved patient outcomes. Innovative and
      cost-effective approaches to manage HF patients following hospital discharge are urgently
      needed in Canada.

    <description>Following baseline data collection, and prior to hospital discharge or within 72 hours of discharge, all patient/caregiver dyads in the intervention group will receive a 45-60-minute standardized education session with the study nurse according to individualized patient learning needs, aimed to ensure similar baseline level of heart failure self-care knowledge. Verbal (teach-back) and written information from the Trial of Education And Compliance in Heart dysfunction (TEACH) RCT will be provided to all patient/caregiver dyads. Information regarding self-care such as dietary restrictions, exercise guidelines, weight and symptom monitoring (shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles) included in the education package will be reviewed. The teaching sessions will occur at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 months post-discharge.</description>

The purpose of this tool will be to assist the patient/caregiver in keeping track of signs and symptoms of worsening heart failure. The family physician will also be provided an access to similar decision support tool for management of clinical deterioration.</description>

    <description>Patients allocated to the usual care group will receive the hospital-approved heart failure management booklet which meets evidence-based requirements for outpatient heart failure management. Patients will meet with the hospital HF nurse-clinician (standard at this institution) to review heart failure symptoms and signs, diet and exercise recommendations. They will also meet with the ward pharmacist prior to hospital discharge to review medications and side effects. Referral to the HF clinic and any HF initiative will be left to the discretion of the most responsible physician.</description>
