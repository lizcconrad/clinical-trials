  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI)
      therapy based on molecular monitoring of BCR/ABL levels in Philadelphia chromosome-positive
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL)undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation(allo-HSCT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(9;22）(q34;q11),
      which leads to the formation of the BCR/ABL oncogene. Ph is the most frequent cytogenetic
      abnormality in ALL characterized by poor outcome. With the BCR/ABL protein TKI, imatinib, in
      the combination chemotherapy regimes for newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, more than 95% of patients
      can achieve complete remission(CR). Several studies have shown decreased relapse rates and
      improved disease-free survival for patients with imatinib-based treatment prior to allo-HSCT.
      However, the efficacy of maintenance therapy with imatinib after transplant for Ph+ ALL
      patients is still uncertain. In addition, acquired resistance to imatinib is frequently
      caused by point mutations in BCR/ABL that inactivate imatinib.

      Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after transplant is associated with an increased
      risk of relapse. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a sensitive
      method for detecting low-level BCR/ABL transcripts to assess MRD in Ph+ ALL. It has been
      corroborated by several reports that detection of MRD after SCT was predictive of imminent
      relapse.

      In this study, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TKI therapy, when initiating
      treatment based on BCR-ABL transcript levels after allo-HSCT.

    <description>Treatment with TKI will be initiated if the level of BCR-ABL transcript in the bone marrow is detectable and transcript levels increased for two consecutive tests.

    <description>Imatinib was given at a dose of 400mg/d or 600mg/d, dasatinib at a dose of 100mg/d or 140mg/d, and nilotinib at a dose of 400mg twice daily. If the patients had T315I mutations, ponatinib will be given. If the BCR/ABL levels increased or did not decrease after one month's use of TKI, donor lymphocyte infusion will be given and the TKI drugs will be modulated. If the patients experienced hematologic relapse, they will withdraw from the study.</description>
