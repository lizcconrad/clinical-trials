  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is not a robust, testable neural model available that sufficiently explains
      the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN) a severe, often fatal,
      adolescent-onset eating disorder. Using state of the art neuroimaging and neuropsychological
      techniques, our objective is to identify neural mechanisms in the adolescent brain underlying
      AN. This is of high clinical relevance in as much as it will provide a robust platform for a
      diagnostic battery so that physicians can identify those who are prone to develop AN at a
      very early stage of life.

      The aim of this research plan is: 1) To develop knowledge of cognitive dysfunction in
      adolescents who have recently been diagnosed with AN, with a battery of cognitive tests
      during a series of clinical visits. 2) To provide a scientific basis for our knowledge about
      how the brain of an adolescent with an eating disorder differs from that of a healthy
      adolescent, by conducting functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging on adolescent
      females with AN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with eating disorders have debilitating cognitive disturbances that impact on
      their social, educational and physical health. One cognitive trait that is found to form core
      cognitive disturbances in AN is superior working memory (WM). WM is the ability to ruminate
      on a cognitive strategy while attending to the details of another task, excluding
      non-relevant stimuli, and is linked to activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC). By administering functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) we have recently found
      that females with AN have increased activation in the DLPFC and reduced appetitive brain
      responses when thinking about eating food shown in visual images. This suggests that the
      increased WM capacity in AN may serve to suppress food intake, but this has not yet been
      clarified. In line with this assumption, we have also shown that restraint of appetite in
      those with AN was linked to greater plasticity in the DLPFC. Furthermore, Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of the DLPFC reduces appetitive responses to food stimuli in
      adults with eating disorders. Conversely, we have shown that being obese is linked to reduced
      structure and abnormal function in the DLPFC, as well as reduced attentional control/WM
      performance. Therefore, it is likely that DLPFC-related WM function is associated with eating
      disorders, particularly cognitive restraint of appetite.

      It is likely that the interaction between appetitive brain regions and specific prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) cognitions determines whether an adolescent develops anorexia nervosa. We aim to
      provide neuropsychological and brain imaging measures showing how a specific cognitive
      function is linked to early-onset disordered eating behaviour, and we will do this before and
      after standard clinical treatment. We suggest that such understanding could enable school
      nurses to use the unique paradigm we use in our fMRI study, to detect illness before it
      damages the child's life and becomes difficult to treat.

      The study has now been increased to include genetic components to examine the genetic and
      epigenetic variation for genes found to be linked with eating disorders.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure functional differences in adolescents with eating disorders and healthy controls.</measure>
    <time_frame>This is measured during scanning shortly after patient admittance to treatment, and one year later. Controls have their scans shortly after being recruited to the study, then again 1 year later.</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of each groups' neural activity will be carried out with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) implemented in Matlab. This will compare the statistical parametric maps between the group using ANOVAs, ANCOVAs and t-tests.</description>

    <measure>Measure structural differences in adolescents with eating disorders and healthy controls.</measure>
    <time_frame>This is measured during scanning shortly after patient admittance to treatment, and one year later. Controls have their scans shortly after being recruited to the study, then again 1 year later.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine any structural differences, matlab will be used. With this one can upload the T1 structural scanning data and determine the volume of each subject's brain, and even compute the volume of each tissue (CBF, white matter and grey matter).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Develop knowledge of cognitive dysfunction in adolescents with eating disorders.</measure>
    <time_frame>The cognitive measures are conducted shortly after recruitment of the study. The subjects are given the questionnaires upon their first meeting, and are posted back to us shortly after.</time_frame>
    <description>Any cognitive dysfunction will be measured with a working memory task in the scanner (N-back task). Further, various clinical variables will be measured with the use of questionnaires such as Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rate Scale (MADRS), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), Barratts Impulsivity Scale (BIS), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI R), and Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine whether clinical variables can predict neural activity.</measure>
    <time_frame>The neural activity is measured during scanning shortly after subject recruitment, and one year later. The clinical measurements are measured with questionnaires given to them on their first meeting after recruitment, which are later posted back to us.</time_frame>
