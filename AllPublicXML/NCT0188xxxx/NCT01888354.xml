      This pilot study is designed as a prospective cohort study to determine whether standard
      subcutaneous (SQ) Highly-Purified (HP) Acthar Gel 14 days is superior to SQ HP Acthar Gel 5
      days in the treatment of relapses or attacks in multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Evaluations and treatment will be administered as an outpatient in the Neurology Clinic. Each
      subject will be seen for MS relapse or exacerbation in the Neurology Clinic during a routine
      or semi-emergent visit. Patients will be offered an FDA approved treatment (ACTHar Gel) for
      MS attacks under a standard 14 day SQ protocol (standard 14 day SQ protocol (80 IU x 14 days)
      or a 5 day SQ protocol - (5 day subcutaneous protocol (80 IU x 5 days). Both protocols are
      within package insert guidelines. The subjects will be evaluated for Extended Disability
      Status Scales (EDSS), a standardized measure of clinical status in MS and the initial visit
      and 28 days later (and 90 days later). We will compare the change in EDSS outcomes between
      day 0 and day 28 (day 90) to determine if the 14 days is superior to 5 day protocol may be
      clinically equivalent. Patients will also be evaluated for walking, upper extremity function
      (9 hole peg test), cognition and vision.

    <measure>Comparison of EDSS Mean Recovery between 5-day vs 14-day SQ 80 IU ACTHar Gel therapy groups</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days (with 90 day follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether a standard 14 day course of SQ 80 IU ACTHar Gel therapy might be superior (in twice as many patients) to treatment with 5 day SQ regimen for ACTHar Gel as determined by EDSS mean recovery from Day 0 (time of steroid therapy initiation) to Day 28 (and day 90).</description>

    <measure>Comparison of ambulation between the 5-day vs.14-day SQ 80 IU ACTHar Gel therapy groups</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days (with 90 day follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The ambulation index (AI) will be used for patients with long track (pyramidal) relapses, i.e. relapses with leg involvement. This is a standardized rating scale developed to assess mobility by evaluating the time and degree of assistance required to walk 25 feet.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of upper extremity function between the 5-day vs.14-day SQ 80 IU ACTHar Gel therapy groups</measure>
    <time_frame>28 day (with 90 follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>The nine-hole peg test (9HPT) will be used for patients with arm involvement during relapses. The 9-HPT is a brief, standardized, quantitative test of upper extremity function. This is a timed test to determine how long it takes the patient to quickly place nine pegs (one at a time) in a wooden box with 9 empty holes, and them remove them again (one at a time) as quickly as possible. Two consecutive trials with the dominant hand are immediately followed by two consecutive trials with the non-dominant hand.</description>

    <description>The patient global impression of change (PGI-Change) will be used in patients to compare subjective impressions of effectiveness between treatment groups</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare visual function between 5-day vs 14-day SQ 80 IU ACTHar Gel therapy groups</measure>
    <time_frame>28 day (with 90 day follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual function, as measured by low contrast Sloan sensitivity testing (LCSST) will be performed on each patient at baseline and at the end of treatment</description>

    <measure>Comparison of cognitive function between the 5-day vs 14-day SQ 80 IU ACTHar Gel therapy groups</measure>
    <time_frame>28 day (with 90 day follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>In patients who report cognitive deficits during relapse, the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT-3) will be used to assess and measure capacity and rate of information processing, and sustained and divided attention. This is a common neuropsychological test used in MS trials that involves working memory, attention and arithmetic capabilities. Patients will hear a series of recorded single-digit numbers at a rate of 1 per 3 seconds, and asked to add the number they just heard with the number they heard before.</description>

    <time_frame>28 Days (with 90 day follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Brain MRI scan Â± Gd will be performed on subjects at entry, day 28 and day 90. Qualitative assessments of changes in numbers of Gd+ lesions from entry to exit will be assessed.</description>

    <description>Peripheral mononuclear cells will be collected from patients at baseline,14 and 28 days post treatment and cytokine responses will be examined using a customized Human Cytokine Inflammatory Antibody Array including Th1-like (IL-2, IL-17, IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-1b), Th2-like cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13)</description>
