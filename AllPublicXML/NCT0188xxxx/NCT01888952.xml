      This is a Phase 0/1 open-label, non-randomized, biomarker and pharmacodynamic study in
      patients with advanced B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple
      myeloma (MM), Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), mantle cell lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have failed at least one prior therapy
      and for whom no standard curative therapy exists. Patients with advanced stage disease are
      those whose disease is resistant or refractory to standard chemotherapy or biological
      therapies.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate whether the administration of roflumilast inhibits the
      activity of PDE4 and results in the modulation of AKT/mTOR pathways in patients with B-cell
      hematologic malignancies. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for the purpose of
      determining the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers as related
      to GC resistance. Samples are obtained at baseline prior to starting study treatment, on Day
      8 before the administration of the Day 8 study drugs (prednisone and roflumilast), and on Day
      15. If a bone marrow biopsy is also performed prior to study treatment or at any time during
      treatment, a sample will be sent for analysis. Normal PBMC (and bone marrow when it is
      obtained) will be examined for changes in key targets related to the inhibition of PDE4 and
      potential reversal of glucocorticoid resistance. Biomarker blood samples will be analyzed in
      order to characterize the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast alone and in combination with
      prednisone on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers, such as phospho-AKT, phosphorylation levels of
      mTOR targets.

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Men and women &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Diagnosed with relapsed or refractory (per investigator assessment) B-cell hematologic
             malignancy, including CLL, SLL, ALL, MM, WM, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular
             lymphoma, or DLBCL that has progressed or recurred following prior therapy. Patients
             must have failed, refused, be ineligible, or not otherwise appropriate for any
             potential standard curative treatment. In addition, patients must be refractory to or
             intolerant of established therapy known to provide clinical benefit for their
             condition. The original diagnostic biopsy and/or other diagnostic data (e.g., cell
             marker data) will suffice.

          -  Has failed ≥ 1 previous treatment for their malignancy, and has relapsed or refractory
             disease following most recent prior treatment.

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 and a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Ability to swallow oral tablets without difficulty.

          -  All subjects with preserved reproductive potential must agree to practice abstinence
             or employ contraceptive measures for the duration of treatment and for 4 weeks
             following final dosing.

               -  Female subjects of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
                  test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic
                  gonadotropin ([hCG]) within 7 days of first day of drug dosing.

          -  Has recovered from adverse, toxic effects of prior therapies to ≤ Grade 1(NCI-CTCAE
             v4) except for alopecia and peripheral neuropathy. This requirement will be
             subordinate to specific clinical and laboratory criteria that are otherwise
             specifically addressed in these inclusion/exclusion criteria. Peripheral neuropathy
             must have recovered to ≤ Grade 2 except for patients with WM, who may enroll with
             Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy if due to the underlying WM.

          -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000/uL, patients may be transfused to this value.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/uL, with or without chronic granulocyte growth
             factor support

          -  Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL, patients may be transfused to this value

        For patients with ALL and CLL:

             considered as &gt;20 mg of dexamethasone a day (or equivalent) for &gt;7 consecutive days.

          -  Uncontrolled illness including but not limited to: symptomatic congestive heart
             failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV heart failure), unstable

          -  Other medical or psychiatric illness or organ dysfunction, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, would either compromise the subject's safety or interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety of the study agent.

          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation (defined as a QTc &gt;450 msec for males and

Prednisone: Patients may receive additional courses of treatment with prednisone (and roflumilast) at the discretion of the investigator if they did not experience unacceptable toxicity and have stable disease or objectively responding disease.
