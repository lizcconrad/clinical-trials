      The primary aims of this study are to:

        1. Quantify serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding potential (BP) in vivo in bipolar
           disorder patients (BPD) during a major depressive episode (MDE).

        2. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HTT.

        3. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HT1A BP.

        4. Assess the effect of lamotrigine treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HTT and 5-HT1A BP.

        5. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of unipolar depression on 5-HTT BP.

      PET and MRI imaging will be used to investigate the aims described above in patients who have
      bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and are currently experiencing a depressive episode.
      Both healthy controls and depressed participants with bipolar disorder or unipolar depression
      will be recruited. Patients who are on medication before enrolling in the study will have a
      three week washout. At baseline, healthy controls and patients will have an MRI consisting of
      both structural and functional sequences. Psychological measures will also be obtained at
      baseline. Within one week of the MRI, both patients and healthy controls will have one CUMI
      and one DASB PET scan.

      Following the baseline PET scans, patient participants will begin medication treatment with
      either lithium or lamotrigine, based on the clinical judgement of the treating psychiatrist.
      Psychological measures will be obtained every 2 weeks. After 6 weeks of medication treatment
      at a therapeutic dose, patients will be assessed for remission (defined as a 50% decrease in
      the HDRS score from baseline). If this criteria is met, patient participants will then have
      follow-up PET scans (one CUMI and one DASB). If this criteria is not met, the patient will be
      switched to the other medication under study and will be reevaluated after an additional 4
      weeks of medication treatment. Patients who still do not demonstrate a 50% decrease in their
      HDRS will be considered non-responders and will have repeat CUMI and DASB scans.

    <description>Patients will have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score obtained at baseline; participants must have an HDRS score of at least 15 to be eligible. After 6 weeks of medication treatment, the HDRS score will be reevaluated. Participants who have a 50% or greater decrease in their HDRS score will be considered responders and will proceed to the repeat PET scans.</description>
