      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of everolimus in
      combination with reduced tacrolimus, compared to tacrolimus control, in living donor liver
      transplant recipients.

      This study is 24 month, multicenter study in 280 living donor liver transplant patients from
      Asia, Europe and Canada. The study also have an long term extension in Japan and
      approximately 28 patients will be included to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of
      concentration-controlled everolimus regimen plus reduced tacrolimus compared to standard
      tacrolimus in recipients of living donor liver transplants in Japan who have participated in
      the CRAD001H2307 study.
