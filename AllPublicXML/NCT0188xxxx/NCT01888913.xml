  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - We are studying people s psychological experiences and how these relate to the way people
      respond have when they see information communicated in different ways. We are testing
      multiple research questions in this research.

      Objectives:

      - To learn about how to design future research studies. Also to learn about how to best give
      people information about health topics.

      Eligibility:

      - Women with a Body Mass Index of 25 or higher.

      Design:

        -  Before the study visit, participants will answer some questions online about themselves,
           their experiences, and their thoughts about their weight.

        -  During the study visit, participants will watch a short scene from a movie, and then
           answer questions about it.

        -  Participants will have a simulated doctor visit with a computerized, virtual reality
           doctor. They will answer more questions about themselves, their experiences, and their
           thoughts about their weight. Then they will answer questions with researchers.
