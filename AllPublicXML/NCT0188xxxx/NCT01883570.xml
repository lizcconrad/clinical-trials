      Currently, teaching X-ray interpretation to medical students is not standardized, and is
      generally not very effective.

      Objective: The goal of our study is to evaluate whether directly teaching an expert search
      strategy for x-ray interpretation to 3d year medical students is effective.

      Methods:

        -  An expert's visual search strategy was recorded using a gaze-tracking device. The search
           strategy was then reproduced using a dynamic cursor moving across the corresponding
           chest x-ray, and incorporated into a teaching program accessible via the internet.

        -  Participants are 3rd year medical students who will be randomized into two groups. The
           experimental group will have access to the teaching program as described. The control
           group will have access to the same x-rays but not the expert's search strategy.

        -  At the end of the study period the investigators will collect performance data (the
           participants' accuracy at reading a series of chest x-rays) and process data (using
           gaze-tracking to evaluate the participants' search strategies); the experimental and
           control groups will be compared.

      Expected results:

      The investigators expect the group trained in expert search strategy to show improved
      accuracy at reading chest x-rays, and an improvement in their visual search strategy

    <description>participants enrolled in the experimental group will be trained to learn the expert's search strategy for reading a chest x-ray. We hypothesize that by the end of the study period they will show an improved visual search strategy over students who were not trained in visual search but were taught through standard methods (interaction with clinician-educators during their clerkship rotations)</description>
