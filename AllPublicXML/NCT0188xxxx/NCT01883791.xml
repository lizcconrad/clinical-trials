  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 40% of patients in mental health treatment settings engage in hazardous alcohol
      and/or drug use. One model of intervention that has been shown effective in medical settings
      to reduce alcohol use and/or promote engagement in addiction treatment is screening, brief
      intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT). Despite the effectiveness of SBIRT for risky
      alcohol use in medical settings, there has been no research on the effectiveness of SBIRT in
      mental health treatment settings. Given the proportionately large number of mental health
      patients who also engage in hazardous substance use, research is needed to find an
      appropriate and effective substance use intervention for patients in these settings.

      The proposed study uses a randomized controlled trial to examine the extent to which the
      World Health Organization's SBIRT model, the ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance
      Involvement Screening Test) and its associated brief behavioral intervention, leads to
      reductions in substances prevalent in mental health settings: alcohol, cannabis and
      stimulants (i.e., cocaine and methamphetamine). The study will also examine the effect of
      SBIRT on improvement in psychiatric symptoms, improved quality of life and for those whose
      level of substance misuse indicates a need for treatment, initiation and engagement into SUD
      treatment services. Eligible participants will be mental health patients who report any past
      year use of cannabis or stimulants or at least one heavy drinking day in the past year.
      Mental health patients (N=750) who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled and randomly
      assigned to either the SBIRT intervention condition or to a health education attention
      control condition. Participants will be assessed at baseline on substance use, psychiatric
      symptoms and quality of life. Each participant will be assessed at 3-, 6- and 12- month
      follow up points for alcohol and drug use, involvement in SUD treatment services, severity of
      psychiatric symptoms and quality of life. If successful this study will yield valuable new
      knowledge about the effectiveness of SBIRT in mental health treatment settings and will
      promote improved well being of mental health patients. Further, the study will provide
      evidence on the effectiveness of SBIRT for reducing illicit drug use. Results from this
      research will be used as the basis for broader dissemination and of SBIRT in mental health
      settings.

      Research Design and Methods The proposed 5-year study is a randomized, controlled trial of
      screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol, cannabis and
      stimulant use in mental health treatment settings. These 3 substances have been chosen as the
      focus for the proposed study because (a) in the US alcohol and cannabis are the most common
      substances used by individuals with serious mental illness in the general population1 and (b)
      stimulant use (in particular, methamphetamine) is a significant public health threat in the
      US. 31,32 The SBIRT model will be tested in a two-group design in which eligible participants
      (N=750) will be randomly assigned to either the SBIRT intervention condition (N=375) or to a
      control condition (N=375) that offers an informational leaflet. The participants will
      comprise male and female mental health patients who have a positive pre-screen for being at
      risk of having or developing a substance use disorder. The performance site for the study
      will be publicly-funded mental health clinics in Ventura County, California. All participants
      (intervention and control groups) will receive mental health care as usual and their
      participation in the study will in no way reduce the level of usual care they receive.

      The SBIRT condition will include the WHO's Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement
      Screening Test (ASSIST) and its accompanying brief intervention that uses motivational
      interviewing techniques to provide feedback, emphasize personal responsibility, give advice,
      provide a menu of options, convey empathy, and promote self-efficacy.33,34 All participants
      in the SBIRT condition will complete the ASSIST as an interview. Based on the results of the
      ASSIST, participants who score in the moderate-risk range for alcohol, cannabis or a
      stimulant will immediately receive a 15-minute brief intervention. Participants who score in
      the high-risk range for one of these substances will receive the brief intervention and a
      referral to a substance abuse treatment facility for further assessment and rehabilitative
      care. Referral to treatment will be an active intervention and is described below in
      'Description of Study Conditions'. We expect that few patients will score in the low-risk
      range on the ASSIST because the pre-screen for the study (described below in 'Recruitment of
      Participants and Randomization') should exclude most of these individuals. In the event that
      any individuals enroll in the study and score in the low-risk range on the ASSIST, their data
      will be excluded from analysis and they will not be counted toward the target enrollment for
      the study.

      The baseline assessment will occur prior to randomization. Research assistants will
      administer the assessments in-person at each clinic. Clinical social workers (English and
      Spanish speaking) will conduct the SBIRT intervention with patients. Follow-up assessments
      will occur at 3-, 6- and 12-months post baseline.

      Project Timeline Table 1 summarizes the main study activities across the 5 years of the
      project. The research and clinical facilities are in place, but a start-up period of 6 months
      will be needed to complete the IRB application and approval process, develop data collection
      templates, train staff and finalize the study protocols and procedures. As shown below in
      Table 1, subject recruitment will begin in month 7 and extend for 36 months. The timetable
      for the project is based on an enrollment of 30 participants per month. This rate of
      recruitment is feasible based on consultations with the mental health treatment sites and
      will allow for recruitment of 750 participants into the study. As Table 1 shows, the timeline
      provides adequate time to collect 12-month follow-up data and conduct data analysis.

    <description>The TLFB will be used to determine days of use for alcohol and drugs over the 90-day period prior to the baseline assessment. The interviewer will guide the participant to identify the number of standard drinks consumed each day, starting from the day immediately before the assessment and moving backwards in time. Days on which cannabis and/or stimulants were used will also be queried. Variables calculated from the interview will include: (1) total standard drinks, (2) drinking frequency, (3) heavy-drinking frequency (5+ for men; 4+ for women), (4) maximum quantity of alcohol consumed, (5) number of days using cannabis, (6) number of days using cocaine, (7) number of days using methamphetamine, and (8) days on which any alcohol, cannabis or stimulant was used. This measure is completed at 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline in order to measure change from one timepoint to the next.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria. Participants who:

          -  (1)have affective disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymia, Bipolar Disorder) or
             psychotic disorder (Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective, or Psychotic Disorder Not
             Otherwise Specified),

          -  (2) have any use of cannabis or stimulants in the past year or a heavy drinking day
             (5+/4+ drinks for men/women) in the past year,

          -  (3) are 18 years or older,

          -  (4) have a stable living situation (i.e., has not been homeless during the past two
             years),

          -  (5) are not under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs at the time of enrollment and

          -  (6) have not received substance abuse treatment within the past year.

        Exclusion Criteria. Patients who:

          -  (1) have received any substance abuse treatment in the past year will be excluded
             because exposure to addiction treatment may confound the effects of the SBIRT
             intervention.

          -  (2) have Opiate and opioid use because we cannot guarantee access to appropriate
             pharmacotherapies (e.g., suboxone or methadone).
