  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the active interventions (exercise or
      wellness/support intervention) compared to usual care on the prevention of postpartum
      depression among women at risk for depression. The investigators will also examine the
      efficacy of an exercise intervention compared to a wellness/support intervention on
      postpartum depressive symptoms among women at risk for depression.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of exercise and wellness/support
      interventions for preventing postpartum depression. Specifically, 450 sedentary postpartum
      women (2-6 weeks postpartum) with a history of depression prior to pregnancy will be
      randomized to one of three groups each lasting six months: (1) telephone-based exercise
      intervention; (2) telephone-based wellness/support intervention; or (3) usual care.
      Participants will also complete a follow-up assessment session at 9 months. Participants will
      be recruited via online, email, and print advertisements. The investigators will obtain
      healthcare provider consent for each participant prior to randomization. The exercise
      intervention will consist of a theory-based telephone intervention shown to increase exercise
      among postpartum women in a previous study (Lewis et al., 2011). The wellness/support
      condition will be on the same schedule as the exercise intervention and will address several
      topics related to wellness. The usual care condition will receive their choice of the
      exercise or wellness/support condition upon completion of their final assessment. The primary
      dependent variable will be depression as measured by the Structured Clinical Interview for
      DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
      Exercise adherence will be assessed using the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Interview and
      the ActiGraph (i.e., an accelerometer, an objective measure of exercise).
