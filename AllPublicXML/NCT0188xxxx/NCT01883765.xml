  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback training (NFT) has been frequently investigated as an alternative treatment for
      ADHD mainly in children and adolescents. However, randomized double-blind trials that include
      a sham-neurofeedback control group are lacking, as well as studies examining the efficacy of
      NFT in adult ADHD populations. The inclusion of a sham-neurofeedback group is crucial to
      monitor and exclude unspecific effects.

      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of NFT as compared to a sham-feedback condition
      and a cognitive behavioral treatment in adults with persistent ADHD.

      Efficacy is assessed on several outcome parameters, such as symptom severity,
      neuropsychological variables (e.g., attention, memory), and EEG parameters.
