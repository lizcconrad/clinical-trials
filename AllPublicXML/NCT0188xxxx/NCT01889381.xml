    <textblock>
      Background: The human face is critically important for breathing, eating, seeing, and
      speaking/ communicating, but its most important job may be to look like a human face.
      Devastating facial deformities often cause affected individuals to avoid human contact and
      disappear from society. Although current surgical advancements can somewhat restore facial
      defects, this process often requires many operations and the resulting face only resembles
      the human face. To date, over 20 face transplants have been performed with highly encouraging
      functional and aesthetic results, but widespread clinical use has been limited due to the
      adverse effects of life-long and high-dose immunosuppression needed to prevent graft
      rejection. Risks include infection, cancer, and metabolic problems, all of which can greatly
      affect recipients' quality of life, make the procedure riskier, and jeopardize the potential
      benefits of face transplantation.

      Study Design: This non-randomized, Phase II clinical trial will document the use of a new
      immunomodulatory protocol (aka - Pittsburgh Protocol, Starzl Protocol) for establishing face
      transplantation as a safe and effective reconstructive treatment for devastating injuries/
      defects by minimizing maintenance immunosuppression therapy in face transplant patients. This
      protocol combines lymphocyte depletion with donor bone marrow cell infusion and has enabled
      graft survival using low doses of a single immunosuppressive drug followed by weaning of
      treatment. Initially designed for living-related solid organ donation, this regimen has been
      adapted for use with grafts donated by deceased donors. The investigators propose to perform
      15 full or partial human face transplants employing this novel protocol.

      Specific Aims: 1) To establish face transplantation as a safe and effective reconstructive
      strategy for the treatment of devastating facial injuries/defects; 2) To reduce the risk of
      rejection and enable allograft survival while minimizing the requirement for long-term,
      high-dose, multi-drug immunosuppression.

      Significance of Research: Face transplantation could help injured individuals recover
      functionality, self-esteem, and the ability to reintegrate into family and social life as
      &quot;whole&quot; individuals. This protocol offers the potential for minimizing the morbidity of
      maintenance immunosuppression, thereby beneficially shifting the risk/benefit ratio of this
      life-enhancing procedure and enabling a wider clinical application of face transplantation.

    <description>This protocol uses a novel bone marrow cell-based therapy for composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) rather than conventional triple-drug immunosuppression to facilitate long-term graft survival of deceased donor human faces under low-dose maintenance immunosuppression. Initial T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab is followed by upper extremity transplantation and tacrolimus maintenance therapy. Donor bone marrow cells are infused on Day 10 (±4 days) post-transplantation to elicit a host alloimmune response triggering exhaustion and deletion of the respective host (anti-donor) lymphocyte clones. Subsequently, tacrolimus therapy is given for at least 6 months before spaced weaning is considered in stable recipients.</description>
