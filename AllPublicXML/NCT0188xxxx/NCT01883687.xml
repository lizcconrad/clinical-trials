      Objectives: The aims of this study are (1) to define the effectiveness of functional nasal
      surgery during Le Fort I osteotomy on nasal obstruction through objective as well as
      subjective evaluations, (2) to determine guideline for concomitant functional nasal surgery
      with Le Fort I osteotomy, and (3) to explore possible mechanisms by which functional nasal
      surgery may reduce nasal obstruction severity.

      Design: A prospective, single-blnd, randomized trial. Setting: Chang Gung Craniofacial Center
      and Department of Otolaryngology (ENT). Patients: A total of 80 Taiwanese patients with
      unilateral cleft lip and palate and dentofacial deformity (age &gt;16 for females, &gt;18 for
      males; 40 in experimental and 40 in control groups) Interventions: In the experimental group,
      all patients will receive Le Fort I osteotomy and septoplasty. In the control group, all
      patients will receive Le Fort I osteotomy only.

      Measurements: All patients will undergo history taking, clinical examination,
      radioallergosorbent (RAST) examination (before surgery), standard questionnaire and image
      examination before surgery, one week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. To reduce
      radiation exposure, cone-beam CT will only be performed before surgery and one week, 12 and
      24 months after surgery.

      Data Analysis: Independent t and chi-squared tests, correlation coefficients and repeated
      measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used. Statistical significance is assumed for a
      p value of less than 0.05.

      Key Words: cleft lip palate, nasal septum deviation, Le Fort I osteotomy, septoplasty,
      effectiveness
