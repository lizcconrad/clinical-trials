  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population continues to increase in weight. Currently there are no guidelines in the
      dosing of cefazolin for the obese population. Standard dosing of cefazolin 2 grams for
      patients &lt;120 kg and 3 grams for patients &gt;120 kg is used as the dose for surgical
      prophylaxis. This makes no provisions for weight based dosing. There has been some recent
      data which states this might not be enough for the obese patients. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine if weight based dosing (30 mg/kg) of cefazolin as surgical
      prophylaxis for patients undergoing elective gastric bypass/laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric
      bypass provides appropriate serum concentrations for a larger percentage of time than the
      current method of giving the standard 2 or 3 gram doses of cefazolin peri-operatively. The
      concentration of cefazolin in tissue will also be measured to help assess this question.

    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that customary doses of antibiotics, when administered for
      perioperative surgical prophylaxis, are insufficient to achieve adequate antibiotic
      concentrations in blood and tissues of morbidly obese patients (defined as a BMI greater than
      40 kg/m2) and that these patients are therefore placed at high risk of surgical wound
      infections and poor clinical outcomes. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin commonly
      used for perioperative surgical prophylaxis in colorectal, abdominal, bariatric, gynecologic
      and obstetric, or orthopedic total joint arthroplasty surgical procedures. Previous cefazolin
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis in obese patients led to conflicting results and
      recommendations. It is not clearly know to what extent the pharmacokinetics of cefazolin in
      morbidly obese patients differ from those of non-obese patients. Specific dosing guidelines
      are then lacking. The main objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of
      cefazolin in morbidly obese after administrations of a standard recommended 2-3 g dose or a
      weight-base 30-mg/kg dose

    <description>Since the goal of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is to achieve free (unbound) serum and tissue drug levels that exceed the MIC for likely pathogens across the duration of the surgical procedure, and since redosing of cefazolin is recommended every 3-4 hours, PK/PD performance of cefazolin over that time frame will be analyzed. For the purposes of this study, pharmacodynamic targets are defined as fT&gt;MIC (time during which free drug concentrations exceed pathogen MICs) of 100% over periods of up to 4 hours in duration. The PK/PD probability of target attainment (PTA) for pharmacodynamic goals and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for both cefazolin regimens will be compared. A PTA of ≥90% and a CFR of ≥ 90% for a dosage regimen (i.e., predicted to meet pharmacodynamic targets in ≥ 90% of the total bacterial population across the full range of MICs) are considered optimum.</description>
