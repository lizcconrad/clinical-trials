  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of breast cancer through screening has been a common practice in the United
      States and several European countries for decades.It is effective in reducing the mortality
      of breast cancer and improving the postoperative quality of life of patients. Mammography has
      been the standard imaging method for the screening, and in recent years, a supplemental
      ultrasound exam is also recommended.A prospective, multi-center, randomized trial is needed
      to define an optimal screening strategy that suits Chinese women and the socioeconomics of
      China.
