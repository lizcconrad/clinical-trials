    <textblock>
      A Phase I open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to a drug),
      safety and tolerability of a single dose of Sativex (containing 10.8 mg tetrahydrocannabinol
      [THC] and 10 mg cannabidiol [CBD]) in healthy patients and those with hepatic (liver)
