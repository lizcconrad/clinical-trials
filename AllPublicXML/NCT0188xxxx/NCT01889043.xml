  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has already shown to improve survival and quality of life in
      patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Quality of sleep seems already to be
      impaired in patients with preserved diaphragmatic dysfunction. Until now, only few research
      has been performed on the quality of sleep in patients with ALS when using NIV, and these
      data are mainly based on patient reported outcomes.Further on, only very little research has
      been done on patient-ventilator interaction.

      Our study would like to perform research on quality of sleep before and after NIV use by
      using full polysomnography with incorporation of transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement
      and built-in ventilator software.

    <description>Search for an optimal titration protocol. Aim is to reduce transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) below 55 mmHg and to reduce central and obstructive respiratory events to a minimum. This will be assessed by performance of a nocturnal measurement of transcutaneous CO2 and full polysomnography at eacht time point.</description>

    <description>The following asynchronies will be evaluated: auto-triggering, double triggering, ineffective effort, prolonged insufflation. The impact of leaks will also be evaluated.Data will be reported as events/hour of sleep. This will be assessed by full polysomnography at each time point.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ALS (according to El Escorial criteria) who are planned to start to use
             NIV, objectivated by a decreased inspiratory muscle force with a restrictive pulmonary
             function and

               1. symptoms of nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation or

               2. increased daytime arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO2)(&gt; 45 mmHg) or

               3. a â‰¥ 10 mmHg increase in transcutaneous PCO2 during sleep in comparison to a
                  normal awake supine value

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &lt; 18 years

          -  Patients not willing to start NIV
