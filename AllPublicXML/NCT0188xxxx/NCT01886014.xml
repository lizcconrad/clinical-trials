      Placebo responses contribute to medical treatment outcome. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether a single intranasal application of oxytocin can increase the placebo
      response in an experimental model of placebo analgesia in healthy volunteers.

      Placebo responses contribute to medical treatment outcome. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether a single intranasal application of oxytocin can increase the placebo
      response in an experimental model of placebo analgesia in healthy volunteers.

      The rationale to study the effects of oxytocin on placebo analgesia is based on previous
      studies showing that oxytocin fosters processes such as empathy, trust and social learning,
      which are key elements of the patient-physician relationship that is pivotal to placebo
      responses. In this experimental mechanisms study we used oxytocin as a tool to modulate these
      factors.

      Placebo analgesia is induced verbal instruction. Therefore two identically looking placebo
      ointments were applied to two sites of the participants' volar forearm. The ointments were
      introduced as a local anesthetic that could reduce or even abolish pain (placebo) and a
      control cream (control), respectively.
