  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a crossover, pilot trial examining the acute effects of standing on blood sugar
      in prediabetic, working adults. Participants will complete oral glucose tolerance testing,
      once while sitting and once while standing. They will also wear a continuous blood sugar
      monitor once while sitting at their desk for a week and once while using their desk as a
      sit-stand desk with a goal of standing intermittently for at least half of the work day.
      Physical activity levels will be measured with an accelerometer. The primary study hypothesis
      is that blood sugar will differ between the sitting and standing conditions for each of the
      tests performed.

    <description>An OGTT is performed while the subject sits at their desk for the entire 2-hour period. 5 blood sugar measurements are taken and a 75g dextrose beverage is consumed following the first, baseline blood sugar reading. The blood sugar is then measured every 30 minutes up to 120 min.</description>

    <description>A continuous blood glucose monitor is worn for 5 days while at work. In the sitting condition the participant only sits at their desk for the duration of the week. Blood sugar is monitored 4 times per day to calibrate the CGM and an accelerometer is worn to track physical activity.</description>
