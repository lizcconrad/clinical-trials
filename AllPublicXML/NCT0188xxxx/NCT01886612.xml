  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a life threatening condition and a serious concern among
      hospitalized patients, with death occurring in approximately 6% of cases. It involves the
      formation of a clot where stagnant blood flow occurs, predominantly in the deep veins of the
      legs. Three mechanisms underlie DVT, venous stasis (slowing or stopping of the blood),
      hypercoagulability (increased clotting) and damage to blood vessel endothelium (damage to
      blood vessel wall), collectively known as Virchow's triad.

      Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) have
      been shown to improve lower limb blood flow. However, few studies have directly compared the
      two methods and those that have, have used dated NMES techniques.

      The objective of this study is to compare the two methods in terms of blood flow.

      Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a life threatening condition and a serious concern among
      hospitalized patients, with death occurring in approximately 6% of cases. It involves the
      formation of a clot where stagnant blood flow occurs, predominantly in the deep veins of the
      legs. Three mechanisms underlie DVT, venous stasis (slowing or stopping of the blood),
      hypercoagulability (increased clotting) and damage to blood vessel endothelium (damage to
      blood vessel wall), collectively known as Virchow's triad.

      Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) involves the use of an inflatable cuff placed around
      the limb. This cuff inflates and deflates intermittently in order to squeeze blood from the
      underlying veins. Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) leads to a contraction of
      muscles by delivering a series of controlled electrical pulses via skin surface electrodes
      placed over the motor points of the targeted muscle.

      Both IPC and NMES have been shown to improve lower limb blood flow. However, few studies have
      directly compared the two methods and those that have, have used dated NMES techniques.

      The objective of this study is to compare the two methods in terms of lower limb
      haemodynamics.

    <description>Doppler measurements must be taken for each of the interventions. The measurement site of interest is the popliteal vein, located at the lateral aspect of the knee, below the sapheno-popliteal junction. Peak venous velocity, time averaged mean velocity, vein cross-sectional area and volume flow are required. A minimum of 3 measurements per intervention is required for rigor. Do not take any measurement within the first minute of the intervention</description>

    <description>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is to be applied using a custom-built, two-channel stimulator (Duo-STIM (stimulator), Bioelectronics Research Cluster, National University of Ireland, Galway) with a frequency of 36 Hz, a balanced biphasic waveform with a pulse width of 350Î¼s, a ramp up time of 500ms, a contraction time of 1s and a ramp down time of 500ms. Stimulation is to be applied every 20 seconds over a period of 5 minutes.
Intermittent pneumatic compression is to be applied using the Novamedix A-V Impulse System Model 6000 (Novamedix distribution Limited, England), programmed to deliver compression every 20 seconds at a pressure of 130 mmHg for a 1 second duration over a period of 5 minutes.</description>
