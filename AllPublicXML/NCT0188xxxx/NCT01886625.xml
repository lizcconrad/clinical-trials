      Background of the study: CRPS type-1 is a pain syndrome that usually develops after an
      initiating noxious event (e.g. fracture) in an extremity. Although treatment options life
      dimethyl-sulphoxide (DMSO), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and intensive physical therapy exist, the
      treatment effect is often unsatisfactory, even leading to amputation of the extremity.
      Surgical treatment of chronic pain disorders by dividing the sympathetic chain is an
      established treatment. Its more invasive nature has prevented widespread application. After
      introduction of minimal invasive techniques in recent years, the UMCG has now devised a truly
      minimal invasive, yet safe and effective thoracoscopic technique, that requires only a single
      1 cm long incision in the anterior axillary line. This technique is developed as treatment
      for primary focal axillary and palmar hyperhidrosis, and is performed in over 50 patients
      producing very satisfying results. This fact has led to the hypothesis that this same
      surgical technique can offer this group of chronic pain patients a safe, effective treatment
      modality.

      Objective of the study: The effect of the intervention on pain an regain of function in de
      affected extremity. This will be quantified in multiple questionnaires at baseline and three
      follow-up points, and by clinical evaluation of the hand function at baseline and two
      follow-up points.
