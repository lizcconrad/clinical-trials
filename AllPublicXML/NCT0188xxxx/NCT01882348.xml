  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a Randomized Controlled Trial designed to test the sustainability of a
      previously developed, tested, effectively implemented tobacco control strategy—the CEASE
      intervention, employing state of the art tobacco dependence treatment for parents who smoke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CEASE intervention works within existing systems of care to address parental smoking.
      Based on national guidelines and extensive qualitative research obtained in pilot testing,
      elements of CEASE can be tailored to work with particular practices' staffing, resources, and
      physical configuration. CEASE integrates evidence-based tobacco-use screening, cessation
      assistance, and referral to outside services into visits with families in pediatric clinics.
      Elements include (1) Identification of smokers and self-assessment of quitting preferences;
      (2) Counseling (brief motivational messaging elements include collaborative goal setting, set
      quit date, personal barriers to quitting, problem-solving strategies, implementing smoke-free
      homes and cars, and social support, strategies shown to increase satisfaction with the
      pediatric visit.(3) Medication (NRT prescription and free 1 week supply (while supplies
      last)—including for those cutting down to quit as recommended in latest guidelines); (4)
      Quitline enrollment via faxed enrollment form; and (5) Review of CEASE action sheets at each
      visit until the family is smoke-free. We train practices in the adoption, implementation, and
      maintenance of the intervention. A more detailed training manual discusses additional
      in-depth strategies for maximizing billing and reimbursement, materials for seasonal
      cessation opportunities and supporting employees' own cessation efforts.
