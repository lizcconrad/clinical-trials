    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess, in adults 18 years of age and above, the
      immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the seasonal influenza vaccine, Fluarix/Influsplit SSW
      2013/2014, containing the three vaccine influenza strains (two A strains and one B strain)
      for the 2013/2014 season.

          <title>Mean Geometric Increase (MGI) for Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibody Titer Against Each of the Three Vaccine Influenza Strains.</title>
          <description>MGI was defined as the fold increase in serum HI GMTs post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination (Day 0). The vaccine strains assessed were Flu A/Christchurch/16/2010 (H1N1), Flu A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) and Flu B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (Yamagata). This outcome measure was assessed by influenza vaccination status in subjects (18-60 years and &gt;60 years) who had and who had not received an influenza vaccine during the 2 influenza seasons prior to season 2012/2013.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available and subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination.</population>

        <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were arthralgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgia, shivering, increased sweating and fever [axillary temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)].
