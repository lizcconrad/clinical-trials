  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be administered experimental
      malaria vaccines. One group of volunteers will receive vaccination with the leading malaria
      vaccine candidate, RTS,S/AS01. This vaccine schedule will consist of 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01
      with an interval of 4 weeks between doses (Doses given at 0,4 and 8 week timepoints). Another
      group will receive a vaccination schedule composed of the same dosage and timing regimen of
      RTS,S, but they will also receive vaccination with ChAd63 ME-TRAP, 2 weeks after the first
      RTS,S followed 8 weeks later by vaccination with MVA ME-TRAP (2 and 10 week timepoints).

      The study will assess the safety of the vaccinations, and the immune responses to
      vaccination. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples. Volunteers will be
      infected with malaria by mosquito bites, 12 weeks after the first vaccination. In addition, a
      group of volunteers not receiving vaccines will also be infected with malaria by the same
      method. These infection experiments will be used to assess vaccine efficacy: how well the
      vaccines act to prevent malaria disease. A further single volunteer may also be infected with
      malaria; this volunteer participated in a previous trial where they received vaccines and was
      completely protected against malaria disease after infection by mosquito bite.

      The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine is a protein (RTS,S) mixed with an adjuvant (AS01). The ChAd63 ME-TRAP
      and MVA ME-TRAP vaccines are called viral vectored vaccines. They are made from viruses which
      are modified so that they can not multiply. The viruses have extra DNA in them so that after
      injection, the body makes malaria proteins (but malaria does not develop), so that the immune
      system builds a response to malaria without having been infected by it.

      Healthy volunteers will be recruited in England at three research sites: in Oxford, London
      and Southampton.
