  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant data exists to suggest that lipid emulsion administration in the setting of local
      anesthetic toxicity has the potential to be life-saving. Unfortunately, a variety of
      potential barriers exist to routine lipid emulsion administration for those performing
      regional anesthesia including drug availability, drug cost and drug location. Inadequate
      training or lack of established protocols also have the potential to negatively impact
      patient outcomes. A previous study by Toledo et al (Availability of lipid emulsion in United
      States obstetric units. Anesth Analg 2013;116:406-408.) evaluated lipid emulsion availability
      on obstetric units and found that it was nearly universally available.

      The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) publishes a list of contact
      information for each anesthesia institution that engages in resident training. Investigators
      will contact these institutions by phone or email to obtain contact information for their
      regional anesthesia program director. In the absence of a program director, investigators
      will send a survey and consent information via email to the faculty physician most involved
      in regional anesthesia. Survey completion instructions (survey itself to be completed on
      Qualtrics Survey Hosting Service) and copy of the study consent form will be attached to the
      initial contact email. The study consent form will contain a description of the study itself.
      Survey participants will be allowed time to complete their survey in private at their
      discretion. Non-responders will receive two follow-up emails at one month intervals.
