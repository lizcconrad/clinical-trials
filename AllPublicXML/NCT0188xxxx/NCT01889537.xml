  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to see whether a low dose of ketamine, a medication used to
      reduce pain, enhances the effectiveness of a virtual reality video game, which is used as a
      form of distraction from pain during a painful burn care procedure.

      This study is conducted in a hospital setting. It is a randomized controlled trial comparing
      the use of virtual reality distraction (VRD) and standard pain medications to the use of VRD,
      standard pain medications and a single low dose of ketamine as a means to reduce pain during
      a painful procedure in patients in the hospital.
