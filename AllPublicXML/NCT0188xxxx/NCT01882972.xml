  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a robust literature on the benefits of exercise for cancer survivors, most of the
      research to date falls in two primary areas - aerobic exercise and breast cancer survivors.
      The focus on aerobic training alone is a concern as resistance training is critical for
      building the muscle mass necessary to maintain physical function. However, concerns have been
      raised about the potential for higher than tolerated adverse event rates during resistance
      training, particularly that which is unsupervised, despite a history of safe use of
      resistance training in other chronically diseased patient populations. The aim of this pilot
      study is to demonstrate the feasibility, safety and quality of life benefit of a home-based
      resistance-training program among colorectal cancer survivors. The investigators will recruit
      n=30 men and women with stage I-III colon cancer. Participants will be randomized to a
      home-based exercise intervention that combines aerobic and resistance exercise. Control arm
      participants will receive a home-based meditation program.

      The investigators will recruit n=30 patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer and randomize
      them to a 12-week resistance training intervention with Theraband and existing evidence-
      based materials or attention control using a meditation intervention. Using an electronic
      survey tool, patients will complete a baseline questionnaire on key outcomes (quality of
      life, fatigue, side effects) and potential confounders and will consent to a medical record
      review. These will also be assessed via at 4 weeks post randomization and 12 weeks post
      randomization. Participants in the intervention group will receive one-time in person
      instruction in the exercises derived from the existing evidence base of home-based resistance
      training programs for older adults and cancer survivors. They will be sent home with a book
      demonstrating the exercises, a log and a set of appropriate resistance bands. Weekly
      follow-up calls will occur for the duration of the intervention and updates on the call
      results will be provided to the colon cancer clinic nurse so that care is integrated.
      Participants in the attention control group will be mailed a meditation CD. Follow-up in the
      control group will parallel that of the intervention group, with weekly calls.
