      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory
      into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to
      kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is to study genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with CD138 positive multiple myeloma that is relapsed (after stem cell
      transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to further chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-CD138 vector (referred to as CART-138 cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-138 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood and bone marrow will be used to detect and
      quantify survival of CART-138 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-myeloma response due to CART-138 cell
      infusions.

      II. To determine if the CD137 transgene is superior to the TCR zeta only transgene as
      measured by the relative engraftment levels of CART-138 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells
      over time.

      III. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-138 cells in bone marrow.

      IV. For patients with stored or accessible myeloma cells, determine myeloma cell killing by
      CART-138 cells in vitro.

      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD138, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-138 (loss of engraftment).

      VI. Determine the relative subsets of CART-138 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.

      Patients receive anti-CD138-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling
      domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects with CD138 positive multiple myeloma in patients with no
             available curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic SCT) who have
             limited prognosis (several months to &lt; 2 year survival) with currently available
             therapies will be enrolled.

          -  CD138 positive multiple myeloma CR can not be achieved after at least 4 prior
             combination chemotherapy regimens.
