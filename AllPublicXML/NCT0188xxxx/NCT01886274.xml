  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine has been described as one of the most common neurological diseases, with high social
      and economic impact. Despite the high prevalence, the pathophysiology of migraine is still
      unknown, several studies have been developed in order to advance the understanding of the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease which are not yet entirely elucidated. The aim
      of this study is to observe the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),
      applied in the visual cortex, on neurophysiological and clinical measures (frequency,
      intensity, duration of attacks and severity of pain) in migraine patients.

    <time_frame>At baseline,1 month, 2 months, 3 months/ per session - at baseline and 30 minutes (after tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-cm circular coil was used that has giving a peak magnetic field strength of 2 tesla. Subjects were asked to wear a blindfold, sit comfortably in a chair and to close their eyes to diminish ambient light.In sagittal line, three points were scored: 2, 3 and 4 cm above the inion. The single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to one of the points scored and the subject was asked to report the presence or absence of a phosphene immediately after stimulation. The stimulation was repeated ten times at each intensity with a maximum frequency of 0.2 Hz, stimulation was initially applied to 60% of the maximum intensity of the stimulator. The intensity of stimulation was changed into blocks of 5% to minimum intensity that the subject can perceive the phosphene certainly, five times ten, then this value was set as the PT for migraineurs and controls.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from eletroencephalography</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 1 month and 2 months, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalography was performed by digital EEG equipment, the sampling rate of 500 Hz, 0.5 Hz high pass filter and low pass 35 Hz to capture brain electrical activity through 23 electrodes on the scalp according to the International 10-20 system.After positioning the electrodes, the subject remained comfortably seated and relaxed, but awake, with eyes closed 30 cm from the photic stimulator and, without any stimulation, EEG was collected for 1 minute (baseline).After the baseline, was collected a sequence of 1 minute record without stimulation followed by 3 seconds to 9 Hz photic stimulation. This sequence is repeated 4 times. After this procedure, the subject received trains of visual stimuli, 20 seconds each, at frequencies of 3, 9, 15, 21 and 27 Hz, 1 minute spaced from each other and totaling 12 minutes evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Change from pain diary</measure>

    <description>The diary is a report of the frequency of the migraine attacks, the intensity, the onset and duration of the pain, the number of migraine-related days (the number of days on which the patients had migraine-related symptoms) and the type of analgesics in case of a migraine attack;</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial direct current stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>tDCS involves application of very low amplitude direct current via surface scalp electrodes. The applied current modifies the transmembrane neuronal potential and thus influences the level of excitability. Depending on the polarity of active electrodes tDCS can increase or decrease the cortical excitability. The cathodal tDCS decrease the excitability, in this study a constant current of 2 mA intensity was applied for 20 min.</description>
