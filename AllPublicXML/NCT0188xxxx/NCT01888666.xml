    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the periodontal effects during rapid palatal expansion
      (RPE) or slow palatal expansion (SPE) and to compare them by means of periodontal indices, in
      order to establish the possible differences and advantages of one of these treatments in
      periodontal terms.

      Materials and methods: 10 patients will selected and submitted to RPE treatment; other 10
      patients will selected and submitted to SPE treatment. The patients will treated with the
      Haas appliance. In both the groups the periodontal clinical indices (plaque index, PI;
      papillary bleeding index, PBI; probing pocket depth, PPD) will collected three times during
      the treatment (before, during and at the end). All measurements will performed by the same
      examiner.

      A descriptive statistical analysis will conducted. The paired samples Student's T test will
      used to evaluate the intra-group differences between t1 and t2. The unpaired samples
      Student's T test will used to evaluate between groups differences at t1 and t2. The
      significance level will set at 95%.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in probing pocket depth at 20 days and 5 months of active therapy</time_frame>
    <description>In the Group I (RPE), probing pocket depth were detected in three stages:
T0, detected 7 days after the periodontal prophylaxis (at the beginning of the active orthodontic therapy) ; T1, detected after 20 days of active therapy; T2, detected after 5 months of retention therapy.
In the Group II, the collected data corresponded to:
T0, detected 7 days after the periodontal prophylaxis; T1, detected during clinical control after 3 months of active therapy; T2, detected after 3 months of restraint. All measurements were performed by the same examiner.</description>
