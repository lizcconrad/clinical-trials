  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the efficacy of parent delivered interventions in the treatment
      of social and communication deficits in children with autism. By collecting information about
      parent and child functioning before and after intervention, the investigators will be able to
      determine whether the intervention is effective in improving child social communication and
      reducing parent stress.
