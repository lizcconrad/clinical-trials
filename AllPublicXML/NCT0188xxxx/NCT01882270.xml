    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if the infection around 3rd molars and the
      resulting inflammation around the gum also produces a general systemic inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relate signs and symptoms of mild pericoronitis, an oral clinical condition characterized by
      intense inflammation and pain around a lower 3rd molar, to indicators of oral and systemic
      inflammation in patients seeking treatment for the condition.

    <description>For enrolled patients with minor signs and symptoms of pericoronitis:
Assess oral inflammation
Levels of &quot;orange/red complex&quot; anaerobic bacteria in biofilm samples from distal of all 2nd molars and distal of affected 3rd molar.
Levels of GCF inflammatory mediators, PGE2 and IL-1ÃŸ from distal of all 2nd molars and mesial of 1st molars. If the first molar is absent, the mesial of the next most anterior tooth in the quadrant.
Assess the possible association between oral inflammation and systemic inflammation -Serum C-Reactive Protein and IL-6 levels at the time of active symptoms</description>
