    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical trial involving the use of the FDA-cleared Fetal ECG tracing
      in labor with the AN24 (Fetal Monitoring device marketed by Monica Healthcare) to the Novii
      (a newer device also created by Monica Healthcare) using the same technology with different
      monitor placement.

    <textblock>
      This study has one arm, in which Both the FDA - Approved AN24 (Fetal Monitoring device
      marketed by Monica Healthcare) and the new device (Novii, being investigated in this clinical
      trial) will be placed on the patient's abdomen. After delivery of the patient's infant, the
      data will be abstracted from the second device. This data will be compared to the data from
      the first device for accuracy.

    <description>Both the AN24 device and the Novii device will be placed on the patient's abdomen at the same time. After the patient has delivered their infant, the data from the Novii will be downloaded and checked against that from the AN24 to assess for accuracy of fetal monitoring.</description>
