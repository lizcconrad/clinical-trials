  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown in in vitro and animal models that hypoxia can have pro-inflammatory
      effects and hyperoxia can have anti-inflammatory effects. The pro-inflammatory effect could
      be the result of activation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor, a transcription factor that is known
      to activate many cell systems aimed at cell survival, including the inflammatory response.
      The anti-inflammatory effects of hyperoxia could be the annihilation of Hypoxia Inducible
      Factor, but also a decrease in inflammation due to oxygen toxicity resulting in a decrease in
      clearance of pathogens. These effects have been sparsely studied in humans. Therefore, we
      hypothesize that hypoxia results in an increase in Hypoxia Inducible Factor in circulating
      leukocytes and increases inflammatory reactions, whereas hyperoxia decreases these reactions.
