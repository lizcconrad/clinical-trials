  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, there is no definite treatment for fecal incontinence that is proven to be
      effective with low morbidity. The efficacy of biofeedback therapy for incontinence has not
      been proven on the randomized controlled trials. Sacral nerve stimulation is too expensive
      although some prospective studies showed the therapeutic potential. Recently, posterior
      tibial nerve stimulation has been reported to be effective with lower cost in comparison with
      sacral nerve stimulation. This study is designed to show the efficacy of posterior tibial
      nerve stimulation compared with biofeedback therapy for fecal incontinence.

      This prospective randomized controlled trial is designed to compare the efficacy of
      biofeedback and posterior tibial nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence. Primary endpoint
      is weekly episodes of fecal incontinence at 1 week after each treatment. Sample size was
      calculated as 50 patients. Outcomes include weekly episodes and severity of fecal
      incontinence, quality of life and anal function. Outcomes will be assessed using bowel diary,
      FISI questionnaire, FIQL questionnaire and anorectal manometry at 1,8,16 and 24 weeks after
      each treatment for 6 weeks.

    Too small included patients and, not enough cost for PTNS and biofeedback.
