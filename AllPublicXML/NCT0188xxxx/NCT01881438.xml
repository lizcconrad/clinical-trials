      The purpose of this study is to assess the association of retinal detachment (separation of
      the retina [the innermost layer of the eyeball] from its connection at the back of the eye)
      with exposure to oral ciprofloxacin or oral fluoroquinolones.

      This is an observational (in which the investigators observe the outcomes of the study
      participants but do not intervene by, e.g, assigning the treatments) and retrospective (a
      study in which the exposures and outcomes occurred before the study began) study. It will use
      data from the Optuminsight and Truven Commercial Claims and Encounters databases, each of
      which will be evaluated separately using 3 designs: (1) Case-control (a design that compares
      the cases [study participants], ie, those with retinal detachment to controls, ie, a sample
      of similar people who did not have a retinal detachment) to assess whether their exposures to
      fluoroquinolones (FQs) differed. Two case-control studies are planned, one (replication) that
      mimics a previously reported study, the other (revised) that addresses more potential
      confounders than did that study , (2) Cohort (a design that follows the participants exposed
      to FQs and those not exposed to FQs to assess whether the two groups had different risks of
      developing retinal detachment), (3) Case-only (a design where the exposure history of
      individuals who had retinal detachment are examined to assess whether they were more likely
      to have had it when they were exposed to FQs than when they were not).

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  At least 1 year of enrollment in the study for medical and pharmacy benefits after
             their cohort (group) entry (the day of their first ophthalmologist visit) for
             case-control design

          -  Oral fluoroquinolone like levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin must be dispensed to
             participants for cohort design

          -  At least one visit to an ophthalmologist and enrolled at least for 1 year in the study
             for medical and pharmacy benefits prior to the date of first occurrence of the
             exposure of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for cohort design

          -  At least one visit to an ophthalmologist and enrolled at least for 1 year in the study
             for medical and pharmacy benefits prior to the diagnosis of their first retinal
             detachment (separation of the retina [the innermost layer of the eyeball] from its
             connection at the back of the eye) for case-only design

        Exclusion criteria:

        - Prior diagnosis of retinal detachment , prior diagnosis or procedure for inflammatory
        conditions of the eyeball, or hospital admission between cohort entry and the date of the
        retinal detachment
