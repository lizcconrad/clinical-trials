    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to
      report the efficacy and safety of All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) combining with High-dose
      Dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP),
      compared to conventional high-dose dexamethasone therapy.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, randomised controlled trial of 80 primary
      ITP adult patients from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. One part of the
      participants are randomly selected to receive All-Trans Retinoic Acid(10mg tablet by mouth
      every 8 hours a day for 12 consecutive weeks, combining with dexamethasone (given orally at a
      dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days, the others are selected to receive high-dose of
      dexamethasone treatment (given orally at a dose of 40 mg daily for 4 days). Patients were
      monitored every 1 to 3 days at the first two weeks and every 1 to 4 weeks afterwards for
      platelet counts, and were monitored every 1 month for transaminitis and other side effects

    <description>The outcome should be classified into one of the following descriptions accordingly :
CR. A complete response (CR) was defined as a sustained (≥ 3 months) platelet count ≥ 100×10^9/L.
R. A response (R) was defined as a sustained (≥ 3 months) platelet count ≥ 30×10^9/L without recurrence of thrombocytopenia.
NR.No response (NR) was defined as platelet count &lt; 30 × 10^9/L or a less than two fold increase in platelet count from baseline or the presence of bleeding. Platelet count must be measured on two occasions more than a day apart.
Relapse.A relapse was defined as platelet count falls below 30×10^9/L or bleeding accrues after achieving R or CR.</description>
