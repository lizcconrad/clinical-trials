  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to test the possibility that a combination of three drugs,
      pomalidomide and everolimus with dexamethasone, may improve patient responses when compared
      with use of either drug alone, with dexamethasone in refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that pomalidomide is an FDA approved drug for patients with relapsed or progressive
      myeloma, and everolimus has been shown to have single agent activity in relapsed myeloma, it
      seems reasonable to combine these two active drugs in patients with relapsed/refractory
      disease. Given that low dose dexamethasone dramatically improved the response rate of
      pomalidomide, this drug will be added to the combination.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dosage (MTD)(Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined by first identifying the dose level at which &gt;= 30% of patients experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, over a 28 day cycle. DLT will be defined based on the rate of drug-related grade 3-5, non-hematological adverse events experienced within the first 4 weeks (1 cycle) for each combined dosage scheme. The MTD will be defined as one dosage level below which DLT was observed in &gt;= 30% of patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toxicity Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicity profile will be described by specific adverse event rates among patients experiencing &gt; grade 3 hematologic events (lasting &gt;7 days) or grades 3-5 non-hematologic adverse events, according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, over a 28 day cycle. Specific events will be described as the numbers of patients experiencing them within each treatment cohort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anti-tumor Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-tumor effect will be assessed based on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) of the monoclonal protein (M-protein) and plasma concentrations of K/L free light chains (FLC) after each 28-day cycle. Descriptive statistics will be used for this measurement.
Complete response (CR): disappearance of any M-protein and FLC as measured by SPEP and/or FLC. Pre-existing plasmacytomas must have completely resolved.
Partial response (PR): &gt;50% reduction in M-protein and &gt;50% reduction in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC. Any plasmacytoma must have decreased in size by &gt;50%.
Stable disease: not meeting criteria for CR, PR, or progressive disease (PD). PD: &gt;25% increase from baseline in serum or urine M-protein (serum M-protein must increase by &gt; 0.5 gm/dl; urine M-protein must increase by &gt;200 mg /24 hr); or development of new plasmacytomas or new lytic bone lesions; or a measurable increase in the size of these lesions; or hypercalcemia (&gt;11.5 mg/dl) attributed to MM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is the percentage of patients with a &gt; Partial Response (PR). Response is assessed based on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) of the monoclonal protein (M-protein) and plasma concentrations of K/L free light chains (FLC) after each 28-day cycle.
Complete response (CR): disappearance of any M-protein and FLC as measured by SPEP and/or FLC. Pre-existing plasmacytomas must have completely resolved.

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dosage (MTD)(Phase I)</title>
        <description>The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined by first identifying the dose level at which &gt;= 30% of patients experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, over a 28 day cycle. DLT will be defined based on the rate of drug-related grade 3-5, non-hematological adverse events experienced within the first 4 weeks (1 cycle) for each combined dosage scheme. The MTD will be defined as one dosage level below which DLT was observed in &gt;= 30% of patients.</description>

Complete response (CR): disappearance of any M-protein and FLC as measured by SPEP and/or FLC. Pre-existing plasmacytomas must have completely resolved.
Partial response (PR): &gt;50% reduction in M-protein and &gt;50% reduction in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC. Any plasmacytoma must have decreased in size by &gt;50%.
Stable disease: not meeting criteria for CR, PR, or progressive disease (PD). PD: &gt;25% increase from baseline in serum or urine M-protein (serum M-protein must increase by &gt; 0.5 gm/dl; urine M-protein must increase by &gt;200 mg /24 hr); or development of new plasmacytomas or new lytic bone lesions; or a measurable increase in the size of these lesions; or hypercalcemia (&gt;11.5 mg/dl) attributed to MM.</description>
