      This trial will investigate whether immunizations with an MVA recombinant HIV vaccine are
      safe and whether they will boost immune responses generated by immunizations with a dendritic
      cell (DC) targeted protein vaccine, DCVax-001, plus poly ICLC in healthy HIV-uninfected
      volunteers.

      This trial will investigate whether immunizations with an MVA recombinant HIV vaccine are
      safe and whether they will boost immune responses generated by immunizations with a dendritic
      cell (DC) targeted protein vaccine, DCVax-001, plus poly ICLC in healthy HIV-uninfected
      volunteers. Investigators propose to assess the quality of immunity elicited by immunizations
      with MVA-CMDR only or by booster immunizations with MVA-CMDR in volunteers previously
      immunized with a DC-targeted HIV vaccine. This vaccination regimen can provide the
      proof-of-concept that DC targeted protein vaccines can prime strong immune responses and
      therefore be valuable in combination with other vaccine modalities against HIV or other
      diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have completed protocol SSC-710 and received either DCVax-001 plus poly ICLC, poly
             ICLC only or sterile saline. If less than 6 volunteers who originally received placebo
             (poly ICLC only or sterile saline) under protocol SSC_710 are willing to participate
             and are found eligible to participate in this proposed study, new volunteers can be

             exclusion criteria below.
