  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, observational study will evaluate the sustained response in
      patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B who are treated with Pegasys according to
      standard of care and in line with the current local labeling in routine clinical practice in
      Vietnam. Eligible patients will be followed for the duration of their treatment and for up to
      2 years thereafter.

    <description>A participant was considered to have achieved suppression of Hepatitis B Virus Deoxyribonucleic Acid (HBV DNA) to &lt;2,000 International Units Per Milliliter (IU/mL) if the HBV DNA measurement is lower than 2,000 IU/mL.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Become Hepatitis B Envelope Antigen-Negative and Anti-HBe-Positive During Treatment and at 6 and 12 Months After End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HBeAg is a protein from the Hepatitis B virus that circulates in infected blood when the virus is actively replicating. The presence of HBeAg suggests that the participant is infectious and is able to spread the virus to other people. HBeAg-negative hepatitis B is a form of the virus that does not cause infected cells to secrete HBeAg. Participant can be infected with the HBeAg-negative form of the virus from the beginning, or the viral mutation can emerge later in the course of infection in participant initially infected with the HBeAg-positive form of the virus.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Loss of Hepatitis B Envelope Antigen During the Observation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Loss of HBeAg is defined as the absence of HBeAg. A participant was considered to have achieved HBeAg loss if the HBeAg measurement was reported as (a) 'NEGATIVE' or (b) a quantitative result was lower than the reported lower detection limit.</description>

    <description>HBeAg seroconversion is defined as the absence of HBeAg and the presence of antibody to hepatitis B antigen (anti-HBe) . A participant was considered to have achieved suppression of HBV DNA to &lt;2,000 IU/mL if the HBV DNA measurement is lower than 2,000 IU/mL.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product</description>

        <description>HBeAg is a protein from the hepatitis B virus that circulates in infected blood when the virus is actively replicating. The presence of HBeAg suggests that the participant is infectious and is able to spread the virus to other people. HBeAg-negative hepatitis B is a form of the virus that does not cause infected cells to secrete HBeAg. Participant can be infected with the HBeAg-negative form of the virus from the beginning, or the viral mutation can emerge later in the course of infection in participant initially infected with the HBeAg-positive form of the virus.</description>
