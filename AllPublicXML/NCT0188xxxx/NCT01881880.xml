      Study Rationale: an accurate breast cancer staging has a great impact in the management of a
      breast cancer. MRI is considered as the most sensible exam for this staging. However it has a
      low specificity and it may result in extra testing and stress for the patient, add to costs,
      and delay treatment. By contrast, Tomosynthesis is performed during the same time than
      mammography and has a good specificity. Although this modality is very promising, it has not
      been assessed in a population of consecutive patients.

      Study objectives: To compare the diagnostic performance of preoperative bilateral Combo mode
      (MG+Tomosynthesis) versus mammography among women with breast cancer for the detection of
      additional multifocal, multicentric, and contralateral cancers.

    <measure>diagnostic performance of preoperative bilateral Combo mode (MG+Tomosynthesis) versus mammography among women with breast cancer for the detection of additional multifocal, multicentric, and contralateral cancers.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In all sites, Mammography and Tomosynthesis will be standardised and performed according to the Combo mode with 2 views for each breast.
Any additional breast lesion assigned a BI-RAD 4 or 5 score after the full staging work-up will be biopsied under the best imaging method.
(BIRADS scale : BIRADS 4a or higher is considered to be positive for cancer )
The Gold Standard diagnosis is defined as the final diagnosis at 1 year on the basis of the most severe histopathologic result (surgery, biopsy) for that lesion.
A retrospective imaging evaluation of mammography versus Combo mode will be performed for the patients diagnosed with a breast cancer lesion. This retrospective imaging evaluation will be conducted centrally within the assessment committee at the lesion, breast and patient level.</description>
