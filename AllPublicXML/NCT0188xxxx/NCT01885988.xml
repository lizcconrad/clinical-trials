  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will take part at The Men's Health Center It will involve men who have a diagnosis
      of erectile dysfunction and also have high blood pressure.

      High blood pressure can affect the lining of the arteries and cause stiffness in the
      arteries. The arteries and veins throughout the body have a lining called the endothelium
      which gives them the ability to stretch. If the lining of the penile arteries becomes
      impaired, it can decrease the stretching of the artery and decrease blood flow. Decreased
      blood flow in the penile arteries can cause problems obtaining an erection.

      The study medication Nebivolol controls blood pressure by relaxing smooth muscle around the
      lining of the arteries, thereby improving stretch and blood flow.

      The primary objective is to determine if treatment with nebivolol improves endothelial
      function and erectile function in men with pre-hypertension and stage 1 hypertension

      70 men will be enrolled into the study. Half of the subjects will receive active medication
      and half will receive a placebo. All men will receive educational informational handouts
      about blood pressure and behavior modifications to improve blood pressure. The study will
      last for 3 months for each subject. The expected recruitment time is one year, with a 2 year
      study completion goal. Subjects will have approximately 5 study visits.

      Subjects will have initial/final blood work, a Rigiscan test (a take home penile erection
      test), two EndoPat tests to assess endothelium function, 3 SphygmoCor tests to assess central
      blood pressure, 2 sexual health questionnaires at 2 visits. Vital signs will be monitored at
      each visit to assess safety and effectiveness of the study medication.

      Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of 70 non-smoking pre-hypertensive men (BP
      120-139 / 80-89) or with newly diagnosed stage 1 hypertension (BP &gt; 140 but &lt; 159/ 90-99)
      with erectile dysfunction receiving nebivolol (5-20mg) or placebo, along with lifestyle
      modifications, daily for 3 months to titrate BP to 120/80 or less.
