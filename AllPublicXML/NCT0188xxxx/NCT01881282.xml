    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the therapeutic effect and safety of compound
      carraghenates cream with Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid (swollen veins in the lower part of the
      rectum or anus) ointment in the treatment of hemorrhoids, especially regarding the relief of
      pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (study
      drug assigned by chance), multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team
      work on a medical research study), controlled clinical trial and comparative study of safety
      and efficacy of compound carraghenates cream with Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid ointment in the
      treatment of hemorrhoids, especially regarding the relief of pain. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either of the two treatment groups that are carraghenates cream
      (Titanoreine) group or Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid ointment group. The total duration of the
      study will be 1 Week (7 days). In carraghenates cream group, 3-4 gram (g) cream will be
      administered each time through anal canal, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the
      evening for consecutive 6 days and in the Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid ointment group, 2 g
      ointment will be administered each time through anal canal, twice a day, once in the morning
      and once in the evening for consecutive 6 days. Efficacy will be assessed by using Numeric
      Rating Scale (NRS) and participants' safety will be monitored throughout the trial.

    <measure>Pain Acting Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The time from the first administration of the drugs to the time when the participant feels that his (her) pain has been remitted remarkably will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity Score at Day 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates intense pain. Grade 1-4 represents mild pain, Grade 5-6 moderate pain, and Grade 7-10 serious pain. Higher score indicates worsening.</description>

    <measure>Pain Intensity Score at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates intense pain. Grade 1-4 represents mild pain, Grade 5-6 moderate pain, and Grade 7-10 serious pain. Higher score indicates worsening.</description>

    <measure>Daily Duration of Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The accumulated time of the onset of all symptoms in the same day will be assessed. The baseline value before the administration of the drugs is the accumulated time of the occurrence of all symptoms in the day prior to the visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Defecation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The daily frequency of defecation for the day prior to the visit and each day during the trial period will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants' Satisfaction for the Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' will assess for the treatment satisfaction on numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 1 to 5, where 1= Very unsatisfactory; 2= Unsatisfactory; 3=General; 4= Satisfactory; 5= Very satisfactory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Other Symptoms and Signs Including Bleeding, Edema, Local Discomfort, and Prolapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will assess these symptoms on a score range of 0 to 3 where 0=none for all symptoms and 3= &quot;Blood jets while defecating, and the blood jetting stops after defecation&quot; for bleeding, &quot;serious edema&quot; for edema, &quot;severe&quot; for local discomfort and &quot;it is difficult or unable to return the prolapsed pile&quot; for prolapse.</description>
