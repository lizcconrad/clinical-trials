  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal jaundice is the most common cause of hospital readmission for term- and near term
      infants and its management poses a significant burden on the healthcare system.

      Infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease, such as ABO or Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility, or
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD deficiency), have an increased rate of red cell
      destruction and, thus, an increase in bilirubin production. Newborn infants have immature
      liver function and do not conjugate bilirubin well, which results in accumulation of
      unconjugated bilirubin. Thus, bilirubin levels may rise rapidly and intervention may be
      required. At present, phototherapy (PT) is the most frequently used treatment for
      hyperbilirubinemia; it converts unconjugated bilirubin to less toxic water soluble
      photoisomers that are then excreted in the urine without need for conjugation. Infants who do
      not respond to PT are treated by exchange transfusion (ET), considered a therapy of last
      resort because of associated morbidity and mortality. Both PT and ET enhance the elimination
      of, but have no impact on the production of bilirubin.

      Stannsoporfin is a heme oxygenase inhibitor that acts to reduce bilirubin production. It is
      being developed for the management of neonatal jaundice.
