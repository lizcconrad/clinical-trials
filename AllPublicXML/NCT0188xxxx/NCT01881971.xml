      Hypothesis: Statin therapy will decrease inflammation and slow progression of cardiopulmonary
      abnormalities in HIV.

      Growing evidence indicates that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important
      cause of respiratory impairment in HIV+ persons and will likely increase as the HIV+
      population continues to age. In the HIV-uninfected population, COPD frequently co-exists with
      cardiac disease including atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The investigators
      work has demonstrated that a syndrome of &quot;cardiopulmonary dysfunction&quot; exists even in
      non-smoking or antiretroviral-treated HIV+ individuals. The investigators have found that
      HIV+ individuals have a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms, airflow obstruction, and
      diffusing capacity (DLco) abnormalities that occur concurrently with cardiac co-morbidities,
      including radiographic measures of atherosclerosis and elevated echocardiographic pulmonary
      artery pressures. This syndrome is marked by inflammation with elevated levels of cytokines
      and hsCRP, peripheral T-cell activation, and increased sputum neutrophils as well as
      elevation of NT-proBNP, a marker of heart strain. Importantly, the investigators have shown
      that DLco impairment and elevated NT-proBNP are significant independent predictors of
      mortality in HIV, indicating that cardiopulmonary dysfunction is likely highly clinically
      relevant and identifies a vulnerable population in whom the investigators lack effective
      interventions.

      Statins have anti-inflammatory effects in the lung and vasculature that might benefit
      cardiopulmonary dysfunction in HIV. These agents have a long history of clinical use in
      cardiovascular disease and are currently being investigated as disease-modifying drugs for
      HIV, COPD, and PH. In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that HIV+
      individuals who received statin therapy within the past year were significantly less likely
      to have impaired DLco and had lower pulmonary artery pressures, lower NT-proBNP, lower
      peripheral cytokines, and fewer sputum neutrophils despite being older and having a greater
      smoking history than those not using statins.
