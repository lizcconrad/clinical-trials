  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the second common gynecologic malignancy in Taiwan. The prevalence has
      been overcome the epithelial ovarian cancer because of the change of life style to western
      style recently. Most patients with endometrial cancer are stage I &amp; II, the most histology is
      still &quot;endometrioid adenocarcinoma&quot; (type I endometrial cancer). In statistics, advanced
      stage (FIGO stage III and IV) is approximately 16% of all cases.

      Most patients has good outcome of endometrial cancer because their surgical stage is belonged
      to &quot;early stage&quot;. However, the recurrence, distant metastases and mortality are high if the
      diseases is confirmed to be advanced stage. The adjuvant therapies after staging/debulking
      operation are systemic chemotherapy and whole pelvic radiation therapy/ brachytherapy.
      Whether the adjuvant therapy can cure the disease of not is still controversial.

      Because of the rarity of the advanced endometrial cancer, varies adjuvant therapeutic
      modalities, eg. chemotherapy only, pelvic radiation therapy only, combination of chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy or sequential &quot;sandwich&quot; therapy were ever used for such group patients
      in each medical center. But the case number is insufficient and limited to show the survival
      or progression free benefit during the statistics. Besides, the surgical procedures and
      adjuvant therapy for early endometrial cancer is still remained to be determined. The
      investigators are also interested to analyze the factors affecting their survival.

      The investigators will perform a retrospective study to review the data of patients with
      endometrial cancer in Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology in Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.
