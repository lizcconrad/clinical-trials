      The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety data in patients with metachromatic
      leukodystrophy (MLD) who are receiving HGT-1110 and have participated in Study HGT-MLD-070
      through Week 40.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of lipid
      metabolism characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A
      (ASA). MLD is a rare disease that occurs in most parts of the world. The estimated overall
      incidence of the disease in the western world is approximately 1 in 100,000 live births that
      varies by geographic location. There are no approved therapies for MLD.

      This study is a multicenter open-label study designed to evaluate safety and efficacy
      outcomes of HGT-1110 administered intrathecally in children with MLD who have participated in
      the dose escalation study, HGT-MLD-070, through Week 40 and are receiving study drug every
      other week (EOW).

      Treatment groups will be identical to those in HGT-MLD-070, ie, patients assigned to Cohort 1
      in Study HGT-MLD-070 will continue to receive a dose of 10 mg, patients assigned to Cohort 2
      in Study HGT-MLD-070 will continue to receive a dose of 30 mg, and patients assigned to
      Cohorts 3 and 4 in Study HGT-MLD-070 will continue to receive a dose of 100 mg. Patients in
      Cohort 4 are to exclusively receive drug product produced with Process B in Study HGT-MLD-070
      and will continue receiving this drug product in this study. Patients enrolled in this study
      from Cohorts 1 to 3 in Study HGT-MLD-070 were transitioned to Process B after all necessary
      approvals were obtained.

      In HGT-MLD-071, all patients in the 10 mg dose cohort who experienced disease progression, as
      determined by the Investigator, increased to the 30 mg dose after agreement by the Medical
      Monitor. Based on the interim analysis results from HGT-MLD-070 (Cohorts 1-3), the dose of
      HGT-1110 will be increased to 100 mg for all patients in HGT-MLD-071 after all necessary
      approvals were obtained.
