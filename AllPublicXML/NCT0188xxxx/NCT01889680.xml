  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FC-8 is a Phase II, multi-center randomized study of a continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV with
      ziv-aflibercept or 5-FU/LV alone (control arm) following the induction regimen of mFOLFOX6
      and ziv-aflibercept as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The
      primary aim of the study is to determine the value of adding ziv-aflibercept to the
      continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV in improving progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer who have achieved at least stable disease after induction
      therapy. The secondary aim is to determine the overall objective response rate (complete,
      partial or stable responses) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive an induction regimen with mFOLFOX6 (5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus Day 1 +
      leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV Day 1 + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV Day 1 followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 by
      continuous intravenous infusion (CIV infusion) over 46 hours [Day 1 and 2]) + ziv-aflibercept
      (4 mg/kg on Day 1) every 14 days for 6 cycles.

      Patients attaining stable disease or better after 6 cycles of induction therapy will be
      randomized to receive a continuation regimen of either 5-FU/LV + ziv-aflibercept IV [4 mg/kg
      Day 1]) every 14 days, as the investigational arm; or 5-FU/LV alone every 14 days, as the
      control arm, until disease progression.

      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.

      Submission of archived primary tumor tissue and blood samples for FC-8 correlative science
      studies will be a study requirement for all patients. Submissions will include primary tumor
      specimens from the diagnostic biopsy sample or another previous surgery and blood samples
      collected before the start of study therapy, prior to starting each even numbered cycle of
      therapy, (i.e., Cycles 2, 4, and 6) and at the time of disease progression or end of study
      therapy.

      The total study accrual will be up to 120 patients over a period of 24 months in order to
      provide 90 patients for randomization to the continuation regimen. Patients will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive the continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV + ziv-aflibercept (Arm 2, 60
      patients) or 5-FU/LV alone (Arm 1, 30 patients).

      In both arms, clinical response will be assessed by radiological examination every eight
      weeks during the continuation regimen course.
