  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which segments of the immune system cause the
      destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas, leaving individuals with an impaired
      ability to control blood glucose levels. Currently there is no cure for Type 1 Diabetes and
      the treatments involve lifelong insulin administration and careful monitoring of blood
      glucose levels. Long-term complications like cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, and retina
      damage, may result. Previous studies have shown that improvement in the control of blood
      glucose can reduce the risks from these long-term complications. Residual insulin production,
      typically within the first few years following diagnosis, helps to reduce an individual's
      need to supplement insulin by injection or pump. This effect helps in maintaining the body's
      ability to regulate blood glucose levels and reducing the needs of external insulin.

      Methyldopa, or Aldomet, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is commonly
      used to treat high blood pressure. This drug has been approved for several decades and has
      been shown to be safe and effective. This drug has been identified by the researcher to be
      able to block the communication between two important types of immune cells; which play a
      critical role in the autoimmune processes of Type 1 Diabetes. The investigators hypothesize
      that Methyldopa, over a 6 week treatment period, will block this communication and possibly
      slow down the destruction of insulin producing cells. The investigators hope to assess the
      appropriate and safe dose to achieve this effect, along with the drug's ability to maintain
      insulin production and blood glucose control.

    <measure>The Change From Baseline of DQ8 Antigen Presentation by Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells After 6 Weeks of Methyldopa Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks (Baseline and week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Cryopreserved primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as antigen presenting cells to stimulate engineered T-cells (T-cell receptor transductant) responding to a specific peptide presented by HLA-DQ8. Secreted IL-2 from the engineered T-cell was measured by a highly sensitive ELISA. This was done for both an α-gliadin/DQ8 responding T-cell and a separate insulin/DQ8 responding T-cell.</description>

    <measure>The Change in C-Peptide AUC Following a MMTT From Baseline to Study Completion.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (Baseline and week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators aim to observe changes in residual endogenous insulin production as measured by C-peptide 2 hour area under the curve following a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT). C-peptide is a measure of endogenous insulin secretion as both are secreted in a 1:1 molar ratio. Individuals ingested a liquid meal (Boost) with a fixed amount of protein, fat and carbohydrate in the fasting state followed by the timed measurements of serum C-peptide at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes to compute the AUC.</description>

        <description>Cryopreserved primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as antigen presenting cells to stimulate engineered T-cells (T-cell receptor transductant) responding to a specific peptide presented by HLA-DQ8. Secreted IL-2 from the engineered T-cell was measured by a highly sensitive ELISA. This was done for both an α-gliadin/DQ8 responding T-cell and a separate insulin/DQ8 responding T-cell.</description>

        <description>Investigators aim to observe changes in residual endogenous insulin production as measured by C-peptide 2 hour area under the curve following a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT). C-peptide is a measure of endogenous insulin secretion as both are secreted in a 1:1 molar ratio. Individuals ingested a liquid meal (Boost) with a fixed amount of protein, fat and carbohydrate in the fasting state followed by the timed measurements of serum C-peptide at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes to compute the AUC.</description>
