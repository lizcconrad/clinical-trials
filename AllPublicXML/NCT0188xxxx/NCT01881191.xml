      This study will evaluate the effects of Aubagio on changes in the brain using MRI.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who take Aubagio will have an MRI, eye test, have blood taken, and complete a
      questionnaire on environmental risk factors to evaluate changes in the brain and on disease
      progression. A healthy control group will also complete the same testing regimen.
