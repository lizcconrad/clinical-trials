  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unsedated ultrathin transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD), in comparison with
      conventional peroral EGD (P-EGD) has been shown to be more tolerable, safer, cost-effective
      and time-efficient. The investigators and in other studies have showed that nasal pledgetting
      (or commonly termed nasal packing) is better than nasal spray in terms of patient tolerance
      and visual capacity. Although pledgetting method to a selected meatus can achieve better
      decongestion effect, epistaxis and nasal pain in some patients are still frustrating to
      endoscopists.

      The investigator has proposed a novel meatus scoring scale to evaluate nasal insertability by
      anterior rhinoscopy using a transnasal endoscope. The investigator also suggest
      endoscopic-guided gauze pledgetting can provide precise nasal anesthesia, thereby reducing
      trauma/bleeding in the nasal cavity and increasing patient tolerance during transnasal
      endoscopy. Endoscopic guidance to deliver a gauze strip can confirm delivering it to at least
      the posterior end of a turbinate. We hypothesize that by using endoscopic-guided method,
      gauze pledgetting to both the inferior nasal meatus (INM) and middle nasal meatus (MNM)
      simultaneously is more tolerable than only gauze pledgetting to a single meatus.

      Nasal anesthesia is the rate-limiting step for a well tolerable unsedated transnasal
      esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) procedure. The investigator has proposed that a simple
      Endoscopic-Guided Gauze Pledgetting method (EGGP) is more tolerable than the &quot;blind&quot;
      cotton-tippled applicator method to deliver a gauze strip for anesthetizing the nasal cavity.
      The initial idea of EGGP is to anesthetize only one single selected meatus. To compare
      patient tolerance, safety and adverse events between double pledget (DPNA, i.e. INM and MNM)
      versus single pledget (SPNA, i.e. INM or MNM) methods of nasal anesthesia, the investigator
      is going to conduct a prospective randomized-controlled trial. The rationale for using double
      pledget is threefold: (1) the middle meatus is bounded by the INT and MNT; (2) the inserting
      and exserting meatuses may be different; (3) erective spongy tissue is mainly distributed in
      the inferior and middle turbinates and the nasal septum. Therefore, the primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate whether DPNA is more tolerable and safer than DPNA before UT-EGD.

    <time_frame>Immediately after transnasal endoscopy up to all questionnaires answered (about 15 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measures are tolerability profiles on a validated visual analogue scale (VAS) and difficulty in inserting the transnasal endoscope through a selected meatus based on a Likert scale. The Likert scale has 5 points of difficulty: minimal, slight, moderate, substantial, and extreme. Facing a 5-point VAS card (1 = minimal discomfort to 5 = severe discomfort), all patients give real-time feedback immediately after UT-EGD by speaking or pointing out their scorings for the following: (1) pain during anesthesia, (2) pain during nasal insertions, (3) pain during exsertion, and (4) overall tolerance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary outcome measures evaluate the side effects of nasal anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>The immediate secondary outcome measures will be evaluated by questionnaires immediately after UT-EGD within 15 minutes and the delayed secondary outcome measures will be evaluated by otolaryngologists within two weeks after UT-EGD.</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures will be evaluated by assisting nurses, who record
(a) immediate responses including: (i) epistaxis, (ii) immediately post-procedural side effects including headache, light headiness, and mucous discharge, and (iii) patient's willingness to receive the same procedure the next time, and (b) delayed side effect including (i) persisting nasal discharge, (ii) epistaxis 24 hours after UT- EGD, and (iii) sinusitis all confirmed by otolaryngologists within two weeks after UT-EGD. The visual capacity for the anterior nasal cavity ranking on a 5-point scale (5 represented standard EGD and 1 poor visual quality) is also evaluated by assisting nurses during endoscopic insertion after nasal decongestive anesthesia.</description>

    <description>All patients in the double pledget nasal anesthesia group receive endoscopic-guided gauze nasal pledgetting to both the inferior nasal meatus and middle nasal meatus. Each patient will receive an anterior rhinoscopy to select the most patent meatus by a validated meatus scoring scale. The endoscope is preloaded with a 1.8 mm biopsy forceps to pick up a right-angled gauze strip. A preloaded biopsy forceps is protruded slowly into the middle meatus first under endoscope monitoring. The second gauze pledgetting procedure is performed two minutes after the first gauze pledgetting which serves to induce turbinate size reduction to both the INT and MNT. A gauze strip is at least brought onto the posterior end of the inferior or middle turbinate.</description>
