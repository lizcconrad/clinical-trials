    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) in children early after sevoflurane anaesthesia is a common
      postoperative problem, with incidence ranging up to 80%. Younger patients, particularly in
      the age range from 1.5 to 5 yr of age, are at increased risk of EA. Preoperative anxiety, as
      measured by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, has been shown to increase the risk
      of EA for each increment of 10 points in the child's state anxiety score. So, Alleviates
      preoperative anxiety in Children maybe decrease the incidence and severity of EA. Preschool
      children enjoy watching animated cartoons, and they can be immersed to animated cartoon so
      they become oblivious of their surroundings. Therefore, viewing an animated cartoon maybe
      reduce preoperative anxiety in children. This study was performed to determine effect of
      animated cartoon for prevention of emergence agitation in children aged 1.5 - 5 yr after
      general anesthesia

    <measure>Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>(PAED) Scale changes from the moment subjects open their eyes, and every 5 minute for 24hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' behavior was rated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) from the moment subjects opened their eyes, and every 5 minutes until discharge from the PACU. The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) Scale (Sikich &amp; Lerman, 2004) was used. The scale assesses 5 behaviors (making eye contact, purposefulness of actions, awareness of surroundings, restlessness, and consolability) on a 5-point scale that ranges from 'not at all' to 'extremely'.</description>
