      The objective of the study is to evaluate the association between certain markers in the
      blood of neonatal brain injury and specific Fetal Heart Rate monitoring findings using the
      device under study.

      The purpose of the study is to:

        1. evaluate the association between serologic markers of neonatal brain injury and the
           specific FHR monitoring findings using the investigational device;

        2. investigate the relationship between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
           antidepressants and the QT interval of the fetal heart. Specifically, examine the
           potential association between maternal SSRI use and the fetal QT interval,and;

        3. develop the capacity to measure uterine contractions during labor using non-invasive
           electrodes that measure the electrical signal from the uterine muscle.

      For this study, the investigational device will not be used to diagnose or treat as it will
      be used in concert with the current standard of care monitors.
