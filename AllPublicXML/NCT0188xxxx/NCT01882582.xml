    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand whether and to what extent the activity of
      immune cells in blood varies over time under normal conditions as assessed in healthy
      subjects. Results of this study will provide the foundation for helping us evaluate changes
      in immune cell activities in response to surgery and drugs used in anesthesia. The overall
      purpose of our research is to understand immune health in the context of anesthesia and
      surgery.

    <description>This is an exploratory study. Numerical and functional (phosphorylation of signaling molecules and transcription factors) behavior of all circulating immune cells will be captured. Blood specimens collected at referenced time points will be analyzed with mass cytometry.</description>
