  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve patient understanding of and interest in donating
      frozen embryos resulting from in vitro fertilization (IVF) to others undergoing infertility
      treatment.

      The first phase of this study involves the mailing of a survey to current Boston IVF patients
      who have embryos frozen in storage. A survey will be sent to these individuals to assess
      their knowledge and understanding of frozen embryos and if they would be interested in embryo
      donation.

      The second phase of research will randomize these patients into two groups: control and
      intervention. The control groups will receive their standard of treatment regarding frozen
      embryos, which consists of receiving a yearly storage bill. The intervention group will
      receive a letter from their physician of record and a follow up phone call from a research
      assistant offering the opportunity to schedule a consult with a licensed social worker at
      Boston IVF. The consult is meant to serve as a chance to discuss the difficult decision
      around embryo disposition. The consult for these patient will be free of charge, covered with
      funds from our grant. Additional enhanced support services and educational services provided
      by embryologists, nurses and physicians in the Frozen Embryo Donation Service will be
      offered. These enhanced services will also be free of charge to subjects.

      The third phase of the study includes the mailing of a letter to a random sample of patients
      with embryos frozen in storage at Boston IVF. This letter will be an invitation to contact
      Boston IVF to schedule a consult with a licensed social worker to discuss embryo disposition
      options. The consult for these patient will be free of charge, covered with funds from our
      grant.
