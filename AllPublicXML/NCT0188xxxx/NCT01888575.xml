    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in a cohort of low dose aspirin (ASA) users previously ascertained
      .The aims of the post hoc analyses are:

      To estimate the one year risk of discontinuation of use of low-dose ASA associated to PPI
      concomitant use versus non-use, crude and adjusted by confounding.

      To estimate the one year risk of discontinuation of use of low-dose ASA associated to PPI
      concomitant use stratified by age and sex.

      To evaluate other predictors of discontinuation of low-dose ASA during the first year of ASA
      therapy.

        This is a pharmacoepidemiology study using data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN)
        primary care database in the UK. Patients aged 50-84 years with evidence of ischemic heart
        disease or cerebrovascular disease, who were new users of low-dose ASA (75-300 mg/day) and
        who had received at least two low-dose ASA prescriptions for the secondary prevention of
        cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease between 2000 and 2007 were identified
        from THIN. .
