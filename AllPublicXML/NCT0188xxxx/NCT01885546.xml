    <textblock>
      This enhanced meter feature raises awareness among patients by providing additional
      information regarding their glycemic control between Healthcare Professional visits. This
      information may facilitate increased dialogue between patient and Healthcare Professionals
      and can remind patients of the importance of glycemic control.

      This study will evaluate a user's ability to obtain the enhanced meter feature.
