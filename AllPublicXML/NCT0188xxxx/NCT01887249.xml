  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10-day sequential therapy was not sufficient to overcome tough situation for H. pylori
      eradication in Korea due to high antimicrobial resistance. The present investigators assumed
      that doubling duration of second phase of sequential therapy might have more potent
      bactericidal efficacy than previous 10-day sequential regimen. But 15-day regimen with
      initial 5-day PPI with amoxicillin followed by remaining 10-day PPI, clarithromycin with
      metronidazole was not ever tested before. Moreover, whether extending the sequential therapy
      to 15-day might be more effective than 10-day sequential therapy is unknown especially in
      Korea. From this background, the present investigators prepared clinical trials regarding
      modified sequential therapy which was extending the treatment duration to 15 days compared
      than previous 10-day sequential therapy regimen. In addition, pre-treatment antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing was performed to find the possibility to overcome antimicrobial
      resistance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with H. pylori infection who had never received treatment for H. pylori
             infection

          -  H. pylori infection defined by a positive rapid urease test (CLOtest, Delta West,
             Bentley, Australia) by gastric mucosal biopsy from the lesser curvature of the mid
             antrum or mid body or histological evidence of H. pylori by modified Giemsa staining
             in the lesser and greater curvature of the mid antrum or mid body, respectively or a
             positive C-urea breath test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with concurrent critical illness, a history of previous upper
             gastrointestinal surgery, contraindication to any of the study medications, recent

             medications, and those that were pregnant or breast-feeding women were excluded from
             the study. Other exclusion criteria include recent use of antimicrobials and any
