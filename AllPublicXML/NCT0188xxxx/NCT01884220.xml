  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study are: to characterize and understand the natural history of disease
      progression in WD and CESD, and to provide historical controls for WD and CESD for developing
      clinical treatment trials. The hypothesis is that the variability and clinical progression in
      WD and CESD is large and represents a continuum of severities from a lethal infantile to near
      normal adults with only &quot;fatty livers&quot;.

      This is a single institution historical cohort study of patients with Wolman (WD) or
      Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD). Retrospective data will be collected and abstracted
      from the medical records of both living and deceased patients. Additionally prospective data
      from living patients will be collected and abstracted annually until the end of the study.
      Literature sources will be used as secondary source data and will be screened to
      minimize/eliminate duplicative reports.
