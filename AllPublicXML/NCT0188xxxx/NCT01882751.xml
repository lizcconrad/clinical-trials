  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A better understanding of knee joint kinematics is important to explain the premature
      polyethylene wear failures within total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) and to help design a
      prosthesis that most closely approximates the normal knee. Previously, most experimental
      studies of knee kinematics have involved cadaveric, in vitro analyses, or have not tested the
      knee in a weight-bearing mode. Others have used exoskeletal linkages and skin markers that
      permit error due to undesired motions between markers and the underlying bone. More recently,
      fluoroscopy has been used to assess in vivo kinematics for subjects having a TKA.

      ConforMIS has attempted to follow a clearly different path than the major orthopaedic
      companies. They have chosen to offer patients a personalized knee implant based off of each
      patient's femoral and tibial bone geometry. The hypothesis is that these subjects will
      experience a more normal-like kinematic pattern, eliminating paradoxical anterior sliding
      during weight-bearing knee flexion. Therefore, the objective for this study is to analyze the
      in vivo kinematics for 25 patients implanted with a personalized ConforMIS TKA and 25
      patients implanted with a traditional TKA design to determine if there are any kinematic
      differences between these TKA designs.

      Each subject will be asked to perform five activities in one continuous sequence: (1) stand
      up from a chair, (2) walk up stairs, (3) walk down stairs, (4) level walking, and (5) a deep
      knee bend. Subjects will be video recorded from the waist down while performing the
      activities. The speed level of each trial will be based on the comfort level of the patient.
      The fluoroscopic images will be stored digitally for subsequent analysis on secure servers
      and workstations at the University of Tennessee.
