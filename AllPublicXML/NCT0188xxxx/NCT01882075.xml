    <textblock>
      The investigators want to test during anesthesia the feasibility of a closed-loop automated
      fluid replacement system using cardiac output monitoring as the input value.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimization of the cardiac output is an important goal during anesthesia to decrease the
      postoperative morbidity, mortality and the care costs.

      We want to test if the closed-loop fluid administration is feasible.

      Two groups will be compared. In all cases:

        -  anesthesia will be provided by a closed-loop which aim is to maintain bispectral index
           between 40 and 60 using propofol and remifentanil. This method permits to have similar
           depths of anesthesia in all cases.

        -  cardiac output will be continuously monitored by LidCO. In one group, fluid replacement
           is decided by the physician; in the other, fluid replacement is automated using a
           closed-loop system.
