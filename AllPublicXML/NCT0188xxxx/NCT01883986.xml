  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this project are to assess the feasibility of recruiting patients and delivering
      a nurse-led telephone based palliative care intervention for patients with newly diagnosed
      lung cancer and to assess if among patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer, the
      investigators can estimate the effect of a nurse-led telephone based palliative care
      intervention on quality-of-life, symptom burden and patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients meeting entry criteria will be randomized to the intervention arm, palliative care
      plus usual care or the usual care arm. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will
      receive usual oncologic care and phone calls from a nurse. Outcomes measures will be
      collected at baseline, and 3 months.

      The study will be performed at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System. The investigators will
      recruit individuals (n=40) with lung cancer over 1 year. The primary objective is to test the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and recruitment of subjects. The
      investigators will estimate the effect of a nurse-led telephone based palliative care
      intervention to improve quality-of-life, symptom burden and patient satisfaction. In
      addition, using validated instruments, the investigators will assess the potential effect
      size of the intervention on quality of provider communication and on clinician knowledge of
      patient preferences for life sustaining therapies. The results of this pilot study will
      inform a future randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of the intervention on a
      larger scale.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Total Outcome Index Score at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Quality of Life including symptoms as measured by the FACT-L (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Scale). The FACT-L outcome measure reported is the mean change in the TOI subscale (Total Outcome Index) of the instrument, computed as the differences between final and baseline visit scores. The TOI subscale range is 0-84 with a higher score indicating a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Satisfaction of Care at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with care will be assessed by using the FAMCARE- Patient Survey 13 (full unabbreviated scale name). The FAMCARE is a 13 item, 5 point likert-scale validated questionnaire measuring patient satisfaction with cancer care and assessing interactions with health care providers, performance status and symptom burden. Only total scores are reported (no subscales). The total scores range from 13-65 with scores of 52 &gt; indicating satisfaction with care. The higher the score the better the outcome (better satisfaction with care). In full randomized clinical trials, the estimated minimal important difference is 5 points from baseline to 12 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change in Baseline Quality of Clinician Communication at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of clinician end-of-life communication will be measured from the patient's perspective by the Quality of Communication Questionnaire (QOC).The QOC consists of 13 items divided into two subscales, six general communication items and seven end-of-life topics. We analyzed the six-item &quot;general communication skills&quot; scale, which scores range from 0-10. The higher the score the better the provider's communication is. We asked patients to answer the questions in reference to the provider who was primarily responsible for managing their lung cancer.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinician Knowledge of Patient Preferences at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician knowledge of patient preferences for life sustaining treatments will be assessed at baseline and at the study end point by asking 2 validated questions to both the clinician and the patient and determining the level of agreement between the responses.</description>

      <recruitment_details>We recruited 41 outpatients with lung cancer of any stage or type at the Puget Sound Health Care System within two months of diagnosis between 3/6/2014 and 9/1/2015. We reviewed weekly tumor board lists and consults to oncology and pulmonary services to mail invitation letters to eligible patients and then follow up by telephone.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Forty-one subjects completed informed consent and forty subjects were randomized. The subject who was consented, but not randomized, became ineligible by enrolling in hospice care.</pre_assignment_details>

The FACT-L outcome measure reported is the mean change in the TOI subscale (Total Outcome Index) of the instrument, computed as the differences between final and baseline visit scores. The TOI subscale range is 0-84 with a higher score indicating a better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Satisfaction of Care at 3 Months</title>
        <description>Patient satisfaction with care will be assessed by using the FAMCARE- Patient Survey 13 (full unabbreviated scale name). The FAMCARE is a 13 item, 5 point likert-scale validated questionnaire measuring patient satisfaction with cancer care and assessing interactions with health care providers, performance status and symptom burden. Only total scores are reported (no subscales). The total scores range from 13-65 with scores of 52 &gt; indicating satisfaction with care. The higher the score the better the outcome (better satisfaction with care). In full randomized clinical trials, the estimated minimal important difference is 5 points from baseline to 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change in Baseline Quality of Clinician Communication at 3 Months</title>
        <description>The quality of clinician end-of-life communication will be measured from the patient's perspective by the Quality of Communication Questionnaire (QOC).The QOC consists of 13 items divided into two subscales, six general communication items and seven end-of-life topics. We analyzed the six-item &quot;general communication skills&quot; scale, which scores range from 0-10. The higher the score the better the provider's communication is. We asked patients to answer the questions in reference to the provider who was primarily responsible for managing their lung cancer.</description>
