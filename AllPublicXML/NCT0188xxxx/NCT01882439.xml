    <time_frame>Months 1, 3, and 6</time_frame>
    <description>PASI determines psoriasis severity based on lesion severity and percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. Lesion severity is assessed for erythema, induration, and scaling evaluated separately for the head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs and then rated for each body area according to a 5 point scale: 0=no involvement; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=very marked. BSA involvement is the extent (%) of body area affected by psoriasis and is assigned a numerical score: 0=no involvement; 1=0% to 9%; 2=10% to 29%; 3=30% to 49%; 4=50% to 69%; 5=70% to 89%; 6=90% to 100%. In each area, the sum of the severity rating scores is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of this area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of the numbers obtained for each of the 4 body areas is the PASI. PASI75 is defined as a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI. n=number of responders.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scores: Total Score: Months 1, 3, 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1, 3, 6</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire, with each item score ranging from 0 to 4. Three endpoints are derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score (range 0-52) is calculated by summing the 13 items. FACIT-F experience domain score (range 0-20) is calculated by summing 5 items : I feel fatigued, I feel weak all over, I feel listless (&quot;washed out&quot;), I feel tired, and I have energy, while FACIT-F impact domain score (range 0-32) is calculated by summing the remaining 8 items. All responses are added with equal weight to obtain the total score. Higher scores represent better fatigue status. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score: Month 3</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI assesses the difficulty a patient has had in the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question, level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The score for each domain is the maximum (worst) score from the items/questions within the domain. Higher score indicates greater disability. Overall score was computed as the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains answered. The total possible score ranged from 0 to 3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Higher overall score indicates greater disability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score: Week 2 and Months 1, 2, 4, and 6</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI assesses the difficulty a patient has had in the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question, level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The score for each domain is the maximum (worst) score from the items/questions within the domain. Higher score indicates greater disability. Overall score was computed as the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains answered. The total possible score ranged from 0 to 3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Higher overall score indicates greater disability. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

        <description>The PGA-PsO is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are rated separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale, scored as 0=none; 1, 2, 3, or 4=most severe. The severity rating scores are summed and the average taken; the total average is rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA-PsO score on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe). n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) Response: Months 1, 3, and 6</title>
        <description>PASI determines psoriasis severity based on lesion severity and percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. Lesion severity is assessed for erythema, induration, and scaling evaluated separately for the head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs and then rated for each body area according to a 5 point scale: 0=no involvement; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=very marked. BSA involvement is the extent (%) of body area affected by psoriasis and is assigned a numerical score: 0=no involvement; 1=0% to 9%; 2=10% to 29%; 3=30% to 49%; 4=50% to 69%; 5=70% to 89%; 6=90% to 100%. In each area, the sum of the severity rating scores is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of this area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of the numbers obtained for each of the 4 body areas is the PASI. PASI75 is defined as a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI. n=number of responders.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dactylitis Severity Score (DSS): Months 1, 3, and 6</title>
        <description>Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. The DSS is a function of finger circumference and tenderness, assessed and summed across all dactylitic digits. The severity of dactylitis is scored on a scale of 0-3, where 0=tenderness and 3=extreme tenderness in each digit of the hands and feet. The range of total dactylitis scores for a participant is 0-60. Higher score indicates greater degree of tenderness. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

        <description>The SPARCC Enthesitis Index identifies the presence or absence of tenderness at 16 enthesial sites, including the bilateral Achilles tendons, plantar fascia insertion at the calcaneus, patellar tendon insertion at the base of the patella, quadriceps insertion into the superior border of the patella, supraspinatus insertion into the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and medial and lateral epicondyles. On examination, tenderness is recorded as present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 16 sites, with an overall total score ranging from 0 to 16.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2, Acute Components (SF-36v2 Acute): Physical Component Summary Score: Months 1, 3, 6</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the physical component summary (PCS) score and the mental component summary (MCS) score. Normalized domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses. The component and domain scores were scored using the United States (US) 1998 general population norms. The resulting norm-based T-scores for both the SF36 version 2 and SF36 health domain scales and component summary measures have means of 50 and standard deviations of 10. A higher PCS score represents better physical health status. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

The 10 items of the physical functioning scale represent levels &amp; kinds of limitations between extremes of physical activities, including lifting &amp; carrying groceries; climbing stairs; bending, kneeling, or stooping; walking moderate distances; self-care limitations. The physical functioning items capture the presence &amp; extent of physical limitations using a 3-level response continuum. The domain scores were scored using the US 1998 general population norms. The resulting norm-based T-scores for both the SF36 version 2 &amp; SF36 health domain scales &amp; component summary measures have means of 50 &amp; standard deviations of 10.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2, Acute Components (SF-36v2 Acute): Role-physical Domain: Months 1, 3, 6</title>
        <description>SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure evaluating 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, &amp; mental health. The 4-item role-physical scale covers an array of physical health-related role limitations, including: a) limitations in the kind of work or other usual activities; b) reductions in the amount of time spent on work or other usual activities; c) difficulty performing work or other usual activities; &amp; d) accomplishing less. Items in the role-physical scale are answered on a 5-point scale. The domain scores were scored using the US 1998 general population norms. The resulting norm-based T-scores for both the SF36 version 2 &amp; SF36 health domain scales &amp; component summary measures have means of 50 &amp; standard deviations of 10. A higher role-physical domain score represents better role-physical functioning. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2, Acute Components (SF-36v2 Acute): General Health Domain: Months 1, 3, 6</title>
          <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The general health scale consists of 5 items including a rating of health and 4 items addressing the respondent’s view and expectations of his or her health. The domain scores were scored using the US 1998 general population norms. The resulting norm-based T-scores for both the SF36 version 2 &amp; SF36 health domain scales &amp; component summary measures have means of 50 &amp; standard deviations of 10. A higher general health domain score represents better general health perceptions. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2, Acute Components (SF-36v2 Acute): Role-emotional Domain: Months 1, 3, 6</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The 3-item role-emotional scale assesses mental health-related role limitations in terms of a) time spent in work or other usual activities; b) amount of work or activities accomplished; c) care with which work or other activities were performed. All 3 items are answered on a 5-point scale. The domain scores were scored using the US 1998 general population norms. The resulting norm-based T-scores for both the SF36 version 2 &amp; SF36 health domain scales &amp; component summary measures have means of 50 &amp; standard deviations of 10. A higher role-emotional domain score represents better role-emotional functioning. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 3 responses. The responses record 3 levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. Standard vertical 0 to 100 mm VAS (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual’s rating for their current health-related quality of life state, with a higher value representing better health status. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scores: Total Score: Months 1, 3, 6</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire, with each item score ranging from 0 to 4. Three endpoints are derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score (range 0-52) is calculated by summing the 13 items. FACIT-F experience domain score (range 0-20) is calculated by summing 5 items : I feel fatigued, I feel weak all over, I feel listless (“washed out”), I feel tired, and I have energy, while FACIT-F impact domain score (range 0-32) is calculated by summing the remaining 8 items. All responses are added with equal weight to obtain the total score. Higher scores represent better fatigue status. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Score Evaluating Spondylitis Using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI): Months 1, 3, 6</title>
        <description>BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participants with ankylosing spondylitis. Utilizing a VAS of 0-10 (0=none and 10=very severe) participants answered 6 questions measuring discomfort, pain, and fatigue. The final BASDAI score averaged the individual assessments for a final score ranging 0-10cm, with higher scores representing more severe ankylosing spondylitis disease activity. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Months 1, 3, 6</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug with presence of spondylitis at screening and baseline BASDAI score &gt;0 cm, and were evaluable.</population>
