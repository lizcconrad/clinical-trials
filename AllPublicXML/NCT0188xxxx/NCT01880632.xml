      1. Target population:locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (LAGC, cT2~3/N+M0,or
           cT4aN+M0);no previous chemo or radio therapy.

        2. Primary objective:Response rate of XELOX in the neoadjuvant setting of LAGC.

           Secondary objectives:

             -  The progression free survival (PFS) in the perioperative treatment of locally
                advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (cT3/N+M0,or cT4aN+M0);

             -  percentage of pathological response ; percentage of grade 3 or 4 adverse events as
                safety profile of perioperative treatments;

             -  D2 resection -rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy of XELOX;

             -  Overall survival;

             -  QOL during the whole period of treatment.

        3. Trial design:This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label, phase II study to evaluate
           the efficacy and safety of Oxaliplatin plus capecitabine(XELOX) in the perioperative
           treatment of locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in combination with D2 resection.

        4. Treatment plan:Patients will be given the perioperative chemotherapy as below once
           recruited:Schedule of Oxaliplatin plus capecitabine (XELOX) will be as follow:
           Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 ，bid,d 1~14 every 3 weeks(treatment for 2 weeks and rest 1
           week)Oxaliplatin：130mg/m2， iv infusion over 2h，d1,every 3 weeks.

        5. Number of subjects:50 patients.Number of centers 5 sites, which have the high volume of
           gastric operations in China, more than 500 per year.
