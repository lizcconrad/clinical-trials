  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury is an extremely common disease, it counts 50.000 deaths and 235.000
      hospitalizations every year. Functional consequences of an acquired brain injury have a
      considerable impact on quality of lives of patients and care-givers with direct effects on
      balance, mobility and on psycho-social functions. Attention deficits are one of the most
      frequent and disabling consequences of severe brain injury. Within the wide spectrum of
      attentive problems, patients with traumatic brain injury frequently have shown difficulties
      in divided attention. Patients, care-givers and professionals frequently refer difficulties
      also in selective attention and vigilance as consequence of the trauma. It has been shown how
      these difficulties are tightly related with the missed return to work after two years from
      the injury.

      The hypothesis of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a rehabilitative protocol
      on gaming using the console Xbox and its efficacy in improving balance, mobility, risk of
      falling, attentive functions (selective and divided attention) in subjects which have had a
      traumatic brain injury at least 12 months before.

    <description>Subjects belonging to the first group will receive a gaming therapy protocol using the Xbox console. They will receive 24 sessions of treatment within 8 weeks (3 sessions per week). Patients will be required to concentrate in games whose major purposes are increasing balance, selective attention and attention shifting. During sessions the patient will be carefully controlled by a researcher who will prevent the risk of falling and impulsiveness reactions.</description>
