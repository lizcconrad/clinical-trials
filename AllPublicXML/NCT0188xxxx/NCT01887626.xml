          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate in the study

          -  History of haemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, lupus anticoagulant or other
             diseases/syndromes that can either alter or increase the propensity for bleeding

             thrombocytopenia, intracranial haemorrhage; or rectal bleeding within 3 months prior
             to the screeening visit; or history suggestive of peptic ulcer disease

          -  History of frequent and/or significant nose bleed or clinically significant non
             traumatic bleed, bruise/haematoma or any other clinically significant bleeding risk,
             as judged by the Investigator
