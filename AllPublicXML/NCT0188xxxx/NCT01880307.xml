      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a top-down treatment approach, prescribing
      infliximab and azathioprine at diagnose, yields better outcome in comparison to the usual
      step-up treatment approach, starting with prednison and azathioprine, in moderate-to-severe
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) patients.

      Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a top-down treatment approach,
      prescribing infliximab and azathioprine at diagnose, yields better outcome in comparison to
      the usual step-up treatment approach, starting with prednison and azathioprine, in
      moderate-to-severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) patients.

      Sample size: We will include 100 (2 x 50) patients. With these numbers a difference of 60%
      and 85% (= 25) can be shown at a power of 80% (2-sided Î± 0.05; nQuery Advisor).

      Study design: an international open-label randomised controlled trial Study population:
      Children (age 3-17 yrs) with new-onset, untreated, CD with moderate-to-severe disease
      activity Intervention: Patients will be randomised to either top-down IFX treatment or
      conventional step-up treatment.

      Treatment arm 1: Top-down IFX treatment will consist of a total of 5 IFX infusions of 5 mg/kg
      (IFX induction at week 0, 2 and 6, followed by 2 maintenance infusions every 8 weeks)
      combined with oral azathioprine (AZA) 2-3 mg/kg once daily. AZA therapy will continue after
      the last IFX infusion to maintain remission.

      Treatment arm 2: Step-up treatment will consist of standard induction treatment by oral
      prednisolone 1 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) once daily for 4 weeks, followed by tapering in 6 weeks
      until stop. Prednisolone will be combined with oral AZA 2-3 mg, once daily, as maintenance
      treatment.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Clinical remission at 52 weeks without need for additional
      IBD related therapy or surgery. Secondary endpoints include clinical response, remission and
      mucosal healing at week 10 and 52, growth and adverse events.
