  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of cognitive disorders after surgery under general anesthesia (GA) is the
      second leading cause of patient complaints (after dental debris caused by intubation
      techniques). These cognitive disorders can range from simple reversible confusion (26%) with
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction without actual recovery (10%).

      The hypnosedation is an ancient technique of anesthesia expanding its effects on cognitive
      function remain to this day unknown, but appear promising.

      For twenty years, hypnosedation is offered to patients who underwent surgery as an
      alternative to other anesthetic techniques (general anesthesia and locoregional), in some
      European and Anglo-Saxon hospitals for specific surgical indications (surgery area). It is
      commonly used in some hospitals.

      The hypnosedation is little used in oncology

      The hypnosedation is a hypnosis technique suitable for anesthesia, namely the one associated
      with intravenous conscious sedation and local anesthesia hypnosis. This derived from medical
      hypnosis Ericksoniene technique is divided into three stages:

        1. induction

        2. Deepening trance

        3. Déhypnotisation.

      This technique is currently being validated and used at national and international level, in
      fact it is based on 500 references and appears in the national nomenclature of the Common
      Classification of Medical Procedures in the code ANRP 001, states: hypnosis referred to
      analgesic.
