  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing a novel surgical device to facilitate safe circumcision among
      adult males. The investigators hypothesize that this device will allow non-medical providers
      to perform safe surgical circumcision without adverse events.

      Objective: To conduct a proof-of-concept study to determine the potential utility of a novel,
      adjustable single-visit, disposable device to facilitate rapid adult circumcision.

      Design: Prospective pilot trial of a novel surgical device Setting: Tertiary care Veterans
      Administration medical center Patients: 5 adult males Interventions: Circumcisions performed
      by junior trainees using an adjustable, single-size surgical-assist device constructed by the
      University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory.

      Main Outcome Measure(s): The attending surgeon and trainees completed standardized forms
      after each procedure to assess technical problems and ease of use. Follow-up visits were
      scheduled to evaluate adverse events, post-operative pain, cosmetic outcomes and participant
      satisfaction at 3, 8, 30 and 90 days post-operatively.

Specifically we looked at: time of surgery, blood loss, ease of use, cosmetic outcome, number of sutures required, need for conversion to another method of circumcision and need for revision surgeries.</description>
