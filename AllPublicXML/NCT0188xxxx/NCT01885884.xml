  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, randomized controlled trial of an embedded collaborative model of supportive
      care designed to improve quality of life and decrease use of unwanted healthcare services at
      the end of life for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We will enroll 30 patients who
      are receiving treatment at the Hillman Cancer Center for recently diagnosed, locally advanced
      or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as well as their accompanying caregivers and
      providers. Patients will be randomized to receive either the supportive care intervention or
      usual care. The purpose of this study is to refine an embedded collaborative model of
      supportive care and to develop protocols for recruitment, randomization, and longitudinal
      data collection.
