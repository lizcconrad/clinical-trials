      This study will build upon a previously approved protocol entitled &quot;A multi-center
      prospective, blinded, randomized crossover study to compare the Cerêve Sleep System at two
      different temperatures in primary insomnia patients&quot; (CIP-003; CER1-01-090). In that study,
      150 insomnia patients were targeted to be randomized to complete in lab assessments of sleep
      using the Cerêve Sleep System. In this follow-on study, 36 patients who completed the in lab
      study will be enrolled to complete 2 phases of in home use of the device. In the first phase,
      the durability study, 30 patients are targeted to complete additional in lab assessments
      following 30 days of in home use of the device. In the second phase, the home use pattern
      study, 24 patients are targeted to complete an additional 5 months of in home use in which
      their use patterns will be monitored.

      Hypothesis:

      EEG sleep latency and sleep efficiency following 30 days in home use of the device at 14-16°C
      will be similar to those measures after the initial acute, 2-night use in the parent study in
      the 14-16°C condition. The device will demonstrate a benign safety profile over 6 months in
      home use.

      Study Design Objectives of the Clinical Investigation

        -  Assess polysomnographically measured sleep latency and sleep efficiency following 30
           days in home use of the device and compare these measures with those following initial
           in lab use in the CIP-003 protocol.

        -  Determine the long-term use patterns of the Cerêve Sleep System in the environment of
           intended use.

      Study Design Overview A multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, two phase study to
      determine durability of effects following 30 days of in home use (phase I) and home use
      patterns over an additional 5 months in home use of the Cerêve Sleep System (phase II).

      A total of 30 evaluable subjects will be targeted to complete phase I and a total of 24
      evaluable subjects will be targeted to complete phase II. It is anticipated that 36 subjects
      will be enrolled into the CIP-004 protocol to obtain the numbers of evaluable subjects
      described.

      During in home use in both the durability phase and the home use patterns phase, the subject
      will be asked to use the device for a minimum of three nights each week for at least 4 hours
      on each of these nights up to seven nights each week. Subjects will complete a weekly home
      use log throughout both phases of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have completed the in-lab protocol CIP-003 and have signed an informed consent to
             participate in this follow-on study.

          -  Sleep latency and sleep efficiency data are available from the 2 in-lab PSG nights
             from CIP-003 in the 14-16° condition, as confirmed by the core laboratory.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of medications known to affect sleep or wake function (e.g., hypnotics,
             benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, antihistamines,
             decongestants, beta blockers, corticosteroids) are excluded for the durability phase,
             through the in-lab studies, in this protocol; Beta blockers which do NOT cross the
             blood brain barrier are acceptable.
