  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the feasibility of iSHIFTup (Internet Skin Health
      Intervention For Targeted Ulcer Prevention) for adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) to
      prevent serious pressure ulcers (PrUs) and promote protective health behaviors. This protocol
      is Phase 2 of a three phase project. In Phase 1, the investigators developed iSHIFTup. In
      Phase 2, the investigators will test the intervention by partnering with Woodrow Wilson
      Rehabilitation Center (WWRC) to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 18
      participants. In Phase 3, the investigators will focus on optimizing the intervention based
      on our outcome findings and feedback, sustaining the program at WWRC, and seeking future
      funding for a larger RCT.

      The investigators will conduct an RCT of up to 18 participants (9 participants in treatment
      as usual (TAU) group, 9 participants in TAU + iSHIFTup intervention group) (18 participants
      are needed to obtain statistically significant results).

      The investigators will meet with potential participants in-person to complete the informed
      consent process and confirm eligibility. Participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group will use the
      program during the study period. Participants randomized to TAU will have usual treatment
      during the study period and an opportunity to use the program following trial participation.
      The investigators will collect information from participants at two times during the study,
      at enrollment and post-intervention at 6-weeks (42 days). The investigators will also collect
      qualitative information from participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group, during an optional
      focus-group setting, to learn users' experiences with the program. The investigators expect
      participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group as compared to the TAU group, to display greater
      awareness of personal risk for pressure ulcers; increased preventive behaviors; and increased
      skin care self-efficacy and knowledge.
