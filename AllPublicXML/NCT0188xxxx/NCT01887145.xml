    <textblock>
      No randomized trials have compared long-term outcomes following endoscopic and open carpal
      tunnel release in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The investigators conducted a
      single-center randomized controlled trial between January 1998 and December 2002, including
      128 patients (25 to 60 years) with clinically diagnosed and electrophysiologically confirmed
      idiopathic CTS. The outcome measures included the validated CTS symptom severity and
      functional status scales completed at baseline and 1 year postoperatively. The trial showed
      that the 1-year outcomes of open and endoscopic carpal tunnel release regarding symptoms and
      function were equivalent. This extended follow-up of the randomized trial will primarily
      measure the symptom outcomes at 10-15 years after surgery. A questionnaire will be sent by
      mail to the patients. The questionnaire will consist of the CTS symptom severity and
      functional status scales, the 6-item CTS symptoms scale (CTS-6), the 11-item disabilities of
      the arm, shoulder and hand (QuickDASH), the 2-item palmar pain scale, and a visual analog
      scale about treatment satisfaction. The patients will also be asked about whether they had
      undergone further surgery for CTS in the same or contralateral hand after their operation in
      the randomized trial. The completed questionnaires will be scanned into a database. The
      scores for the different scales will be calculated. Analysis will include comparison between
      the open and endoscopic groups as well as within-group changes of scores from 1 year to 10-15
      years.

    <description>Surgery dwas done under local anesthesia injected at the portal sites only. Tourniquet was used. Each of the two skin incisions in the endoscopic procedure was 1 cm long. With the endoscope inserted from the distal portal and a hook knife inserted from the proximal portal, the transverse carpal ligament was divided from its distal edge to its proximal edge. Incisions were closed with non-absorbables sutures and a soft dressing was applied. Sutures were removed 10 days postoperatively.</description>

    <description>Open carpal tunnel release using conventional open technique under local anesthesia and tourniquet. The incision in the open procedure extended from about 1 cm proximal to 3 cm distal to the wrist crease. The transverse carpal ligament was divided; no additional procedures were performed. a soft dressing was applied. Dressing and sutures were removed 10 days postoperatively.</description>
