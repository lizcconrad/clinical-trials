      A randomized pilot study will be conducted, the goal of which is to determine which format
      represents the most viable approach to behavioral weight loss treatment with 18-25 year olds.
      Specifically, participants will be randomized to one of three arms; all arms will receive a
      12-week behavioral weight loss intervention, including identical dietary, physical activity,
      and weight loss prescriptions.

      A randomized pilot study will be conducted, the goal of which is to determine which format
      represents the most viable approach to behavioral weight loss treatment with 18-25 year olds.
      Specifically, participants will be randomized to one of three arms; all arms will receive a
      12-week behavioral weight loss intervention, including identical dietary, physical activity,
      and weight loss prescriptions. Behavioral goals / prescriptions will be the same, and basic
      content delivered will also be the same; only the format by which the intervention is
      delivered will differ among the treatment arms. A total of 45-55 participants, 18-25 years of
      age, with a BMI between 25 and 45 kg/m2 will be randomized to one of three groups: 1)
      Face-to-face brief behavioral weight loss (FBWL), 2) Web-based brief behavioral weight loss
      (WBWL), or 3) Web-based brief behavioral weight loss PLUS optional group sessions (WBWL
      Plus). Assessments will take place at 0 (baseline), 3 (post-treatment), and 6 months
      (follow-up).

    <description>Primary Aims Include:
To determine whether it is feasible to engage and retain 18-25 year olds in a clinic-based, face-to-face BWL program, as evidenced by achieving &gt;80% attendance at sessions and &gt;80% retention at post-treatment assessment visits.
To determine whether it is feasible to engage and retain 18-25 year-olds in a web-based BWL program, as evidenced by achieving &gt;80% completion of reporting activities and &gt;80% retention at post-treatment assessment visits.
To determine whether engagement and retention is improved in the web-based BWL program by the addition of optional in-person sessions.</description>

Participants in this arm will also have the option to attend several experiential group sessions that will help those interested to apply the material and skills they are being taught (e.g., cooking demonstration, circuit training). *New material / content is not provided in these optional sessions, rather they are meant to serve as a place to practice applying the core content from the lessons.</description>
