  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the phototherapy may be adjuvant to exercise to
      improve muscular efficiency and increase aerobic capacity. We hypothesized that phototherapy
      adjuvant with physical exercise may be benefit to populations with Diabetes mellitus that
      have impairment in cardiopulmonary fitness and low oxygen uptake peak values (VO2peak) in
      exercise tests. Two doses will be tested 150J and 300J.

      Additionally, this study aims to evaluate the effect of phototherapy previously applied to
      the exercise on the cardiovascular coupling. We hypothesize that phototherapy previously
      applied to the exercise will result in the increase baroreflex sensitivity (increased
      coherence and gain and decreased phase), promoting the improvement of the cardiovascular
      autonomic control and cardiovascular coupling in diabetic subjects. Two doses will be tested
      150J and 300J.

    <description>The near-infrared radiation by light emitting diode (LED) will be performed with a cluster multi-diode arranged in an array of 34x18 cm containing 50 LEDs (GaAlAs, 850 nm). The phototherapy will be applied bilaterally on femoral quadriceps and triceps surae muscles during 40 seconds with 3J of total energy for each diode and 150 J of total energy delivery to muscle. Neither subject nor evaluators will known if LED was effective or placebo during data collection. A hidden button in the LED device is employed to ensure the double-blind procedure. This button allows selecting placebo or effective emission of near-infrared radiation while the time display is working. This button will be selected by a researcher who just participated of randomization procedure and LED application and had no access to data collection.</description>
