  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as a group of diseases characterised by an elevated
      mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) â‰¥25 mmHg at rest. Recently, chronic myeloproliferative
      diseases (CMPD) associated with pulmonary hypertension were included in the group 5 category,
      corresponding to PH for which the aetiology is unclear and/or multifactorial. CMPD include
      chronic myelogenous leukaemia, chronic neutrophilic leukaemia and chronic eosinophilic
      leukaemia (which primarily express a myeloid phenotype and polycythaemia vera), idiopathic
      myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocytosis in which erythroid or megakaryocytic hyperplasia
      predominates.

      The purpose of this research:

        1. Assess Prevalence of PH in patients with CMPD in Northern Israel

        2. Describe the demographics and clinical course in patients with CMPD who are diagnosed
           with PH.
