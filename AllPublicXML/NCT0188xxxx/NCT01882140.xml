  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high incidence of burn injuries and mortality and morbidity as well as the high economic
      impact associated with this type of injury justifying the need to develop new technologies
      for the treatment of burn patients. Electrical stimulation for wound healing is a resource
      that has been increasingly used in routine physical therapists, but has the disadvantage of
      needing means of wet contact between the electrode and injury. The other resource used for
      therapeutic healing is conventional electrical stimulation of low intensity for capacitive
      field, a technique of physical therapy intervention not commercially available in Brazil.
      This new technology seems to have significant physiological effects in tissue repair and has
      been used for the treatment of chronic wounds which healed with difficulty. The objective is
      to analyze the effects of electrical stimulation of low intensity for capacitive field in
      healing skin burns. Patients from both genders aged over 18 years who have burns, will be
      evaluated and treated at the Emergency Unit of the Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of
      Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo. The stimulation will be initiated within 24 hours
      after surgery to perform the graft and will be held daily for 60 minutes during the patient's
      stay or until complete healing of the skin. The electromagnetic field will be placed on the
      care of the burned area and / or the donor skin graft, not interfering with departmental
      procedures. Will be performed photographic record standardized wound by a digital camera, and
      then quantified by a computer program. Expected to reduce the period of hospitalization and
      thus lowering the cost of treatment, and the possibility of improving the quality of life of
      patients.

Each image is calibrated by the tool &quot;Analyze / Set Scale&quot;, which allows you to adjust the measure in pixels / cm through the rule contained in the photo. After this standardization selecting the plugin &quot;Polygon&quot; delimiting the border of the lesion with the mouse saving in extension ROI.

    <description>Patients in the Study Group will receive daily treatment for 60 minutes. The treatment is initiated within 24 hours following surgery to achieve graft. Use of Electrical Stimulation by Capacitive Field was the only addition to the current standard of care of the Emergency Unit of HC-FMRP/USP. These Electrical Stimulation by Capacitive Field devices do not produce heat or cause any sensation in tissue. The equipment will produce an electrical stimulation of low intensity pulsed output (1.5 MHz, 1:4 duty cycles, 30mW). The electrodes consist of two metal plates (20x20cm) separated by an insulating material.</description>
