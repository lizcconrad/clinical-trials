  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the maintenance of antipsychotic efficacy and safety
      of risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) in patients with schizophrenia (psychiatric
      disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with
      delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) or schizoaffective (a mixed
      psychiatric disorder relating to a complex psychotic state that has features of both
      schizophrenia and a mood disorder such as bipolar disorder) disorder who were receiving
      treatment with any antipsychotic medication and who required a long-term antipsychotic
      therapy. The secondary aim is to investigate prospectively (a study that starts with the
      present condition of a population of individuals and follows them into the future) the
      prevalence of patients who met standardized remission criteria (according to Andreasen et al.
      criteria) and the psychopathological, psychosocial and subjective predictors of achieving
      remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      single-arm study conducted at 47 sites in Italy between January 2005 and April 2007.
      Approximately 338 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were receiving
      treatment with any antipsychotic medication and who required a long-term antipsychotic
      therapy will be switched directly to RLAI without an oral risperidone run-in (the elapsed
      time before a trial is started when no treatment is given to patients in the study). They
      will be considered either not optimally treated or symptom-free. Patients will be either not
      hospitalized or living in residential structures at the time of the enrollment as well as
      throughout the study. The maximum duration of study participation will be 52 weeks. Patient
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>GAF is a 100-point tool rating overall psychological, social and occupational functioning of adults. The higher score range (91-100) refers to a superior functioning in a wide range of activities, and absence of symptoms. The lower score range (1-10) refers to persistent danger of severely hurting self or others; or persistent inability to maintain minimum personal hygiene; or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>
