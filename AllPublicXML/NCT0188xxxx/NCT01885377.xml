      Objective: A randomized clinical trial in order to evaluate the efficacy of a specific
      exercise strategy for patients with subacromial pain.

      Hypothesis:

      H1 - The three month specific exercise strategy has a satisfactory effect improving shoulder
      function and/or shoulder pain.

      H0 - No difference between the two exercise strategies (specific exercise strategy and active
      control exercises).

      Method: Patients attending primary care with subacromial pain are offered participation. If
      accepted, they will participate in a three month rehabilitation program. The duration of
      symptoms can vary from 2 weeks and longer. The patients will be randomized to either
      rehabilitation; the specific exercise strategy or active control exercises. All patients has
      an equal number of sessions with the physical therapist (PT) to offer similar attention and
      support with exercise performance. A blinded physical therapist evaluates the following
      outcomes at baseline and after three-, six and twelve months:

      Primary outcomes: Constant-Murley shoulder assessment (CM-score). Secondary outcomes;
      Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH), different aspects of pain by
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), EuroQol-5D index (EQ-5D) and EuroQol-VAS (EQ-VAS), The Patient
      Specific functional Scale, and Patients' global impression of change (PGIC). Also sick-leave
      and return to work will be recorded. All patients are evaluated with a diagnostic ultrasound
      to reveal the status of the rotator cuff.

      Additional to the analysis of treatment effect on shoulder function and pain, factors
      influencing and explaining the CM-score at follow-ups will be analyzed.

      This study is warranted in order to evaluate if an earlier reported positive effect on
      shoulder function and pain with the specific exercise strategy, in patients on waiting list
      for subacromial decompression, can be repeated in the primary care population of patients
      with subacromial pain. There is no consensus about first-line exercises for patients with
      subacromial pain, and these positive results on pain and shoulder function need to be
      reproduced in primary care before they can be recommended and implemented. Further, knowledge
      about which factors that can be used in prediction rules for patients that will respond to
      the exercises or needs surgery is lacking.
