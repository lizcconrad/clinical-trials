  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) or common baldness is the most common cause of hair loss in
           both men and women and is caused by the action of androgens in genetically predisposed
           individuals.

        -  This clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using a
           preparation of autologous plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) in the treatment
           of androgenetic alopecia.

    <description>Hair cycle has different phases. Two of the most important are anagen (active growth phase of hair follicles) and telogen (resting phase of the hair follicle). This secondary outcome measure allows to measure the efficacy of the PRGF-Endoret treatment.</description>
