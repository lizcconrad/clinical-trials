    <textblock>
      A preliminary demonstration of the Safety of IPBS in positioning a vacuum assisted biopsy
      (VAB) tool to enable an MRI-guided automated breast biopsy. This will consist of 10-15 biopsy
      procedures facilitated by the MRI-guided system. Patients will be followed after the
      procedure to assess clinical outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients over the age of 18 with suspected or confirmed breast cancer requiring
             a manual MRI-guided breast biopsy for diagnosis and staging.

          -  Individuals Capable of giving a free and informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient for whom the manual MRI-guided breast biopsy procedure would not be
             possible (size of patient, etc.).

          -  Patients who refuse the procedure for any reason will be excluded from the study at
             the investigators discretion.

          -  Patients who are not suitable for the procedure will be excluded at the investigators
             discretion.

          -  Patients unwilling to complete associated study questionnaires or follow up visits.
