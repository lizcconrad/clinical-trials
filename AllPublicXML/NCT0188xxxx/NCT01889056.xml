  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blood hormone Erythropoietin (Epo) is not only produced by the kidneys but also by the
      brain, especially under hypoxic conditions. It has been shown in animal studies and human
      studies that Epo has neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, there is scientific evidence
      for central modulatory effects of Epo in the brain but high dose of Epo is needed to overcome
      the blood brain barrier. In a double blind placebo controlled crossover study we will
      investigate the effects of a single high dose of Epo on cognitive function and exercise
      capacity in healthy subjects. The subjects will receive a single high dose of Epo (60.000 IU)
      and will perform a computerized cognitive test battery, a breathing test, a maximal exercise
      capacity test (VO2max), and a time trial (TT) 24 hours after the treatment. The primary
      outcome of the study will be the cognitive function.
