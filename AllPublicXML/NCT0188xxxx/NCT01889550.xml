      The research aims at generating new knowledge about ways to inform pregnant women about
      prenatal screening for Downs syndrome.

      The overall purpose of this project is to increase pregnant women's knowledge of prenatal
      screening for Downs syndrome, and thereby an option to make an informed choice. The project
      is planned as a research into whether the use of an eHealth solution (in this project an
      interactive website) may be an appropriate intervention for pregnant women.

      Prenatal screening and diagnosis is testing for diseases or rare conditions in the fetus
      before birth. The aim is to assist the pregnant women to make their own decisions, and
      neutral and adequate counseling is a prerequisite during prenatal diagnosis. To make an
      informed choice, the pregnant women must be informed about the benefits and potential
      disadvantages of prenatal diagnosis and with this background be able to make a comprehensive
      evaluation, where ethical values will have a high impact.

      The overall purpose of this project is to increase pregnant women's knowledge of prenatal
      screening for Downs syndrome, and thereby an option to make an informed choice. The project
      is planned as a research into whether the use of an eHealth solution (in this project an
      interactive website) may be an appropriate intervention for pregnant women.

      Methods:

      Part one consists of an identification of the problem

      Part two consists of developing a website with relevant information about prenatal screening
      for Downs syndrome.

      Part three is an effect measurement. The effect of the intervention is measured through a
      randomized controlled trail in which the essentials of the measurement will be the pregnant
      women's knowledge and behavior in relation to prenatal diagnosis. Twice 300 pregnant women
      will be included in the project.

      Results:

      The research aims at generating new knowledge about ways to inform pregnant women about
      prenatal diagnosis and prenatal screening. The expected results are:

        -  Higher knowledge about prenatal diagnosis for the pregnant women.

        -  Less difficulty in making an informed choice for the coming parents.

        -  Easy access to high quality information.

        -  Equity in access to high quality information.
