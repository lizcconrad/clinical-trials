    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TXA127 to reduce the incidence
      (Grade II-IV) of acute Graft-vs.-Host Disease (aGVHD) in adult subjects undergoing double
      umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). The study will also evaluate the effects of
      TXA127 on incidence, severity and duration of mucositis; neutrophil engraftment and platelet
      recovery; platelet transfusion requirements; immune reconstitution; and duration of
      corticosteroid use. TXA127 has shown to be well tolerated by patients and appears to induce
      rapid production of neutrophils and platelets in the bloodstream, as well as increase the
      immune system components. TXA127 has also been shown reduce the severity of
      chemotherapy-induced mucositis.

      Cord blood (CB) as a hematopoietic stem cell source has multiple advantages. Cord blood is
      normally discarded at birth and can easily be collected and stored. Availability of numerous
      CB banks has resulted in genetically diverse CB units including those from non-Caucasians.
      Once a suitable CB unit is located, confirmatory typing can be quickly performed and a donor
      unit can be shipped to the transplant center. Furthermore, because a CB graft results in a
      lower incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), one or two antigen-mismatches may be
      acceptable for transplantation. Despite these advantages, CB has a significant drawback: the
      number of hematopoietic stem cells obtained from a unit of CB is significantly lower than
      from a bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest. The number of stem
      cells can be increased by transplanting two cord blood units, however the incidence of GVHD
      increases in patients receiving two CB units compared to patients who receive one unit.
      Another issue in this population is mucositis, as a result of myeloablative conditioning
      given prior to the transplant, which can be debilitating to patients. TXA127 is
      pharmaceutically-formulated angiotensin 1-7, a non-hypertensive derivative of angiotensin II
      (which contains the 8th amino acid conferring receptor binding to blood pressure receptors).
      TXA127 has multilineage effects on hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and in vivo. The
      hematopoietic properties demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies support the
      investigation of TXA127 to reduce the incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and mucositis in this
      patient population.
