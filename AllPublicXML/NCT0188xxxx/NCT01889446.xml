  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propionic acid (PA) is used as a preservative in foods such as cheeses, baked goods, or
      additive for artificial fruit flavors. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers it
      safe and therefore, has no limitation on its use. Since PA has been shown before to serve as
      a substrate for glucose production in the liver, the purpose of this study is to find out if
      PA intake causes changes in levels of glucose, insulin and other important hormones following
      a meal.

      This research study will compare PA to placebo. The placebo looks exactly like the active
      substance, but it does not contain any active agent (PA). Placebos are used in research
      studies to see if the results are due to the study drug or to other reasons.

      The investigators plan to have 20 subjects take part in this study at the Brigham and Women's
      Hospital (BWH).

      -To test whether PA, added as food supplement to humans, results in altered post-prandial
      metabolism. The investigators propose to conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo
      controlled, cross-over study in which blood levels of metabolites and hormones will be
      measured in healthy volunteers following a mixed meal test without or with PA.

      Study design:

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over study. Twenty volunteers
      who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized into two groups, provided with a
      mixed meal without or with calcium proprionate (also known as E282). A week later,
      participants will be provided with a mixed meal again, following cross-over of the groups.
      Blood will be collected at baseline, and every 30 minutes for 4 hours.

      Study Subjects:

      20 healthy male and female volunteers (ages 18 to 65 years) with a body mass index (BMI) of
      20 to &lt;30 Kg/m2.

    <description>Addition of calcium propionate (PA arm) in a capsule (1000 mg) consumed together with a mixed meal of 500 kCal in the morning following an overnight fast. Blood is taken at baseline and every 30 minutes for 4 hours. This arm is compared to a placebo capsule (following identical protocol). Following a washout period of a week, the arms will be crossed over and the PA arm participants will repeat the same protocol in the 'placebo arm'.</description>
