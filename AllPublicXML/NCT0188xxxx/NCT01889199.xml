      The purpose of this research study is to collect specimen samples and study medical
      information from women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and women without PCOS. The goal
      is to learn more about the changes that take place in the body that result in PCOS.

      We anticipate that 59 women will take part in this study (15 without PCOS and 44 with PCOS).
      All patients will undergo a physical exam, blood tests, and ultrasound of their ovaries. If
      they meet the criteria for this study, they will then undergo additional blood tests, removal
      of a small amount of subcutaneous abdominal fat, measurement of regional body fat (i.e., MRI,
      DXA scan), a modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT), and
      determination of ovarian function (via a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] test). The women
      without PCOS will be complete the study at this point.

      The women with PCOS will be randomized to receive the drug flutamide 125 mg/day or placebo.
      They will take the drug every day for six 28-day cycles. They will be asked to collect and
      store a urine sample once a week. They will also be asked to complete a pill diary and
      menstrual diary. Once a month while they are taking the flutamide/placebo, they will return
      to the clinic and bring their frozen urine samples. At that time they will undergo a physical
      exam, toxicity assessment, and blood draw.

      Quality of Life assessments will be done at the beginning of the study for all participants.
      Women with PCOS who are taking the flutamide or placebo will be asked to repeat the Quality
      of Life assessments during the study and at the end of the study.

      Six months following the completion of protocol procedures, participants who received
      flutamide/placebo will be contacted by phone to check on the status of their health. They
      will be asked if they have experienced any health problems or have become pregnant since they
      completed the study procedures.

      After the six 28-day cycles are completed they will then undergo additional blood tests,
      removal of a small amount of subcutaneous abdominal fat, measurement of regional body fat
      (i.e., MRI, DXA scan), a modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test
      (FSIGTT), and determination of ovarian function (via a FSH test).

      Aim 1. Compare differences in SC abdominal adipogenesis of lean PCOS women vs. age- and
      BMI-matched controls Subjects and clinical assessment: We will recruit 36 lean (18.5-25
      kg/M2) PCOS subjects and 12 age- and BMI-matched controls. Subjects will complete a
      standardized questionnaire emphasizing menstrual dating, abnormal hair growth and acne. The
      questionnaire also will annotate age, smoking status, medications, surgical history and
      family histories of excess hair growth in female relatives and of diabetes in parents or
      siblings for exclusion criteria and for inclusion of some basic traits as covariates.
      Subjects also will undergo a physical examination; hirsutism will be scored by the modified
      Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) method. Transvaginal sonography (TVUS) will be performed to determine
      the presence or absence of polycystic ovaries. A screening blood sample will be obtained for
      determinations of steroid hormones, SHBG, TSH, and prolactin.

      Non-Hispanic Caucasian women between the ages of 18 and 35 years will be recruited to avoid
      confounding differences as a function of race. PCOS patients will be diagnosed by 1990 NIH
      criteria. Controls will have regular menstrual cycles at 21 to 35 day intervals, a luteal
      phase progesterone (P4) level &gt; 3 ng/mL, and no evidence of hirsutism, acne, alopecia,
      polycystic ovaries or endocrine dysfunction. Exclusion criteria are: present/past history (&lt;5
      years) of smoking, cancer, alcohol abuse, drug addiction, severe depression, or post
      traumatic stress; diabetes; uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 165/100); clinically significant
      hepatic or renal disease, or other major medical illness; signs or symptoms of infection;
      recent (within 30 days) use of an experimental device; recent (within 6 months) use of
      androgens, anabolic steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; recent (within 3
      months) use of hormonal agents (including birth control pills or insulin sensitizers); use of
      the drug warfarin.

      Studies will be conducted in the follicular phase in controls and during amenorrhea in PCOS
      women. All subjects will undergo a modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance
      test (FSIGTT). Glucose in the form of a 50% solution (0.3 g/kg) and regular human insulin
      (0.03 units/kg) will be injected through an intravenous line at 0 and 20 min, respectively.
      Blood will be collected at -20, -15, −5, 0, 2, 4, 8, 19, 22, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90, and 180 min
      for glucose and insulin determinations. Mathematical modeling of serial glucose and insulin
      determinations will calculate: insulin sensitivity index (SI, i.e. the action of insulin to
      accelerate glucose uptake and suppress glucose production), glucose effectiveness index (SG,
      i.e. the combined effect of glucose to enhance glucose uptake and suppress endogenous glucose
      production at basal insulin levels) and the acute response to glucose (AIRG).

      Adipocytes isolation and culture: Approximately 1-3 gm of fat will be obtained from the lower
      SC abdomen using standard procedures under local anesthesia. Adipocytes (fat cells) and
      surrounding fat tissue will be isolated to measure adipocyte cell number and diameter, lipid
      accumulation and function, adiponectin, and stem cell development.

      Procedures: All procedures will be performed in normal and PCOS women at the start of study.

      i). Venipuncture: Fasting blood will be collected for blood count, chemistry panel, LH, FSH,
      total/free T, DHT, A4, DHEAS, E1, E2, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), SHBG, adiponectin, IL-6,
      lipid profile and free fatty acids (FFAs).

      ii ). Body composition: Body composition will be assessed by BMI, waist-to-hip circumference
      and DEXA scanning. Girths will be measured at the waist (narrowest section of the torso
      between ribs and umbilicus) and hips (largest protrusion of the hip region, above the gluteal
      fold). For total body fat and regional fat distribution, whole body scans will be performed,
      utilizing DEXA imaging.

      iii). Body fat distribution: Total body DEXA will measure abdominal fat (i.e., the area
      between the dome of the diaphragm and the top of the hip. Total body DEXA images also will
      determine % body fat; fat-free body mass; total body, abdominal, and leg fat; and abdomen/leg
      fat mass ratio. The leg region is that area below the top of the hip bone (greater
      trochanter).

      Multiple axial abdominal MRI slices from the diaphragm to the pelvis will assess
      cross-sectional areas of SC abdominal and visceral fat.

      iv). Ovarian testing:

        1. Ovarian morphology: Transvaginal ultrasound will be performed in the follicular phase in
           controls and during amenorrhea in PCOS women. Ovarian volume will be calculated. Antral
           follicle number, defined as the total follicle number (2-9 mm in diameter) of both
           ovaries, will be determined by 1 investigator (D.A.D.). Polycystic ovaries will be
           defined by 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2-9 mm in diameter, and/or
           increased ovarian volume (&gt; 10 ml), with one such ovary sufficient to define PCO.

        2. Estradiol (E2) response to recombinant human (rh)FSH. Blood samples will be drawn
           through an indwelling iv catheter at 0.5-h intervals for 2 h before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5,
           2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h after 150 U rhFSH injection. The E2 response to
           rhFSH will be assessed before and after adjusting for numbers of TVUS-detected ovarian
           antral follicles.

      Aim 2. Examine effect of flutamide in lean PCOS women on SC abdominal adipogenesis, visceral
      adipose content and ovarian folliculogenesis.

      Modified FSIGTT and Adipogenic studies: The modified FSIGTT and all adipogenic studies
      performed at study initiation will be repeated at the end of the 6-month flutamide vs.
      placebo intervention in PCOS women.

      Procedures: All procedures performed at study initiation also will be repeated at the end of
      the six 28-day cycles of flutamide vs. placebo intervention in PCOS women. In addition,
      monthly liver function studies will be performed to detect possible elevations of serum
      transaminase levels above the normal range during flutamide vs. placebo therapy.

      Menstrual records and urinary pregnanediol glucuronide (UPDG): Ovulatory frequency will be
      determined by having subjects keep a daily menstrual record and collect weekly first morning
      urine samples for UPDG and creatinine assay. Urine samples will be frozen for later analysis
      to determine evidence of ovulation.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Women with PCOS exhibit impaired glucose tolerance that correlates with enlarged subcutaneous (SC) abdominal adipocytes. Since a common denominator to these abnormalities is hyperandrogenism, we hypothesize that 6-month flutamide (antiandrogen) administration to lean PCOS women will improve glucose tolerance by glucose tolerance testing and reduce subcutaneous (SC) abdominal adipocyte size, as determined by SC abdominal fat biopsy.</description>

    <description>This study carefully considers the safety of low-dose flutamide in examining how hyperandrogenism in PCOS affects ovarian function, subcutaneous fat storage and glucose metabolism. The 125 mg oral dose of flutamide has been specifically chosen because it has not been associated with liver enzyme abnormalities (0%, 62.5-125 mg/day), while being as effective as high dose flutamide in improving androgenic symptoms. Furthermore, in the rare event mild elevation of hepatic enzymes occurs with low-dose flutamide despite its dose-dependency, it is easily detected and reversible.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-Hispanic Caucasian women between the ages of 18 to 35 years.

        Groups will be: 12 lean controls (Aim 1); 36 age- and BMI-matched PCOS women randomized to
        flutamide vs. placebo for 6 months (Aims 1 and 2).

        i) Lean patients with PCOS: 36 subjects with PCOS (defined by 1990 NIH criteria [all
        Aims]), BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2. This BMI range is defined as normal and has been chosen to
        examine underlying mechanisms of PCOS-related androgen excess in the genesis of adipogenic
        and ovarian dysfunction, independent of obesity.

        ii) Lean control women: 12 healthy subjects, BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2. Controls will have regular
        menstrual cycles, and no evidence of hirsutism, acne, alopecia, polycystic ovaries, and/or
        endocrine dysfunction. This BMI range has been chosen to match that of the PCOS group.

        Up to 44 lean PCOS patients and 15 lean controls will be recruited, for a total of 59 study
        participants over a 5-year interval, accounting for a 20% rate of patient drop-out or
        insufficient adipose procurement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for study participation are: present or past history (&lt;5 years) of
             smoking, cancer, alcohol abuse, drug addiction, severe depression, or post traumatic
             stress; diabetes; uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 165/100); clinically significant
             hepatic or renal disease, or other major medical illness; recent (within 3 months) use
             of androgens, anabolic steroids or hormonal agents (including birth control pills or
             insulin sensitizers). These exclusion criteria are chosen to avoid effects from
             medical conditions, environmental factors or exogenous agents. Women taking the drug
             warfarin, CYP active medications, or herbs will be excluded.

        Since this study involves MRI testing, women with pacemakers, metal implants, or
        claustrophobia will be excluded.

        The screener will assess the participants response to establish if depression or drug use
        exclude participation in this study.

        Women taking beta blockers will be excluded.

        Women who have taken birth control pills or had a Mirena IUD or used Plan B contraception
        during the previous 3 months will be excluded.
