  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the tolerability and effectiveness of pregnenolone in the treatment of
      behavioral deficits in adults with autism. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring hormone
      found in the body which has been shown to help with the function of nerve cells. It is also
      shown to modulate the activity of certain brain receptors implicated in autism. We hope to
      examine the tolerability of pregnenolone in adults with autism.

      This study will assess the tolerability and effectiveness of pregnenolone in the treatment of
      behavioral deficits in adults with autism. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring hormone
      found in the body which has been shown to help with the function of nerve cells. It is also
      shown to modulate the activity of certain brain receptors implicated in autism.

      Pregnenolone has been used safely in research studies involving individuals with
      schizophrenia. In the proposed trial, we hope to examine the tolerability of pregnenolone in
      adults with autism. We hope to see improvement in behavioral outcomes as measured by
      standardized behavioral measures. Further, we will measure concentrations of pregnenolone and
      related neuroactive compounds in the blood. The use of pregnenolone has been studied in a
      number of mental disorders but not autism. Thus, we hope the study will identify new avenues
      of research for the treatment of autism.

    <description>With Baseline serving as approximately day 1, twice daily intake of orally administered pregnenolone will occur on a schedule consisting of an up-titration followed by a down-titration as described below.
Week 1 and 2: 100 mg
Week 3 and 4: 200 mg
Week 5 and 6: 300 mg
Week 7 and 8: 400 mg

At the end of Week 12, pregnenolone was decreased by 50 mg twice a day every 3 days until it was discontinued.
If the participant is unable to tolerate a specific dose then he/she will be maintained at the highest tolerated dose until down titration occurs.</description>

Pregnenolone: With Baseline serving as approximately day 1, twice daily intake of orally administered pregnenolone will occur on a schedule consisting of an up-titration followed by a down-titration as described below.
Week 1 and 2: 100 mg
Week 3 and 4: 200 mg

At the end of Week 12, pregnenolone was decreased by 50 mg twice a day every 3 days until it was discontinued.
If the participant is unable to tolerate a specific dose then he/she will be maintained at the highest tolerated dose until down titration occurs.</description>

          <title>Pregnenolone</title>
          <description>Pregnenolone was not associated with any severe adverse effects. Single episodes of tiredness (n = 1), diarrhea (n = 1), and depressive affect (n = 1) that could possibly be related to pregnenolone were reported. A few other adverse events with remote chance to be related to the medication were reported: increased excitement/agitation (n = 3), sleep problems (n = 1), drowsiness (n = 1), anorexia/decreased appetite (n = 2), increased motor activity (n = 1), sweating (n = 1), constipation (n = 1), diarrhea (n = 1), tremor (n = 1), and depressive affect (n = 1). No significant vital sign or EKG changes occurred in any study participants. No abnormal laboratory tests were caused by pregnenolone.</description>
