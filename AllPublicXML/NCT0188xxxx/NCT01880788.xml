  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be designed as a case control evaluation to compare the genetic profiles of
      three groups of patients categorized according to diagnosis.

      Group 1 - CNV secondary to CSC Group 2 - CSC without CNV Group 3 - CNV secondary to advanced
      AMD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if patients presenting with type 1 neovascularization believed to be secondary
      to CSC are genetically distinct from typical CSC patients without neovascularization or
      patients presenting with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to advanced AMD.
      Disease associated markers detecting variants in ARMS 2, Complement Factor H (CFH) Complement
      component 3 (C3), Complement component 2 (C2) , Factor B (FB), VEGFA or other genetic
      polymorphisms associated with CNV will be evaluated to determine if the CSC neovascular group
      is genetically distinct from the CSC group without neovascularization or the advanced AMD
      group.
