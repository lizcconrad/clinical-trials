  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our recent prospective randomized controlled study comparing single-port vs. multiport
      laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal herniorraphy (NCT 01660048) demonstrated
      superiority of the single-port technique in reducing post-op pain/analgesic requirements,
      quicker return to work/normal physical activities and improved cosmetic scar scores. During
      this study all patients underwent the initial extraperitoneal dissection with the distension
      balloon. However, the balloon itself costs AU $380 per device which represents a significant
      percentage of the overall cost of the procedure (when the hospital/operating rooms cost is
      approximately AU $2500 for a unilateral laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair) especially if
      only unilateral inguinal herniorraphy is performed.

      The European Hernia Society Guidelines encourage the use of the distension balloon for the
      initial distension/dissection of the extraperitoneal space especially during the learning
      curve. This recommendation arises from the fact that during the conventional multiport repair
      the umbilical port allows only the insertion of the laparoscope and the extraperitoneal space
      cannot easily be dissected with the scope itself, especially in patients with well-developed
      linea alba extending down to the pubic symphysis, and the camera itself, if used as
      dissection device, would become smudged and it would have to be repeatedly withdrawn for
      cleaning. Yet this must occur since the extraperitoneal space must be dissected in the
      midline sufficiently for safe insertion of two additional 5 mm ports for insertion of
      dissecting instruments in order to complete the extraperitoneal space dissection and the
      repair.

      With single incision laparoscopic surgery the use of the Triport™ system ensure that the port
      can be place under direct vision into the extraperitoneal space when the scope and two
      dissecting instruments can be safely inserted at the outset. In this way the extraperitoneal
      space can be dissected under direct vision. The balloon dissection is essentially a blind
      dissection even though the balloon distension is being observed by the scope, incorrect
      tissue planes can be entered ie the dissection can occur below the pre-peritoneal fascia
      exposing the nerves in the groin with the potential risks for nerve damage and entrapment.
      This is an argument that surgeons who practise transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia
      repair use to justify their superior technique over the TEP repair because, in the TAPP
      repair, the peritoneum is carefully dissected free from and leaving the underlying
      preperitoneal fascia intact.

      While the use of the balloon, when some 25 &quot;pumps&quot; of air are used during the insufflation,
      to create a significant space to place not only the two 5 mm ports but also to create a
      significant extraperitoneal dissection when usually only the lateral space and the hernia sac
      need to be dissected this is not always possible. In patients who have had previous lower
      abdominal surgery including previous anterior inguinal herniorraphy (especially if the mesh
      plug is used) the balloon dissention is normally judicious as one cannot predict whether
      there are any significant peritoneal or even bowel adhesions. Consequently, in such cases,
      the balloon distension is normally confined to an area just inferior to the umbilical port
      and superior to the pubic symphysis so that there is just enough extraperitoneal dissection
      to place the two 5 mm trocars. Usually this means only using only 5 pumps of air in the
      distension balloon for placement of two 5 mm trocars. Then the dissection of the
      extraperitonealy space under direct vision can take place. The use of the distension balloon
      in such cases represents an enormous waste of resources since AU $380 is spent just to create
      enough space to place the two 5 mm ports and hence allowing the insertion of the dissecting
      instruments. With the Triport+™ port the dissecting instruments can easily be placed in the
      extraperitoneal space and the dissection can begin under direct vision hence achieving the
      same safe dissection that TAPP surgeons claim to perform.

      In this study we aim to look at the safety and efficacy of telescopic vs. balloon dissection
      by prospectively comparing a similar former group of patients to the ones who had previously
      undergone single-port inguinal herniorraphy with balloon dissection in our previous study
      (NCT 01660048).

      All patients having surgical treatment of groin hernia at St Luke's and Holroyd Private
      Hospitals are subject to very careful assessment and study. All patients are requested to
      report immediately if there are any problems.

      This study will compare the extraperitoneal dissection during single-port laparoscopic total
      extraperitoneal repair of inguinal/femoral hernias using the traditional balloon dissection
      and the telescopic dissection techniques.

      Laparoscopic hernia repair was first introduced in 1990. The uptake rate was slow to start
      off with such that in 1994 only 9.7% of all inguinal hernias were performed laparoscopically
      However, in 2012, the figure now stands at 48% Australia-wide.
      (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au). Indeed, in the State of New South Wales this figure stands at
      51%, which means that it is the commonest operation performed for inguinal hernias in this
      State.

      Up to 2009, the laparoscopic hernia repair involves the insertion of 3 ports: 10mm port in
      the infra-umbilical region for the camera via a 2 cm incision and 2 x 5 mm working ports
      usually in the midline for the dissecting instruments via 2 x 10 mm incisions. These ports
      are called secondary trocars which are usually sharp. Their insertion has the potential to
      cause bowel and vascular injuries.

      The European Hernia Society guidelines (www.herniaweb.org) on the treatment of inguinal
      hernias have shown (conventional) endoscopic techniques to be associated with higher rates of
      port-site hernias and visceral injuries especially during the learning curve period.

      A recent study of 37,000 gynaecological laparoscopies in the US showed a bowel injury rate of
      0.16%; a third of these led to the death of the patients. 22% of all bowel injuries resulted
      from the insertion of secondary trocars
      (www.danaise.com/vascular_and_bowel_injuries_duri.htm).

      Another report from a large hernia centre in the US showed that in the first 300
      transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repairs 2 bowel injuries (and one bladder injury) were
      observed. Indeed, when these investigators changed the technique to a TEP repair they also
      observed 2 bowel injuries (and one bladder injury) in the first 300 TEP repairs.
      (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11178763) Therefore bowel and vascular injuries during
      laparoscopic surgery are real but they are often under reported.

      Single incision laparoscopic surgery, where all the instruments are placed in a single port,
      has the primary aim of preventing vascular and bowel injury through the use of completely
      blunt trocars as in the case of the SILS™ port. The first case of laparoscopic TEP repair was
      reported in 2009. Since then there have numerous reports confirming the safety and efficacy
      of the single-port technique.

      The principle author, Dr Hanh Tran, has been performing single incision laparoscopic hernia
      repair since October 2009. To date, he has performed in excess of 600 cases with excellent
      results and this was confirmed in a recently completed prospective randomized controlled
      study comparing single-port vs. multiport laparoscopic inguinal herniorraphy (NCT 01660048)
      in achieving successful cure of hernias, no complications including wound infection, reduced
      post-op pain/analgesic requirements, earlier return to work/physical activities, high patient
      satisfaction and excellent cosmetic results.

      However this was achieved at significant additional costs because of the use of the single
      ports. These costs were not reimbursed by the medical insurance companies. The single-port
      technique allows for direct insertion of the dissecting instruments into the extraperitoneal
      space where complete dissection can occur under direct vision as supposed to blind dissection
      with the balloon dissector just so that two 5mm ports can be inserted during multiport TEP
      repair.

      It is proposed that 51 (or more) patients will be enrolled into the study and this will be
      compared to the previous 51 patients in the previous RCT with balloon dissection. The
      single-port TEP inguinal herniorraphy is exactly the same in both procedures except in the
      telescopic technique the dissection of the extraperitoneal dissection is done under direct
      vision without the use of the balloon dissector.

      The main disadvantage of the single port technique is the relative loss of triangulation and
      the principle author has shown that this can be overcome with the use of a longer and smaller
      laparoscope (of which Holroyd Private Hospital has bought two specifically for this purpose),
      different dissecting techniques and with increased experience. Therefore, if a surgeon is not
      experienced with this technique the operation and its success can be compromised by
      inadequate dissection. The author (who has performed over 2500 TEP repairs over the past 13
      years) believes that the learning curve for single-port TEP hernia repair for a highly
      experienced TEP surgeon is around 25-50 ie after this number the operation time will approach
      that of the standard three ports TEP repair and this has been shown in our recently completed
      RCT. He has performed in excess of 600 Single-port Laparoscopic hernia repairs since October
      2009. Therefore the success of the operation for patients in either arm of the study will not
      be compromised by lack of experience.

      The follow up of these patients will be no different to those followed up under the protocol
      of the Sydney Hernia Specialists/Clinic. This is a standard follow up and is consistent with
      normal clinical practice.

      In summary, the goals are simple. (i) To perform single-port laparoscopic TEP inguinal
      herniorraphy with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection; (ii) To assess the efficacy of the
      newer telescopic dissection technique in a rigorous scientific manner; (iii) To report any
      unexpected problems or complications; (iv) To follow up patients treated laparoscopically to
      ensure that the single-port technique with balloon dissection or telescopic dissection have
      as good results as or better in terms of cure of hernia (absence of recurrence of the hernia)
      and less complications and better cosmetic results as that which is achieved when the
      traditional 3-ports technique is used and; (v) to assess the outcomes of patients undergoing
      telescopic dissection vs. balloon dissection.
