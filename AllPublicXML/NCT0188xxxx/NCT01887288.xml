      To evaluate the Growth Modulation Index (GMI) of the combination of metronomic capecitabine
      with oral digoxin in metastatic breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II study, the Investigators will combine metronomic capecitabine with digoxin
      to treat metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed on both anthracyclines and
      taxanes. We hypothesize that the combination of digoxin with metronomic capecitabine may lead
      to increased efficacy and duration of treatment without progression with decreased side
      effects than standard regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients ≥ 18 years of age with histologically confirmed, metastatic breast cancer
             resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes

          2. Anthracycline resistance is defined as tumor progression during treatment or within 3
             months of last dose in the metastatic setting, or recurrence within 6 months in the
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Alternatively, a minimum cumulative dose of
             anthracycline of 240 mg/m^2 (doxorubicin) or 360 mg/m^2 (epirubicin) has been reached,
             or there is contraindication to use anthracycline, the patient is also eligible

          3. Taxane resistance is defined as recurrence within 4 months of the last dose in the
             metastatic setting or within 12 months in the adjuvant setting

          4. Having progressed on anti-HER2 or hormonal therapy if they have HER2 positive or
             hormone-receptor positive breast cancer

             g/dL

          8. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range, total bilirubin ≤ 2
             mg/dL, AST/ALT ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal range
