      1. Verify the effect of Erlotinib concurrent whole-brain radiation therapy as ﬁrst-line
           treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer to
           compare with WBRT alone.

        2. Verify pre-built EGFR mutation prediction model for NSCLC brain metastases

      All patients will be randomized to receive WBRT or Erlotinib concurrent WBRT. Erlotinib
      concurrent WBRT, patients were given a loading dose of erlotinib 150mg per day for 6 days,
      after which all patients received erlotinib 150mg per day concurrently with WBRT. Dose
      reduction was allowed for intolerable adverse effects (grade ≥3) such as rash or diarrhea in
      50 mg increments down from 150mg to 100 mg and then to 50 mg if needed. Radiation therapy was
      delivered in 2.0 Gy fractions once per day 5 days per week to a total dose of 40Gy (20
      fractions). Radiation was delivered as opposed lateral 8-MV beams with a Sweden precise
      linear accelerator.
