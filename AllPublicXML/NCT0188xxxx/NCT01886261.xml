    <textblock>
      Usability of the PALMS system, validity of the PALMS system and added value to an existing
      cohort study.

      Hypothesis: Addition of GPS device and use of PALMS system will allow researchers to better
      examine place-based interventions.

    <textblock>
      The Personal Activity Location Measurement System (PALMS) researchers at UCSD have created a
      web-based processing system for location (GPS) and physical activity (accelerometer) data. We
      will collect data on a pilot sample of 40 Hispanic persons to a) test the validity of PALMS
      assessments of transportation modes, and activity in different locations against an objective
      record of activities derived from images collected by Vicon Revue; b) compare PALMS
      assessments of transportation modes and activity locations to other self-report measures and
      interview measures; c) assess the construct validity of PALMS-based activity assessment.

      We will be assessing the usability of PALMS in a research staff with no previous experience
      of using the PALMS system. We will be assessing the added value of using PALMS to examine a
      place-based intervention in an existing cohort study.

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Construct validity assesses the theoretical relationship of a measure (and resulting variables) with other variables. The multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM) is a procedure first developed by Campbell and Fiske to asses construct validity by creating a fully crossed method-by-measure matrix of associations among multiple constructs and multiple measurement methods. The resulting matrix of correlation coefficients gives a pattern of associations that informs the validity evidence of the measure and construct. We will use the following measures in the multitrait multimethod matrix: Neighborhood Physical Activity Questionnaire, the American Timeuse Survey, and PALMS based physical activity in location estimates.</description>
