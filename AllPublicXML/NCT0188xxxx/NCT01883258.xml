  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are:

        1. To compare cardiovascular function in type 2 diabetes patients vs. healthy controls.

        2. To compare the effect of 8 weeks of aerobic interval training versus continuous moderate
           exercise on cardiovascular function in adults with type 2 diabetes.

        3. To examine the mechanisms underlying the exercise-related changes in cardiovascular
           function.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared to continuous moderate intensity exercise
      training, interval training will be more effective in improving cardiovascular function in
      adults with type 2 diabetes.

      Cardiovascular function will be measured at baseline in adults with type 2 diabetes and in
      age-matched healthy controls. Research volunteers with type 2 diabetes who meet the inclusion
      criteria will be randomized to the aerobic interval training group, continuous moderate
      exercise group or non-exercise control group. At the end of the 8-week randomized control
      exercise intervention, baseline measures will be repeated.
