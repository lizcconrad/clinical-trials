  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, phase I/II clinical trial for patients who have relapsed more than 60
      day after allogeneic transplant for a hematologic malignancy. The study consists of two
      phases. The dose finding phase is a modified version of a phase I trial and the extended
      phase is a modified version of a phase II trial.

      The primary objective of the dose finding phase is to determine the maximum tolerated,
      minimum efficacious dose (MTD/MED) of a interleukin-15 (IL-15) super agonist complex
      (ALT-803) when given once weekly for 4 weeks in the outpatient setting. The study will follow
      a standard 3+3 design of dose escalation for toxicity with an added feature of stopping early
      if efficacy is confirmed. There are six dose levels of ALT-803 for to determine the MTD/MED:
      1, 3, 6, 10, 20, and 30 mcg/kg.

      Once the MTD/MED for ALT-803 is determined, this cohort will be used in the extended phase.
      The primary goal of this extended phase is to study the potential efficacy of ALT-803 in this
      patient population. Efficacy will be measured using rates of remission induction. An optimal
      Simon's two-stage design will be used in this phase. Stage 1 will enroll 14 patients
      (including the 6 patients treated at the MTD/MED during the dose finding phase). If 3 or more
      of these 14 patients respond to ALT-803, the trial will move to stage 2 and enroll an
      additional 23 patients. If 2 or fewer respond, the study will terminate enrollment early.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Relapse after previous allogeneic stem cell transplant for one of the following
             hematologic malignancies (acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic
             leukemia,myelodysplastic syndromes, lymphoma, myeloma, Chronic lymphocytic Leukemia,
             chronic myelogenous leukemia):

               -  For non-CML, relapse will be defined based on disease specific morphologic
                  criteria from a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate or recurrence of disease specific
                  cytogenetics. For disease specific definition of relapse, see appendix III.
                  Relapse can be determined morphologically. Equivocal results for relapse should
                  result in a repeated test after an appropriate time interval (suggested 1 month)
                  to determine eligibility.

               -  For CML, relapse will be defined as any cytogenetic evidence of a Philadelphia
                  chromosome or persistence of BCR/ABL rearrangements by molecular testing on at
                  least two measurements over a 6 month interval. If cytogenetics are normal and
                  there is PCR evidence of a BCR/ABL fusion, patients will be eligible if they have
                  evidence of a quantitative increase in CML measured either by quantitative PCR or
                  by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

          -  ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70% (appendix II)

          -  Adequate organ function within 14 days (30 days for cardiac and pulmonary) of

               -  Thyroid Function: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) within institutional normal
                  range - patients with thyroid disease are eligible if euthyroid on suppressive or
                  replacement therapy

               -  Pulmonary: PFTs &gt; 50% of predicted

               -  Cardiac: LVEF by ECHO or MUGA &gt; 40%

          -  Ability to be off prednisone and other immunosuppressive drugs for at least 30 day
             before first dose of study drug

          -  Patient agrees to stay within a reasonable distance (i.e. 30 miles) of the study site
             for the duration of the study treatment and for a minimum of 48 hours after the last
             dose and has a dedicated care giver as is standard practice for BMT outpatient care

          -  Women of child bearing potential and men with partners of child bearing potential must
             agree to use effective contraception during therapy and for 4 months after completion
             of therapy

          -  Voluntary written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (often referred to as EBV-associated
             lymphomas)

          -  Known active CNS leukemia or lymphoma - patients with previously treated CNS disease
             is permitted if neurologically stable with no ongoing or anticipated need for steroid
             therapy are eligible

             aGVHD or cGVHD requiring treatment
