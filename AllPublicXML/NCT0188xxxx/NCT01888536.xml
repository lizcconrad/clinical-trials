      This trial is a comparative study of Opast tablet and Rikalin capsule 75mg and Rikalin
      capsule 75mg in combination with Opast tablet to evaluate improvement effectiveness of Opast
      tablet on subjective symptoms and neurologic claudication in patients with lumbar spinal
      stenosis.

      Subjects who provided written consents voluntarily after receiving a sufficient explanation
      about this trial will be assigned to one of groups(study group; limaprost, comparative group
      1; pregabalin, comparative group 2; limaprost+ pregabalin) by randomization at the rate of
      1:1:1.

      Subjects will take assigned investigational drugs thrice a day for eight weeks by
      double-blind and double-dummy methods, and they will visit the site two times at intervals of
      four weeks.

      At each site visit point, the improvement effectiveness will be comparatively evaluated by
      evaluation of following endpoints;

      Efficacy endpoints: ICD(initial claudication distance) at treadmill test (speed:3km/hr,
      grade:0%), VAS in pain on lower extremities, EQ-5D and ODI Safety endpoints: Vital signs,
      hematology/blood chemistry tests and adverse events, etc.
