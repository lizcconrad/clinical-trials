  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of two anti-inflammatory drugs, fish oil
      capsules and the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, on pregnancy associated breast cancer (PABC).
      Short-term intervention with anti-inflammatory medications will demonstrate a reduction in
      the inflammation and immune suppressive phenotype of PABC, and decreased metastatic potential
      in PABC. This unique window in breast cancer management serves as a valuable opportunity to
      obtain preliminary data on biomarkers and the alterations that occur when the system is
      troubled by a drug or other intervention which will be instrumental in designing future
      therapeutic or preventative strategies for larger clinical study.

      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies omega-3 fatty acid or celecoxib in treating
      patients with breast cancer planning to undergo surgery. Omega-3 fatty acid may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Celecoxib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet
      known whether omega-3 fatty acid or celecoxib is more effective in treating breast cancer.

    <description>Tumor cells are stained using the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody. Ki-67 is measured as a percentage of positive tumor cells. The investigator will conduct three paired t-tests comparing the percent Ki-67 at baseline to the percent Ki-67 after treatment. There will be one t-test for each arm.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of breast cancer; for patients with fine
             needle aspiration (FNA), a core biopsy must be intended

          -  For patients diagnosed with needle core or excisional biopsy, formalin-fixed paraffin
             embedded tumor blocks or unstained slides must be available or patient must be willing
             to undergo repeat core biopsy for research purposes as part of study procedures
             (biopsy for fresh/ fresh frozen tissue is otherwise optional)
