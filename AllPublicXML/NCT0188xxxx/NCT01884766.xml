    <textblock>
      In many fields of medicine, except seizure disorders, blood biomarkers have captured an
      integrated part of diagnostic decision making, including copeptin, the surrogate marker of
      vasopressin release. There are strong arguments to hypothesize circulating copeptin is
      elevated in epilepsy, especially in generalized seizures such as fever seizures (FS), and
      that copeptin is predictive for complexity and relapse at least in FS. Although long-term
      morbidity and mortality are both low in FS, there is high anxiety among parents because of a
      lack of criterions to identify children at risk for relapse. Copeptin may fill this gap by
      adding important diagnostic and prognostic information. Eventually, less children may receive
      needlessly over years fever drugs or anti-epileptic drugs.

      Background:

      Copeptin is a surrogate marker of the pituitary-secreted nonapeptide arginine-vasopressin
      (AVP) and has gradually replaced AVP in several clinical studies largely due to its
      structural and methodological advantages. Copeptin is a marker of non-specific stress
      response, and has been suggested to have clinical implications in a variety of cardiovascular
      and non-cardiovascular conditions. However, up to now there are no data available on copeptin
      in seizure disorders, neither in adults nor in children.

      Working hypotheses:

        1. Circulating copeptin concentrations are increased after generalized seizures, including
           FS.

        2. Copeptin is predictive for complexity and relapse in FS.

      Specific aims:

        1. to determine copeptin concentrations in children below six years after generalized
           seizures, either unrelated or related to fever (FS), and in control children below six
           years without seizures.

        2. to compare copeptin concentrations with blood-gas parameters (including hydrogen ion
           concentration (pH), base deficiency, and carbon dioxide), lactate, sodium, chloride, C
           reactive protein (CRP), and prolactin.
