      Limbal ring contact lenses enhance the look of the eye by adding pigmentation in a ring
      pattern to the contact lens. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if corneal
      staining increase is dependent upon the lens pigment location.

    <description>Corneal staining was evaluated in 5 corneal regions (Central, Inferior, Nasal, Temporal and Superior) using Sodium Fluorescein strips. The corneal Staining was graded using the scale Grade 0: No Staining, Grade 1: Trace(Minimal superficial staining or stippling), Grade 2: Mild (Regional or diffuse punctate staining), Grade 3:Moderate(Significant dense coalesced staining, corneal abrasion or foreign body tracks.), Grade 4 Severe(Severe abrasions greater than 2 mm in diameter, ulcerations, epithelial loss, or full thickness abrasion.). The total was calculated by using the sum across all regions by time point. The range for the total grade for each time point would be 0-20. The total average grade for each lens and time point was evaluated as an average change from baseline level of corneal staining.</description>

             neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on
             the Efron classification scale or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate
             contact lens wear.

          8. Have any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to contact lenses (as assessed by
             ocular history).

          9. Have any ocular infection.

         10. Have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable
             contact lens wear.

         11. Have participated in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14
             days prior to study enrollment.

         12. Have any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), by self-report.

         13. Currently wear their contact lenes on an extended wear basis.

         14. Is an employee of the investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator,
             Technician).

         15. Currently wears toric or multifocal contact lenses. If the subject wears soft contact
             lenses for monovision, they must be willing to wear distance only correction in both
             eyes for the study.

        <title>Corneal Staining</title>
        <description>Corneal staining was evaluated in 5 corneal regions (Central, Inferior, Nasal, Temporal and Superior) using Sodium Fluorescein strips. The corneal Staining was graded using the scale Grade 0: No Staining, Grade 1: Trace(Minimal superficial staining or stippling), Grade 2: Mild (Regional or diffuse punctate staining), Grade 3:Moderate(Significant dense coalesced staining, corneal abrasion or foreign body tracks.), Grade 4 Severe(Severe abrasions greater than 2 mm in diameter, ulcerations, epithelial loss, or full thickness abrasion.). The total was calculated by using the sum across all regions by time point. The range for the total grade for each time point would be 0-20. The total average grade for each lens and time point was evaluated as an average change from baseline level of corneal staining.</description>
