    <textblock>
      A computational model of human sound production based on high quality anatomic measurements
      and physical laws of sound propagation cannot be accomplished without a comprehensive data
      set including both 3D-images of the speaker's anatomy and the simultaneous recording of
      speech. Since the computational model has separate models for the vocal folds and the vocal
      tract, patients undergoing an orthognathic surgery is an optimal test object for the model
      development. Vocal folds remain unchanged while substantial changes take place in the vocal
      tract. Moreover, since the aim of the research is to predict acoustic changes in speech due
      to operations in head neck area, the orthognathic patient group is par excellence an example
      of such a prediction problem. If the model can be shown to give valuable information
      pre-operationally, many other patient groups could benefit from the results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery deals with the correction of abnormalities of the facial tissues. The
      underlying cause for abnormality may be present at birth or acquired during the life as the
      result of distorted growth or trauma. Orthodontic treatment alone is not adequate in many
      cases due to severity of the deformities. In a typical operation, the position of either one
      jaw (mandible or maxilla) or both jaws is surgically changed in relation to the skull base.
      The movement of the jaw position varies usually between 5-15 mm either to anterior or
      posterior direction. Such a considerable movement has a very profound effect on the shape and
      volume of vocal tract resulting detectable changes in acoustics. Although the surgery
      involves mandibular and maxillary bone, changes occur also in the position and shape of
      respective soft tissues and hyoid bone, as well. For this project, 20 adult patients (10
      women and 10 men) undergoing orthognathic surgery will be enrolled. Exclusion criteria
      include diseases and conditions in which MRI examination is contraindicated (.e.g. pace
      maker), severe speech or hearing impairment, and other situations where the patient has
      difficulties with completing the tasks defined in the research protocol. Furthermore,
      patients to whom segmental surgery of the jaws will be performed in connection of
      orthognathic surgery are excluded. A specific pre-selection criterion for patients is the
      presence of numerous dental amalgam fillings that may cause artifacts in MR images.

    <description>The vocal and nasal tracts from the lips and nostrils to the beginning of the trachea are imaged with Siemens Avanto 1.5T MRI machine using carefully optimized, externally triggered imaging sequences that are synchronized with the rest of the experimental setting. A sound sample, given by the test subject, is recorded simultaneously to obtain a coupled data set: the speech sound and the precise anatomy which produces it.</description>
