  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protective ventilation (association of a tidal volume &lt; 8 ml/kg with a positive end
      expiratory pressure) is poorly used in severe brain-injured patients. Moreover, a systematic
      approach to extubation may decrease the rate of extubation failure and enhance outcomes of
      brain-injured patients.

      We hypothesized that medical education and implementation of an evidence-base care bundle
      associating protective ventilation and systemic approach to extubation can reduce the
      duration of mechanical ventilation in brain-injured patients.

      A before/after study design will be used. The before period (control phase) will consisted of
      all consecutive patients with severe brain-injury who were admitted to the participating
      ICUs.

      During the interphase, all physicians, residents, physiotherapists and nurses will receive a
      formal training for the processes and procedures related to the 2 point bundle: protective
      ventilation and systematic approach to extubation (according to recommendation for the use of
      tidal volume &lt; 7 ml/kg and of a positive expiratory pressure = 6 to 8 cmH20 (centimeter of
      water) and extubation as soon as ventilatory weaning is associated with a glasgow coma scale
      equal or above 10 and cought).

      The after period consisted of all consecutive severe brain-injured patients admitted to the
      participating ICUs after the formal training.
