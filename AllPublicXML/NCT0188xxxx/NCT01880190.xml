  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various stimuli such as trauma, infection and major surgery may alter the physiologic immune
      balance and initiate systemic inflammatory processes. This pathophysiological event is
      characterized by the release of potent inflammatory mediators into the circulation.

      Among these, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 or
      IL-10, ICAM-1 play a dominant role as local or systemic regulators in the acute inflammatory
      response. Recent studies have also investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
      in the inflammatory response. The MMPs constitute a family of enzymes that are structurally
      related neutral proteinases. MMPs can degrade essentially all extracellular matrix (ECM)
      components and play an important role in wound healing and remodeling of the ECM. The
      Tissutal Inhibitor MetalloProteine (TIMPs) are important regulator of MMPs activity.

      The inflammatory response coming of surgery mainly affects surgical patients' outcome. Many
      factors may attributed to this response, such as the kind of operation, the extent of
      surgical trauma, the patient's medical history and therapy, as well as the type of anesthesia
      used. Apart from that, the kind of fluids administered for volume replacement was revealed to
      alter the inflammatory processes. Several studies have addressed on this issue mainly
      involved abdominal surgery and provided compelling evidence that perioperative fluid
      optimization produces benefits for the patient, with regard to inflammatory biomarkers such
      as cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1). They
      support that the different volume replacement strategies, using only crystalloids or
      combination of crystalloids with colloids (HES 130/0,4), may have important impact on immune
      response. However, the relevant studies investigated different inflammatory biomarkers, and
      usually involved either metalloproteinases, and their inhibitors (TIMPs) or cytokines.

      In our study we investigated the hypothesis that intra- and postoperative volume replacement
      with HES attenuates inflammatory response to elective abdominal surgery compared to RL fluid
      therapy. For this purpose both metalloproteinases, MMP-9, MMP-13, their inhibitor, TIMP-1,
      cytokines, IL-6, IL-8 and the intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1 were investigated
      postoperatively. Their changes during the first 24 postoperative hours consisted our primary
      outcomes.
