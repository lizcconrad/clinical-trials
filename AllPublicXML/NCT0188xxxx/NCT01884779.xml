  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum histoplasmosis is the leading cause of acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death in French Guiana and probably in the Amazon. The
      diagnosis of this disease requires invasives procedures, laboratory performance, and delays
      up to several weeks. The Mycotic Diseases Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC) has established a rapid, sensitive and specific ELISA test for blood and
      urine samples that looks interesting in endemic areas, particularly in developing countries.
      The study aims to measure the proportion of HIV-infected patients hospitalized or in
      outpatient awaiting hospitalization for a suspicion of infectious syndrome whose serum and/or
      urinary antigen detection tests are positive for Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum.
