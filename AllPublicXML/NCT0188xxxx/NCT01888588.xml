    <textblock>
      The analyses are conducted in a previous population-based cohort study using The Health
      Improvement Network database in the UK (Cai et al 2009).The aims of the post hoc analyses
      are:

      To estimate the relative risk of uncomplicated symptomatic peptic ulcer (UPU) associated with
      use of low dose aspirin (ASA) and other anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, steroids) in the
      general population To estimate the dose-response and duration-response associated with use of
      these drugs To estimate the relative risk of UPU associated with naive/non-naive use of low
      dose ASA in the general population To evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
      (alone or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs) on the occurrence of UPU in the
      general population To investigate the management of low dose ASA/oral antiplatelets after UPU

        The study is conducted using The Health Improvement Network database in the UK. Patients
        aged 40-84 years between January 1997 and December 2005 with a registration status of
        permanent or deceased, who were enrolled for at least 2 years with a GP and had 1 year of
        electronic prescription history. Patients with a code for cancer, peptic ulcer (both
        uncomplicated and complicated), upper GI bleeding, oesophageal varices, Mallory-Weiss
        disease, alcohol abuse, liver disease, or coagulopathies before beginning date were
        excluded from the source population. All patients in the study population were followed up
        until the end of the study period (December 2005), or until they reached the age of 85,
        died, met any of the exclusion criteria (including receiving a diagnosis of complicated
        peptic ulcer disease), or received a diagnosis of uncomplicated peptic ulcer
        disease.Patient records were manually reviewed to validate cases.
