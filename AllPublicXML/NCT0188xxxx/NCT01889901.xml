  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is common in childhood. Throughout life, including adulthood, children with epilepsy
      are at increased risk of impaired health, functioning, psychological well-being and
      quality-of-life. There is evidence that physical activity improves the medical and
      psychosocial aspects of health in adults with epilepsy- but there are no such studies in
      children. The investigators predict that we can increase levels of physical activity and
      influence children's functioning, psychological well-being and quality of life through
      multiple pathways. The investigators propose to evaluate the relationship between enhanced
      physical activity and health, and explore facilitators and barriers to physical activity in
      children with epilepsy.

      This project explores an innovative idea that, if successful, will have the potential to
      significantly change current thinking and practice regarding health promotion among children
      with epilepsy. There are many unfounded assumptions about the dangers of exercise in children
      with epilepsy that may be seriously detrimental to children's health, and that we have good
      reason to challenge. Physical activity (PA) interventions, such as walking programs, are
      practicable, non-pharmacological approaches to health promotion and represent a neglected
      opportunity for disease modification. We propose to undertake a prospective randomized
      controlled trial to evaluate the effects of increasing physical activity levels through a
      modern pedometer-measured walking program, followed by assessment of the sustainability of
      the program. We hypothesize that a motivational program to increase the levels of PA over
      6-months will result in sustainable enhanced PA. This in turn will positively and
      simultaneously influence health and reduce several morbidities in children with epilepsy,
      leading to improved health and life quality in childhood and continuing into adulthood.

    <description>The control group will receive instruction to maintain their physical activity. The intention is to study the existing levels of physical activity through step count via the Fitbit pedometer. The control group will receive information about epilepsy (attention placebo)and will be able to upload step counts wirelessly to the Fitbit website. Participants will not receive a password to access the website to follow their accumulating data during the intervention period (first 6 months). At the start of the 6-month monitoring period (second 6 months), the control group will be provided with a password to access the pedometer web page that allows them to create and view a visual map of their progress giving them a clear picture of how they are doing and where they are headed.</description>

    <description>The goal is to reach 12,000 steps per day by the end of the 6-month intervention period. If 12,000 steps per day are reached, participants will be encouraged to surpass this goal or to maintain this step count. Participants will be motivated by augmented behavior modification strategies such as: having access to the pedometer web page to view calculated step counts; scanning and discussing neighborhoods for available walking routes; and creating a buddy system for walking. Each will be facilitated by telephone-based physical activity behavior change counselling, occurring weekly, bi-weekly and monthly. Participants will upload their pedometer data wirelessly. At the end of the 6 months, the experimental group will be monitored for an additional 24 weeks with no further incentives.</description>
