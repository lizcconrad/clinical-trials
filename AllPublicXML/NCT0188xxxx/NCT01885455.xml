    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, interventional trial in which the navigation is the intervention. Phase
      is not applicable. The study is a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of a nurse-led
      patient navigation intervention in improving rates of receipt of lung-directed therapy with
      curative intent (LDTCI) among African Americans with early stage lung cancer. Study sites are
      cluster-randomized to either the usual care study arm or the to the navigation intervention
      study arm. Randomization occurred at the level of the study site rather than at the level of
      individual participants. There are two arms.

  <detailed_description>

      The burden to participants will be minimized to enhance retention. Patients in the usual care
      arm receive the current &quot;gold standard&quot; of treatment. The patients in the intervention arm
      are assigned to a PN, who helps to reduce the barriers to care that could negatively impact
      the patients' receipt of LDTCI. The telephone-administered survey is administered to all
      study participants at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-enrollment. It takes
      approximately 30-40 minutes to administer. The telephone mode of survey administration was
      chosen to reduce the number of visits that would be required by each patient. Interviews are
      scheduled at the convenience of the study participants. To further reduce burden to the study
      participants, the interviewers offer breaks during the interview process. Patients in both
      arms undergo standard therapy visits. Patients in the navigation arm receive standard therapy
      visits plus the navigation intervention. Outside of the standard therapy visits, no
      additional clinic visits are required of the study participants.

      Once informed consent has been obtained and the informed consent document is received, the
      SSC/PN will communicate to the MUSC HCC study staff the participant's contact information and
      that the participant is ready for baseline survey administration. All the study surveys will
      be administered by trained MUSC HCC study staff via telephone. A survey answer guide will be
      provided to the participant either in-person or via mail prior to administration of the
      baseline survey.

    <description>Participants who are assigned to the usual care arm may receive the following services: complete staging work-up (CT/PET scan and possible mediastinoscopy), surgical consultation with a general or cardiothoracic surgeon, cardiac clearance and/or pulmonary function testing (if deemed necessary by the evaluating surgeon), surgical resection (wedge resection, lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or radiosurgery, as indicated by the size and location of the tumor), and adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, as determined by the intraoperative findings and pathology results).</description>

    <description>The PN will provide each patient with a copy of the NCI's &quot;What You Need to Know About Lung Cancer&quot; booklet and encourage them to re-contact his/her primary care physician (or the physician who diagnosed their probable/proven NSCLC) to discuss treatment options.
The PNs will provide patients with their contact information and brief patients on their role. The PNs will navigate study participants for up to 4 months (16 weeks, 112 days) after NSCLC diagnosis, until the patient is deemed ineligible for LDTCI (i.e., lung resection or SBRT) by their physician(s), until receipt of LDTCI, or death (whichever comes first).
During the EPDPN intervention period, PNs will contact each intervention group participant by telephone (or in-person) on weekly basis (at minimum).</description>
