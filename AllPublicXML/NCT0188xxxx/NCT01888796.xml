  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examination of the effect of Linagliptin versus placebo on diastolic function in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diastolic dysfunction as assessed by transthoracic
      echocardiography.

      Furthermore the effect on serum levels of NT-pro BNP as a biomarker of heart failure will be
      investigated.

      Treatment:

      The Patients will receive Linagliptin 5 mg QD or placebo for a period of 6 months.

      The echocardiography and 24h RR measurement will be performed at baseline and 6 months after
      initiation of the therapy.

      The blood chemistry (Glucose, HbA1c, BNP) will be evaluated at baseline as well as 3 and 6
      months after initiation of the therapy.
