    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to disseminate the 2010 Osteoporosis Canada clinical practice
      guidelines, using a multi-faceted Knowledge Translation (KT) model, as KT aims to close the
      gap between knowledge generated from research and practice. The investigators' primary
      objective is to evaluate if this intervention can increase the percent of long-term care
      (LTC) residents receiving appropriate treatment for osteoporosis (i.e. treatment is
      considered appropriate for an individual over age 50 who has had a diagnosis of osteoporosis
      or a fragility fracture of the hip or vertebrae and those who have had more than one
      fragility fracture and is therefore considered high-risk). A secondary objective is to
      examine whether the intervention increases the percent of all LTC residents receiving Vitamin
      D equivalent to ≥800 IU/day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who live in LTC are at high risk for osteoporosis and fractures, particularly hip
      fractures, which lead to pain and transfer to acute care. The investigators' previous work in
      LTC has shown that awareness and use of clinical practice guidelines in LTC are low. To
      successfully transfer knowledge, it is imperative to understand the needs of the LTC teams
      and to tailor KT interventions appropriately.

      Interventions which focus on strategies to overcome barriers and on new ways to deliver and
      promote the uptake of best practices that are specific to both the learning needs of LTC
      health care providers and the operational/organizational culture in LTC are greatly needed.
      Interdisciplinary teams who participated in the Vitamin D and Osteoporosis Study (ViDOS)
      indicated several process barriers that may hinder the proper identification and treatment of
      fractures in LTC. There is a need to educate Ontario LTC practitioners on the osteoporosis
      guidelines. The investigators' aim is to facilitate the uptake of Osteoporosis Canada 2010
      Clinical Practice Guidelines, across Ontario LTC homes using the ViDOS multi-faceted KT
      model. Furthermore, the investigators will have a greater emphasis on the implementation of
      guidelines which includes risk assessment and appropriate medication use.

    <description>Difference in the percentage of residents appropriately prescribed an osteoporosis medication before and after the intervention will be measured. Medications to be included in the baseline and post data download are in accordance with the current Osteoporosis Canada guidelines. Treatment is considered appropriate for an individual over age 50 who has had a diagnosis of osteoporosis or a fragility fracture of the hip or vertebra and those who have had more than one fragility fracture (i.e. high risk).</description>

    <description>Two interactive sessions will be delivered to the interprofessional team at Month 1 and Month 6 and are 1 hour in length. The Clinical Consultant Pharmacist at each LTC home will lead the Knowledge Translation Sessions. Participants will watch an educational video, developed by the co-investigators with expertise in osteoporosis and geriatrics and members of the Ontario College of Family Physicians. Accompanying materials that support the topics in the video will be provided. Following the educational video, one of the experts from the video will phone the LTC home to address questions and provide the home with direct access to an expert.</description>
