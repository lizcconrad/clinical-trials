      Objectives:

      Primary Objective

        -  To evaluate the response rate of Ibrutinib plus rituximab in patients with relapsed
           and/or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

        -  To evaluate the safety and response rate of Ibrutinib plus rituximab in elderly patients
           (&gt; 65) with newly-diagnosed, untreated MCL.

      Relapsed and/or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL):

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will begin the first cycle of treatment
      with ibrutinib and rituximab. Each cycle is 28 days.

      Ibrutinib Administration:

      Every day you will take 4 ibrutinib capsules with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water. Do not
      open the capsules or dissolve them.

      If you miss a dose, you can take it up to 6 hours after the time you would have taken it. If
      it is later than 6 hours, you should skip the dose and start taking the capsules at the same
      time as usual the next day.

      You will need to fill out diary cards with information about when you take ibrutinib. You
      should bring the diary cards with you to appointments. You will receive a 30 day supply of
      the ibrutinib capsules on Day 1 of Cycles 1-9. After that, starting on Cycle 10, you will
      receive a 60-day supply of the drug every other cycle.

      Rituximab Administration:

      On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, you will receive rituximab by vein. The first infusion
      takes 6-8 hours. After that, infusions take about 4 hours.

      You will then receive rituximab by vein over 4 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 3-8 and every other
      cycle after that for up to 2 years.

      For some patients, you may receive the rituximab dose over 2 days. Your doctor will tell you
      if this is the best approach for you.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration
           to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan to check the status
           of the disease.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then every 3 cycles after that, if the study
      doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. You
      may have scans less often.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing and to check the status
           of the disease. Biomarkers are found in the blood and may be related to your reaction to
           the study drug.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your immune system.

      One time between Cycles 2-10, when the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 4
      tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing and to check you immune system.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you finish taking the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  Blood (about 5-7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, for biomarker testing,
           for immune system testing, and to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a CT scan and/or x-ray to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan and/or bone marrow
           biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1Â½ tablespoons) or urine
           pregnancy test.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing and to check the status
           of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your immune system.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      After your end-of-treatment visit, you will be called every 3 months for 1 year and every 6
      months after that to see how you are doing. These calls will take about 2-3 minutes.

      If you stop the study drug and the disease has gotten better or is stable at the time you
      stopped taking the study drug, blood will be drawn every month for 3 months, then every 2
      months for 6 months, and then every 3 months after that to check the status of the disease.

      Elderly Patients (&gt; 65) with Newly-Diagnosed, Untreated MCL:

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will begin the first cycle of treatment
      with ibrutinib and rituximab. Each cycle is 28 days.

      Ibrutinib Administration:

      Every day you will take 4 ibrutinib capsules with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water. Do not
      open the capsules or dissolve them.

             active disease and is cleared by GI consultation.

         15. Newly Diagnosed MCL: The patient has a prior or concurrent malignancy that in the
             opinion of the investigator, presents a greater risk to the patient's health and
             survival, than of the MCL, within the subsequent 6 months at the time of consent.

         16. Newly Diagnosed MCL: History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months
             prior to signing the consent.

         17. Newly Diagnosed MCL: Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as
             uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or myocardial
             infarction within 6 months at the time of consent or any Class 3 (moderate) or 4
             (severe) cardiac disease defined by the New York Heart Association Classification.

         18. Newly Diagnosed MCL: Significant screening electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities
             including left bundle branch block, 2nd degree AV block type II, 3rd degree block,
             bradycardia (&lt; 50bpm), or QTc &gt;500 msec.

         19. Newly Diagnosed MCL: Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting
             gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel or ulcerative
             colitis, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel
             obstruction.

         20. Newly Diagnosed MCL: Major surgery within 4 weeks or vaccination with live attenuated
             vaccines within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.

         21. Newly Diagnosed MCL: Prior treatment with Ibrutinib.

         22. Newly Diagnosed MCL: Requires concomitant anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent
             vitamin K antagonist.
