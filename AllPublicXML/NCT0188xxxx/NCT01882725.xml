      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low level laser light therapy is effective
      in increasing local blood circulation in people with chronic heel pain arising from plantar
      fasciitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy blood circulation is important to overall health and well-being, as strong and steady
      local blood flow delivers fresh nutrients to the cells and prevents accumulation of waste
      materials within the cells necessary to maintain healthy cell function. Conversely, poor
      local blood circulation can cause numerous acute and chronic health problems, and can
      manifest itself in symptoms of pain, numbness, weakness and swelling, and can exacerbate
      these symptoms in co-existing acute and chronic conditions. Chronic conditions that may
      result from poor blood circulation that is untreated and persists over a long period of time
      include varicose veins, kidney damage, stroke and heart attack. Memory loss, frequent
      headaches, dizzy spells and slowed mental response can also result.

      Therefore, improving local blood circulation has significant positive implications for both
      the overall health and well-being of an individual and for improving, relieving and
      preventing symptoms and long-term complications of poor blood circulation. Treatment to
      improve blood circulation include simple options such as changes in dietary and exercise
      habits, and alternative treatments such as acupuncture and herbal remedies. Medications may
      be prescribed to assist with contributory conditions such as high blood pressure or
      cholesterol. In more progressed cases, surgical options such as angioplasty or bypass may be
      performed to treat narrowed or blocked arteries.

      However, less invasive options are usually minimally effective, medication has its own risks
      and side-effects and surgical procedures are invasive and carry significant procedural risks
      and potential complications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of low
      level laser therapy as a means of increasing local blood circulation as it is related to
      reducing chronic heel pain arising from plantar fasciitis that is simple, non-invasive and
      risk-free.

      Low level laser therapy is believed to effect various physiological mechanisms of change that
      include improved blood flow and increased cell metabolism, advanced healing,
      anti-inflammatory actions and stimulation of the immune system. The laser directs light
      energy into the body's cells. The cells then convert this light energy into chemical energy
      to promote natural healing and pain relief. The laser also allows photons to enter the tissue
      and become absorbed in the cells mitochondria within which the photonic energy is converted
      to electromagnetic energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This additional ATP is
      energy the cell uses to trigger positive physiological responses from the body such as
      increased cell metabolism and development of muscle tissue and collagen, improvement of blood
      circulation, stimulation of tissue repair, wound healing and stimulation of the nervous and
      immune systems.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) measured peripheral microcirculation or skin perfusion using a laser Doppler sensor and a pressure cuff to evaluate reactive hyperemia, the transient increase in blood flow that occurs following a brief period of ischemia. The SPP value was measured in mmHg.
The per cent (%) change in mean Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) in mmHg was calculated as the % change in measurements from before the first procedure administration with the Erchonia® HPS Laser to after the sixth and final procedure administration. It was pre-determined that a minimum mean change in % SPP of +10% or greater across the evaluation period would be considered clinically meaningful.
A positive (+) change indicates that SPP increased across the procedure administration phase and is positive for study efficacy.
A negative (-) change indicates that SPP decreased across the procedure administration phase and is negative for study efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change in Skin Surface Temperature on the Hind Foot</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Skin surface temperature on the hind foot was recorded in degrees using an infrared thermometer. Change in skin surface temperature in degrees was calculated as the change in measurements before the first procedure administration (baseline) to after the sixth and final procedure administration. It was pre-determined that a minimum mean increase in skin surface temperature of +2.5 degrees across the procedure administration phase would be considered clinically meaningful.
A positive (+) change indicates that the skin surface temperature increased across the procedure administration phase and is positive for study efficacy.
A negative (-) change indicates that the skin surface temperature decreased across the procedure administration phase and is negative for study efficacy.</description>

          <title>Degree of Heel Pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
          <description>The Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) is one of the three most commonly used scales for assessing chronic pain consisting of a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal line anchored at one end by the label &quot;0: no pain at all&quot; and at the other end &quot;100: worst pain imaginable&quot;. The subject marks on the line the spot for the overall degree of pain experienced in the study treated heel region upon waking in the morning and taking the first few steps of the day, which is then measured using a ruler.</description>

        <title>Change in Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP)</title>
        <description>Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) measured peripheral microcirculation or skin perfusion using a laser Doppler sensor and a pressure cuff to evaluate reactive hyperemia, the transient increase in blood flow that occurs following a brief period of ischemia. The SPP value was measured in mmHg.
The per cent (%) change in mean Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) in mmHg was calculated as the % change in measurements from before the first procedure administration with the Erchonia® HPS Laser to after the sixth and final procedure administration. It was pre-determined that a minimum mean change in % SPP of +10% or greater across the evaluation period would be considered clinically meaningful.
A positive (+) change indicates that SPP increased across the procedure administration phase and is positive for study efficacy.
A negative (-) change indicates that SPP decreased across the procedure administration phase and is negative for study efficacy.</description>

        <title>Change in Skin Surface Temperature on the Hind Foot</title>
        <description>Skin surface temperature on the hind foot was recorded in degrees using an infrared thermometer. Change in skin surface temperature in degrees was calculated as the change in measurements before the first procedure administration (baseline) to after the sixth and final procedure administration. It was pre-determined that a minimum mean increase in skin surface temperature of +2.5 degrees across the procedure administration phase would be considered clinically meaningful.
A positive (+) change indicates that the skin surface temperature increased across the procedure administration phase and is positive for study efficacy.
A negative (-) change indicates that the skin surface temperature decreased across the procedure administration phase and is negative for study efficacy.</description>
