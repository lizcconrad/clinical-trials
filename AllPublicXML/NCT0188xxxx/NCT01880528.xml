    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies lisinopril in reducing shortness of breath caused by
      radiation therapy in patients with lung cancer. Lisinopril may decrease the side effects
      caused by radiation therapy in patients with lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the adverse event profile of lisinopril, during and after external beam
      radiation therapy (RT) to the lung.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the level of patient-reported acute respiratory distress (dyspnea) during and
      after external beam RT.

      II. To explore the level of patient-reported symptoms during and after external beam RT.

      III. To explore the impact of lisinopril treatment on patient quality of life (QOL) during
      and after external beam RT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Beginning within 7 days of beginning radiation therapy, patients receive lisinopril
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7.

      ARM II: Beginning within 7 days of beginning radiation therapy, patients receive placebo PO
      QD on days 1-7.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 7 days for until 3 months after completion of radiation
      therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of grade 3 or higher hypotension, acute kidney injury, allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, as measured using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics of frequency (percentage) will be used to summarize adverse event (AE) incidence and severity in the lisinopril and placebo arms separately. Should incidence rates differ between the treatment arms, the Chi-square test may be utilized in an exploratory fashion to further characterize the differences. The difference between the two arms (point estimate and 95% confidence interval) will be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events as measured using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>An entire AE profile for both treatment arms will be compiled using descriptive statistics of frequency (percentage). Should incidence rates differ between the treatment arms, the Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test may be utilized in an exploratory fashion to further characterize the differences. The difference between the two arms (point estimate and 95% confidence interval) will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life, assessed using lung cancer symptom scale (LCSS), Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment Lung Cancer (FACT-L), and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer (EORTC-QLQ-LC13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The LCSS, FACT-L, and EORTC-QLQ-LC13 will be scored according to their respective scoring algorithms. All continuous QOL data will be converted to 0-100 point scales where 100 is best QOL, for comparability. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals) will be compiled for maximum scores over time, actual scores at each time point, and change from baseline scores. Frequencies (percentages) will be utilized to compile individual item responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of acute respiratory distress (dyspnea), measured using the maximum score, at any time, of the shortness of breath question on the LCSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals) will be compiled in the lisinopril and placebo arms separately. Statistical tests (two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) may be employed to determine differences, if any, occur between treatment arms. The difference between the two arms (point estimate and 95% confidence interval) will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-level symptoms as measured using the Symptom Experience Questionnaire (SEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals) will be utilized to summarize each individual SEQ response within each treatment arm separately. Statistical tests (two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) may be employed to determine differences, if any, occur between treatment arms. The difference between the two arms (point estimate and 95% confidence interval) will be reported.</description>
