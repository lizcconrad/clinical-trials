      This study is testing a navigation program for early palliative care provided in tandem with
      HIV primary care for persons living with HIV (PLWH) who are at high risk or mortality and
      morbidity related to their co-morbid chronic conditions. Participants are enrolled for a
      period of 36 months, with data collection at enrollment and every 9 months after, for a total
      of 5 data collection time points. Study participants enrolled will be randomized into one of
      two groups: control or intervention. Control group participants will receive control calls in
      between survey data collection time points. Intervention group participants will participate
      in a Navigation Program which includes home visits and phone calls with an advanced practice
      nurse (APN) and licensed social worker (LSW), as well as visits / calls by a volunteer if
      desired. The frequency of visits / calls will be determined based on level of need (high,
      medium or low).

      The specific aims of the study are to: 1) identify needs and preferences for palliative care
      and advance care planning for PLWH, in order to tailor an existing Navigation Program for
      this study; 2) test the effectiveness of an HIV Navigation Program intervention on outcomes
      of quality of life, symptom burden, coping ability, and advance care planning; and 3)
      determine if effectiveness of the HIV Navigation Program intervention differs by age, gender,
      ethnicity, education, income level, and level of palliative care service need.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of effective antiretroviral treatment for HIV has come a marked increase in
      the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), with the highest prevalence since the
      epidemic began of more than 1.2 million. While PLWHA survive longer, they also experience
      increased burdens of chronic conditions related to lifestyle factors, treatment side effects,
      and age. PLWHA are a population at great risk for high symptom burden, impaired coping and
      social functioning, decreased quality of life, and inadequate end-of-life care. The
      remarkable shift in attitudes towards HIV, from an inevitably fatal disease to a chronic
      condition, has been accompanied by a lessening emphasis on symptom management and end-of-life
      planning. However, while mortality from AIDS-defining conditions has decreased, PLWHA
      continue to have unaddressed needs for coordinated care, symptom management and proactive
      advance care planning. Palliative care, focused on comprehensive management of physical,
      psychological, social, and spiritual needs of persons with incurable, progressive illnesses,
      is a health service uniquely designed to meet these needs. This research project will test a
      model of early palliative care for PLWHA at high risk of mortality and morbidity. First,
      focus group methods will be used to explore views of PLWHA regarding their needs for symptom
      management and social support, and attitudes towards advance care planning and end-of-life
      concerns. We will then conduct a randomized trial of a novel HIV Navigation Program, which
      will be a modification of an existing navigation program that uses trained and experienced
      volunteers as a core component, offered by a large, comprehensive hospice and palliative care
      organization. The specific aims of this study are 1) to identify needs and preferences for
      palliative care and advance care planning of PLWHA, in order to tailor an existing Patient
      Navigation Program to the specific needs of PLWHA with chronic conditions; and 2) to test the
      effect of an HIV Patient Navigation Program intervention on outcomes of quality of life,
      symptom burden, coping ability, and advance care planning; and 3) to determine if
      effectiveness of the HIV Navigation Program intervention differs by age, gender, ethnicity,
      education, income level, and level of palliative care service need. Because of the increasing
      prevalence of HIV coexisting with chronic conditions, there is an urgent need to assess
      palliative care needs and preferences of PLWHA and design effective interventions. This
      interdisciplinary study will test, at the community level, a novel health service designed to
      meet the unique needs of chronically ill PLWHA, and improve and support advance care
      planning. Results from this study will increase understanding of who are PLWHA at highest
      risk for need of palliative services and provide a model for providing early palliative care
      support for PLWHA.

    <description>Patients are &quot;admitted&quot; to the navigation program, provided through a local community partner agency. Each of these subjects will be assigned an advanced practice nurse (APN) and licensed social worker (LSW) as co-case managers, with their relative contributions depending on the nature of the subject's needs. Level of need (1, 2 or 3) will be confirmed for each patient, and the level will inform the amount of in-person and phone call contacts made to provide on-going support and monitoring of patients. Additionally, this group will meet with the research team for data collection at enrollment and at four 9-month intervals for a total of 5 time points.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive &quot;usual care&quot; - medical care and support provided by their primary care provider. They will not receive any of the navigation program services. To provide control for the effects of attention, we will contact these subjects at baseline and every other month thereafter by phone. During these contacts, we will ask a scripted &quot;social&quot; query (e.g. &quot;How are things going for you?&quot;). A subject who raises any health issues or need for specific information will be referred to the primary care provider. Additionally, this group will meet with the research team for data collection at enrollment and at four 9-month intervals for a total of 5 time points.</description>

    <ipd_description>A goal of this project is to test a novel health service model that could be replicated in other sites and with other hospice organizations. Therefore, we will share results with HIV clinicians and researchers, and palliative care and hospice clinicians and researchers. For clinical audiences, we will to target national meetings, including the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association annual symposium. The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization is another avenue for dissemination of this model of care. We also expect to use the Center for AIDS Research, where several of the study team members participate, as an opportunity for reaching researchers. Because previous research shows that specific palliative care needs vary among populations, we will make the de-identified data available so that other centers can evaluate similarities and differences from our population in order to apply our findings.</ipd_description>
