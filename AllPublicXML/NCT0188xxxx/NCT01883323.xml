  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical study for patients with metastatic (the cancer has spread to
      other parts of the body) melanoma. Patients will receive an infusion (given by vein) of
      autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). TILs are a type of white blood cells that
      recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down.

      Prior to the cell infusion, patients will receive a two drugs cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine to prepare the body to receive the TILs. After cell infusion, patients will
      receive low-dose interleukin-2 therapy which is an approved drug to treat melanoma. This
      study will see how useful this regimen is in treating metastatic melanoma.
