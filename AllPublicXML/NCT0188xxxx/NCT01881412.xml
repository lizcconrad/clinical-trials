  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many children have asthma and this causes problems with their health. A lot of children with
      uncontrolled asthma use emergency departments for asthma care, and so this is an ideal place
      for an intervention for these children. One intervention is prescribing inhaled steroids to
      children with uncontrolled asthma, but currently this is rarely done in the emergency
      department. Inhaled steroids have been shown to be good at making children better long-term
      when they have uncontrolled asthma.

      This study identifies children in the emergency department with uncontrolled asthma using a
      tool called the Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (PACCI). If children
      meet criteria for uncontrolled asthma they will be randomly assigned to either: 1) routine
      asthma care which includes close follow up with their doctor or 2) prescribing of an inhaled
      corticosteroid from the emergency department. The investigators hypothesize that children who
      are prescribed inhaled steroids for uncontrolled asthma from the emergency department will
      have better 6 month asthma control than children who receive routine asthma care.

      Specific aim 1 - An ED-based RCT to determine if ICS prescription in children identified
      using the PACCI as having uncontrolled asthma results in less asthma morbidity compared to
      routine asthma care. We hypothesize that children receiving ICS prescriptions will have fewer
      unscheduled health care use for asthma exacerbations (doctor's office visits, ED visits, or
      hospitalizations), and greater quality of life.

      Specific aim 2 - Thematic analysis of interviews with parents who are adherent versus
      non-adherent with ICS prescription filling and use to determine the factors associated with
      adherence. We hypothesize that factors will include: 1) Parent beliefs about the chronic
      versus episodic nature of asthma, 2) Parent's knowledge of benefits and risks of ICS, and 3)
      Provision and use of an asthma action plan.

    <description>The ITG-CASF has been validated in the ED setting for children 2 to 17 years old, is reliable (Cronbach's Î± =0.70), and can be administered by telephone. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale. Each response is scaled as a percentage of the maximum response, and the total score is the maximum percentage based on the number of questions answered. The scores range from 0 - 100, with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. The change in ITG-CASF scores for children with improved overall clinical status are 10 points higher than when children have not improved.</description>

    <description>These measures will include unscheduled visits to primary care providers (PCPs) for asthma, emergency department visits for asthma, and hospitalizations. We will use parent reports for the 6 month period. Hospital and PCP medical records will be used to corroborate reported data, and for families that are unable to be contacted.</description>

    <description>During discharge, the study MD/nurse informs the family that the child has been randomized to the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) group, and will be prescribed fluticasone to help control the asthma. The families preferred pharmacy is determined and a prescription for a fluticasone multi-dose inhaler (MDI) provided. Dosing follows the NHLBI asthma guidelines for low dose ICS in this age group (88 mcg administered twice per day, dispense one inhaler, 3 refills). In addition to standard asthma discharge instructions, the family receives specific instructions for ICS administration, possible side effects of medication use, and distinction between controller and quick-relief rescue medications. Parents are instructed to discuss with their primary care provider the length of ICS use.</description>
