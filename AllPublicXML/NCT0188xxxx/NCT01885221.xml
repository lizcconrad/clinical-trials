    <textblock>
      In an earlier study, the investigators developed a guidebook that taught women supportive
      behaviors to help their husbands/partners quit smokeless tobacco. This study will create a
      website using the information in the guidebook, along with interactive features, videos, and
      forums. The investigators will then conduct a randomized trial comparing an intervention
      group (receiving website access and the printed guidebook) with a delayed treatment control
      condition, to learn if the support intervention can effectively teach women supportive
      behaviors and thereby increase their partners' smokeless tobacco cessation rates.
