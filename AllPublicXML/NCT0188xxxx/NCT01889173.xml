  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very low dose (VLD) cyclobenzaprine at bedtime has shown promise as a treatment for
      fibromyalgia, but the chemistry of cyclobenzaprine requires new formulation technology for
      bedtime use. The present trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of 3
      different formulations of TNX-102 2.8 mg SL Tablets (a new formulation of cyclobenzaprine
      designed to result in increased dosage precision and decreased potential for morning
      grogginess) and to compare the bio-availability of 3 different formulations of TNX-102 2.8 mg
      SL Tablets (TNX-102 with potassium phosphate, TNX-102-B with sodium phosphate, and TNX-102-C
      with trisodium citrate) to that of cyclobenzaprine (5 mg tablets).
