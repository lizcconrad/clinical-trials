      The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of an investigational 2 mg
      sublingual nicotine tablet (Pharmaceutical Productions Inc.) to a 2 mg Commit® nicotine
      lozenge (GlaxoSmith Kline) in a randomized crossover design in 6 male and female otherwise
      healthy smokers.

      A single oral dose of each medication will be administered to each participant with a 48 hour
      washout period between administrations. Serial blood samples will be obtained at the
      following times after the administration of the nicotine dosage forms: 0, 4, 8, 10, 12, 16,
      30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing and at 30,
      60, 180, and 240 minutes after dosage administration. A craving questionnaire will be
      administered prior to dosing and at 5, 11, 17, 25, 35, 50, and 65 minutes. Craving
      questionnaires will then be administered at 30 minute intervals thereafter up to 180 minutes
      after medication administration. A Product Preference Questionnaire will be completed at the
      end of the second study period. A 30 day follow-up visit will be scheduled with each
      participant at the conclusion of the study
