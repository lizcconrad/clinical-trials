    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a common clinical problem of musculoskeletal pain and
      various treatment modalities have been introduced. If self-applicable physical modalities and
      medications that are used for treatment of MPS patients are combined, they may open up new
      possibilities for effective and practical self-care. The aim of this study is to compared the
      therapeutic effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) patch given in monotherapy
      and NSAID patch in combination with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, heating pad,
      or topical capsaicin in the treatment of patients with MPS of the upper trapezius.
