  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhalation is a common condition in patients with impaired their awareness requiring
      protection of the upper airway by endotracheal intubation. This inhalation may lead to
      chemical pneumonitis and/or bacterial pneumonia. Only the latter requires the administration
      of antibiotics. Patients developing such a bacterial pneumonia, has a mortality, duration of
      mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay increased. However, the proportion of patients
      with such bacterial pneumonia, bacterial ecology and morbidity that are little known.

      The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of bacterial pneumonia in patients
      admitted to the ICU for coma and treated with mechanical ventilation

        Patients hospitalized in ICU for coma (define by Glasgow score &lt; 8) and under mechanical
        ventilation. Suspicion of bacterial inhalation pneumonia will be confirme by a protected
        distal sampling during a flexible bronchoscopy.
