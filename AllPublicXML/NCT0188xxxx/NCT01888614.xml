  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate etCO in patients with HbSS, HbSC, and HbS-beta
      thalassemia during routine clinic visits, and longitudinally. Our goal is to know whether
      etCO differs amongst subjects with different sickle cell syndrome genotypes, and whether it
      is a stable marker of hemolytic rate, as reflected in routine labs obtained for clinical care
      (including total hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and, when sampled,
      total and direct bilirubin). We hope to establish whether this inexpensive and non-invasive
      test faithfully reflects hemolytic parameters in sickle cell syndromes.

      This is an observational study of sickle cell patients with the aim to measure exhaled carbon
      monoxide levels and to correlate with genotype and standard clinical markers of hemolysis.

      Upon enrollment and at each subsequent visit, if acceptable to the patient, each subject will
      undergo measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide utilizing a hand held carbon monoxide monitor,
      MicroCO/Smoke check. Subsequent evaluations may be obtained during a routine visit, while
      hospitalized for a vasocclusive crises (VOC) episode, or when evaluated in the acute care
      clinic.

      The principal study objective is to assess if exhaled carbon monoxide levels are a
      non-invasive marker of hemolysis in subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD).

      The secondary study objective is to assess exhaled carbon monoxide levels serially in
      subjects with SCD, relative to vasocclusive crises, transfusion requirements, and pain
      syndromes.

      The one inclusion criteria is for all adult sickle patients presenting for follow up at the
      outpatient sickle cell clinic who are capable of following simple instructions.

      The exclusion criteria are a recent (2 week) history of lung infection, asthma, acute chest
      syndrome, or COPD exacerbation and/or a significant pulmonary dysfunction in the recent (3-6
      month) past.
