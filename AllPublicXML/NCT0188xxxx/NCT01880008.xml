  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant neoplasm of the adult brain. Even after
      multimodal therapy, outcomes remain poor, with a median survival of one year. Although
      advanced imaging methods have been suggested as molecular markers of prognosis and
      therapeutic response, these methods have not been validated for clinical use. In this
      exploratory, imaging-based, trial, thirty patients with a pathological diagnosis of
      glioblastoma will be followed prospectively for two years. The study examines how PET and MR
      imaging signals change following administration of a standard radio-chemotherapy treatment
      regimen to determine whether these imaging modalities can provide early indicators of
      response to therapeutic intervention. The investigators hypothesize that decreases in uptake
      of an investigational 18F-FLT PET tracer following treatment with radiation and chemotherapy
      will be a reliable predictor of glioblastoma response. In a more exploratory fashion, the
      investigators also will identify changes in diffusion and hypoxia MR imaging that may also
      correlate well with treatment response.

      Patients with glioblastoma will be imaged with FLT PET/CT followed by MRI. The FLT uptake
      will be correlated with advanced MRI markers of tumor progression to determine the ability of
      using FLT PET and MRI for predicting response to treatment.
