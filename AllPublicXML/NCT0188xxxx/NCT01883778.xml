      The purpose of this study is to identify existing cost knowledge of Emergency Medicine (EM)
      physicians and patients and investigates its reported impacts on medical compliance. A
      cross-sectional survey will be administered electronically to Emergency Medicine physicians
      at the University of Utah Hospital and the Emergency Physician Integrated Care, LLC (EPIC)
      who staff ten-community hospital Emergency Departments (ED) in order to investigate physician
      knowledge and attitudes regarding cost and perceived patient compliance. In addition, a
      cross-sectional survey will be administered to a convenience sample of patients presenting to
      the University of Utah Emergency Department to obtain information about their cost knowledge
      and reported compliance. All ED patients will complete a follow-up phone survey to measure
      compliance with recommendations made during the ED visits. Following administration of the
      baseline survey physicians will be provided the prices of the test and procedures and will be
      re-surveyed 30-days later as a post intervention test to measure changes in knowledge and
      attitudes.

        There will be two distinct study populations in this study. The first population will
        consist of physicians from Emergency Medicine. There are 51 Emergency Medicine physicians
        at the University of Utah (27 attending, 24 residents); there are 138 board-certified
        Emergency Medicine physicians in the EPIC group therefore a projected provider cohort of
        n=90 (about 50% of 189) is anticipated. The only exclusion criterion for physicians is they
        do not practice in one of the above-mentioned provider groups.

        The second population will consist of patients presenting to the University Utah Emergency
        Department who are determined by the attending physicians to be mentally and physically
        competent to complete the questionnaire (n=450). Included in this cohort are all English
        speaking patients who are eighteen years of age and older, who are deemed psychologically
        and medically stable by the ED care provider, are not prisoners, and were not brought in by
        EMS.
