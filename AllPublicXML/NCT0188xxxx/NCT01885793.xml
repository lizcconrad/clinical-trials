    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study looking at ways to measure the cuff pressure of cuffed
      endotracheal tubes (ETTs). We will be comparing a hand-held manometer (MM) to the transducer
      of an invasive pressure monitoring setup (IPMS), which is commonly used for arterial or
      central venous pressure monitoring. The investigators previously did this study in vivo with
      ETTs in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) &quot;tracheas&quot; and we found that there is good correlation
      between the pressure readings using the MM and the IPMS. The purpose of the current study is
      to validate the in vitro findings in clinical situations.
