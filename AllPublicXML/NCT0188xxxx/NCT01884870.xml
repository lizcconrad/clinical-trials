      Ureteral stones may be silent in 5.3% of patients. The goal of this study was to
      prospectively evaluate the impact of a silent ureteral stone on renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of nephrolithiasis is increasing worldwide, reaching 5.2% in North America and
      10.1% in Italy. The widespread use of computed tomography and ultrasonography have resulted
      in a greater detection rate of asymptomatic stones and, in part, might explain the trend.
      Clinically, kidney or ureteral stones range in severity from asymptomatic to presenting with
      complete renal failure. Therefore, it is not only the alarming incidence of urinary stone
      disease, but also the associated burden that makes this one of the most concerning conditions
      in public health.

      The situation becomes even more distressing when managing asymptomatic stones. Studies of the
      natural history of stones have revealed that only 20% of patients yearly actually become
      symptomatic from a new stone, and one half of those require surgical intervention at some
      point. The guidelines are well established for the treatment of symptomatic urolithiasis, and
      many investigators have extensively studied the management of silent kidney stones.
      Conversely, the same is not true for silent ureterolithiasis. The purpose of the present
      study is to report the investigators experience managing silent ureteral stones and to
      prospectively analyze their true influence on renal function.
