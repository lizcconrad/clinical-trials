  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the effect of chronic consumption of Quercetin 500 mg
      tablets on blood uric acid and other biomarkers in adult males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the research is to determine the long term effects of daily supplementation
      of quercetin, a compound naturally and normally present in food, on the chemical composition
      (uric acid ii and glucose) of blood and urine and on blood pressure, of healthy males.

      Six of the volunteers will collect urine after consuming a standard meal made from fresh
      onion and after quercetin supplement intake, in the same way, with 3 days washout before
      each. The urine collected here will be analysed to check that the supplement is equivalent to
      the food. Stage 2 will only be conducted with supplement and placebo.

      Healthy male volunteers with higher (than average) blood uric acid will be selected and will
      be asked to consume a standard supplement/placebo added to their own diet for 4 weeks per
      phase. Two arms are separated by 4 weeks resting period: quercetin supplement and placebo.
      Blood and urine samples will be taken every other week to detect any changes of uric acid and
      other biomarkers.

      ----- i) Quercetin is found in a variety of foods including apples, berries, brassica
      vegetables, capers, grapes, onions, shallots, tea, and tomatoes, as well as many seeds, nuts,
      flowers, barks, and leaves.

      ii) Uric acid, a compound found in both in the human body and urine, is produced by the
      breakdown of purines, which are nitrogen-containing compounds in substances such as nucleic
      acids (DNA). They enter the circulation from digestion of certain foods, drinks (alcoholic
      beverages like beer and wine) or from normal breakdown and turnover of cells in the body.
      Most uric acid is removed by the kidneys and disposed of in the urine; the remainder is
      excreted in the stool.
