  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will compare 3 treatments. The first group of patients will receive the
      standard treatment (paracetamol, diclofenac and an opioid if necessary) with infiltration of
      the portal sites with the local anesthetic ( 0.5% levobupivacaine) . The second group of
      patients will receive the standard of care, with infiltration of the portal sites with the
      local anesthetic ( 0.5% levobupivacaine) and additional injection of the local anesthetic (
      0.5% levobupivacaine, non -diluted) in the peritoneal cavity via a trocar both at the
      beginning and the end of the surgery . The third group of patients will receive the standard
      of care, with infiltration of the portal sites with the local anesthetic ( 0.5%
      levobupivacaine) and additional intraperitoneal atomization of the local anesthetic. We will
      use non-diluted 0.5% levobupivacaine delivered directly onto the target sites both at the
      beginning and the end of surgery. The drug will be delivered using OptiSpray® surgical spray
      device, an inexpensive delivery system that will direct a fine mist of drug directly to the
      areas of the peritoneal cavity that are theoretically the cause of post-op pain (diaphragms,
      peritoneal abdominal surface, surgical dissection site).

      Our primary goal is to assess the efficacy of intraperitoneal atomization of levobupivacaine
      in reducing postoperative pain and of opioid requirements in patients undergoing
      gynecological laparoscopic procedures in one-day surgery.
