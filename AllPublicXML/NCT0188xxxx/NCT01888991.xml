  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of substrate oxidation, expressed by
      RER, on food intake regulation and net energy balance.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between substrate oxidation as measured by respiratory exchange ratio (RER)
      and food intake is undefined. This study is examining the effects of three modulators of
      substrate oxidation (RER), a glucose preload, exercise and age food intake regulation and net
      energy balance in normal-weight boys (9-12 y) and men (20-30 y).

      Subjects (15 boys, 15 men) were measured in random order with treatments of beverages of
      either water or glucose followed by either moderate exercise or rest for 40 min. Measures
      included RER via indirect calorimetry, energy expenditure, subjective appetite, food intake
      measured at an ad libitum pizza meal and net energy balance as the sum of the calories of the
      glucose preload + calories from the pizza lunch minus energy expended at exercise or rest.
