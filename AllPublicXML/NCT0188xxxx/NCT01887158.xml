  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies that have investigated different bowel preparations in patients with history of
      colorectal surgery are surprisingly lacking.Therefore, which is the best colon preparation in
      this subgroup of patients is still unknown. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based solutions are the
      most popular and safest bowel preparation regimens, however the 4-Liter volume is often
      poorly tolerated. More recently, it has been shown that the use of a low volume preparation
      (2-Liter PEG solution with the adjunct of a laxative, bisacodyl) achieves comparable bowel
      cleanliness rates to 4-Liter PEG in general population.The primary aim will be to compare the
      efficacy of 2-L mixed preparation (bisacodyl plus PEG) to 4-L PEG preparation.

    <measure>Tolerability to the preparation (specific questionaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed from the randomization until the time of colonoscopy, about 2 weeks after the randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability will be assessed by using a questionnaire completed by the patients on arrival at the endoscopy unit before colonoscopy.
The patient acceptance/satisfaction to bowel preparation will be evaluated with the following question:
What is the extent of your disturbance due to bowel preparation? Severe (the bowel preparation assumption was stopped and not completed)(score 3) Moderate (bowel preparation assumption was stopped several times because of side effects but finally completed)(score 2) Mild (bowel preparation was completed without pauses but with some mild side effects)(score 1) No side effects (score 0)</description>

    <time_frame>about 2 weeks from the randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Polyps will be categorized as non-neoplastic or neoplastic (ie, adenomatous). Adenoma will be diagnosed by pathological evaluation of retrieved polyps. Adenomas will be considered advanced when they will be ≥10 mm in size, with villous architecture, high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma (pTis), or 3 or more adenomas will be found. Invasive cancer will be considered when malignant cells will be observed beyond the muscularis mucosa. Size of adenoma will be obtained from both the colonoscopist's assessment and the pathology report, with the larger measurement being used in the analyses. Site of adenoma will be recorded by the colonoscopist at the time of polypectomy. Lesions at or proximal to the splenic flexure will be termed right-sided lesions, those distal to the splenic flexure as left-sided, taking into account the type of colorectal surgical resection underwent by the patient. The adenoma detection rate will be defined as the proportion of colonoscopies with adenomas.</description>
