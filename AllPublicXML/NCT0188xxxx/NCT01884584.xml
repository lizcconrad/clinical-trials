      The surgeon may remove a very small amount of additional tissue compared to what would be
      removed if you were not enrolled in the study. This tissue may prove to contain tumor or it
      may contain normal tissue. The surgical cavity will be examined by a special laser pen after
      the tumor is removed, and if areas of fluorescence are seen, that may indicate tumor cells
      where the ICG dye collected are still remaining and the surgeon would then remove those.
      After the tumor and the tissue around it are removed and sent to the laboratory, the tissue
      may be examined using that same laser pen to see where the cancer cells are and compare that
      to what the laboratory sees when it looks at the tumor and tissue with a microscope. It is
      hoped that what the dye shows and what is seen with the microscope will be alike.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To validate the use of intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) for better definition of
      tumor margins therefore, minimizing the necessity of a second surgical procedure to obtain
      negative margins.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive indocyanine green solution intravenously (IV) between 2-8 hours before
      surgery. Fluorescence measurements are taken from all specimens removed during surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 48 hours.
