  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves 3 phases that modifies current Interactive Preventative Health
      Record-Colorectal Cancer Screening (IPHR-CRCS) modules to address each patient's individual
      colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) knowledge, attitudes, preferences, and test-specific
      barriers. The study will engage patients, ages 50-75 years who are non-adherent to CRCS, to
      assess their CRCS test preferences and corresponding test-specific barriers in &quot;real time&quot;.
      Based on patient characteristics (e.g. age, personal and family history, physician CRCS
      recommendation, CRCS test preferences, top test-specific barriers), tailored messages/videos
      will appear in the pop-up screens to address/reduce the top patient-reported, test-specific
      CRCS barriers while incorporating an action plan for CRCS adherence. The investigators
      hypothesize that modifying the IPHR-CRCS module to address each patient's individual CRCS
      knowledge, attitudes, preferences, and test-specific barriers will further increase CRCS.

    <time_frame>Phase II: Baseline, 3 months, and 9 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The four NCI-recommended CRCS history questions will be included on the self-report surveys. Respondents will identify the last time they had each test (i.e., fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and barium enema). Having had ≥1 test within the time frame specified for each procedure will count as adherent CRCS.</description>

    <description>We will track participants' use of the intervention and usual care arms to capture number of log-ins, pages viewed, length of view, links clicked. In addition to elucidating patients' uptake of intervention components, these data can indicate engagement for dose-response analyses or be examined as potential mediators. For Phase II, this data will allow us to assess the timing of intervention reminders to make a decision about what frequency is most appropriate so that we can modify before we begin the feasibility study (phase III).</description>

    <time_frame>Phase II: Baseline, 3 months, and 9 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>A previously validated modality-specific colorectal cancer screening barrier instrument will be used. The FOBT-specific scale includes 19 questions relating to barriers for fecal occult blood test, and the colonoscopy-specific scale includes 21 questions relating barriers to colonoscopy. All items are measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with 5 representing greater barrier endorsement. Items are summated to create continuous scale scores (range: FOBT=19-95; colonoscopy=21-105).</description>

    <measure>Feasibility of MyCRCS+ in target setting - patient survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase III: Baseline and 9 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Phase III is a feasibility study to determine among other things, implementation in the &quot;real world&quot; setting. The outcomes we propose to measure are defined by the RE-AIM model. Specifically, we selected four essential elements pertaining to the feasibility of fielding MyCRCS+: Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, and Maintenance.
The patient survey will include key questions related to intervention reach and potential future implementation adaptations addressing patient awareness and perception of the practices' MyCRCS+ integration strategies.Surveys will assess: patients' awareness of MyCRCS+, how they learned about it, what they liked or disliked about how practices promoted and used MyCRCS+; to what extent they used the MyCRCS+, the factors that influenced use, facilitators and barriers to both using and acting on MyCRCS+ recommendations; anxiety and worry; and quality of life (QOL).</description>

    <description>The IPHR will be programmed so that where the IPHR-CRCS would normally present patients, who based on their demographics and health conditions, with content advising them to seek CRCS and links to third-party sites, they would instead be randomized to receive the usual care (IPHR-CRCS).</description>

    <description>Patients who are identified by the IPHR as study participants will see an attractive link. In the Prefs arm, via question prompt lists, patients will first identify their CRCS preference using previously developed elicitation strategies.
Tailoring will be used to increase salience of information, motivation, communication, and action plans. We envision the Prefs+ arm in its entirety will be 5-7 minutes, but will depend on Phase I formative work. If the patient remains non-adherent, they will receive an e-mail reminder generated by the IPHR (specific text and frequency determined in Phase I). The Prefs content is identical to the preference portion of the Prefs+Barriers arm, which will allow us to assess the incremental benefit of addressing preferences only and the incremental benefit of addressing preferences and barriers.</description>

    <description>Patients who are identified by the IPHR as study participants will see an attractive link. In the Prefs+Barriers arm, via question prompt lists, patients will first identify their CRCS preference using previously developed elicitation strategies, and subsequently based on their test preference determine their top 3-5 test-specific barriers/concerns in &quot;real time&quot;.
Tailoring will be used to increase salience of information, motivation, communication, and action plans. We envision the Prefs+Barriers arm in its entirety will be 15-25 minutes, but will depend on Phase I formative work. If the patient remains non-adherent, they will receive an e-mail reminder generated by the IPHR (specific text and frequency determined in Phase I). The Prefs content is identical to the preference portion of the Prefs+Barriers arm, which will allow us to assess the incremental benefit of addressing preferences only and the incremental benefit of addressing preferences and barriers.</description>
