  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study to investigate safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of AZD4721 given to

             kg and no more than 100 kg (inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate

          2. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous
             3 months

        urinary tract infection) or at risk of infection (surgery, trauma, or significant
        infection) in previous 90 days, or history of skin abscesses within the previous
