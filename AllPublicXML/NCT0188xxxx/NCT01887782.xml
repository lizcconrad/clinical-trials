  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare a novel form of rTMS, intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation to the
      standard conventional high frequency left sided stimulation protocol. The Left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex will be the site of stimulation in both treatment conditions. The site of
      stimulation will be targeted using MRI co-registration. The study seeks to determine if the
      two treatment protocols have similar effectiveness in treating major depression.

    <description>Outcome measure is measured by a change in the HAM-D17 score from baseline to week 4 or 6. A 50% improvement in the score is considered response to rTMS. A final score of &lt;8 is categorized as remission.</description>
