    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TXA127 to reduce the incidence
      (Grade II-IV) of acute Graft-vs.-Host Disease (aGVHD) in adult subjects undergoing allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The study will also evaluate the effects
      of TXA127 on incidence, severity and duration of mucositis; neutrophil engraftment and
      platelet recovery; platelet transfusion requirements; immune reconstitution; and duration of
      corticosteroid use. TXA127 has shown to be well tolerated by patients and appears to induce
      rapid production of neutrophils and platelets in the bloodstream, as well as increase the
      immune system components. TXA127 has also been shown reduce the severity of
      chemotherapy-induced mucositis.

      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasingly used as an
      effective treatment for malignant disease. The three most common sources for stem cells used
      in HSCT are bone marrow (BM), umbilical cord blood (UCB), and peripheral blood stem cells
      (PBSC). In a retrospective review of 1,525 adults with acute leukemia receiving allogeneic
      transplants between 2002 and 2006, UCB accounted for 10.8%, PBSC for 58.2%, and BM for 31% of
      the population (Eapen et al., 2010). PBSC as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for
      transplantation has advantages over bone marrow in terms of donation ease and comfort and
      over cord blood in terms of adequate cell dose. However, PBSC transplantations are associated
      with an increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Based on current literature
      acute GVHD (aGVHD) is reported in 48-80% of PBSCT recipients (Eapen et al., 2010, Ferrara et
      al., 2009). Additionally, the myeloablative conditioning regimens used for these transplants
      often result in mucositis which can be debilitating to patients. TXA127 is
      pharmaceutically-formulated angiotensin 1-7, a non-hypertensive derivative of angiotensin II.
      TXA127 has multilineage effects on hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and in vivo. The
      hematopoietic properties demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies support the
      investigation of TXA127 to reduce the incidence of aGVHD and mucositis in this patient
      population.
