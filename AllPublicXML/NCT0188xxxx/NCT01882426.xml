  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess if standardized care-path that features objective evaluations of disease activity and
      time-bound algorithms is superior to usual step-care in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Step-care based on symptomatic response remains the overwhelming algorithm of choice in
      clinical practice. Many subjects receive infliximab only as a last resort, when the subject
      is very ill and has failed repeated attempts of corticosteroid induction therapy. Although
      this situation is far from ideal, to change such entrenched physician behavior will require
      compelling evidence that Step-care results in inferior outcomes to earlier introduction of
      effective therapy.

      Based on these considerations, we will perform a cluster randomization trial in which 40
      gastroenterology practices will be randomly assigned to a treatment algorithm featuring the
      early use of combination therapy, treatment intensification guided by objective assessments
      of inflammation and the use of remission as a therapeutic goal or a conventional Step-care
      approach.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             randomization, and must use a hormonal (oral, implantable or injectable) or barrier
             method of birth control throughout the study. Females unable to bear children must
             have documentation of such in the source records -- - Documented diagnosis of UC with
             a Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) ≥6 and a baseline Mayo Endoscopy Score &gt;2.

          -  Either an elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (above the Upper Level of Normal
             (ULN) according to local laboratory results) or elevated fecal calprotectin (&gt; 250
             mg/kg) concentration.

          -  Requires sigmoidoscopic evaluation at baseline (standard of care)

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained and documented.

          -  Ability of subject to participate fully in all aspects of this clinical trial in the
             opinion of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous failure of TNF antagonist therapy

          -  Received any investigational drug in the past 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Any conditions (e.g., history of alcohol or substance abuse) which in the opinion of
             the investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with study
             procedures.
