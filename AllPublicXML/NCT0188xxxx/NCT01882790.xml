  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autonomic nerve function is involved in both blood pressure (BP) regulation and the
      pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm(CAS), but few studies have been published about the
      relationship between CAS and effect of BP lowering drugs in patients with hypertension. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of CAS, atrioventricular (AV) block and
      effect of BP lowering drugs on CAS in hypertensive patients treated with BP lowering agents.
      The investigators will register consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography with
      an acetylcholine (Ach)-induced provocation test. The investigators will include hypertensive
      patients who were taking antihypertensive drugs, and exclude patients who had a documented
      history of cardiovascular disease or who were not treated with antihypertensive agents. CAS
      is defined as &gt;70% luminal narrowing on Ach provocation and /or concurrent chest pain. The
      study population will be divided into quartiles of rising systolic BP and diastolic BP. The
      incidence of Ach-induced CAS according to each systolic BP/diastolic BP quartile will be
      evaluated.

      A total of consecutive patients in the CAS registry of the Cardiovascular Center at Korea
      University Guro Hospital and who had resting chest pain without significant coronary lesions
      (luminal narrowing &lt;50%) underwent a provocation test with Ach infusion during coronary
      angiography from November 2004 to May 2012 will be reviewed. Among them, patients with
      documented cardiovascular disease and/or any other serious medical condition, such as an
      increased serum creatinine level (&gt;2mg/dl), will be excluded. Patients will be excluded due
      to incomplete data. The investigators will register hypertensive patients who are currently
      using antihypertensive medications. The study population will be divided into quartiles based
      on rising systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressure. CAS+chest pain(CP) means&gt;70% luminal
      narrowing on Ach provocation test. and/or concurrent typical chest pain.

      BP was measured with a noninvasive BP monitoring device with the patient lying on the
      angiographic table after a five-minute rest (Patient monitoring system, NP 30:Philips,
      Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The first reading was discarded, and the mean of the next two
      consecutive readings was used. Next, coronary angiography was performed. Hypertension is
      defined as systolic BP ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90mmHg on at least two consecutive
      readings in the outpatient clinic. Patients taking antihypertensive medications are also
      categorized as hypertensives. Other Risk factors for CAS examined in this study include
      hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level ≥200mg /dl or current medication with lipid-lowering
      drugs), diabetes (fasting blood glucose≥126mg /dl, and/or glycated Hemoglobin A1c level more
      than 6.5% or current use of medications), current smoker (active smoking within the past 12
      months), and current alcohol user (at least 1 alcohol drinking a week).
