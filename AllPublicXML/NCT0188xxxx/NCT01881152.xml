  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The starting hypothesis is that a multilevel educational campaign, specifically developed for
      the local community, can increase public stroke awareness and reduce pre-hospital delay.

      The effectiveness of such intervention will be evaluated according to a cluster randomized,
      stepped wedged design. The clusters are the four communities of the Area Vasta Emilia Nord,
      AVEN (Parma, Piacenza, Modena e Reggio Emilia). As analysis Units, we will consider the
      patients consecutively admitted to the six participating hospitals throughout the study
      period, for suspected stroke or transitory ischemic attack (TIA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a baseline 3 month period, the educational campaign will be sequentially launched in
      the four communities over four 3 month periods, according to a computer-generated list. The
      comparison will be the&quot;usual care&quot;.

      Primary outcome measures: The proportion of patients arriving at the Emergency Department
      (ED) with suspected stroke or TIA within two hours.

      Secondary outcome measures: the proportion of patients with confirmed stroke or TIA
      diagnosis; the proportion of ischemic stroke patients evaluated for recominanat Tissue
      Plasminogen Activator (rTPA) therapy; the proportion of patients treated with rTPA; time
      interval between arrival at the ED and CT scan; for patients treated with rTPA, time interval
      between arrival at the ED and therapy initiation (door to needle time); death and disability
      (assessed as modified Rankin Score 3-5) at 1 and 3 month from stroke onset.
