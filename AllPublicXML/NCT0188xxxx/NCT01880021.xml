  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibrosis level of explanted mesh</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each specimen will be graded and given fibrosis score of 0 - 4 to establish the degree of inflammation/foreign body reaction that occurred while mesh was in vivo.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tensile strength of explanted mesh</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each specimen will be tested for tensile strength to determine force versus displacement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Collagen protein levels of explanted mesh.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The total amount of collagen and non-collagenous proteins in cultured cell layers and tissue sections by differential staining with two dyes, sirius red and fast green. Sirius Red binds to all types of collagen, whereas fast green stains non-collagenous proteins.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with history of radiation to abdomen/pelvis</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Identify possible clinical characteristics which affect mesh degradation.</description>
