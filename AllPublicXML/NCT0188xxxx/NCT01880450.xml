  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project Prepared is a theoretically based, comprehensive, intensive group intervention that
      is designed to prepare early adolescents for middle adolescence and its challenges. It
      emphasizes skills in avoiding risky sexual situations, and provides medically accurate
      information about sexual development, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.
      Effectiveness is measured by using a randomized control trial design and tracking differences
      in cognitive factors (HIV/STI (Sexually Transmitted Infections) knowledge, sexual
      self-efficacy; intention to use a condom); relationship factors (immature romantic beliefs,
      relationship self-efficacy), gender norms (macho man, powerless female), and resilience.
