    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of
      an investigational combination of drugs to learn whether they work in treating a specific
      cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs is still being studied and that
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it, such as the safest dose to use and the
      side effects they may cause. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the combination.

      The two drugs being tested in this study are tivozanib and enzalutamide. Enzalutamide has
      been approved by the FDA for treatment of prostate cancer. On the other hand, tivozanib is
      still investigational, and has not been tested in a combination with enzalutamide before.

      Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist (it blocks the activity of the male sex
      hormones). Prostate cancers are initially dependent on the male hormone testosterone for
      growth. Hormonal therapies that lower testosterone or block the ability of testosterone to
      act at the level of the prostate cancer are currently among the most effective treatments for
      prostate cancers taht have spread to other body organs (metastasized). The effectiveness of
      hormonal treatments, however, is not permanent, and over time many prostate cancers progress
      in spite of these treatments. Enzalutamide is a drug that has been proven to help delay the
      progression of advanced prostate cancer on average for about 8 months.

      Tivozanib is an anti-angiogenesis medicine that fights different types of cancer by blocking
      the blood supply to the tumor, so that the tumor does not receive the nutrients it needs to
      grow. The main goal of this study is to determine whether the combination of tivozanib and
      enzalutamide is more effective in delaying the progression of disease than when enzalutamide
      is given alone. This study will also determine whether treatment with the combination of the
      tivozanib and enzalutamide will have more side effects then treatment with enzalutamide
      alone.

      Patients will be treated in treatment cycles of 28 days (4 weeks), during which time they
      will take tivozanib once a day for 21 days (3 weeks) followed by a one week break from
      treatment. The other medication, enzalutamide, will be taken every day throughout each cycle.

      Patients will be given a Study Drug Administration Diary to keep a brief record of medication
      administration, and to record any side effects or symptoms.

      Patients will be seen in the clinic at the beginning of each cycle (every 4 weeks). During
      each visit they will have the following procedures: medical history, vital sign measurements,
      complete physical examination, performance status, routine blood tests, urine sample,
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, assessment of tumor, review of study drug
      administration diary, and review of current medications.

      About four weeks after stopping the study drug patients will be asked to return to the
      research clinic for a final study visit. The following procedures will be done: medical
      history, vital sign measurements, brief physical examination, electrocardiogram, review of
      other medications used since the last visit, routine blood tests, urine sample and a review
      of any changes in health.
