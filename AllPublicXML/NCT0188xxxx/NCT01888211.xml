  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms through which omega-3 fatty acids reduce adverse cardiac events remain
      uncertain. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid
      supplementation on endothelial vasomotor function, endogenous fibrinolysis, and platelet and
      monocyte activation in patients with coronary heart disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with a previous myocardial infarction were recruited into a randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
      (2g/day for 6-weeks). Peripheral blood was taken for analysis of platelet and monocyte
      activation, and forearm blood flow was assessed in a subset of 12 patients during
      intrabrachial infusions of acetylcholine, substance P and sodium nitroprusside. Stimulated
      plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentrations were measured during substance P
      infusion.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endogenous fibrinolysis (net release of plasma t-PA,IU mL-1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 6 weeks after omega 3 fatty acids or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Endogenous fibrinolysis was measured by drawing blood during intrabrachial substance P infusion and then plasma t-PA antigen and activity (t-PA Combi Actibind Elisa Kit; Technoclone, Vienna, Austria) concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Estimated net release of plasma t-PA was the product of the infused forearm plasma flow (based on the mean hematocrit and the infused forearm blood flow) and the concentration difference between the infused and noninfused arms.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured at 6 weeks after omega 3 fatty acids or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Forearm blood flow was measured during intrabrachial infusions of acetylcholine, substance P and sodium nitroprusside by venous occlusion plethysmography with mercury-in-silicone elastomer strain gauges.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circulating platelet-monocyte aggregates (%).</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 6 weeks after omega 3 fatty acids or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood was immunolabelled with appropriate monoclonal antibodies for subsequent flow cytometric analysis of platelet-monocyte aggregation. Platelet-monocyte aggregates were defined as the percentage of monocytes positive for CD42a.</description>
