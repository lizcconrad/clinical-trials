    <textblock>
      Pain associated with fibromyalgia interferes with daily function, work, and social activities
      resulting in a decreased quality of life. People with fibromyalgia also have a significant
      amount of fatigue and a fear of movement. People with fibromyalgia show enhanced excitability
      of pain neurons in the central nervous system and reduced pain inhibition. Therefore, one of
      the main treatments for patients with fibromyalgia must focus on pain relief to allow the
      person to function more independently both at home and at work. Transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation is used by health professionals to deliver electrical stimulation through
      the skin for pain control. Basic science studies, from the PI's laboratory show that TENS
      activates descending pain inhibitory pathways to inhibit excitability of pain neurons. Thus
      the ideal patient population for the treatment of TENS would be one in which there is
      enhanced central excitability and reduced inhibition; fibromyalgia is such a condition.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve
      Stimulation (TENS) to patients with fibromyalgia will reduce resting and movement-related
      pain and reduce central excitability by restoring diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC),
      and that this decrease in pain and/or central excitability will reduce fatigue and fear of
      movement, thereby improving function and quality of life

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center clinical trial
      involving a device, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS). TENS is a
      non-pharmacological agent which delivers electrical stimulation by a battery operated device
      via electrodes placed on the skin. TENS is considered to be a safe, inexpensive and
      non-invasive modality used to treat a variety of acute and chronic pain conditions. The
      initial phase of the study will randomly allocate subjects to receive active TENS, placebo
      TENS or standard care (No TENS). After participating in the 1 month random assignment, all
      subjects will receive active TENS for 1 month. The subjects will make 4 visits to the clinic
      approximately 2 to 3 1/2 hours each visit. Visits will entail questionnaires, functional
      tasks, accelerometry, TENS, pain and fatigue assessments.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to test the effect of the long-term use of TENS on
      movement-related pain as measured by a numeric rating scale (NRS) during six minute walk test
      (6MWT) in women with fibromyalgia with random assignment to three treatments: standard care
      (No TENS), placebo TENS and active TENS.

      Aim #2: A secondary aim will test if movement-pain reduction by TENS results in a concomitant
      decrease in fear of movement, fatigue, resting pain and analgesic medication and an increase
      in function and quality of life. Outcome measures will include physical function by directly
      assessing daily activity with an accelerometer, self-report (IPAQ), as well as performing
      specific function tasks. A sub-analysis will determine responders and non-responders to TENS
      and factors that predict both responders and non-responders. Multiple factors that could
      contribute to TENS response include self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, levels of physical
      activity, fear of movement, sleep, pain, fatigue, function, quality of life, or pain
      physiology.

      Aim #3: To determine if active TENS alters pain processing in women with fibromyalgia and if
      improvement in clinical symptoms correlates with normalization of pain processing physiology.
      We will evaluate change in these physiologic parameters in responders versus non-responders
      as assessed clinically.Pain processing will be assessed by examining pressure pain thresholds
      at the site and outside the site of stimulation and by examining conditioned pain modulation

      Aim #4: To determine if PROMIS (patient reported outcome measurement information system) is a
      useful instrument for assessing outcomes in women with fibromyalgia by comparing the PROMIS
      modules to symptom domains measured by other instruments validated for use in fibromyalgia
      clinical trials and by determining the performance of PROMIS in the definition of responders.
