  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the biochemical/genetic defects in erythropoietic
      protoporphyria (EPP). People with EPP have skin sensitivity to sunlight and occasionally
      develop liver disease. In this study, the investigators hope to learn the nature of the
      biochemical/genetic defects in EPP because this may help explain the severity of these
      clinical features.

      This study examines the possibility that abnormal expression of the gene mitoferrin-1, which
      codes for the protein that transports iron in the mitochondria of cells, is a contributing
      factor to the phenotype in individuals with EPP.

      Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a human genetic/metabolic disorder in which
      accumulation of the compound protoporphyrin causes skin sensitivity to sunlight. Some
      individuals with the disorder also have mild anemia, and a few have hepatobiliary disease.
      Iron is joined to protoporphyrin to form heme in the mitochondria of cells, under control of
      the enzyme ferrochelatase. Defects in this process cause the accumulation of protoporphyrin,
      leading to the biochemical and clinical features of EPP. Abnormalities in the ferrochelatase
      gene are the major cause of the defect, but do not satisfactorily explain the severity of the
      phenotype in all subjects. Mitoferrin-1 transports iron to ferrochelatase in the mitochondria
      of cells for heme formation, and also transports iron for the formation of a compound that
      keeps ferrochelatase active and stable. Thus, a deficiency of this iron transporter could
      reduce ferrochelatase activity and contribute to the phenotype in EPP.
