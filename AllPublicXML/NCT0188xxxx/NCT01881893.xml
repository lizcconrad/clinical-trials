  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The psychosocial development of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) can be challenged
      by many issues including family overprotection, impaired peer relationships, delayed
      progression into independent adulthood, and difficulties with career and future planning.
      One-third of patients have diagnosable mood or anxiety disorders and the prevalence of
      depression is 3 times that of the general Canadian population. Unfortunately, most adults
      with CHD and significant depression or anxiety do not receive mental health treatment.
      Despite an increasing awareness of the unique psychosocial concerns of this patient
      population by both health care providers and patients, there have been no interventions
      targeting psychosocial outcomes in the adult CHD population. Our quantitative and qualitative
      research suggests that patients themselves are very interested in psychological services that
      target their distinctive life experiences, are provided in a group setting, and emphasize
      coping and resilience. The overarching aim of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of a
      full-scale randomized controlled trial of a group intervention aimed at improving the
      psychosocial functioning, quality of life, and resilience of adults with CHD.
