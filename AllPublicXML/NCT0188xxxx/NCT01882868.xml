    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To assess efficacy aflibercept + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/levofolinate/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) by
      objective response rate (ORR).

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the following:

        -  safety profile;

        -  progression free survival (PFS);

        -  overall survival (OS);

        -  pharmacokinetics (PK);

        -  immunogenicity.

      Screening was up to 24 days. Treatment period was continued until DP, unacceptable toxicity,
      or participant's refusal. Follow up period was continued until death, participant's refusal,
      or end of study, whichever came first.

      This trial was conducted in Japan, where the International Nonproprietary Name (INN)
      designation for the study molecule is &quot;aflibercept&quot; and this term is therefore used
      throughout the synopsis. In the US, the US proper name is &quot;ziv-aflibercept&quot;.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 6 weeks until DP (maximum duration: 16.4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response in participants was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by an independent radiological review committee (IRRC) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions; any lymph node (target or non-target) must have reduction in the short axis to &lt;10 mm; PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Percentage of participants with overall response and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were provided. The 95% CI was calculated using normal approximation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 6 weeks until DP or death, due to any cause (maximum duration: 16.4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time interval from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first observation of DP or death due to any cause, whichever came first. If death or progression was not observed, the participant was censored at the date of participant's last valid progression-free tumor assessment prior to the study cut-off date. DP for PFS was assessed by the IRRC based on tumor imaging according to RECIST 1.1. Progression in disease was defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study with absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions. PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to death or study cut--off (maximum duration: 24.7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time interval from the date of first study drug administration to the date of death due to any cause. If death was not observed, the participant was censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive or the study cut-off date, whichever was first. OS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose (Day 1 of Cycle 1) of study treatment up to end of treatment visit (30 days after last dose of study treatment) (maximum duration: 77 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened during the on--treatment period which was defined as the period from the time of first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.</description>

    <description>Blood samples of participants were analyzed by using a titer-based, bridging immunoassay developed and validated to detect aflibercept ADA in human serum. Samples with positive antibody levels were further analyzed using a validated, non-quantitative, competitive ligand binding assay to detect NAb.</description>

        <description>Overall response in participants was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by an independent radiological review committee (IRRC) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

Percentage of participants with overall response and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were provided. The 95% CI was calculated using normal approximation.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time interval from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first observation of DP or death due to any cause, whichever came first. If death or progression was not observed, the participant was censored at the date of participant’s last valid progression-free tumor assessment prior to the study cut-off date. DP for PFS was assessed by the IRRC based on tumor imaging according to RECIST 1.1. Progression in disease was defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study with absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions. PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
