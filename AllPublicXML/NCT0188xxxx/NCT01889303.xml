  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been demonstrated a significant improvement in overall
      survival and disease-free survival according to Intergroup Trial 0116 in patients with
      gastric cancer after surgical resection. However,there are still many patients experiencing
      local recurrence or distant metastasis after adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer after resection. The optimal and
      standard regimen for adjuvant treatment has not been established in locally advanced gastric
      cancer yet.The investigators designed the trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      regimen compared with classical FOLFOX6 regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and 5-FU/CF as
      chemoradiotherapy in patients of locally advanced gastric cancer after D2 radical resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Intergroup 0116 trial, 5-FU plus CF regimen was used as adjuvant chemotherapy and
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with resected gastric cancer.But 33 percent of those
      in the chemoradiotherapy group had distant relapses. Docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as
      adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer has been proofed Safe and Effective in many clinical
      trials about gastric cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of
      docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      regimen compared with classical FOLFOX6 regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and 5-FU/CF as
      chemoradiotherapy in patients of locally advanced gastric cancer after D2 radical surgery.
      The investigators hope the new interventions can reduce the rate of distant metastasis and
      have more clinical benefit.
