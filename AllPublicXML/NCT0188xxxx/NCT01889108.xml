      The proposed feasibility study will evaluate the investigators ability to conduct a clinical
      trial of a novel intervention (SPEEDI) which addresses a striking gap in the literature.
      Supporting Play, Exploration, and Early Development Intervention (SPEEDI) differs from
      current early intervention practices in 2 important ways. First it bridges the traditional
      gap in services from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to home providing ongoing and
      intensive support for developmental activities when parents are establishing care giving
      routines. Second, in contrast to wide-ranging intervention provided by current early
      intervention models, SPEEDI uses an action perception model to target specific behaviors
      which lead to improved early motor abilities and provide a foundation for learning.[6] The
      purpose of this feasibility study is to extend the investigators preliminary data and
      evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      SPEEDI.
