  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is the commonest form of prostate cancer treatment in the UK. In one in four
      men, radiotherapy will fail to control the cancer. These men are offered hormonal treatment
      which has significant side effects. Few men are offered a further treatment such as surgery,
      HIFU or cryotherapy. Only half of these men are cancer free at 5 years. The investigators
      believe this is due to poor imaging tests such as CT and Bone scan that cannot accurately
      detect whether cancer has come back inside or outside of the prostate or both. Also
      radiotherapy damages tissue surrounding the prostate which affects tissue healing for example
      after surgery. Treating just the cancer in the prostate only (focal treatment) rather than
      the whole prostate may limit this damage and cause fewer side-effects. The investigators want
      to see if new imaging tests can better identify cancer that has spread outside of the
      prostate and areas of cancer inside the prostate. Our new tests are whole-body MRI (for
      distant disease) and MRI guided biopsies (MRI-TB) (for local disease). First, the
      investigators will compare the results of whole-body MRI to existing imaging tests
      (bone-scan, and choline PET/CT) that try to find distant spread. Second, the investigators
      will compare the results of MRI-TB to a very detailed and accurate biopsy of the prostate
      called template prostate mapping which will show us where and how aggressive the cancer is.
      Third, if the cancer is confined to the prostate, the investigators will treat men using
      focal salvage therapies HIFU and cryotherapy. The investigators believe that these new
      imaging tests could better identify those who will benefit from early hormone treatment and
      those who will benefit from local salvage treatment. Our study may help justify carrying out
      a larger trial looking at how good the treatment is in controlling cancer in the medium and
      long-term.
