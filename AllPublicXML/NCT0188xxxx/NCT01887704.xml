  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment of calcified coronary lesion remained to be elucidated. A Prospective,
      randomized controlled trial was perform to explore the immediate effect and long-term outcome
      of rotational atherectomy in patients with balloon resistant coronary lesion.

      The inclusion criteria included patients presenting drug-resistant angina pectoris who
      underwent balloon resistant angioplasty.

      The exclusion criteria included:

        1. Acute myocardial infarction within the 28 days;

        2. Intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel, contrast media, or statins;

        3. Angiographic visible thrombus, or dissection;

        4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&lt;35%;

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for 2 years after the procedure, an expected average of 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Follow-up study was performed by experienced doctors through telephone interviews or clinic visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure, and at every 6 months thereafter. The average duration of follow up was anticipated to be 24 months.</description>

    <time_frame>In hospital endpoints were doucmented for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline characteristics were measured on the day of admission to the hospital(baseline).An electrocardiogram was performed 2 h after the procedure. electrocardiograms were required to document any suspicious cardiac ischemic episodes. If any cardiac biomarker elevation was noted after the procedure, further measurements were performed as needed. During their hospital stays, patients were clinically monitored for the occurrence of any adverse events and the need for any additional coronary interventional treatment (In hospital endpoints including death, periprocedural MI).</description>

    <description>Rotablator plus conventional angioplasty and/or stenting was performed in 120 patients in the R group.
Rotablator using 140, -160, 000 rpm, small rota burr (burr-to-artery ratio, 0.6:1), avoid drop of &gt;5000 rpm for 5s.
Conventional intervention will be performed in the rotablator group. All subjects were given 100 mg/day aspirin and clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose and 75 mg/day maintenance dosage) at least 24 h before the procedure. A cutting balloon, buddy wire balloon, buddy wire, or DES (including sirolimus-eluting stent, paclitaxel-eluting stent, everolimus-eluting stent,zotarolimus-eluting stent) was implemented at the discretion of the operator in both groups.</description>

    <description>Conventional angioplasty and/or stenting was performed in 120 patients in the C group.
Conventional intervention without rotablator was performed in the C group. All subjects were given 100 mg/day aspirin and clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose and 75 mg/day maintenance dosage) at least 24 h before the procedure. A cutting balloon, buddy wire balloon, buddy wire, or DES (including sirolimus-eluting stent, paclitaxel-eluting stent, everolimus-eluting stent,zotarolimus-eluting stent) was implemented at the discretion of the operator in both groups.</description>
