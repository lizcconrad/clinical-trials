  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the immune-modulatory effects of
      arginine-rich nutritional supplements in patients undergoing surgery. Numerical and
      functional changes of all circulating immune cells will be assessed with mass cytometry.
