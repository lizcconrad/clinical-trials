    <textblock>
      The study is to understand whether distribution of two different supplies of nicotine patches
      through a telephone quitline has an effect on quit rates. The two different supplies are four
      vs. eight (in two separate four-week mailings) weeks of nicotine patches. The hypothesis is
      that eight weeks will be slightly more efficacious but four weeks will be more
      cost-effective.
