      The use of exogenous insulin and incorrect nutritional habits are conducive to obesity and
      excess weight. This leads to the development of insulin resistance, even in patients with
      type 1 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of metformin as
      adjunctive therapy on anthropometric parameters, insulin resistance and metabolic control in
      overweight and obese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

      The study group consists of 200 Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients with elevated adipose
      tissue content as measured by electrical bioimpedance, treated at the Poznan University of
      Medical Sciences Department of Diabetology in 2009-2014. All patients have type 1 diabetes
      diagnosed by autoimmune antibodies, and are treated with intensive insulin therapy. This
      group is divided into metformin treated arm (group I+ M, 100 subjects), the remaining 100
      patients are treated with insulin alone (control group, group I). Metformin is administered
      at least 6 months at a mean dose of 1000 mg/day.

      The investigators would like to assess the impact of metformin treatment on metabolic
      control, insulin resistance and anthropometric parameters in overweight and obese patients
      with type 1 diabetes.
