  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study the safety and feasibility of recruiting patients
      eligible for EUS-guided biliary drainage (EGBD). Our goal is to prospectively study safety
      and effectiveness of this procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our central hypothesis is that EGBD is equally effective and safe to percutaneous
      transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) but is associated with better quality of life than PTBD
      in patients with inoperable malignant distal biliary obstruction who have failed prior ERCP.
      Furthermore, EGBD may be associated with decreased procedure-related costs. Patients who
      undergo PTBD usually require multiple procedures for stent exchange/upsize. Our initial study
      will be a prospective multicenter feasibility study that will include patients with
      inoperable distal biliary obstruction who have failed ERCP. If feasibility is demonstrated,
      our goal will be to compare EGBD and PTBD in a randomized multicenter international trial
      with a crossover design.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive adult patients (18-80 years of age) with jaundice due to inoperable (by
             EUS and/or CT criteria or due to health status) malignant distal (more than 2cm distal
             to hilum) biliary obstruction and who have failed prior ERCP attempt. Failure is
             considered to be 2 unsuccessful attempts, according to each institution's definition
             of &quot;failed&quot; procedure (patients may be consented for EGBD prior to repeat ERCP due to
             higher likelihood of failure). One failure at outside institution and one failure at
             your institution can be considered as total of two failures.
