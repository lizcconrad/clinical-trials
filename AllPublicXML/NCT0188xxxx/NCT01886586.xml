      This study will adapt Problem Solving Therapy (PST) for individuals with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) as an intervention for preventing major depression (DEP). PST will be
      modified so as to be provided to both MCI probands as well as their support person. The
      primary aim is to examine the effectiveness of PST in individuals with MCI and the support
      person, at preventing DEP over 12 mos. in MCI probands. We also will examine the effect of
      exercise on preventing depression.

      The Recall Study (Retaining Cognition while Avoiding Late-Life Depression) is a study for
      adults 60 and older who have noticed mild memory changes in themselves or a loved one. Mild
      memory changes may feel stressful and therefore increase an individual's risk of developing
      depression. This research project will test whether Problem Solving Therapy (PST) is
      successful in preventing major depression for those living with mild cognitive impairments.
      We will also examine the effect of modest exercise on mood. You will participate in 8 to 12
      PST sessions over 16 weeks. All treatments are provided at no cost and there is compensation
      for participation.
