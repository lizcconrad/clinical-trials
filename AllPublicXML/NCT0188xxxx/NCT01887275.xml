      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of medical ozone in
      treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total of 439 patients with chronic hepatitis B were divided according to patients' intention
      into two arms. 173 patients in arm I were treated with medical ozone therapy with humares
      which was made in Germany for at least 12 weeks.266 patients in arm II were treated with
      conventional interferon-α for at least 24 weeks.Patients in both groups were followed-up for
      24 weeks.Virology response, biochemistry response and hepatitis B viral serological response
      will be studied at 12 weeks after the treatment, at the end of treatment and after 24 weeks
      of follow-up.
