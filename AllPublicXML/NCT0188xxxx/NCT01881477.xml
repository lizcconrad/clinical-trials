      CONTEXT: The physical deconditioning in the critically ill patient is favored by prolonged
      immobilization, which compromises the ability to function. This perpetuates the stays in
      hospital and intensive care units (ICU). To combat this, there physiotherapy intervention
      methods that can reverse or reduce their occurrence.

      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research is to determine the effects of passive movements,
      assisted active and resisted, and changes of position on grip strength, joint mobility and
      functional capacity in patients in ICU.

      METHODS: A quasi-experimental intervention, before and after, no control group, in which 40
      patients in an adult ICU in Medellin, receive physiotherapy care. Electrogoniometry,
      dynamometry and functional independence measure, will be made before the intervention and
      serial assessments every four days, until discharge from ICU.

      Intervention study, prospective, comparative before-after, no control group, The sample was
      chosen for convenience and consisted of all patients during the eight months of the execution
      of research, met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, ie 23 patients. The recruitment of
      patients was very limited due to the complexity of their health condition. We included
      patients older than 18 years, with over 24 hours of stay in the intensive care unit, who were
      begin physical therapy. We excluded those who were hemodynamically unstable heart disease or
      severe, severe symptomatic stenosis, decompensated heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmias,
      high blood pressure (systolic greater than 200 mmHg, diastolic greater than 110 mmHg), mean
      arterial pressure below 60 mmHg , uncontrolled systemic disease or end stage; limb with
      unstable or acute musculoskeletal injury, severe dementia or aggressive behavior that does
      not allow performing the procedure properly, injury or infection of the central nervous
      system and neuromuscular diseases which take motor control extremity, patients with inotropic
      or vasoactive treatment associated with severe sepsis or multisystem dysfunction.

      To assess muscle strength in the grip using the Baseline ® hand dynamometer. The range of
      motion were measured using the electronic goniometer Biometrics ®. Functional capacity was
      assessed using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (8), an instrument that allows the
      classification of individuals according to the score in independent, partially dependent or
      dependents.

      Range of motion was measured articular shoulder abduction and flexion, hip abduction,
      dorsiflexion standing collar. Dynamometry was applied during the initial evaluation or after
      the patient's consciousness allowed, bilaterally, choosing the best score of three. The FIM,
      was filled out at the foot of the patient bed, by the evaluators. Were followed for clinical
      outcome in four days of starting treatment, and dynamometry applied only if the state of
      consciousness allowed. Evaluations were completed once the patient was transferred to the
      Special Care Unit (SCU).

    <description>The duration of the intervention will be approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour and will take place 5 days a week. They constantly monitor the vital signs and signs of exercise intolerance.
The intervention consists of four levels of complexity. The progression in kinetic patterns based on muscle strength during exercise Kinetic methods begin with passive movements and patients are assisted in the movement slowly until they are active, culminating in movements against resistance, in all joints, with a minimum of 10 repetitions for each joint.
Additionally, it promotes the adoption and sitting positions long and short legged and walk.</description>
