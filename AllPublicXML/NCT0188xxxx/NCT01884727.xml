      To test the effect of ASEA consumption on 24-hour resting energy expenditure. Hypothesis:
      consumption of 8-oz of ASEA water (4-oz before breakfast and 4-oz before bedtime) will
      significantly elevate 24-h resting energy expenditure as compared to consumption of a placebo
      control (salt water, same dietary intake).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ASEA beverage is a special oral formulation produced from a pure saline solution
      containing 123 mg sodium and 129 mg chloride per 4 oz. serving. A proprietary electrolytic
      and catalytic process rearranges the salt water solution to mimic the redox signaling
      molecular composition of the native salt-water compounds found in and around human cells.
      Data obtained thus far, suggests the possibility that consumption of the ASEA beverage may
      increase energy expenditure and thus be beneficial for the treatment of obesity, however,
      this has not been assessed in human clinical studies. To this end, we will measure the
      effects of ASEA consumption on energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry using the indirect
      room calorimeter at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Nutrition Research Institute.

      The primary outcome measures will be the change in 24-h energy expenditure and respiratory
      quotient in response to ASEA consumption. The secondary outcome variables will include
      changes in relevant peptide hormones, and norepinephrine/epinephrine and their relationship
      to changes in energy expenditure in response to consumption of ASEA.

    <description>Subjects to arrive fasted and will spend two 24-h periods inside the metabolic chamber (ASEA or salt water) with a one week interval between visits. Blood will be drawn at 9 am prior to consumption of salt water or breakfast, and at 11 am after consumption of salt water and breakfast. Subjects will receive a second portion of salt water at 10:15 pm just prior to bedtime. The energy content of meals will be identical at each visit.</description>
