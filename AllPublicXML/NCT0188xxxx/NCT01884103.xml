  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal in this proposed study is to describe the current prehospital trauma triage
      process for older adult (ageâ‰¥55) patients with suspected Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), to
      identify the effect of certain medications (anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors) on
      TBI-related need for trauma center services, and to identify novel TBI screening strategies
      that are feasible for use in the prehospital setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is major source of disability and death for older adults. Of
      particular concern is that older adults most frequently sustain TBIs after low-mechanism
      injuries, such as falls from standing height, and frequently use anticoagulants and platelet
      inhibitors, which place them at risk for worse clinical outcomes. With the growth of the
      older adult population and the expanding use of anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors, TBI
      among older adults will continue to be a major source of morbidity and mortality unless
      methods are identified to improve outcomes in this unique population.

      Building upon our long-standing and highly successful EMS research laboratory that has
      specifically focused on the triage of injured patients and the prehospital care of older
      patients and employing a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we will collect
      data from a large, multi-county catchment area that includes multiple EMS agencies, urban and
      rural environments, as well as trauma centers and non-trauma centers. In this study, we will:
      1) identify candidate neurologic scales to maximize detection of high-risk older adult TBI
      patients; 2) characterize the current trauma triage process used by EMS providers to identify
      older patients with suspected TBI and patients taking anticoagulants and/or platelet
      inhibitors; 3) assess the public health burden of TBI among older adult EMS patients taking
      anticoagulants and/or platelet inhibitors; 4) assess the predictive ability of novel
      prehospital-based neurologic screening strategies to identify high-risk older adult TBI
      patients in the prehospital setting who require TBI-related trauma center care. Findings from
      this study have the potential to shift clinical practice in the prehospital setting by
      informing future recommendations for the identification of TBI among older adults taking
      anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors.
