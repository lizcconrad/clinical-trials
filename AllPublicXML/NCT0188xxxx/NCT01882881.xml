  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the individual and combined effects of dark
      chocolate/cocoa and almonds on lipids, lipoproteins, antioxidant defense, lipid peroxidation,
      phenolic acids, inflammatory status, blood pressure and arterial health. It is hypothesized
      that dark chocolate/cocoa and/or almonds will favorably affect lipids, lipoproteins,
      antioxidants, inflammatory status, blood pressure and arterial health compared to a healthy
      American control diet; however, the effects will be greater when dark chocolate/cocoa and
      almonds are consumed together versus consumption of each food individually.

    <description>The Control Diet will be comprised of the same foods as the test diets except for the isocaloric substitution of almonds and/or dark chocolate and cocoa for sources of saturated fat; an approximate 250 kcal substitution. In an effort to keep all the diets consistent (except for the specific foods to be tested), the Control Diet will be slightly higher in fiber (20-25g) and lower in cholesterol (~250 mg) than the typical consumption practices (15g and 278 mg, respectively).</description>

    <intervention_name>Dark Chocolate/Cocoa Diet</intervention_name>
    <description>The Dark Chocolate/Cocoa Diet will include a daily hot cocoa beverage containing 11g of natural cocoa powder and 6 pieces of Hershey's Bliss Dark Chocolate (43g of dark chocolate). This amount of dark chocolate and cocoa will allow for the isocaloric substitution with 1.5oz almonds. The total diet will provide ~33% of calories from fat. The SFA (~12%) in the Dark Chocolate/Cocoa Diet will match that of the Control Diet and be slightly higher than the Almond Diet, however the saturated fat will be comprised largely of stearic acid from the dark chocolate; cholesterol will be ≤200 mg/day. The fiber in the Dark Chocolate/Cocoa Diet will be higher than both the Control and Almond Diets due to the fiber content of the dark chocolate (~9g).</description>

    <intervention_name>Almond Diet</intervention_name>
    <description>The Almond Diet will include 1.5 oz of almonds daily and provide ~34% of calories from fat. The Almond Diet will be lower in SFA than the Control and Dark Chocolate/Cocoa Diets, containing ~ 8-9% calories from SFA. In addition, both almond containing diets will be slightly higher in MUFA and PUFA than the Control and Dark Chocolate/Cocoa Diets, as a result of the nutrient profile of the almonds. Cholesterol will be ≤200 mg/day; fiber will be increased compared to the Control Diet due to the inclusion of almonds.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dark Chocolate/Cocoa + Almond Diet</intervention_name>
    <description>This diet is designed to test the additive effects of combining consumption of dark chocolate and cocoa with almonds. The diet will include the same hot cocoa beverage (11g) and dark chocolate pieces (43g) plus 1.5 oz of almonds. Additional high saturated fat foods are removed from the Control Diet to account for both the dark chocolate and almonds. As a result, the total fat will be similar to the other three test diets at ~34-35% and the SFA will match that of the Almond Diet at ~8-9%. The fiber content of this diet will be highest (~35g); cholesterol will remain ≤200 mg/day.</description>
