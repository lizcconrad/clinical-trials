    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to estimate the proportions of vestibular schwannomas (VS) and
      meningiomas after 10 days of exposure to the study drug RAD001 at a dose of 10 mg daily, as
      determined by immunohistochemistry. This is a &quot;phase 0&quot; PK (pharmacokinetic) and PD
      (pharmacodynamic) study of RAD001 in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 2-related and
      sporadic VS and meningiomas. Enrolled patients will take RAD001 prior to a scheduled VS or
      meningioma surgery, and blood and tissue samples will be obtained for further analysis.

    <description>1) To estimate the proportions of VS and meningiomas with complete inhibition of phospho-S6 after10 days of exposure to RAD001 at a dose of 10 mg daily, as determined by immunohistochemistry. This endpoint was chosen based on prior pharmacodynamic data from a published trial, showing complete inhibition of phospho-S6 in solid tumor tissue of patients treated with RAD001 and our own preliminary data confirming baseline phospho-S6 expression in VS and meningiomas.</description>

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60%

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm³ (unsupported)

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ (unsupported)

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl (transfusion support allowed)

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN*) OR corrected glomerular filtration
             rate ≥ 70 ml/min

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN*

          -  ALT ≤ 2.5 times ULN*

          -  Serum albumin ≥ 2 g/dl

          -  INR &lt; 1.3 (or &lt; 3 on anticoagulants)

          -  Patients taking a cholesterol-lowering agent must be on a single medication and on a
             stable dose for at least 4 weeks

          -  Fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dl OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/l AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5
             times ULN*.

          -  Fully recovered from acute toxic effects of any prior chemotherapy, biological
             modifiers or radiotherapy

          -  Any neurologic deficits must be stable for ≥ 1 week

          -  Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test. The anti-proliferative activity of this
             experimental drug may be harmful to the developing fetus.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any of the following are ineligible for this research study:

          -  Patients with VS or meningiomas deemed very high surgical risk for stroke and/or other
             complications by the attending surgeon, such as meningiomas with major vascular or
             dural sinus infiltration.

          -  Patients with serious concurrent infection or medical illness, which would jeopardize
             the ability of the patient to receive the treatment outlined in this protocol with
             reasonable safety.

          -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris.

             juice.

          -  Patients cannot receive CYP3A4 inducing anticonvulsants including carbamazepine,

          -  Patients who previously received CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors must have discontinued
             these medications within at least 1 week prior to study entry and can re-start them 1
