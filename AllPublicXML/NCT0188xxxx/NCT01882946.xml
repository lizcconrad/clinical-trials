    <textblock>
      The study comprises a Phase I component during which the optimal dose of DCVax-Direct for the
      treatment of solid tissue tumors will be identified, followed by a Phase II component to
      determine if the injection of DCVax-Direct into selected solid tissue tumors has the ability
      to reduce tumor growth.

        Inclusion Criteria (summary):

          -  Age between 18 and 75 years (inclusive) at screening.

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of 70 or higher or Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) 0-1 at screening.

          -  Subjects with a histological or cytopathological confirmed diagnosis of a locally
             advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancy for which primary treatment is no longer
             effective or does not offer curative or life-prolonging potential per clinician
             judgment, with the understanding that DCVax-Direct is not intended as a treatment of
             last resort.

          -  Not eligible for complete resection due to either tumor location, physician's
             assessment or subject's choice.

          -  Must have completed at least one recent treatment regimen in the metastatic or
             advanced setting in the disease currently under treatment to reduce tumor burden.

          -  Any steroid therapy &gt;2 mg dexamethasone or equivalent dose should be stopped or have
             been tapered down 2 weeks prior to the leukapheresis.

          -  At least one measurable tumor mass, i.e. a lesion that can accurately be measured by
             CT/MRI in at least one dimension with longest diameter ≥ 1 cm, that is accessible for
             injection either with or without imaging (CT/ultrasound) guidance.

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function,

          -  Adequate blood coagulation parameters

          -  Life expectation of &gt;3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria (Summary):

          -  Positive HIV-1, HIV-2, or Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I/II) tests.

          -  History of current or prior (within the last two years) active clinically significant
             malignancy other than the tumor type for which DCVax-Direct treatment is considered,
             and except for primary tumor in the case of metastases and adequately treated basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Heavily pretreated (HP) subjects are not eligible for this study, unless treatments
             have occurred more than 1 year in the past.

          -  Presence of brain metastases, unless treated surgically and/or irradiated and
             clinically stable off steroids or on low dose (&lt; 2 mg per day) steroids for ≥ 14 days,
             or presence of leptomeningeal disease.

          -  History of immunodeficiency or unresolved autoimmune disease.

          -  Requirement for ongoing immunosuppressants.

          -  Prior active immunotherapy for cancer within the past 2 years.

          -  Ongoing medical need for continuous anti-coagulation or anti-platelet medication.

          -  Known genetic cancer-susceptibility syndromes.

          -  Acute or active uncontrolled infection

          -  Ongoing fever ≥ 101.5 degrees F/38.6 degrees C at screening.

          -  Unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as unstable angina,
             uncontrolled arrhythmias, Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis etc.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or lactating or who are not using
             adequate contraception (surgical, hormonal or double barrier, i.e. condom and
             diaphragm).

          -  Allergy or anaphylaxis to any of the reagents used in this study.

          -  Inability to obtain informed consent because of psychiatric or complicating medical
             problems.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to return for required visits and follow-up exams.
