    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be an autoimmune disease that is caused by the
      immune system attacking the central nervous system (CNS) leading to myelin loss and axonal
      damage, resulting in long-term disability. The pathophysiology of MS is complex with
      involvement of genetic and environmental factors that define the susceptibility to generate
      the autoimmune attack. MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering
      that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow down or
      stop.The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's own
      immune cells attack the nervous system. Currently, treatment of MS relays mainly on
      immunosuppression combined with monoclonal antibodies and steroid therapies.The most advanced
      application for MSCs in the neurological clinical arena is in multiple sclerosis.This
      clinical study time period is for 1 year. This study is carried out to see the role of BMMNC
      cell Therapy in Multiple sclerosis, and to control symptoms and help to maintain a normal
      quality of life of suffering patients.
