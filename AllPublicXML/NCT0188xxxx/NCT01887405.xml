    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of Jext compared with EpiPen for
      the proportion of subjects with a successful self-injection. And to evaluate and compare the
      handling characteristics of two auto-injectors (Jext and EpiPen).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-inferiority of Jext compared with EpiPen for the proportion of subjects with a successful self-injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The following steps were recorded as correctly done or not by the observer in a check list approach (yes/no):
The subject identified the safety cap.
The subject removed the safety cap.
The subject identified the end of the auto-injector where the needle presents itself
The subject used sufficient force to actuate the injection.
The subject injected the auto-injector into the anterolateral thigh at a right angle (approximately 90°) to the thigh.
The time spent for the injection of adrenaline was more than 10 seconds, i.e. with the needle in situ.
If all 6 steps were performed correctly, the injection was considered as successful. These data form the basis for evaluation of the binary primary endpoint (successful injection or not).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate and compare the handling characteristics of two auto-injectors (Jext and EpiPen) regarding subject preference for one of the two auto-injectors over the other, the time to perform the injection and any hesitance to perform the injection</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>For evaluation of the secondary endpoints, the observer assessed the following:
The time used for the actuation of the injection, i.e. the time from starting to read the instructions to having injected the adrenaline as recorded by a stop watch. This time was divided into two parts:
The time for reading the information
The time used to perform the injection Any hesitation from the subject to actuate the injection on a 4-step scale: None, Minor, Severe or Completely Inhibited (i.e. no injection)
At the end of the second session the subject was asked the following question: &quot;Which auto-injector do you prefer?&quot; The following responses were possible:
Jext / EpiPen / I don't have any preference for any of the auto-injectors. The preference is a secondary endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of instructions and AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>After the injection the subject evaluated the package of instructions (leaflet as well as the information on the auto-injector) for the following (yes/no):
Were the instructions concise? Were the instructions comprehensible? Do you have any further questions concerning the instructions or do you see any lack of clarity? These have been assessed as other endpoints.
Safety assessments included recording of all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were done.</description>

    <description>Each subject will be randomly assigned to use either the Jext or EpiPen first. The alternative auto-injector will then be used by the same subject in the second study session.
Valid for both Jext and Epipen:
Active ingredients: Adrenaline tartrate Dosage form: Prefilled auto-injector for single use, delivering one intramuscular injection Dose/strength: 150 μg Excipients: Sodium chloride, sodium metabisulphite (E223), hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), water</description>
