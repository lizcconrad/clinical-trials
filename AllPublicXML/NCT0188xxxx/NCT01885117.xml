  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to confirm the safety and immunogenicity of trivalent, surface
      antigen, inactivated influenza vaccine in 2 age cohorts: 18 to ≤60 years and ≥61 years and
      the antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen, as measured by Single Radial
      Hemolysis (SRH) or Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) at approximately 21 days post
      immunization.

      The vaccine composition will be based on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
      influenza strains for the 2013/2014 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.

      The results of this study are intended to support the use of this vaccine in future influenza
      seasons if the recommended vaccine composition remains the same, in compliance with the
      requirements of the current European Union (EU) recommendations for clinical trials related
      to yearly licensing of influenza vaccines.

    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups with SRH areas ≥25mm2 against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after receiving one dose of TIVf.
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if the percentage of subjects achieving post vaccination SRH areas ≥ 25mm2 is &gt;70% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;60% for subjects aged ≥61 years.</description>

    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase by SRH area against each of the three vaccine strains ,three weeks after receiving one dose of TIVf.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area ≤4mm2 achieving a post vaccination SRH area ≥25 mm2. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area &gt;4mm2 achieving at least 50% increase in post vaccination SRH area.
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if the percentage of subjects achieving post vaccination SRH areas ≥ 25mm2 is &gt;40% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;30% for subjects aged ≥61 years.</description>

    <description>The antibody responses were evaluated in terms of GMRs of post vaccination GMAs to pre vaccination GMAs against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after receiving one dose of TIVf.
The related European Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if the GMR day 22/day 1 is &gt;2.5 for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt; 2.0 for subjects aged ≥61 years.</description>

    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titers after receiving one dose of TIVf.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer &lt;10 to a post vaccination titer ≥40. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer ≥10 to at least a 4-fold increase in post vaccination HI antibody titers.

        <title>Percentages of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in SRH Area, Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After Receiving One Dose of TIVf</title>
        <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase by SRH area against each of the three vaccine strains ,three weeks after receiving one dose of TIVf.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area ≤4mm2 achieving a post vaccination SRH area ≥25 mm2. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area &gt;4mm2 achieving at least 50% increase in post vaccination SRH area.
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if the percentage of subjects achieving post vaccination SRH areas ≥ 25mm2 is &gt;40% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;30% for subjects aged ≥61 years.</description>

The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if the percentage of subjects achieving HI titers ≥ 40 is &gt;70% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;60% for subjects aged ≥61 years.</description>

        <title>Percentages of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in HI Antibody Titers After Receiving One Dose of TIVf</title>
        <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titers after receiving one dose of TIVf.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer &lt;10 to a post vaccination titer ≥40. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer ≥10 to at least a 4-fold increase in post vaccination HI antibody titers.
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if&gt;40 % for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and&gt;30% for subjects aged ≥61 years achieve seroconversion or significant increase in post vaccination HI titers.</description>
