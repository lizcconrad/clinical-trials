      Background: Studies regarding the effects of high protein (HP) diet on cardiovascular (CVD)
      risk factors have reported contradictory results.

      Objective: In present study, the investigators aimed to determine the effects of HP diet on
      CVD risk factors among overweight and obese children.

      Design: In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators recruited 50 overweight and
      obese women, aged 6-11years into HP or control energy restricted diets for 10 weeks (protein,
      carbohydrate, fat: 25%, 45%, 30% vs. 15%, 55%, 30%, respectively). Total protein amount,
      divided to animal and plant sources in 50%-50% and animal sources distributed (half/half)
      between meats and dairy products. Fasting blood samples, lipid profile, systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were measured based on the standard
      guidelines.
