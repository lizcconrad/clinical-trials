    <textblock>
      Study objectives:

        1. To compare cardiovascular function in older compared to young healthy adults.

        2. To compare the effect of 8 weeks of aerobic interval training vs. continuous moderate
           exercise on cardiovascular function in healthy older adults.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Compared to young adults, older adults will have lower cardiovascular function.

        2. Compared to continuous moderate intensity exercise training, interval training will be
           more effective in improving cardiovascular function in older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular function will be measured at baseline in older healthy adults and young
      healthy controls. Older adults will be randomized to the aerobic interval training group,
      continuous moderate exercise group or non-exercise control group. At the end of the 8-week
      exercise intervention, baseline measures will be repeated in the older adults.
