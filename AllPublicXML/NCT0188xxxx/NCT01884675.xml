  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesised that ambrisentan may provide benefit to subjects with inoperable chronic
      thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), where currently no proven or licensed
      treatment options exist. This Phase III, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled parallel
      group, 16 week study will compare the safety and efficacy of ambrisentan 5 milligrams (mg)
      versus placebo in subjects with inoperable CTEPH. The study will enrol 160 subjects, to
      assure at least 72 evaluable subjects per treatment arm, based on 10% drop-out rate.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Six Minutes Walking Distance (6MWD) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0); Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-minute walk test was conducted according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines in accordance with local standard operating procedures. 6MWD was measured by a 6-minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a participant can walk in a period of 6 minutes. Change from baseline was calculated at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at the specified visit minus the Baseline value. Data at Baseline is based on average of two consecutive test results during Screening/Baseline period that differ by &lt;10%. If only one measurement was available, that measurement was used. In any cases where the protocol-defined criteria for Baseline 6MWD was not met, the Baseline value was based on the last two consecutive measurements for a participant.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in WHO Functional Class (FC) at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16/Early Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0); Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO FC indicates the severity of PAH and is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association classification. It was assessed by the investigator. There are four grades for WHO FC based on severity of symptoms (Class I = none, Class IV = most severe). This functional classification system links symptoms with activity limitations, and allows clinicians to quickly predict disease progression and prognosis, as well as the need for specific treatment regimens, irrespective of the underlying etiology of PAH. Baseline is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit minus the Baseline value. For analyse purposes, the WHO FC Class categories of I-IV were mapped to a numeric scale of 1-4.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Borg CR10 Scale (BCR10S) Immediately Following Exercise at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16/Early Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0); Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The BCR10S score was collected immediately following completion of the 6-minute walk test. Baseline data was calculated as the average of the two BCR10S values obtained following the two 6MWD tests used in determining the Baseline 6MWD. If only one measurement was available, that measurement has been used. BCR10S scores ranges from 0 to 10 (0=nothing at all, 10=extremely strong). If participant's perception or feeling was stronger than &quot;10&quot;, i.e &quot;extremely strong&quot;, &quot;Maximal&quot; - a larger number could be used, e.g. 12 or still higher i.e &quot;Absolute maximum&quot;). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Plasma N-terminal Pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0); Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio to baseline [BL] in NT-proBNP was calculated as the ratio of the value at the specified time-point to the BL value and was expressed as a percent change from BL. For each treatment group, the mean change from BL at the specified time-point was determined on the log scale. This mean was then back transformed to give a geometric mean (GM) of the ratio of the value at the specified time-point to BL on the original scale. The GM was expressed as a percentage (100*[GM - 1]). Standard Deviation(SD) is the SD of the mean change from baseline values on the log scale.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Measured by Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 16/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 v2 is a self-administered, health-related quality of life (QoL) metric. It is a 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health as well as 2 summary measures (Physical Health and Mental Health). Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. The SF-36 data were collected, but after the study was terminated, not all endpoints listed in the protocol were analyzed, including the SF-36. This decision was documented in the reporting and analysis plan prior to database lock.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Six Minutes Walking Distance (6MWD) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The 6-minute walk test was conducted according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines in accordance with local standard operating procedures. 6MWD was measured by a 6-minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a participant can walk in a period of 6 minutes. Change from baseline was calculated at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at the specified visit minus the Baseline value. Data at Baseline is based on average of two consecutive test results during Screening/Baseline period that differ by &lt;10%. If only one measurement was available, that measurement was used. In any cases where the protocol-defined criteria for Baseline 6MWD was not met, the Baseline value was based on the last two consecutive measurements for a participant.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WHO Functional Class (FC) at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16/Early Withdrawal</title>
        <description>The WHO FC indicates the severity of PAH and is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association classification. It was assessed by the investigator. There are four grades for WHO FC based on severity of symptoms (Class I = none, Class IV = most severe). This functional classification system links symptoms with activity limitations, and allows clinicians to quickly predict disease progression and prognosis, as well as the need for specific treatment regimens, irrespective of the underlying etiology of PAH. Baseline is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit minus the Baseline value. For analyse purposes, the WHO FC Class categories of I-IV were mapped to a numeric scale of 1-4.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Borg CR10 Scale (BCR10S) Immediately Following Exercise at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16/Early Withdrawal</title>
        <description>The BCR10S score was collected immediately following completion of the 6-minute walk test. Baseline data was calculated as the average of the two BCR10S values obtained following the two 6MWD tests used in determining the Baseline 6MWD. If only one measurement was available, that measurement has been used. BCR10S scores ranges from 0 to 10 (0=nothing at all, 10=extremely strong). If participant's perception or feeling was stronger than ”10”, i.e “extremely strong”, “Maximal” – a larger number could be used, e.g. 12 or still higher i.e “Absolute maximum”). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at specified visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Plasma N-terminal Pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP)</title>
        <description>The ratio to baseline [BL] in NT-proBNP was calculated as the ratio of the value at the specified time-point to the BL value and was expressed as a percent change from BL. For each treatment group, the mean change from BL at the specified time-point was determined on the log scale. This mean was then back transformed to give a geometric mean (GM) of the ratio of the value at the specified time-point to BL on the original scale. The GM was expressed as a percentage (100*[GM – 1]). Standard Deviation(SD) is the SD of the mean change from baseline values on the log scale.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Measured by Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)</title>
        <description>The SF-36 v2 is a self-administered, health-related quality of life (QoL) metric. It is a 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health as well as 2 summary measures (Physical Health and Mental Health). Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. The SF-36 data were collected, but after the study was terminated, not all endpoints listed in the protocol were analyzed, including the SF-36. This decision was documented in the reporting and analysis plan prior to database lock.</description>

        <description>AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.</description>

        <description>For male participants testicular function (total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG-calculated free testosterone), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and inhibin B were assessed at Weeks 4 and 16/early withdrawal. The testicular function data were collected, but after the study was terminated, not all endpoints listed in the protocol were analyzed, including Testicular Function. This decision was documented in the reporting and analysis plan prior to database lock.</description>
