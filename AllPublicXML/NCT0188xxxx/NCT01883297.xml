  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical study for patients with platinum resistant (does not respond to
      platinum-based chemotherapy) high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
      cancer. Prior to the main treatment, patients will receive cyclophosphamide by vein. Patients
      will then receive an infusion (given by vein) of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
      (TILs) which will first be taken from the patient, then be stimulated with certain substances
      called autologous dendritic cells (DCs) and OKT3 (anti-CD3 antibody), and then given back to
      the patient as an infusion. This is believed to make the TILs work better. TILs are a type of
      white blood cells that recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to
      break down. After infusion of TILs, low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy will be given.

             cancer.

          2. Tumor is suitable for harvest (i.e., lesion to be harvested for TIL evaluation has a
             total volume of ≥1cm3) or patient has previously undergone tumor harvest under other
             REB approved studies involving clinical evaluation of TILs.

          3. If tumor harvest is required, subject must be a suitable surgical candidate in the
             opinion of the operating surgeon.

          4. Patient age: ≥ 18 years.

          5. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.

          6. Life expectancy &gt; 5 months from the date of consent for TIL evaluation.

          7. Ability to understand and has signed the Pre-Screening Consent Form.

          9. Confirmation that the Translational Immunotherapy Lab is able to process the specimen

         10. If there is a history of allergy to penicillin, gentamycin, streptomycin, or
             anti-fungals, the ability to generate TILs should first be confirmed with the cell
             manufacturing lab (i.e., Translational Immunotherapy Laboratory).

        Inclusion Criteria (Eligibility for Treatment):

          1. Prior to the performance of any study-specific procedure, the subject has signed and
             dated the informed consent form, approved by a Research Ethics Board (REB), after the

             days prior to the first dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. If in the opinion of the
             PI or his designee the lesion(s) no longer represents active disease, the subject will
             be considered eligible.

          5. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.

          6. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months from the date of consent for TIL treatment.

             infusion. All subjects' toxicities must have recovered to a CTCAE grade 1 or less;
             however, patients with residual CTCAE grade 2 neuropathy from previous
             carboplatin/taxol treatment will not be excluded. Subjects may have undergone minor
             surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered
             to CTCAE grade 1 or less or as specified in the inclusion criteria listed above.

          9. Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:

               1. Serum ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (for patients with liver
                  metastases, serum ALT ≤ 3 x ULN;

               2. Serum AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (for patients with liver
                  metastases, serum AST ≤ 3 x ULN;

               3. Total serum bilirubin ≤ 2xULN (patients with Gilbert's Syndrome - direct serum

               8. Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits OR serum creatinine clearance
                  ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional
                  normal;

               9. Serum lipase≤ 1.5 x ULN;

              10. Serum amylase ≤ 1.5 x ULN

         10. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. Acceptable birth
             control failure rate of less than or equal to 1% when used consistently and correctly
             such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, double barrier, some
             intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner. Subjects are
             considered to be not of child bearing potential if they are considered to be
             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized (e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy,
             bilateral salpingectomy. Women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are
             still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to
             prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible
             reason.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with ongoing or prior use systemic steroid therapy within 4 weeks before the
             TILs infusion will be excluded. Use of topical, intranasal and inhaled
             corticosteroids, or systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses are allowed. Oral
             steroid use as premedication to prevent allergic reactions to radiologic contrast is
             allowed.

          2. Subjects cannot be HIV positive.

          3. Subjects cannot have active hepatitis B or hepatitis C, syphilis, or Human T-Cell
             Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV).

          4. The number of prior lines of chemotherapy is not limited. However, if the subject has
             had ≥3 lines of prior chemotherapy for platinum refractory or platinum resistant
             disease, documentation of a response to one of these lines is required. Response can
             be defined by RECIST 1.1 or CA125 as defined by the modified GCIG criteria (See
             Section 11).

          5. The subject cannot have any active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other
             active major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system,
             uncontrolled psychiatric disorders, or other conditions that may affect compliance
             with the trial.

          6. The subject must have no active underlying cardiac illnesses defined by positive
             stress test, LVEF&lt;40% or ongoing life-threatening arrhythmias (i.e., for patients
             older than 60 years of age or otherwise clinically indicated).

          7. Subjects who have a prolonged history of cigarette smoking or symptoms of respiratory
             dysfunction will be excluded if they have an abnormal pulmonary function test as
             evidenced by a FEV1 &lt; 60% predicted.
