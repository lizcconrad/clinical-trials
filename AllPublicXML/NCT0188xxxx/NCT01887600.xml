    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Anemia is a
      reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is important for the transport of
      oxygen in your blood. The purpose of the study is to see if Roxadustat is both effective and
      safe as a treatment for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.
