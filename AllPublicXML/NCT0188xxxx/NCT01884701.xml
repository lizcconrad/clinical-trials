      The current study is a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, multi-center study to
      evaluate the outcome of the ENABLER-P Catheter System for crossing chronic total occlusions
      during endovascular intervention for femoral-popliteal occlusive disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documentation from a previous attempt OR a concurrent reasonable attempt (at least 5
             minutes) during this procedure, demonstrating resistance to conventional guidewire
             crossing;

          -  Patient must have objective evidence of lower extremity ischemia;

          -  Totally occlusive lesion in a native femoropopliteal artery classified
             angiographically as absolute (100% occlusion with no flow), where no antegrade filling
             beyond the occlusion is visible;

          -  Target occlusion length is &gt;1cm and ≤ 30 cm;

          -  Patient's reference vessel diameter is ≥ 4.0 mm and ≤6.0 mm (by visual angiographic
             estimation)

          -  Patient must be an acceptable candidate for PTA, peripheral artery bypass surgery or
             peripheral artery stent implantation;

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within
             48 hours prior to the study procedure;

          -  Patient must have been informed of the nature of the study, agree to its provisions,
             and provide written informed consent;

          -  Patient is ≥ 21 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, Plavix or
             radiographic contrast agents which cannot be adequately pre-medicated;

          -  The patient requires immediate treatment in more than one occluded vessel, in any
             combination of grafts or native vessels;

          -  Patient has planned femoropopliteal intervention scheduled within 30 days after index
             procedure;

          -  The patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device trial
             that may conflict with study data collection and has not completed the entire
             follow-up period;

          -  Patient has no collateral flow distal to the occlusion;

          -  Patient's target occlusion has a dissection that occurred within the past 30 days
             caused by a guidewire attempt;

          -  Patient has a history of bleeding diatheses, coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusion in cases of emergency;

          -  Patient suffered recent (within the past 6 months) significant gastrointestinal (GI)
             bleeding;

          -  Patient's target lesion or the vessel proximal to the target lesion reveals
             significant ectasia, dissection, aneurysm or thrombus;

          -  Patient has other medical illnesses (i.e., cancer or congestive heart failure) that
             may cause the patient to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data
             interpretation or is associated with life-expectancy less than 1 year.
