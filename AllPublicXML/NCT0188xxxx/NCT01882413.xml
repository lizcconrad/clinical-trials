    <measure>Percentage of Patients With a Presence of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 Days Prior to Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Suspected of Having Dry Eye With Elevated MMP-9</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days prior to cataract surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Suspected of having dry eye was defined as a response of &quot;Yes&quot; to the Investigator Dry Eye History question.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 Without Prior Diagnosis or Physician Recommended Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days prior to cataract surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Participants without a prior diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, dry eye or tear film insufficiency or physician recommended use of topical cyclosporine, artificial tears or punctal plugs are included in the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 With Dry Eye Symptoms Without Conjunctival or Corneal Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days prior to cataract surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Dry eye symptoms were measured by a score of at least ≥ 2 using the Subject Evaluation of Symptoms of Dryness (SESoD) questionnaire without conjunctival or corneal staining. The SESoD assesses dry eye using a 5-point scale where 0= no dryness to 4= severe dryness. Conjunctival and Corneal Staining were evaluated as part of the slit lamp biomicroscopy examination. Eye structures and surfaces were assessed for dry eye signs using a 5-point scale where: 0=none, 0.5=trace, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 With Dry Eye Symptoms Without Any Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days prior to cataract surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Dry eye symptoms were measured by a score of at least ≥ 2 using the SESoD questionnaire without any signs. The SESoD assesses dry eye using a 5-point scale where 0= no dryness to 4= severe dryness. Signs included conjunctival or corneal staining, Schirmer's score ≤ 7mm, or Tear Film Break-up Time [TFBUT] ≤ 10 seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 With at Least One Dry Eye Sign Without Dry Eye Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days prior to cataract surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Dry Eye Signs included conjunctival or corneal staining, Schirmer's score ≤ 7 mm, or Tear Film Break-up Time [TFBUT] ≤ 10 seconds without Dry eye symptoms measured by a score of at least ≤ 1 using the SESoD questionnaire. The SESoD assessed dry eye using a 5-point scale where 0= no dryness to 4= severe dryness.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 With at Least One Dry Eye Sign and Dry Eye Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days prior to cataract surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Dry Eye Signs included conjunctival or corneal staining, Schirmer's score ≤ 7mm, or Tear Film Break-up Time [TFBUT] ≤ 10 seconds with Dry eye symptoms measured by a score of at least ≥ 2 using the SESoD questionnaire. The SESoD assessed dry eye using a 5-point scale where 0= no dryness to 4= severe dryness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 Who Routinely Use Artificial Tears</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 Days Prior to Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Artificial Tear usage was assessed by the investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 With Punctal Plugs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 Days Prior to Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. A history of punctual plug usage was assessed by the investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 With Corneal Staining Grade ≥ 1 and ≥ 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 Days Prior to Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Corneal Staining was evaluated as part of the slit lamp biomicroscopy examination. Eye structures and surfaces were assessed for signs of dry eye using a 5-point scale where: 0=none, 0.5=trace, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 and an Ocular Surface Disease Index® (OSDI®) &gt; 12, &gt; 22 and ≥ 32</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 Days Prior to Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. The OSDI consists of 12 questions to assess visual function, ocular symptoms and environmental triggers related to dry eye. Each of the 12 questions is assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none of the time to 4=all of the time) which is converted to a total score between 0-100. OSDI total scores of 0-12=normal (best), 13-22= mild ocular surface disease, 23-32 =moderate ocular surface disease, and 33-100=severe ocular surface disease (worst).</description>

        <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. Dry eye symptoms were measured by a score of at least ≥ 2 using the Subject Evaluation of Symptoms of Dryness (SESoD) questionnaire without conjunctival or corneal staining. The SESoD assesses dry eye using a 5-point scale where 0= no dryness to 4= severe dryness. Conjunctival and Corneal Staining were evaluated as part of the slit lamp biomicroscopy examination. Eye structures and surfaces were assessed for dry eye signs using a 5-point scale where: 0=none, 0.5=trace, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Elevated MMP-9 and an Ocular Surface Disease Index® (OSDI®) &gt; 12, &gt; 22 and ≥ 32</title>
        <description>Tear film was collected and a diagnostic test was used to determine the presence of MMP-9 in the study eye. The OSDI consists of 12 questions to assess visual function, ocular symptoms and environmental triggers related to dry eye. Each of the 12 questions is assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none of the time to 4=all of the time) which is converted to a total score between 0-100. OSDI total scores of 0-12=normal (best), 13-22= mild ocular surface disease, 23-32 =moderate ocular surface disease, and 33-100=severe ocular surface disease (worst).</description>
