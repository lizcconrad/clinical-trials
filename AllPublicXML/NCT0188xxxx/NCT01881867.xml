    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7
      (CYT107) after vaccine therapy works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate
      cancer that has spread to other areas of the body or has not responded to at least one type
      of treatment. Biological therapies, such as glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7, may
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines
      made from white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective
      immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether glycosylated recombinant
      human interleukin-7 works better with or without vaccine therapy in treating prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      T-cell immune response to the sipuleucel-T fusion protein vaccine construct prostatic acid
      phosphatase granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PAP-GM-CSF) (PA2024).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      T-cell immune response to PAP.

      II. To assess the character of the T-cell immune response to PAP and PA2024. III. To
      determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      antibody immune responses to PAP and PA2024.

      IV. To quantify the effects of CYT107 on T-cell repertoire diversity. V. To assess the
      effects of CYT107 on the immune competence of patients with advanced prostate cancer.

      VI. To assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sipuleucel-T plus CYT107 compared
      with sipuleucel-T alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive no treatment (observation) after completion of standard
      sipuleucel-T therapy.

      COHORT II: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 subcutaneously (SC)
      every week for 4 weeks (on days 0, 7, 14, and 21) beginning 3-7 days after completion of
      standard sipuleucel-T therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 53 weeks. Patients are
      followed by phone, once a year, after completion of Week 53 for overall survival.
