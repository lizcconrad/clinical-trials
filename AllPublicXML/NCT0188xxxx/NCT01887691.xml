      The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of sleep effectiveness on glucose and
      insulin metabolism in health and disease (prediabetes and type two diabetes).

      We will monitor sleep effectiveness using the sleep spectrogram, obtain serial nocturnal
      blood glucose and insulin measurements, and assess the impact of pharmacologic enhancement
      [using eszopiclon (Lunesta), a medication that promotes stable sleep)] on glucose and insulin
      homeostasis.

      We hypothesize that 1: Effective sleep is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity,
      relative to ineffective sleep states, and 2: Enhancing sleep effectiveness using eszopiclone
      (Lunesta) improves 24-hour glucose metabolism in prediabetics and diabetics compared to
      baseline.

      Evidence from experimental studies supports the hypothesis that fragmented or insufficient
      sleep contributes to impaired glucose and insulin homeostasis. The sleep spectrogram, an
      EEG-independent measure of sleep effectiveness, maps coupled oscillations of heart rate
      variability and ECG-derived respiration. In a sample of non-diabetic subjects with and
      without sleep apnea, we previously explored the association between ECG-spectrogram derived
      biomarkers and glucose metabolism and found that the marker of effective sleep, High
      Frequency Coupling (HFC), is associated with reduced diabetes risk (increased Disposition
      Index). HFC is also enhanced by sedative medications (unpublished data). In this study we
      will 1.) explore the relationship between sleep effectiveness and insulin sensitivity across
      the sleep period, by frequently sampling glucose and insulin during nocturnal polysomnography
      in healthy and prediabetic subjects; and 2.) evaluate the impact of pharmacologic enhancement
      of effective sleep with nightly eszopiclone (1 week, home environment) on glycemic profiles
      (continuous glucose monitoring, 72 hrs) in prediabetics and diabetics compared to
      pretreatment baseline. We expect that desirable glycemic profiles will correlate with the
      spectrographic marker of effective sleep while undesirable glucose profiles will correlate
      with the marker of ineffective sleep. Using pharmacologic enhancement of effective sleep, we
      expect to demonstrate improvement in glycemic profiles in prediabetic and diabetic subjects
      compared to pre-treatment baseline.

    <description>We will evaluate the impact of pharmacologic enhancement of effective sleep with nightly eszopiclone (taken before bedtime for 1 week, home environment) on glycemic profiles (continuous glucose monitoring, 72 hrs) in prediabetics and diabetics compared to pretreatment baseline. The dose of eszopiclone will be the lowest tolerated dose (1-3 mg) via dose escalation and side effect profile assessment.</description>
