  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether exposure to hypertensive disorders of
      pregnancy and/or a preterm birth results in alterations in the cardiovascular system during
      infancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the incidence of cardiovascular disease has reduced dramatically, coinciding with
      favourable changes in risk factors, cardiovascular disease remains the single largest cause
      of mortality and premature mortality in the United Kingdom. Identification of novel
      biological pathways that underlie disease susceptibility raises the potential for new early
      primary prevention strategies to complement classical management. There is particular
      interest in the role of early environment in 'programming' risk of cardiovascular disease in
      later life and growing evidence that various early life exposures impact cardiovascular
      health in the longer term.

      The investigators have therefore designed the EPOCH study to investigate whether those
      individuals born to hypertensive pregnancies and/or to a preterm birth demonstrate
      differences in the cardiovascular phenotype at birth, or whether they develop any differences
      over the first three months of life and whether this varies with other perinatal factors.
      This study also allows investigation of the short term impact of perinatal interventions used
      in this cohort. Comprehensive multi-modality non-invasive imaging measures of cardiovascular
      structure and function allow precise quantification of cardiovascular phenotype in this
      population.

        Study population is drawn from infants admitted to or delivered in the OUH NHS Foundation
        trust to normotensive or hypertensive pregnancies across a range of gestations. The mothers
        of these infants form a secondary study cohort.
