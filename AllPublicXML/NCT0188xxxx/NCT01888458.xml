  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections due to post transplant immune deficiency are a major problem following allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT), particularly in patients receiving cord blood
      transplant (CB). Duration of neutropenia is one of the most important risk factor for
      invasive fungal infection (IFI). In this setting, Micafungin has been approved for antifungal
      prophylaxis for patients undergoing Allo-SCT. In a randomized, double-blind, comparative,
      phase III trial, the overall efficacy of micafungin was superior to that of fluconazole as
      antifungal prophylaxis during the neutropenic phase after Allo-SCT. However, very few
      patients in this study received a CB transplant.

      This is phase IIb, prospective, open-label, non-comparative study to assess the safety of
      micafungin when use in prevention of IFI in neutropenic patients receiving allo-SCT using CB
      as source of stem cells.

Prophylaxis will start within 48 hours of the beginning of the transplant-related conditioning regimen until 5 days after recovery from neutropenia (ANC ≥ 500/µl), or occurrence of an IFI, or up to 42 days, or withdrawal for any reason (e.g. patient's or investigator's decision, development of intolerance, death), whichever come first</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients receiving allo-Stem Cell Transplantation using Cord Blood as source of
             stem cells (cf conditioning regimen recommendation).

          -  Sex male or female

          -  Age between 18 and 65 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          -  Diagnosis of an hematologic disease for who a allograft decision has been taken

          -  not having a (HLA)-matched related or unrelated donor within two month after complete
             remission achievement

          -  Able to understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form.

          -  Subjects affiliated with an appropriate social security system

          -  Male, female without childbearing potential or negative urine pregnancy test at the
             screening visit prior to beginning the treatment. Women of childbearing potential must
             be following adequate contraceptive measures. Men must agree to use an acceptable
             method of contraception (for themselves or female partners) for the duration of the
             study

          -  Each subject will weigh 40 kg or more

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any suspected or documented invasive fungal infection at study entry or at any time
             prior to study entry

          -  Use of any systemic antifungal therapy within 72 hours prior to study entry

          -  Known history of allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to echinocandin agents

          -  Patient with any medical, psychological or social condition, which in the opinion of
             the investigator could increase the risk to the patient, or decrease the chance of
             obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of this study.

          -  Participation in a study testing a new drug or a new conditioning

          -  HIV, HBV or HCV positive

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females.

          -  Subject protected by law.
