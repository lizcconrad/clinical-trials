  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for women with high risk endometrial cancer is the removal of all
      visible lymph nodes in the pelvis and lower abdomen to identify if disease has spread to
      these areas. It is estimated that no more than 25% of all women with presumed early stage
      high risk endometrial cancer will have positive lymph nodes however currently the majority of
      women are subjected to extensive resection of all pelvic lymph and or para-aortic lymph nodes
      and its associated morbidities. The objective of this study is to determine if intraoperative
      sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping will improve the assessment of regional lymph nodes and
      enhance the detection of lymph nodes with metastatic disease in endometrial cancer. This
      would benefit the majority of women with early stage high risk endometrial cancer and would
      prevent the associated complications of pelvic lymph node dissection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the SLN can be accurately identified and the detection of metastatic lymph nodes in women
      with early stage high risk endometrial cancer can be improved then the majority of women
      could avoid a complete systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is
      associated with many intraoperative and postoperative complications such as hemorrhage,
      lymphocyst formation, nerve injury and chronic lower extremity lymphedema. If less invasive
      techniques to assess regional lymph node involvement, such as SLN mapping, replaced routine
      pelvic lymphadenectomy the complications associated with more extensive pelvic surgery could
      be avoided.

      This will be a prospective cohort study. The population to be studied will be patients with
      newly diagnosed early stage high risk endometrial cancer who will undergo primary surgical
      intervention that includes hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic and inframesenteric para-aortic
      lymphadenectomy via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic-assisted. Patients will be taken to
      the operating room for their planned procedure. After initiation of general anesthesia,
      fluorescent dye (indocyanine green, ICG) will be injected into the patient's cervix. The dye
      will be visualized by excitation with an infrared light (an attachment on the Novadaq
      Pinpoint system for laparoscopy). The surgery will proceed and all lymph nodes that are
      &quot;green&quot; will be removed surgically and their anatomic location and laterality documented.
      These &quot;green&quot; sentinel nodes will be assessed by a study pathologist by frozen section and
      the result read out intraoperatively. The hysterectomy and complete lymphadenectomy will then
      be performed. The SLN status will be compared to the status of the other nodes removed at
      complete lymphadenectomy. All data on these patients will be prospectively collected.

    <description>Performance analyses of SLN mapping will be performed. In particular, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of mapping and detection of sentinel lymph nodes with metastatic disease will be calculated using the pathology results of the surgical intervention as the Standard of Reference. Performance analyses will be evaluated at both the lesion and patient level. Generalized estimating equations will be used to adjust for correlations of repeated measures within patients. Raw performance estimates will be reported with adjusted 95% confidence intervals.</description>
