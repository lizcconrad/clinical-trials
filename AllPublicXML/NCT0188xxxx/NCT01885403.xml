  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of collecting respiratory parameters
      during recompensation following ADHF (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure)with non-invasive
      measurements. This could lead to a better understanding of how respiratory parameters may
      change during re-compensation therapy and could also be a comfortable method for patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a single-center, open, interventional, observational study according
      to clause §23b of the German Medical Device Act (MPG). The study will recruit 50 patients
      suffering from cardiogenic pulmonary congestion and edema including ambulant patients and
      patients of intensive care.

      We will investigate whether respiratory parameters during re-compensation are related to the
      therapy effects and changes in pulmonary congestion status. This study will collect data in
      an observational and clinical setting in the re-compensation phase of ADHF.

      Correlation between measured lung and respiratory parameters and standard clinical parameters
      characterizing stages of re-compensation will be undertaken. Standard clinical parameters may
      include diuretics and other cardiac medication dose frequency, weight, heart rate,
      respiratory rate, chest x-rays (when routinely performed), symptoms such as shortness of
      breath or fatigue, biomarkers such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), stroke volume, cardiac
      output, and oxygen requirements.

    <description>stationary as well as ambulant patients with acute decompensation receive clinical standard measurements and will be measured with the help of non- invasive technology such as respiratory profile and gaz analysis, bioimpedance spectroscopy. Patients will be measured at baseline and 2 times at ward if applicable and at 3 months follow up visit. Measurements will take 1:30 hours per visit.</description>
