  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of the ESPELMA project are twofold: 1) To increase acute spinal cord injury
      patients' satisfaction with treatment while hospitalization and 2) To increase mastery among
      rehabilitation professionals with regard to the clinical management of patients'
      psychological distress.

      For these purposes, a tailored training for professionals will be designed and offered.

      It is hypothesized that building capacity among professionals will serve to better management
      of patients' distress and a greater ability to commit them to the rehabilitation process.
      Thus, it is expected to lead to better and faster functional recovery and consequently to
      higher perceived satisfaction with treatment.

      Background: Acute spinal cord injury leaves patients severely impaired and consequently,
      generates high levels of psychological distress among them and their families. This
      psychological distress can cause patients and their families to take a less active role in
      rehabilitation, which leads to lower and slower levels of functional recovery and to less
      perceived satisfaction with the results. In addition, rehabilitation professionals that deal
      with this psychological distress could ultimately experience higher stress and more risk of
      burnout. The aim of ESPELMA project is to train rehabilitation professionals in the clinical
      management of acute spinal cord injury associated psychological distress, and to measure the
      impact of this training on the patients' perceived satisfaction with treatment. It is
      hypothesized that rehabilitation professionals trained in psychological distress management
      will foster greater psychological well-being during hospitalization among acute spinal cord
      injury patients and their families, and will secure greater commitment from them to
      participate in the rehabilitation process. Thus, it is expected to lead to better and faster
      functional recovery and consequently to higher perceived satisfaction with treatment.

      Methods/Design: The study follows a pre-post control group design. Participants are a sample
      of acute spinal cord injury patients consecutively admitted to a tertiary hospital spinal
      cord injury unit, their relatives, and the spinal cord injury unit staff. All participants
      completed a baseline survey before the intervention. Training of rehabilitation professionals
      comprises biweekly 6-hour sessions followed by 6-months of optional on-demand coaching.
      Contents of the training are customized according to focus groups. Once the training sessions
      end, all participants are assessed again.

      Discussion: To our knowledge, no studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of training
      professionals to manage psychological distress of acute spinal cord injury patients by means
      of motivational interviewing principles. If this training proves to be effective, several
      benefits could be achieved: e.g. higher job content and less burnout among professionals, as
      well as better patient compliance and satisfaction with treatment.

    <description>The initial assessment includes pre-intervention measures (baseline) for the patient, his/her relative (or main caregiver) and the rehabilitation staff.
Patients are assessed during the first week (or ≥ 10 days of SCI Unit admission) and at discharge (an expected average of 8 weeks). At the time of each patient's discharge, their family or main caregiver is also surveyed.
Lastly, rehabilitation team members are also assessed across the pre-intervention phase.</description>

    <description>Prior to the training, separate focus groups for professionals, patients &amp; families are conducted to determine each party's needs and worries.
Tailored training for professionals (customized according to focus groups contents) consists of 12 hours distributed in 2 days (1 day per week). It includes theoretical and practical exercises on early detection of PD, communication skills, management of psycho-emotional reactions, family interventions and teamwork alternatives. Standard motivational interviewing techniques for improving empathy skills and communication styles are employed.
Additionally, optional on-demand small group or individual coaching sessions (after training) will be offered (50-60 minutes per session) during a 6-months period.</description>
