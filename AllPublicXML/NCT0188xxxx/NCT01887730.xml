  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to elucidate the possibility to reduce occurrence of
      infectious diseases in a garrison with enhanced and guided hand hygiene. The investigators
      will study occurrence and transmission of infections. In addition, the investigators will
      find out the causative agents of infections in a garrison with virological analyses of
      naso-pharyngeal and fecal specimens. The costs of lost service days and other expenses due to
      infectious diseases will be evaluated with a cost analysis study.
