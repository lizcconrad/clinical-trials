      Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Monosialoganglioside(GM1) to prevent the neurotoxicity
      induced by cisplatin

    <textblock>
      NSCLC patients received a cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy are included in this trial.
      Patients are randomly assigned into the experimental group and control group based on
      segmented block randomized method. After enrollment, patients should complete four or six
      chemotherapy and GM1/placebo injection. During the 3w per cycle chemotherapy, cisplatin
      injection is conducted in D1/D1-3, GM1/placebo (80mg+250ml N.S) is injected from D0 to D3.
      Neurotoxicity evaluation and quality of life (FACT-NTX and EROTC scale) assessment will be
      conducted every cycle and 3w/11w/19w after the chemotherapy.
