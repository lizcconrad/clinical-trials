  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to make T-cell depleted stem cells from a family member who is
      a half match (haplo-identical) available on an expanded access basis to patients receiving
      one or two unrelated cord blood transplants who are at a higher risk of not engrafting in a
      safe amount of time. The purpose of the related stem cells is the give the bone marrow a
      &quot;jump start&quot; towards recovery. Ultimately, the cord blood cells will grow and permanently
      rescue the bone marrow.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary purpose of the study is to provide expanded access of T-cell depleted
      haplo-identical stem cells for patients receiving allogeneic transplantation from a related
      haplo-identical donor and an unrelated, umbilical cord blood (UUCB) unit(s) for the treatment
      of high risk malignancies and non-malignant disorders. The T-cell depleted haplo-identical
      stems cells are intended to facilitate early, short-term myeloid engraftment with the primary
      goal of minimizing early infections and other non-relapse mortality while the UUCB cells
      engraft as the durable and permanent graft. Patients with high risk or refractory
      malignancies, or non-malignant disorders amenable to stem cell transplantation therapy but
      lacking conventional related or unrelated donors will be eligible for this protocol.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a consenting related haplo-identical (3/6, 4/6, or 5/6 if DRB1 mismatch) stem
             cell donor.

          -  Have one or two available 4, 5, or 6/6 antigen matching unrelated UCB unit(s) that
             will deliver a total cell dose &gt;3.0 x 10e7 cells/kg. Patients who do not have a single
             UCB unit that will deliver the minimum required cell dose, two partially HLA-matched
             UCB units which together meet the minimum cell dose requirement, can be used for 1
             transplant. These units must be HLA-matched minimally at 4 of 6 HLA-A and B (at
             intermediate resolution by molecular typing) and DRB1 (at high resolution by molecular
             typing) loci with the patient, and HLA-matched at 3 of 6 HLA- A, B, DRB1 loci with
             each other (using same resolution of HLA typing as indicated above). There is no
             limitation on maximum cell dose.

          -  Have a high risk or refractory malignancy, or non-malignant disorder amenable to stem
             cell transplantation therapy.

          -  Meet eligibility requirements for allogeneic transplant per institutional standard
             practices.

          -  Have given written informed consent according to FDA guidelines (or consent of
             parent/legal guardian as applicable).

          -  Be &lt;65 years of age at the time of study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a consenting 8/8 or 10/10 allele matched, consenting, related or unrelated
             hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) donor.

          -  Have a life expectancy of less than 3 months.

          -  Have uncontrolled infections at time of cytoreduction.
