    <textblock>
      Clinical trial phase I, randomized, double blind, where 30 individuals will receive the
      experimental vaccine while 30 other volunteers will receive a meningococcal C conjugate
      vaccine already licensed in Brazil and available in the National Immunization Program for
      children less than 12 months of age. The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate the
      safety profile of the vaccine under test, which should allow its application in humans.
      Secondly, the investigators will study its immunogenicity from the evaluation of the
      correlates of seroprotection for meningococcal, defined by the World Health Organization
      (WHO).

      Study design - This is a clinical study Phase I, randomized, double blind with 60
      individuals. 30 individuals will receive the experimental vaccine by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz
      and 30 individuals will receive a meningococcal C conjugated vaccine used in the National
      Immunization Program.

      Location of Study - Clinical Trials Unit for Immunobiology by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz.

      Primary objective - Evaluate the safety of the meningococcal C vaccine by
      Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz for use in humans.

      Secondary objective - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the meningococcal C vaccine by
      Bio-Manguinhos in young adults.

      specific objectives

        1. To evaluate the frequency / intensity of adverse events occurring up to 30 days after
           vaccination.

        2. To evaluate the seroconversion defined as pre-immunization serum nonreactive (negative)
           and post-immunization reactor (positive) antigens, with getting titles 8 (rabbit
           complement) to the target strain used in the test of bactericidal power of the sera from
           immunized volunteers, a 4-fold increase in titers following vaccination compared to
           pre-vaccination and antibody titers after immunization.
