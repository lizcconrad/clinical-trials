    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of metformin. Safety and tolerability of isavuconazole will
      be assessed alone and in combination with metformin.

      Subjects will check-in to the clinic on Day -1 and remain confined through completion of the
      study procedures on Day 10.

      A follow-up telephone call will be made on Day 16 to check on health status.
