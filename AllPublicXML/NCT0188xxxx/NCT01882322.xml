      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety between a group that has
      been on Prograf twice daily therapy but converted to Advagraf once daily therapy and a group
      that maintained Prograf twice daily therapy.

      De novo Liver Transplant Recipients will be divided into two groups. Both groups will receive
      Prograf (Tacrolimus twice daily therapy), and at Month 1 (Week 4) after surgery, Prograf will
      be converted to Advagraf (modified release Tacrolimus, once daily) in one group, while
      Prograf therapy will be continued in other group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject scheduled for liver transplantation from a living donor or brain dead

          -  In case of a woman of childbearing potential, a subject with a negative pregnancy test
             prior to enrollment and who consents to and would practice double contraception
             throughout the study (Pessary therapy, or rhythm method, or sexual abstinence,
             surgical sterilization, menopause or otherwise sterile; however, oral contraceptives
             are excluded.)

          -  A subject with terminal hepatic failure for which liver transplant is necessary

          -  A subject who understands and is completely aware of the study objective and risks and
             who submitted a written informed consent form on study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject who received multiple organ transplants or any previous organ transplant
             (including re-transplantation of the liver)

          -  A subject who had received auxiliary transplant or used the bioartificial liver
             (cellular system)

          -  A subject allergic or resistant to macrolide antibiotics or Tacrolimus

          -  A subject who was taking Cyclosporine and Bosentan (Tracleer) that may interact with
             Tacrolimus, or potassium-sparing diuretics known to possibly cause hyperkalemia
             (Spironolactone, Triamterene) at screening

          -  A subject who requires immunosuppressive treatment or systemic chemotherapy from
             before transplant. However, a subject who received immunosuppressive treatment for
             less than 1 month prior to transplant to treat underlying hepatic disorder may be
             enrolled in the study if treatment is discontinued at the time of transplant.

          -  A subject with malignancy or malignant tumor history within the past 5 years; however,
             a subject may be enrolled in this study in case of successfully cured for basal cell
             carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  A subject who suffers severe diarrhea, vomiting, active peptic ulcer or
             gastrointestinal disorder that may affect Tacrolimus absorption (may be determined at
             the discretion of the investigator)

          -  A subject with any type of substance abuse, psychological disorder, or communication
             disorder at the discretion of the investigator

          -  A subject (transplant recipient) and/or donor who are positive to HIV

          -  A subject who cannot comply with the protocol-planned routine visit schedule

          -  A subject who is not appropriate for study participation at the discretion of the
             investigator
