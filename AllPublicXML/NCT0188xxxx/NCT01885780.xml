      This clinical phase IV study is an open, prospective phase IV study and acts to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the femtolaser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective phase IV study acts to address the predictability and
      effectiveness of astigmatic keratotomy in eyes after femtolaser-assisted cataract surgery.
      Within this prospective data collection the laser-assisted Arcuate Incisions are performed by
      the VICTUS™ Femtosecond Laser Platform.

      This study will be conducted at Gemini eye clinic in Zlin, Czech Republic by Dr. Pavel
      Stodulka who will treat up to 50 eyes. Patients will be recruited according to the study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.
