  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The debate about tight glycemic control (TGC) in the operating room and on the intensive care
      unit is ongoing, especially in cardio-surgical patients treated with blood cardioplegia, due
      to high blood glucose levels during operations and subsequent high rates of sternal wound
      infections. We showed in a feasibility study that early computer based insulin therapy
      starting in the operating room is a safe therapy that allows to better warrant normoglycemia
      in patients undergoing major cardiac surgery with the use of blood cardioplegia.

      Patients are enrolled and randomized into 3 groups. Start of therapy is determined as the
      beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass. Group A: Therapy with computer-based algorithm and
      measurement of blood glucose every 30 min. Group B: Measurement of blood glucose every 15 min
      using the identical computer-based algorithm. Group C: Conventional therapy using a fixed
      insulin dosing scheme. End of therapy is defined as discharge from ICU.

    <description>With start of the cardiopulmonary bypass, computerized algorithmic application of insulin was performed with a dedicated computerized syringe pump system (Space GlucoseControl System, B. Braun, Germany). The targeted corridor for blood glucose was determined with 80 - 150 mg/dl. During surgery, blood glucose was measured every 30 min, and on the ICU every 2 hours. TGC management was continued until ICU discharge.</description>

    <description>Corresponding computerized algorithmic application of insulin management was used as for group A. However, only the interval of blood glucose measurement during surgery was adjusted to 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>With start of the cardiopulmonary bypass conventional therapy with a fixed insulin dosing scheme was initiated. If blood glucose was &gt; 150 mg/dl, manual insulin therapy was started following a fixed insulin dosing scheme. Measurements of blood glucose were performed during surgery every 30 minutes, and on the ICU every 2 hours until discharge (Routine Care).</description>
