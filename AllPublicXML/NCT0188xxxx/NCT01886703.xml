  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess whether a supported pedometer-based walking program is helpful
      in maintaining physical activity for breast and head-and-neck cancer patients who are
      undergoing radiation therapy. Follow-up monitoring sessions will be scheduled to help provide
      support for physical activity during radiation therapy. We will also examine the relationship
      of physical activity and quality of life outcomes to help inform future research.

      Will the integration of a patient-centered exercise prescription and supportive counseling
      attenuate declines in physical activity during radiation therapy? To address this question,
      this study will assess the feasibility of a patient-centered walking program for breast and
      head-and-neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. Follow-up monitoring sessions
      will be scheduled to help provide support and ongoing counseling to facilitate increased
      activity (through walking) during radiation therapy. We will also examine the effect of the
      walking program on other outcomes such as happiness, depression and sleep to determine point
      estimates and measures of variability to inform future research.

    <description>All subjects will be prescribed a low-intensity walking program based on their current activity level and an daily assigned step count goal (with the current physical activity recommendations of 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity per day or 150 minutes per week as the ideal goal). Participants will be provided with face-to-face counseling and written material describing their specific individualized walking program. Participants will also be instructed to maintain their normal activities as much as possible during the intervention period. Participants will be given a pedometer and instructed to wear it at least 5 days per week for the duration of the study.</description>
