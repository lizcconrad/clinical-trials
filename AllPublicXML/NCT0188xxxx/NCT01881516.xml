    <textblock>
      we plan to conduct this trial to find out：

        -  If acpuncture treatment could relieve CRF among lung cancer patients receiving chemo- or
           radio-therapy？

        -  How about the extent it relieves？the safety and applicability ？

        -  What's the possible influential factor and mechanism ？
