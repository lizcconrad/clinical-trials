    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) in combination with ionizing
      irradiation for the treatment of stage IV melanoma, a disease that is essentially incurable
      with median overall survival periods that range from 8-16 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) (Resimmune™), an anti-T cell immunotoxin is currently being studied as
      a treatment for cutaneous T cell lymphoma and other CD3+ malignant diseases (FDA IND Number:
      100712, Scott and White Protocol 071163). During the course of this study, data accumulated
      that Resimmune could be acting as an immunomodulator. This was based on the observation that
      four out of six partial responses converted to complete responses at times ranging between 6
      and 24 months following the completion of the 4-day treatment protocol and no other treatment
      took place.

      The purpose of this trial is to test the hypothesis that Resimmune can act as an
      immunomodulator of late stage metastatic melanoma when combined with palliative radiation to
      induce the priming of activated T cells with tumor antigens. The primary objective of this
      study is to determine the safety of combining Resimmune with palliative radiation therapy in
      patients with stage IV melanoma. A secondary objective is to document the tumor response and
      duration of response at irradiated and unirradiated sites (the abscopal effect). An
      additional secondary objective is to determine if T cell activation occurs following
      administration of A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) and local radiation to a metastatic lesion of
      melanoma.

    <description>Response will be assessed at 2 months, and at least every 3 months (±7 days) thereafter using for up to 1 year after the last treatment administration or until evidence of disease progression. Tumor measurements and therapeutic response will be determined using irRC (Immune Related Response Criteria). At a minimum, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed at study entry, at 2 months, and, if a response or stable disease, at least every 3 months (±7 days) for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug, and/or at any time there is clinical evidence of disease progression, to evaluate disease status.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have histologically proven stage IV metastatic melanoma consisting
             of at least two lesions
