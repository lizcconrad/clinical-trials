  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BioSensics has developed a Physical Activity Monitoring System (PAMSys) that consists of a
      single wearable motion sensor that is worn on the torso. The objectives of this observational
      study are the following: 1) to test the efficacy of PAMSys for objectively assessing a
      persons risk of falling based on activity data measured during activities of daily living and
      2) to test the efficacy of PAMSys for identifying precise early physical activity or
      functioning indicators of frailty in those who are pre-frail or frail as compared to
      non-frail controls.

    <description>Eligible subjects will receive a PAMSys motion sensors and necessary instructions for proper use. They will then wear the motion sensor continuously for 48 hours. PAMSys will record the duration of each sit-to-stand transition during this 48 hour monitoring period. The primary outcome measure is the average of these durations.</description>
