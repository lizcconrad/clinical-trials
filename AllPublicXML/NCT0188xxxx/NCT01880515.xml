  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Advanced NSCLC has a poor prognosis and the positive impact of chemotherapy is limited
           by the development of intrinsic and acquired resistance.

        2. Over the past decade, less toxic agents such as the innovative targeted therapies, i.e.
           erlotinib or gefitinib, have the potential to improve the effectiveness and keep a good
           quality of life with a low toxicity

        3. BIBW2992 (afatinib), an aniline-quinazoline, is an epidermal growth factor receptor
           (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) irreversible inhibitor, and
           it has activity against erlotinib-resistant isoforms having mutations in EGFR and HER-2.

        4. This molecule has shown benefits as a single agent in pre-treated patients who have
           progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy, with a minimal toxicity compared to
           chemotherapy.

        5. BIBW2992 is associated with adverse effects similar to those for erlotinib and
           gefitinib, such as rash and diarrhea. These symptoms can reduce the quality of life (QL)
           in patients and lead to inconsistent EGFR inhibitor dose administration

        6. There is not a standard treatment for rash. However, case reports have tried to
           demonstrate the benefit in the treatment of these cutaneous injuries obtained with
           alcohol-free emollients, sunscreen with titanium dioxide or antibiotic (topic or oral)
           treatment regimens that include clindamycin or doxycycline, as well as anti-inflammatory
           drugs such as steroids and isotretinoin.

        7. In order to reduce the incidence and severity of cutaneous toxicities, we will compare
           the prophylactic antibiotic treatment using tetracycline and general dermatological
           recommendations versus using only dermatological recommendations, in patients initiating
           the treatment with BIBW2992.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Case reports have tried to demonstrate the benefit in the treatment of rash obtained with:
      alcohol-free emollients used 2-3 times daily, sunscreen with titanium dioxide or zinc oxide
      with a skin protection factor (SPF) greater than 15, topic or oral antibiotic regimens (such
      as clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracyclines) when there is secondary infection as well as
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (betamethasone, triamcinolone) and isotretinoin.

      The objective of this project is to evaluate whether the prophylactic treatment with
      tetracycline can reduce dermatological toxicities such as rash, induced by the EGFR and HER-2
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBW 2992 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
