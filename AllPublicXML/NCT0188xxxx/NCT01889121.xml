  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opiate drug abuse/addiction is a significant co-morbidity in pregnancy. Opiate maintenance
      program enhances the outcome of pregnancies for the mother and the infant. Our objective was
      to assess if provision of structured psychosocial support in addition to methadone
      maintenance program adds incremental benefits with regards to the outcome of pregnancy.

    <description>Infants delivered to mothers that are maintained on methadone are at risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome. Psychosocial support is provided to pregnant women in methadone maintenance program to impact the outcome of the infants. The percentage of infants requiring pharmacotherapy would be expected to be reduced by the addition of psychosocial intervention to methadone maintenance program.</description>
