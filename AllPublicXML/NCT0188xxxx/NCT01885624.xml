      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and tolerability of ascending dosed of TAB08
      after single i.v. infusion to the adult healthy volunteers. Additionally were assessed
      infusion speed tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TAB08 after single i.v.
      infusion and to explore TAB mechanism-of-action biomarkers.
