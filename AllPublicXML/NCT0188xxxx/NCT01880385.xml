      Multi-center, non randomised, open label, non controlled pilot study. Evaluating the

      Pilot study evaluating the safety and efficacy of adding Bevacizumab to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients presenting non metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Patients
      will receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy FEC100 associating Fluorouracil (500 mg/m2), Epirubicin
      (100 mg/m2), Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every at day 1 of ecah 21
      days cycle for 4 cycles. Six weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients will
      undergo mastectomy and 4 cycles of Docetaxel (100 mg/m2)as adjuvant chemotherapy
      +/-Trastuzumab 8 mg/kg for the first cycle then 6mg/kg every 3 weeks for 17 cycles if tumor
      overexpress Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy, i.e.
      pathologic complete response (pCR) after 4 cycles of FEC100+Bevacizumab in IBC
