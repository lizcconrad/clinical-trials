      This study is designed as a crossover randomized controlled trial, to investigate the effects
      of client's ethnic characteristics on the quality of family planning services.

      The study aims at evaluating, in a causal way, whether health providers in Peru might be
      contributing to ethnic health disparities in the provision of family planning services. We
      perform a field experiment that combines audit studies and simulated patient methodologies.
      The study population consists of clinics in Metropolitan Lima that are administered by the
      Ministry of Health and which provide family planning counseling services. The sample in our
      study includes 351 clinics. The primary outcome measured in the study was a composite of
      service provider compliance to guideline technical tasks in family planning counseling. We
      pre-defined indigenous and mestizo profiles using distinctive cultural attributes such as
      clothing, styling of hair, posture and patterns of speech. With a 1:1 allocation as per a
      computer generated randomization schedule, and using permuted blocks of four, clinics were
      assigned to a sequence of ethnic profiles, either to receive the indigenous then the mestizo
      profile (sequence 1) or mestizo and then the indigenous profile (sequence 2) in two periods.
      The trial comprises two treatment periods each of five week's duration. The second treatment
      period followed the same sequence of visits than the first one to obtain at least a five-week
      'wash-out' period to mask the study.

    <description>Clinics receive simulated patients (SPs) enacting the indigenous profile, and interpreting a standardized script with a biographical and clinical background. The indigenous SP wears a lliclla (a traditional woven cloth that covers the back and shoulders), long braids, a woven cardigan and loose pants; she uses no make-up and, her patterns of speech are slower and her posture and movement more rigid than the mestizo SP. The script indicates that SPs do not want to have any more children and that her choice of method is the pill.</description>

The mestizo SP does not wear a lliclla (a traditional woven cloth that covers the back and shoulders) or long braids, but a pony tail or loose hair; she wears make-up and, a vest made of polar fleece, tight pants and culturally salient accessories; her patterns of speech are faster and her posture and movement less rigid than the indigenous SP.
