  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose oxidase is a hydrogen peroxide producing enzyme, which also is present in honey.
      Human rhinoviruses are sensitive to the action of hydrogen peroxide, which is documented in
      laboratory studies.

      In the present study we aim to investigate if a nasal spray with glucose oxidase could treat
      a common cold, when the treatment is started even after the onset of the symptoms. The study
      is randomized and placebo controlled.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons that are convinced of that they have caught an episode of common cold can be included
      into the study within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.

      Before they start the treatment with the nasal spray they perform a viral sample from the
      nose and also fill in the WURSS-21 protocol. After this the persons spray with glucose
      oxidase+glucose/only saline+glucose 5 times the first day and thereafter 3 times daily for a
      total treatment of one week. Every day the included persons fill in the WURSS-21 protocol.

    <description>Symptoms of a common cold, recorded in a home protocol, &quot;Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Score 21 (WURSS21)&quot; daily for 7 days was used as the evaluation method of the treatment. WURSS-21 is a validated protocol for assessing symptoms of a common cold. We used this protocol at start, before the persons in the study started their treatment and thereafter every day for the next 7 days. WURSS 21 consists of 21 questions (last question is not valid) regarding different symptoms as: running nose, sore throat, cough, blocked nose, etc. Every such question is graded from 0-7, 0 is defined as no such symptom and the number 7 means the worst possible symptom. The outcome measure is predominantly calculated as &quot;the sum of all symptoms&quot; in the WURSS-21 protocol, which means that the value from each of the 20 questions (min=0, max=140) is summarized every day for each of the participants, which gives a mean value for both groups every day.</description>

          <title>Sum of All Symptoms in Viruspositive Persons</title>
          <description>Symptoms of a common cold, recorded in a home protocol, &quot;Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Score 21 (WURSS21)&quot; daily for 7 days was used as the evaluation method of the treatment. WURSS-21 is a validated protocol for assessing symptoms of a common cold. We used this protocol at start, before the persons in the study started their treatment and thereafter every day for the next 7 days. WURSS 21 consists of 21 questions (last question is not valid) regarding different symptoms as: running nose, sore throat, cough, blocked nose, etc. Every such question is graded from 0-7, 0 is defined as no such symptom and the number 7 means the worst possible symptom. The outcome measure is predominantly calculated as &quot;the sum of all symptoms&quot; in the WURSS-21 protocol, which means that the value from each of the 20 questions (min=0, max=140) is summarized every day for each of the participants, which gives a mean value for both groups every day.</description>
          <population>The persons analyzed were those that had a positive viral sampling with Parainfluenza, Corona or Rhinoviruses, that is: the viruses that most often causes common cold and also would be accessible for treatment with a nasal spray.</population>
