  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well clofarabine and melphalan before a donor stem cell
      transplant works in treating patients with a decrease in or disappearance of signs and
      symptoms of myelodysplasia or acute leukemia (disease is in remission), or chronic
      myelomonocytic leukemia. Giving chemotherapy, such as clofarabine and melphalan, before a
      donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells
      from a donor are infused into a patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem
      cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Giving clofarabine and melphalan
      before transplant may help prevent the cancer from coming back after transplant, and they may
      cause fewer side effects than standard treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Following a patient safety lead-in, determine the anti-tumor activity of clofarabine given
      in combination with high-dose melphalan as assessed by 2-year progression-free survival
      (PFS).

      II. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse/progression and
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

      III. Summarize toxicities/complications by organ and severity, including acute and chronic
      graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), and infection.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -9
      to -5 and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -4.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day -3, patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) and
      sirolimus PO once daily with taper per City of Hope standard operating procedure.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up once weekly for 60 days, at
      100, and 180 days, at one year, and then yearly for up to 5 years.
