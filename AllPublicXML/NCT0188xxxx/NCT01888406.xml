  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BEST4US compares the effectiveness of two forms of self-help interventions that target
      college students, ages 18 years to 22 years, who report binge eating. The overall question is
      whether one or the other format will prevent excess weight gain and lead to differences in
      eating behaviors. The two formats are (1) &quot;pure self-help&quot; (receipt of a self-help program
      via book form or online texts) and (2) a combination of the self-help program and guidance
      provided by a trained peer coach over the course of 8 weekly sessions.

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (8-week), and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is change in BMI from randomization. Height and weight will be measured by study staff at the baseline visit using a stadiometer (collecting height measures twice and reporting the average) and a calibrated scale (light clothing, street shoes removed). BMI will be calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in squared centimeters. Weight will be re-measured at 8 week- and 6 month assessments. BMI change is a primary-, and incidence of obesity (i.e., obesity onset since baseline, BMI &gt; 30) is a secondary outcome variable. While we assess weight at the post-treatment assessment, the key question of our study is whether the intervention will reduce excess weight gain at 6-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cessation of Binge Eating</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (8-week), and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Binge eating is assessed by clinical interview using an abbreviated version of the Eating Disorders Examination (EDE-16e) at baseline, post-treatment (8-week), and 6-month follow-up. Specifically, the EDE sections on 7-day meal patterns, overeating episodes, and the frequency of inappropriate compensatory behaviors will be administered. The key question of our study is whether the intervention will eliminate binge eating at 6-month follow-up (no reported binge eating episodes in the 28 days prior to the 6-month follow-up).</description>
