    <textblock>
      Collect clinical images requested by FDA with GE Breast Tomosynthesis to show they are of
      acceptable quality as defined in the relevant FDA guidance document before and after artifact
      correction and in standard screening images. Lossy compression will also be evaluated to
      demonstrate that images are of acceptable quality when lossy compression is enabled.

    <description>Collect 12 clinical DBT cases with MLO and CC views taken from the Senographe Essential to assess whether the DBT in Senographe Essential is of acceptable quality according to FDA criteria following the clinical evaluation instructions described in Section 9 of the guidance document &quot;Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Full-Field Digital Mammography System&quot;. Assessment will include review of images with and without artifact correction and with and without lossy compression and findings will be included in PMA submission.</description>
