  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether a cranberry concentrate reduces recurrent urinary tract
      infections (UTIs) in women who consume it. About 150 adult women will participate in this
      study. Subjects will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to take either cranberry capsule or
      a placebo for 12 months. We expect cranberry supplement to have better results than the
      placebo. Subjects will not know which supplement they are taking. The primary outcome is the
      number of UTIs over 12 months.

      Participants will attend their first study visit at a clinic at UBC. They will be randomized
      to the cranberry capsule or placebo. Participants will be instructed to consume the assigned
      supplement for the next 12 months. A calendar will be provided to record compliance and
      recurrent UTI. Participants will also record any side effects. They will be phoned each month
      to encourage participation and adherence. At 8 weeks and 6 months, they will be asked to
      return to the clinic to complete a midline questionnaire which will ask about any recurrent
      UTIs experienced. More supplements will be provided at their 6-month visit. At 12 months,
      participants will return to the clinic to complete an endline questionnaire. They will return
      any leftover supplements, calendar and side effect diary. If participants withdraw from the
      study, they will still be encouraged to return at 12 months to complete the survey to allow
      for intent-to-treat analysis.
