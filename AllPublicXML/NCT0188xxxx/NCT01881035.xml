  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the efficacy of renal nerve denervation in treating
      drug-resistant hypertension in patients with end stage renal disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug resistant hypertension is very common in end stage renal disease treated by dialysis.
      The prevalence of hypertension has been evaluated to be over 50% and up 80%. In this patient
      group mortality figures are high because of cardiovascular diseases which are complications
      of hypertension. Renal nerve denervation is a new intervention to treat hypertension. By
      applying radiofrequency pulses to the renal arteries, the nerves in the vascular wall
      (adventitia layer) can be denervated. This causes reduction of renal sympathetic afferent and
      efferent activity and blood pressure can be decreased. The technique and its efficacy in end
      stage renal disease has not been systematically studied. There are case reports which have
      showed promising responses to denervation. In the present study 30 patients over 18 years are
      planned undergo renal denervation if the medical treatment (three different drugs including
      diuretics) has failed to decrease blood pressure sufficiently(160/100mmHg). The failure of
      medical treatment will be documented by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. After renal
      nerve denervation a two year follow-up of patients with ambulatory blood pressure
      measurements will be organized. The blood pressures before and after denervation are compared
      and the quality of life of the patients is evaluated by questionnaires.
