  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sildenafil is a selective pulmonary vasodilator; in patients with a special kind of pulmonary
      hypertension it is approved for treatment. The trial seeks to find out, whether the acute
      response to this treatment (= vasoreactivity testing) given intravenously is effective and
      allows prediction of therapy success during a following oral treatment.

    <measure>efficacy of Sildenafil I.V. for vasoreactivity testing</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Right heart catheterisation with comprehensive hemodynamic measurements (pressures in RA, RV, PA, PCW position; cardiac index (CI) by thermodilution; oxygen saturation in the PA; the same under exercise conditions) is performed. In case of precapillary pulmonary hypertension, Sildenafil is given I.V. and acute tolerability, safety and efficacy on hemodynamic parameters are registrated. Successful vasoreactivity testing is defined by lowering the mean PA pressure by 10 mmHg or more, lowering it below 40 mmHg and maintaining / rising of the CI. Safety is mainly defined by lack of a substantial effect of the study drug on systemic blood pressure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>clinical efficacy of sildenafil per os predicted by testing it intravenously in the course of oral therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Complete hemodynamic and functional assessment after 90 days of oral Sildenafil therapy (same protocol as before except vasoreactivity testing). Hemodynamic parameters which characterize successful oral therapy are mainly mean PA-pressure (decrease), pulmonary vascular resistance (decrease) and cardiac index (increase) - at rest and exercise.
Functional improvement is further characterized by exercise capacity (cardiopulmonary exercise testing: improvement of V´O2 peak by ≥ 1 ml/min/kg), fall of NTproBNP, improvement of echocardiographic parameters of right ventricular function (TAPSE, S´, RV-FAC).
Evaluation, if positive initial vasoreactivity testing results in successful oral therapy as defined above.</description>
