  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent UTIs are common among patients on IC. These create significant patient morbidity
      and healthcare burden. In desperation, many physicians prescribe prophylactic oral or
      intravesical antibiotics. This practice is common among our Gillette clinic patients.
      However, the benefit is unclear and the risks are not insignificant. As such, practice
      variation is significant. In order to better define the evidence for or against gentamicin
      bladder irrigation and thus inform clinical practice both locally at our Gillette urology
      clinic and for practitioners at large we will pursue the following specific aims:

        1. Compare rates of symptomatic urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria among
           a population of Gillette patients on IC with and without gentamicin bladder
           instillation.

        2. Compare antibiotic resistance rates among a population of Gillette patients on IC with
           and without gentamicin bladder instillation.

      In the Gillette Lifetime Urology clinic, gentamicin bladder instillation (GBI) for UTI
      prophylaxis is common practice among our neurogenic bladder patients in IC. However, as
      previously shown, the evidence supporting this practice is mixed. Potential risks of this
      practice include wasted costs, wasted materials, wasted time and growing antibiotic
      resistance. Potential benefits include reduced use of systemic antibiotics, a reduction in
      symptomatic UTIs and fewer hospitalizations for febrile UTIs. We seek to define the evidence
      for or against this practice by completing a double-blind randomized controlled trial of GBI
      vs. NS instillation. Such a trial would benefit our Gillette patients and the community of
      patients on IC worldwide.
