  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well the antibody levels found months to years after
      patients entered a previous randomised placebo-controlled trial of a glycoprotein B vaccine
      against cytomegalovirus have persisted and to have the previous samples retested using
      different methods which have been further developed in different laboratories.

      Also, to prepare monoclonal antibodies from the B lymphocytes of these patients and define
      their strength. If potent antibodies are identified, the investigators would like to consider
      developing them further to see if they can protect future transplant patients against
      cytomegalovirus.

      This is a follow up study to a randomised controlled trial comparing a CMV glycoprotein B
      vaccine with placebo (Trial title: A Phase II Immunogenicity Trial Of Cytomegalovirus
      Glycoprotein B Vaccine In Allograft Candidate Recipients; CTA ref no 20363/0238/001-0010; REC
      ref no 5476; UCL sponsor no 05/009) in participants with Chronic renal or liver deficiency
      sufficient to require transplantation. The study provided encouraging results (data now
      unblinded and analysed) by reducing the amount of cytomegalovirus that vaccinated patients
      excreted in blood post transplant (Griffiths et al Lancet 2011). The titre of antibody made
      against glycoprotein B was a correlate of protection against duration of viraemia (i.e.
      reduction in CMV levels). 100% of patients given vaccine produced antibody against
      glycoprotein B although the titres decreased with time. The titres of CMV neutralising
      antibody were boosted in those with prior natural immunity. The titres of neutralising
      antibody were low among those who were initially seronegative. However, improved assays for
      CMV neutralising antibodies have now become available, so we wish to have the samples
      retested using these different methods. We will also send the blood samples taken in the
      previous study to the same labs for enzyme immunoassay for antibodies against glycoprotein B.
      This trial will approach patients that took part in the above referenced study for one
      further blood sample to determine their current antibody titres and to obtain their consent
      to test the samples taken in that previous study using these new improved antibody assays.
      Monoclonal antibodies will be made from purified B lymphocytes to study how these may bind
      and neutralise cytomegalovirus in the laboratory in order to develop antibodies as potential
      therapeutic agents.
