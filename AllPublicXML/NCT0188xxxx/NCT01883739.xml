  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators shall conduct a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of
      parental presence at transfer rounds on parental anxiety and patient safety following
      transfer from the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (PCICU) to the ward. The
      investigators plan to test the hypothesis that parental involvement in the child's transfer,
      with the option of peer support, will result in measurable reductions in medication errors,
      unplanned nutritional and feeding management, and parental anxiety after transfer as compared
      to the control group. The investigators goal is to improve continuity of care by implementing
      multidisciplinary transfer rounds at the child's bedside in which patients and family share
      in the control of the management plan when a cardiac child is discharged from PCICU to the
      ward.

    <description>Medication and nutritional order reconciliation will occur 48 hours after transfer from the PCICU. The pharmacist, dietician and physician who review the patient charts and order sheets will be blinded to the randomization. Differences between pre and post transfer orders will be discussed to detect omissions and/or deviation from standard of care.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive an educational document prior to transfer rounds introducing the concept of Patient and Family Centered Care and the role of a parent in transfer rounds. These parents will have the option of meeting with a parental peer support person for a &quot;coaching&quot; or training session prior to their participation in transfer rounds. During the transfer rounds parents will be actively included in discussion of their child's medical management plan upon discharge to the wards.</description>
