      The objective of this pilot study is to investigate Cone Beam Computed Tomography Imaging
      (CBCT), with the primary goal, the accumulation of a body of evidence to provide preliminary
      data for a future extensive clinical trials.

    <description>This study was to evaluate the radiation dose, breast coverage, and image quality of cone-beam breast CT compared with a conventional mammographic examination.</description>

    <description>In Group I, up to 100 women, at least 40 years of age, who have had a routine standard mammogram read as BI-RADS® 0, 1, 2, or 3 will also undergo 3D breast imaging using a cone beam CT scanner specifically designed to image the breast. Of these 100, we hope to enroll at least 30 subjects with mammograms read as BI-RADS® 0 and at least 30 read as BI-RADS® 3. The BI-RADS® 0 category refers to patients for whom additional imaging is required after a screening mammogram provided incomplete diagnostic information.</description>

    <description>The goals of Group II will be to compare the CBCT study with standard imaging for the diagnosis of breast disease in palpable or non-palpable breast lesions (having a BI-RADS® score of 4 or 5). Forty (40) women, who have had abnormalities detected by physical exam or an imaging modality and are also scheduled for breast biopsy of the index lesion, will also undergo a CBCT of the breast(s), prior to biopsy.</description>
