  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AFF008E is set-up to assess the long term effects of the 4 PD01A vaccinations that have been
      applied during AFF008 with regard to safety as well as immunological-, radiological and
      clinical activity. Accordingly, during AFF008E, no further vaccine dose will be applied.
      Instead, patients who were participating in AFF008 will be assessed for another 52 weeks at
      the occasion of 4 quarterly visits. This is offered to patients who received PD01A
      vaccinations but also to the patients who served as controls in AFF008. Thus, AFF008E will
      ensure standardized and controlled management of individuals who have received PD01A as part
      of AFF008, the Phase I study analyzing for the first time in humans this first in class
      candidate.
