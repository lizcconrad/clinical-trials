      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of 2 regimens of lactulose as a
      preparation for colonoscopy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A full-dose regimen of lactulose for oral solution, where all dosing is completed the evening
      prior to the colonoscopy procedure, will be studied and compared to a split-dose regimen,
      where three doses are taken on the prior evening, and one dose is taken the morning of the
      procedure.

    <measure>Efficacy of Lactulose as a Preparation for Colonoscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>at least 3 hours post last consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy assessed by the physician's determination of the cleanliness of the colon using the cumulative Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score. The cumulative score is derived from three segmental scores assessed from the following three colonic segments: right colon, transverse colon, and left colon. Segment scores range from 0 to 3 with the following abbreviated definitions: 0=mucosa not visible; 1=a portion of the mucosa is visible; 2=minor residue, but mucosa is seen well; 3=entire mucosa is seen well with no residue.
The cumulative BBPS score is the sum of the three segment scores such that a cumulative score of 9 represents a colon with maximum mucosa visible and a score of 0 represents minimal visibility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>at least 3 hours post last consumption</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment failure is defined in the protocol as a bowel preparation that receives a cumulative Boston Bowel Preparation Score less than 5, or has one or more of the segments scored as a 0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability of and Preference for Lactulose as a Bowel Evacuant-Patient Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 - 15 hours post last consumption</time_frame>
    <description>A paper questionnaire contained a horizontal line 100 mm long with the right end labeled &quot;Best Possible Experience&quot; and the left end labeled &quot;Worst Possible Experience&quot;. The patients were asked to use a pen to place a mark on the line at the point that best described their overall tolerability for the bowel preparation.
Scores were determined by measuring the distance of the mark from the left end of the line. So, a lower number would indicate a poor experience and a high number would reflect a positive experience, with 100 being the maximum score and one that describes the best possible experience with the preparation.</description>

    <description>Tolerability assessed by a patient questionnaire - Likert response to &quot;The dosing instructions were easy to understand and follow&quot; Range of responses allowed include whole numbers between 1 and 7.

        <title>Efficacy of Lactulose as a Preparation for Colonoscopy.</title>
        <description>Efficacy assessed by the physician’s determination of the cleanliness of the colon using the cumulative Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score. The cumulative score is derived from three segmental scores assessed from the following three colonic segments: right colon, transverse colon, and left colon. Segment scores range from 0 to 3 with the following abbreviated definitions: 0=mucosa not visible; 1=a portion of the mucosa is visible; 2=minor residue, but mucosa is seen well; 3=entire mucosa is seen well with no residue.
The cumulative BBPS score is the sum of the three segment scores such that a cumulative score of 9 represents a colon with maximum mucosa visible and a score of 0 represents minimal visibility.</description>

        <title>Tolerability of and Preference for Lactulose as a Bowel Evacuant-Patient Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>A paper questionnaire contained a horizontal line 100 mm long with the right end labeled &quot;Best Possible Experience&quot; and the left end labeled &quot;Worst Possible Experience&quot;. The patients were asked to use a pen to place a mark on the line at the point that best described their overall tolerability for the bowel preparation.
Scores were determined by measuring the distance of the mark from the left end of the line. So, a lower number would indicate a poor experience and a high number would reflect a positive experience, with 100 being the maximum score and one that describes the best possible experience with the preparation.</description>
