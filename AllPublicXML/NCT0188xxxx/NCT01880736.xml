             antidiabetic drug). All antidiabetic treatments should have been on-going for at least
             12 weeks prior to randomisation, and doses of OADs should have been stable in this
             period of time. - Please note that a maximum of 3 OADs are allowed during this trial:

             alfa-glucosidaseinhibitors or pioglitazone.

          -  Stroke; decompensated heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV;
             myocardial infarction; unstable angina pectoris; or coronary arterial bypass graft or
             angioplasty; all within the last 26 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening visit)

          -  Impaired renal function, defined as serum-creatinine higher than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL
             for males and higher than or equal to 1.3 mg/dL for females

          -  Current or past (within the last 5 years) malignant neoplasms (except basal cell and
             squamous cell skin carcinoma)

          -  Treatment with glucose-lowering agent(s) other than stated in the inclusion criteria

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Nocturnal (00:01-05:59 am) Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>The number of treatment emergent nocturnal (00:01-05:59 am) confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes over the time period of Week 0-26 was recorded by dosing regimen (flexible vs. fixed dosing) and by titration algorithm (simple vs stepwise). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes with a confirmed plasma glucose value of less than 3.1 mmol/L. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes are defined as occurring between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 0-26</time_frame>
        <population>The SAS included all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational product or its comparator. 458 subjects were grouped either according to dosing pattern or treatment algorithm received. Subjects in the safety set contributed to the evaluation “as treated”.</population>
