      To compare the quality of life (QoL) in patients receiving a bilioenteric anastomosis vs.
      endoscopical stenting for palliation of biliary obstruction due to locally unresectable or
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. In the past, endoscopy seems to have been favoured based on
      older studies, but with new chemotherapeutic regimens available, the likelihood to experience
      stent complications has increased. Therefore, the issue as to which palliation should be
      favoured has to be reconsidered.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this multi-centre, prospective-randomised study was to compare the effectiveness
      of palliative applications on patients suffering from a local, advanced and/or hepatic,
      metastasising, non-resectable pancreas head carcinoma and jaundice.

      Before randomisation, all patients are fitted with an endoscopically inserted biliary tract
      drainage endoscopically inserted. When postoperatively ascertained that the pancreas head
      carcinoma is non-resectable, the patient shall be electronically registered and randomly
      assigned to one of the palliative strategies. Group 1 will be fitted with a biliodigestive
      anastomosis. Group 2 will continue with the endoscopically inserted drainage. Regardless of
      which group they belong to, all patients will receive a palliative chemotherapy.

      The primary parameter is the average quality of life over a period of 6 months post-OP, to be
      analysed monthly using identical questionnaires. The comparison of the randomisation groups
      will be carried out using a co-variance analysis (ANCOVA) with the initial value, taken
      directly before the OP, to be used as co-variant.

    <description>Study arm A will, after randomisation, have a biliodigestive anastomosis inserted. After the healing of the wound (al least 14 days postoperative) the treatment using gemcitabine, according to the plan mentioned below.
Gemcitabine shall be administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 4 week cycle. The cycle is defined as a weekly, over a period of 3 consecutive weeks, applied infusions, followed by 1 week pause. On the day of therapy a dosage of 1000 mg/ml body surface shall be administered, intravenous, over a period of 30 minutes.</description>
