    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-month interprofessional
      community-based health promotion program, and explore its effects on older adults'
      self-management of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). Recently enrolled clients of Diabetes Care Guelph
      (DCG), who are age 65+ and have at least two other chronic conditions, will be eligible to
      participate. Participants must be English speaking, community-dwelling, independent in
      activities of daily living, and mentally competent to give informed consent. The 6-month
      intervention will consist of: in-home visits by a Registered Nurse and Registered Dietitian
      from DCG; participation in a monthly Diabetes Wellness Day group program offered through the
      Guelph Wellington Seniors Association (GWSA) together with DCG; peer support from trained
      volunteers at the Diabetes Wellness Day group program; care coordination by the DCG
      Registered Nurse to help participants access necessary supports and services; and monthly
      team conferences between care providers at DCG and the GWSA to develop a client-centred plan
      of care. To evaluate the program, participants will complete interviewer-administered
      questionnaires before and after the intervention, and care providers and peer volunteers will
      take part in group interviews.
