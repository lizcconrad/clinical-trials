      The study is designed to assess the safety of Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o. implant in patients
      with primary open angle glaucoma undergoing a combined phacoemulsification - non penetrating
      deep sclerectomy procedure.

      In this study, Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o. will be implanted during a combined surgery of
      cataract and non - penetrating deep sclerectomy in a group of 16 patients with primary open
      angle glaucoma and clinically significant cataract. Given that a considerable number of
      glaucoma patients also suffer from cataract, it is reasonable to test Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o.
      during a combined procedure of phacoemulsification and deep sclerectomy. This is also of
      importance because a combined procedure avoids the need of a second operation in this group
      of patients. Finally, it has been shown that combined phacoemulsification - deep sclerectomy
      does not induce a further risk compared to deep sclerectomy alone(open phase I study).

      Safety will be assessed based on the occurrence of adverse events.

      Efficacy assessments will be performed at every visit and efficacy analysis will include:

        -  Proportion of subjects at each study time point which will need additional IOP lowering
           drug therapy to achieve an IOP reduction to values &lt; 21 mmHg. If a subject needs more
           than one drug to achieve target IOP, the number of drugs needed to achieve adequate IOP
           reduction will be recorded.

        -  Proportion of subjects at each time point which will need Neodymium:YAG goniopuncture to
           achieve an IOP reduction to values &lt; 21 mmHg.
