  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothalamus is a part of the brain containing a number of nuclei with a variety of
      functions. It is central in the regulation of hormone secretion, sleep, and circadian
      functions. The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is a key component in controlling
      circadian rhythms and generates the rhythm of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland and
      cortisol secretion. Both melatonin and cortisol are involved in the regulation of circadian
      rhythms and sleep.

      Craniopharyngiomas are a type of brain tumors that usually affect the hypothalamus
      indirectly. In general, they are locally aggressive invading crucial structures e.g. the
      hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the optic nerve. Compared to healthy controls,
      craniopharyngioma patients have previously been reported with impaired quality of life,
      increased self-reported general and physical fatigue, increased daytime sleepiness, and
      increased prevalence of severe sleepiness

      Damage to the hypothalamus by local tumour or its treatment might involve the suprachiasmatic
      nucleus and thereby melatonin secretion leading to disturbed circadian function causing
      clinical manifestations in terms of daytime sleepiness and fatigue.

      The investigators aimed to assess the influence of craniopharyngiomas or their treatment on
      melatonin secretion, and the association with sleep pattern, sleep quality, fatigue, and
      sleepiness.

      15 patients with craniopharyngioma and 15 gender, age, and BMI matched healthy controls were
      included. Salivary melatonin and cortisol were measured over a 24h-period. Sleep-wake
      patterns were characterized by two weeks of actigraphy recordings and sleep diaries.
      Sleepiness, fatigue, sleep quality, and general health were assessed by questionnaires.
