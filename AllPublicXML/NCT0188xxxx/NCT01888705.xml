  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been a growing interest in the study of nonlinear dynamics as a
      methodology for complementary analysis to characterize the respiratory pattern. These methods
      are well established in studies of heart rate. The analyzes evaluate complex signals,
      including large-scale fractal correlations and distributions in time series, and can provide
      relevant clinical information.

      Measures such as approximate entropy and sample entropy have shown great potential in the
      evaluation of the complexity of the respiratory system, providing information relevant to the
      understanding of physiological and pathophysiological processes. These measures are based on
      the concept of non-linearity in the presence of a high number of interconnections, resulting
      in the complex behavior exhibited by physiological systems.

      The approximate entropy (ApEn) is related to the amount of clutter, complexity or
      unpredictability of a data series over time. In a complementary way, the sample entropy
      (SampEn), is a far more elaborate than the ApEn, to reduce possible biased estimates due to
      self-similarity.

      A study conducted by our group in asthma patients with different levels of bronchial
      obstruction demonstrated a significant reduction in airflow approximate entropy (ApEnV´) in
      asthmatic subjects. Investigators believe that in COPD, similar to that which occurs in
      asthma disorders that are associated with complex changes in the pathophysiology triggering
      breath control, possibly resulting in changes in air flow (V´).

      Considering the development &quot;silent&quot; changes of mechanical ventilation in COPD patients and
      its clinical relevance, as well as the difficulty of identifying such changes through
      conventional methods, we observed the need to obtain more detailed information, including the
      complexity of the system breathing for better understanding of factors that contribute to the
      illness.

      In this context, the objectives of this study were: (1) analyze the influence of airway
      obstruction in the complexity of the patterns of airflow in patients with COPD, (2) evaluate
      the diagnostic power of the test in identifying the changes caused by COPD.

    <description>The aim of the study was to analyze the changes in the respiratory system impedance (Zrs) in the different phases of the respiratory cycle of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This research was conducted using a monofrequency version of the forced oscillation technique (mFOT) and consisted of a controlled observational study where 31 individuals were analyzed, 8 controls and 23 individuals with COPD. The patients presented different degrees of airway obstruction.</description>

        The control group will consist of healthy subjects, nonsmokers, who had no episode of
        respiratory infection thirty days before the examinations.

        The group of patients with COPD will be comprised of individuals treated at the Department
        of Pneumology (Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto), at different levels of airflow
        obstruction.
