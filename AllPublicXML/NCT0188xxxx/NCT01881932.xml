  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will assess how useful and safe acupuncture is in easing the
      pain, tingling and numbness that is caused by chemotherapy. The researchers hope this will
      prevent the need to reduce the amount of chemotherapy a patient receives.

      This is a single-center, pilot (phase IIb), randomized, standard care- and placebo (sham
      acupuncture)-controlled clinical trial (N=60) assessing the effects of acupuncture to prevent
      chemotherapy dose reduction due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and to
      elucidate the mechanism of action. Breast or colorectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant
      or adjuvant chemotherapy containing neurotoxic agents (taxanes or oxaliplatin) at the
      University of Maryland Marlene &amp; Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC) will be screened
      for CIPN. Once these patients develop greater than or equal to National Cancer
      Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade 2 CIPN, they will be recruited for this
      study. Severity of CIPN as defined by NCI-CTC is listed in Appendix A. Patients will be
      stratified based on cancer type (breast cancer vs colorectal cancer). The patients will then
      be randomly assigned to one of three arms: (A) real acupuncture, (B) sham acupuncture or (C)
      standard care. All patients will follow the same chemotherapy dose reduction algorithm
      (Appendix B). No concomitant anti-neuropathy medication is allowed. Patients in the
      intervention arms will be randomly assigned to undergo weekly real or sham acupuncture until
      the end of their chemotherapy. In these two arms, the patient, the patient's medical
      oncologist, pharmacist, research nurse, and study coordinator will be blinded to the
      treatment assignment. In standard care arm, patients will not receive additional therapy for
      CIPN. Their CIPN will be managed according to the standard chemotherapy dose reduction
      algorithm. In all arms, chemotherapy dose will be documented during the patient's scheduled
      chemotherapy sessions. The chemotherapy relative dose intensity (RDI) will be calculated at
      the end of their chemotherapy. Validated patient-reported outcome questionnaires: Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy/ Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx)
      questionnaire and Neuropathy Pain Scale (NPS), described later, will be used to assess CIPN
      severity weekly in all patients until the end of their chemotherapy and at the 4 week follow
      up. Nerve conduction study will be performed by a neurologist at baseline and after
      chemotherapy is finished. Side effects from real or sham acupuncture will be recorded weekly.
      Approximately 4 ml of blood will be drawn from patients before each real or sham acupuncture
      treatment, or with routine weekly blood work check (in the standard care arm), at the end of
      chemotherapy, and at the 4 week follow up to measure changes in nerve growth factor and other
      neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, the
      insulin-like growth factors, and vascular endothelial growth factor. They will be analyzed in
      the cytokine lab at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM).

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The main objective is to assess efficacy and safety of acupuncture using Seirin acupuncture needles in colorectal and breast cancer patients who developed chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy while receiving adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Safety will be assessed by recording side effects from acupuncture treatment. Efficacy will be assessed by measuring the proportion of patients in each arm who are required to undergo dose reduction or discontinuation due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Colorectal and Breast Cancer Patients in Each Arm Who Require Dose Reduction or Discontinuation Due to Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy.</title>
        <description>The main objective is to assess efficacy and safety of acupuncture using Seirin acupuncture needles in colorectal and breast cancer patients who developed chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy while receiving adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Safety will be assessed by recording side effects from acupuncture treatment. Efficacy will be assessed by measuring the proportion of patients in each arm who are required to undergo dose reduction or discontinuation due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.</description>

            <description>Patients will be stratified based on cancer type (breast cancer vs colorectal cancer). In standard care arm, patients will not receive additional therapy for CIPN. Patient will complete a weekly questionnaire during the study to determine severity of nerve pain symptoms. Each week record the total amount of chemotherapy received in the past week. Record how much chemotherapy received all together. Each week patient will have blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon) to check nerve growth factors levels. All patients will follow the same chemotherapy dose reduction algorithm. No concomitant anti-neuropathy medication is allowed.</description>

            <description>Patients stratified based on cancer (breast cancer vs colorectal cancer). The patients will be randomly assigned to get acupuncture until the end of their chemo. Patient will complete a weekly questionnaire during the study to determine severity of nerve pain symptoms. Each week record the total amount of chemo received in the past week &amp; all together. Each week patient will have blood drawn (about 1 tsp) to check nerve growth factors levels. All patients will follow the same chemo dose reduction algorithm. No concomitant anti-neuropathy medication allowed. In standard care arm, patients will not get additional therapy for CIPN. Acupuncture using SeirinÂ® needles: Participants will get acupuncture weekly until the end of chemotherapy. Subjects will get acupuncture at documented acupoints. To improve blinding effect, acupuncturist will also tap 2 guiding tubes at 2 sham points &amp; immediately affix a pair of needles to surface of the same points with adhesive tape, no needle insertion.</description>
