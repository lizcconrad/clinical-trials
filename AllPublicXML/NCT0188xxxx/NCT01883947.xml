      The aim is to study effects of touch massage in the sub-acute phase after stroke in two main
      areas; general health and independence.The hypothesis are that; touch massage in the
      sub-acute phase after stroke decreases anxiety and pain, increases health related-quality of
      life, decrease physiological stress responses, increase sensorimotor function, decrease
      disability, and increase activity in sensorimotor areas and decrease redundant brain activity
      in motor-related areas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite high quality stroke care in Sweden, decreased sensorimotor function, anxiety and pain
      remains one year after stroke and lead to impaired health and dependence as well as high
      health care costs. It is therefore urgent to find new rehabilitation strategies. There is
      some knowledge about effects of touch massage among healthy and patients with ill-health
      conditions but no study have evaluated touch massage in the sub-acute phase of stroke.
      Therefore the aim in this project is to study effects of t touch massage in the sub-acute
      phase after stroke in two main areas; general health and independence.

    <intervention_name>Touch massage</intervention_name>
    <description>Touch massage is a gentle massage with strokes on hands, arms, feet and legs with at pressure of 2.5 N which is more gentle than Swedish massage but harder than strokes performed with a brush. The speed of the strokes is about 1-5 cm/sec. During the massage, the subjects will lie on a bed. Intervention group will receive touch massage on hands and feet and the intervention will start one week after the onset of stroke and last for 30 minutes each time, five days a week for two weeks</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control group will have sham treatment which is a non-active transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (non-TENS), while they lie in bed with electrodes attached to the skin of the affected arm. The device will be manipulated in a way so that no electrical impulses will reach the electrodes. During treatment, the masseur will remain in the room without initiating any conversation.</description>
