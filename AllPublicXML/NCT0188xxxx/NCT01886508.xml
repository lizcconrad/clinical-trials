      The investigators designed this multicentre randomized study to investigate the clinical
      benefits of nerve-spring radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. Patients with FIGO stage
      Ia2, Ib1, IIa1 and FIGO stage Ib2, IIa2 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are randomized to
      either nerve-spring radical hysterectomy or radical hysterectomy. The primary endpoint are
      urodynamic outcome including maximum flow rate, residual volume, maximum vesical compliace,
      cystomctric capacity at first desire, and maximum cystomctric capacity. A total 240 patients
      (120 per treatment arm) are planned to accrue for this study within 7 years.
