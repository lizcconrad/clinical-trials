  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to demonstrate that data collected from ShuntCheck-Micro-Pumper (SCMP)
      testing results can be used in conjunction with imaging to diagnose shunt patency or
      obstruction in pediatric/adolescent subjects presenting to an Emergency Department or
      Neurosurgery Clinic (ED/NC). SCMP results and SCMP results combined with other diagnostic
      methods, including the Attending Physician's and the Neurosurgeon's clinical judgment will be
      compared to clinical outcomes within 7 days of ED/NC visit - either shunt obstruction
      confirmed during shunt revision surgery or shunt patency confirmed by no surgery or patency
      confirmed in surgery.

    <intervention_name>ShuntCheck-Micro-Pumper (SCMP)</intervention_name>
    <description>ShuntCheck uses thermal dilution to detect flow in CSF shunts. CSF is cooled transcutaneously with an ice pack and ShuntCheck's thermosensor detects a temperature drop due to CSF flow &quot;downstream&quot; of the ice. Micro-Pumper is a handheld device which vibrates the shunt valve to generate a temporary increase in CSF flow in patent but temporarily non-flowing shunts. This flow increase can be detected by ShuntCheck.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females, older than 35 months and less than 20 years of age.

          2. Parent/guardian or alert subject (age 18 or over) capable of giving consent; subject
             less than 18 and of assent age must give assent to participate if appropriate and
             required by the institution. If the subjects are incapable of giving assent, then only
             parent/guardian consent is required.

          3. Possess an unambiguously identifiable chronically indwelling ventricular shunt which
             crosses the clavicle.

          4. Suspicion of shunt obstruction is great enough to warrant the performance of any
             diagnostic test for this condition

          5. Will be available for follow-up for up to 7 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability or unwillingness of the parent/guardian or alert subject to give informed
             consent/assent (when appropriate) as required by the Institutional Review Board.

          2. Presence of multiple shunts or known non-functioning shunts crossing the clavicle.

          3. Evaluating staff rule out shunt obstruction on the basis of a physical/clinical
             examination.

          4. SCMP test would interfere with emergent subject care or if the subject is scheduled to
             go the OR in short order.

          5. Presence of an interfering open wound or edema over the shunt.

          6. Likelihood, in the judgment of the investigator, of the subject being lost to
             follow-up as a result of subject unavailability or clinical outcome being
             unobtainable.

          7. Any other condition that would preclude or bias the results of the study according to
             the judgment of the investigator.

          8. Judgment of the investigator that participation in the study will interfere with, or
             be detrimental to, administration of optimal health-care to the subject.
