  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a dentist, administering anesthetic to patients, especially children, proves to be one of
      the most difficult parts of a procedure. Pain is one of the most common symptom in dentistry,
      and a serious concern for the dentist. The pain of the local anesthetic injection has several
      causes. Of the many reasons for pain at the site of injection, the acidity of the solution is
      thought to be most important. This study will be measuring the effects of adding sodium
      bicarbonate (buffer) to local anesthetic during dental procedures. This is commonly used in
      medical applications but is not widely used in the dental setting. Using this biochemistry
      and human physiology, one can predict when buffering the lidocaine injection, a quicker
      response in analgesia and a decrease in pain during administration. I will be measuring the
      effect using several measuring devices to gauge if buffering the local anesthetic will
      benefit the pediatric dental patient by reducing the time it takes for the analgesic effect
      as well as decreasing the pain during administration. Along with time, I will be using the
      Wong-Baker Scale to assess the pain. This scale is standard protocol for assessing pain in
      the pediatric population. The pediatric dental population has aversions to dental procedures
      because of the associated pain produced from most procedures. If limiting the time it takes
      for the analgesic to take effect and decrease the pain altogether, the pediatric patient will
      be less likely to skip treatment therefore, increase dental health.
