  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study human recombinant placental alkaline phosphatase (hRESCAP) will be
      investigated. Alkaline Phosphatase is naturally present in the body and reported to use
      lipopolysaccharde (LPS, bacterial endotoxins) and extracellular nucleotides leaking from
      damaged and ischemic cells as physiological substrates. The LPS-substrate prevalence makes
      alkaline phosphatase an interesting novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of LPS-mediated
      diseases. A bovine homologue of this protein (bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase, BIAP)
      has previously been investigated for treatment of acute inflammatory responses such as
      sepsis, and was shown to be safe in humans. hRESCAP, which will be investigated in the
      current study, is expected to have a longer half-life in humans than the previously
      investigated BIAP, due to the fact that it is more sialylated. The possibility to increase
      the t1/2 to days instead of minutes enables treatment of chronic diseases.

      In the current study the peak plasma concentration (pharmacokinetics/elimination) of
      [14C]-labelled hRESCAP in healthy volunteers will be investigated at increasing single doses
      (up to anticipated therapeutic dose), with a microdose (≤30 nmol) as a safe starting dose.

        -  Part 1: To assess the peak plasma concentration of a single microdose (≤30 nmol) of a
           recombinant human protein (hRESCAP), administered intravenously, as a suitable technique
           to predict the pharmacokinetics in humans at pharmacologically relevant doses;

        -  Part 2: To determine the safety and tolerability of single dose of hRESCAP up to 5300 µg
           in healthy male volunteers administered intravenously;

        -  To determine the peak plasma concentration of hRESCAP in healthy male volunteers within
           a pharmacologically relevant dose-range and compare this with BIAP pharmacokinetics with
           emphasis on half-life (t1/2).
