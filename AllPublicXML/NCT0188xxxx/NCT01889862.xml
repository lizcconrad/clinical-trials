      165 by Adults With PKU.

      This study is open only to adults who have been exposed to BMN165 in a previous study.

      Study BMN 165-302 is a four-part, Phase 3 study.

        -  PART 1: Open-label period

        -  PART 2: A Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period of 8 weeks
