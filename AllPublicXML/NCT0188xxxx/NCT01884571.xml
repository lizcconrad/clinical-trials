      This is a multicenter, 15-month study evaluating the effect of immunosuppression treatment on
      the rate of change on the ALS Functional Rating Scale (Revised) (ALSFRS-R) score in up to 33
      subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

    <textblock>
      In an ongoing safety trial of neural stem cell injections into the spinal cord of patients
      with ALS at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, one patient has demonstrated clear
      improvement by objective clinical and electrophysiological measures, a finding that is
      unheard of in patients with ALS.

      This patient had an improvement in ALSFRS-R by 1.4 points per month. In 826 historical
      controls from the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) and the Western ALS Consortium (WALS)
      database where ALSFRS-R was documented at 2 or more visits, there have been no patients that
      have shown improvement in ALSFRS as seen in this case. Additionally, 5 patients in the stem
      cell trial who were not on mechanical ventilators at the time of surgery seem to have very
      slow disease progression as compared to the expectation from current understanding of typical
      disease course. This observation raises consideration for a disease-modifying effect of the
      novel immunosuppression regimen used in this trial. Also, given that ALS is clinically an
      extraordinarily heterogeneous disease, the diagnosis of ALS may represent a group of
      phenotypically similar but pathogenically variable disorders. It is possible that there
      exists a subset of patients with an immune-responsive ALS subtype that has not been
      previously recognized.

      Recent studies have furthered the understanding of the immune mechanisms that contribute to
      ALS progression. Microglia and lymphocytes have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective functions
      depending on activation states and physiologic conditions within the nervous system.
      Therefore, targeted immunotherapies that proportionally suppress neurotoxic immune elements,
      while sparing or promoting protective elements, seemingly have more potential to modify
      disease course in ALS than previously tested regimens. It is postulated that the
      immunosuppression treatment given to the stem cell patients may have exhibited
      neuroprotective effects by favorably promoting the ratio of regulatory T cells and other
      protective immune mediators in relation to neurotoxic immune modulators. It is hoped that
      this trial will optimize the chance of replicating these findings and advance knowledge about
      the complex changes that occur within the immune system in patients with ALS before and after
      treatment with an immunosuppression regimen.

      The primary outcome measure will be rate of change of ALSFRS-R. A clinical response will be
      defined as a rate of change of ALSFRS-R of +6 points over a 6 month period (mean of change of
      +1 point per month).

      Secondary outcome measures will include slow vital capacity (SVC), grip strength, and hand
      held dynamometry (HHD). The change in rate of progression in clinical measures will be
      monitored to look for a potential disease-modifying effect of the immunosuppression regimen.
      Blood and cerebrospinal fluid immune system markers will be also be studied.

      If a clinical response is seen among study participants following treatment, further analyses
      will be conducted to explore any differential effects of immunosuppression in participants
      with early-stage disease and later-stage disease. To ensure adequate numbers of participants
      for conditional analyses stratifying by symptom onset date, participants will be enrolled
      based on symptom onset within 24 months of the screening visit or more than 24 months before
      screening. All participants will have the same treatment and will be treated as a single
      group for the analyses of the main study outcomes.

    <description>The ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) is an ordinal rating scale (0 through 4) used to determine the ALS patient's self assessment of their ability and need for assistance in 12 activities or functions. This is a validated scale, both in person and by phone, which provides a total score (best of 48) from four sub-scores which assess speech and swallowing, (bulbar function), use of upper extremities (cervical function), gait and turning in bed (lumbar function), and breathing (respiratory function). A clinical response is defined as a rate of change of ALSFRS-R of +6 points over 6 months (mean of +1 point per month), where typically patients with ALS have a decline in ALSFRS-R by an average of -1/month.</description>

This is a validated scale, both in person and by phone, which provides a total score from four sub-scores which assess speech and swallowing, (bulbar function), use of upper extremities (cervical function), gait and turning in bed (lumbar function), and breathing (respiratory function). Total scores range from 0 (most impaired) to 48 (normal ability). ALSFRS-R was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in ability over time.</description>

    <measure>Mean Rate of Change of Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) During Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Treatment Period (3 months prior to the start of treatment, 2 months prior to the start of treatment, and 1 month prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and then monthly until Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Vital capacity (VC), percent of predicted normal, was determined using the slow VC method. SVC measures the amount of air exhaled following a deep breath. For this test, participants hold a mouthpiece in their mouth, breathe in deeply, and breathe out as much air as they can. The test was done seated in a chair and then repeated while lying on an exam table at the Screening Visit. For all other visits, this test was done while seated in a chair. This test takes 15-20 minutes. SVC was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. SVC is a way to measure respiratory insufficiency in persons with ALS and SVC decreases as ALS progresses. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline over time.</description>

    <measure>Mean Rate of Change of Hand-Held Dynamometry (HHD) During Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Treatment Period (3 months prior to the start of treatment, 2 months prior to the start of treatment, and 1 month prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and then monthly until Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Hand held dynamometry (HHD) is a measure of muscle strength and scores decrease as ALS progresses. Six proximal muscle groups were examined bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities. Mean and standard deviation for each muscle group are established from the initial values for each participant. Strength determinations were converted to Z scores and averaged to provide an HHD megascore. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean of 0. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean. HHD was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in strength over time.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-Treatment Period (3 months prior to the start of treatment, 2 months prior to the start of treatment, and 1 month prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and then monthly until Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip was measured using a study approved dynamometer to test the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. The grip strength of the left and right hands were analyzed together. Grip strength was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. Grip strength is a measurement of muscle strength and declines as ALS progresses. A positive value means that scores during treatment were higher than pre-treatment scores, indicating an increase in grip strength over time.</description>

    <measure>Mean Rate of Change of T-cell Subsets in Blood Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Treatment Period (2 months prior to the start of treatment), Treatment Period (Day 1 and Months 1, 2, 4, 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was collected for ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the mean rate of decline of T-cells during the 6 month treatment period compared to the pre-treatment period was assessed (blood was collected twice during the 3-month long lead in period). The precise role that T-cells have in ALS is unknown and this study aims to further the understanding of how T-cells operate in persons with ALS. T-cell measurement is a ratio where the relative expression levels of FOXP3 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was calculated using the Comparative CT Method (ΔΔCT Method), normalizing to β-actin. Samples were obtained during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in T-cells over time.</description>

    <description>Lumbar punctures (LPs) were performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is banked for future use to characterize immune system markers and to further the understanding of the immune factors that contribute to disease progression in ALS. Cytokines are markers of neuroinflammation and can be categorized as neurotoxic or neuroprotective. The role that cytokines play in in ALS progression is still not yet fully understood.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Average Increase in ALSFRS-R Score of One Point Per Month</title>
        <description>The ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) is an ordinal rating scale (0 through 4) used to determine the ALS patient's self assessment of their ability and need for assistance in 12 activities or functions. This is a validated scale, both in person and by phone, which provides a total score (best of 48) from four sub-scores which assess speech and swallowing, (bulbar function), use of upper extremities (cervical function), gait and turning in bed (lumbar function), and breathing (respiratory function). A clinical response is defined as a rate of change of ALSFRS-R of +6 points over 6 months (mean of +1 point per month), where typically patients with ALS have a decline in ALSFRS-R by an average of -1/month.</description>

Total scores range from 0 (most impaired) to 48 (normal ability). ALSFRS-R was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in ability over time.</description>

        <title>Mean Rate of Change of Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) During Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment</title>
        <description>Vital capacity (VC), percent of predicted normal, was determined using the slow VC method. SVC measures the amount of air exhaled following a deep breath. For this test, participants hold a mouthpiece in their mouth, breathe in deeply, and breathe out as much air as they can. The test was done seated in a chair and then repeated while lying on an exam table at the Screening Visit. For all other visits, this test was done while seated in a chair. This test takes 15-20 minutes. SVC was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. SVC is a way to measure respiratory insufficiency in persons with ALS and SVC decreases as ALS progresses. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline over time.</description>

        <title>Mean Rate of Change of Hand-Held Dynamometry (HHD) During Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment</title>
        <description>Hand held dynamometry (HHD) is a measure of muscle strength and scores decrease as ALS progresses. Six proximal muscle groups were examined bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities. Mean and standard deviation for each muscle group are established from the initial values for each participant. Strength determinations were converted to Z scores and averaged to provide an HHD megascore. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean of 0. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean. HHD was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in strength over time.</description>

        <title>Mean Rate of Change in Grip Strength Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment</title>
        <description>Hand grip was measured using a study approved dynamometer to test the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. The grip strength of the left and right hands were analyzed together. Grip strength was measured during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. Grip strength is a measurement of muscle strength and declines as ALS progresses. A positive value means that scores during treatment were higher than pre-treatment scores, indicating an increase in grip strength over time.</description>

        <title>Mean Rate of Change of T-cell Subsets in Blood Treatment Compared to Pre-Treatment</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the mean rate of decline of T-cells during the 6 month treatment period compared to the pre-treatment period was assessed (blood was collected twice during the 3-month long lead in period). The precise role that T-cells have in ALS is unknown and this study aims to further the understanding of how T-cells operate in persons with ALS. T-cell measurement is a ratio where the relative expression levels of FOXP3 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was calculated using the Comparative CT Method (ΔΔCT Method), normalizing to β-actin. Samples were obtained during the 3 month lead in period and the 6 month treatment period. A random slopes model was fit to the lead-in and treatment periods, with a change point when treatment started. The analysis was based on the difference in slope after the change point. A negative value means that scores during treatment were lower than pre-treatment scores, indicating a decline in T-cells over time.</description>
