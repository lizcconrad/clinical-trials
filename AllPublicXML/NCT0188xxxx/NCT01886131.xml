      To compare the electrical activity of SubThalamic Nuclei (STN), by mean of local field
      potentials recordings, during the phasic behaviours of RBD with the electrical activity
      recorded at this level during the execution of voluntary movements during the &quot;off&quot; and the
      &quot;on&quot; phases in patients with RBD secondary to PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient with severe Parkinson's disease (PD) with motor fluctuations are akinetic and
      bradykinetic during the &quot;off&quot; phases. Their motor status dramatically improves during &quot;on&quot;
      phases, due to the effect of dopaminergic agents.

      In the off phases, the plasmatic levels of dopaminergic drugs are the lowest. The plasmatic
      levels of dopaminergic drugs are also very low during nocturnal sleep.

      Nevertheless, PD patients may show vigorous and rapid movements during REM Behaviour Disorder
      (RBD). Thirty-three to 46% of the patients with PD have RBD.

      Akinesia and bradykinesia are the consequence of a hyperactivity of the SubThalamic Nuclei
      (STN). The electrophysiological correlate of this hyperactivity causing akinesia and
      bradykinesia is represented by STN beta activity, recorded by local field potentials.

      STN beta activity is not present during the execution of a voluntary movement at an &quot;on&quot;
      phase. Levodopa therapy, which can revert akinesia and bradykinesia, also suppress STN beta
      activity in PD patients The STN is the surgical target for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of
      the basal ganglia to improve the motor symptoms of PD.

      The STN has bilateral connections with the laterodorsal nucleus/pedunculopontine tegmentum
      (LDT/PPN), a key structure for REM sleep regulation.

      The investigators hypothesize that during the execution of the phasic motor behaviours of RBD
      the pattern of discharge of STN differs from the one observed during voluntary movements in
      the &quot;off&quot; phase, in PD patients. In other terms, we expect the STN beta activity to disappear
      during the execution of phasic motor behaviors of RBD.

    <description>We will record the electrical activity of the STN (local field potentials) during the 2 consecutive nights following the implantation of the electrodes in the STN for DBS. In this period, the deep brain stimulator will not yet be connected to the intracranial electrodes.
The intracranial EEG signal from the STN will be synchronised with the scalp EEG and other video-polysomnographic parameters.
The STN recordings during the phasic movements of RBD will be compared to the recordings obtained at the same level during a motor task.</description>
