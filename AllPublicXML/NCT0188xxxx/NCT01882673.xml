  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this program of research is to disseminate an effective, brief
      computer-based intervention that can be readily integrated into Substance Use Disorders (SUD)
      treatment programs to motivate tobacco quitline use in patients who smoke. The overall
      objective of this application, which is the first step in the attainment of this long-term
      goal, is to fully develop this computer-based intervention, modify it based on initial
      piloting and feedback to insure its feasibility and acceptability, and obtain preliminary
      data supporting the efficacy of the intervention. This will be accomplished by pursuing three
      specific aims: 1) to develop and conduct preliminary pilot testing (n=20) of a brief,
      computer-based intervention intended to motivate tobacco quitline use among cigarette smokers
      in SUD treatment (TIME-TQ; Tablet computer Intervention to Motivate Engagement in Tobacco
      Quitline use) and to develop and pilot test a computer-based, time matched control
      intervention (CON), 2) to conduct a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 60
      smokers in SUD treatment, comparing TIME-TQ vs. CON, with predictions that TIME-TQ relative
      to CON will result in increased readiness, higher rates of tobacco treatment engagement, more
      quit smoking attempts and higher rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 1- and
      3-month follow-ups. Substance use outcomes over the course of the 3-month follow-up period
      will also be examined, and 3) to examine TIME-TQ's effects on key mechanisms during the
      computer session and their associations with tobacco treatment engagement and smoking
      outcomes at 1- and 3-month follow-ups.
