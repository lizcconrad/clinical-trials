    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidences of GVHD and viral infections in
      haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients receiving different dose of
      antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for acute graft-versus-host disease(aGVHD) prophylaxis. Our
      first objective was to investigate the optimal dose of ATG for aGVHD and second object was to
      evaluate the effect of different dose of ATG on post-transplant viral infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)is the only therapeutic option
      for many hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, about 75% of patients who require
      allo-HSCT lack human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors. The alternative is hematopoietic
      stem cells from an HLA-mismatched family donor. However, this strategy, which is called
      haploidentical HSCT, may be associated with high risk of early death and severe GVHD.

      Opportunistic infections are common complications after allo-HSCT. Due to the absence of
      effective preventive and therapeutic drugs for most viruses, viral infections has become one
      of the most important causes of death. The immunosuppression regimen including ATG has been
      shown effective to prevent severe GVHD in haploidentical HSCT. But this strategy delays
      immune reconstitution, and therefore increase the risk of viral infection.

      The optimal dose of the different ATG preparations with respect to prevention of GvHD is not
      fully understood today. The total doses between 6 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg are effective for
      prevention of GVHD, but the dose above 10 mg/kg may increase the development of viral
      infection.

      In this trial, we will focus on the incidence of aGVHD and viral infections in patients
      treated with 7.5mg/kg or 10mg/kg of ATG. The incidence of GVHD and viral infections will be
      compared between different dose arms.
