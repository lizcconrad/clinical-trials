        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects will be at least 21 years of age.

          -  Subjects will have a life expectancy of approximately 6 months

          -  Subject health is adequate as determined by the investigator to receive [18F]NAV4694

          -  Female subjects will not be of child-bearing potential or will have a negative urine
             pregnancy test on day of [18F]NAV4694 injection.

          -  Must exhibit adequate visual, auditory, and communication capabilities to enable
             compliance with study procedures. This includes being able to lie down flat in the MRI
             or CT and PET scanner for a period of approximately 1 hour.

          -  Subjects must be willing to donate their brains for post mortem examination upon death
             (this consent can be obtained in the manner specific to the country/region involved).

          -  Subjects have been fully informed about the study, including provisions of the Health
             Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as applicable, and informed
             consent or assent has been signed and dated (with time) by the subject and/or the
             subject's legally acceptable representative (LAR) (for individuals with dementia).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Scheduled for surgery and/or another invasive procedure within the time period of up
             to 7 days after [18F]NAV4694 injection.

          -  Has severe cerebral macrovascular (i.e., multi-stroke) disease or brain tumor
             (metastasis/brain cancer) as verified by MRI that prohibits sampling of the required
             pre-specified ROIs.

          -  Has any history of any transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (prion disease).

          -  Has received any contrast material (X-ray, MRI) or radiopharmaceutical within 48 hours
             prior to, or a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical (e.g., 131-I) within 10 days prior to,
             or any radiopharmaceutical administration within 10 radioactive half-lives prior to
             the administration of the investigational product or for whom administration of such
             substances is planned within 7 days after investigational product administration.

          -  Is allergic to the investigational product or any of its constituents.
