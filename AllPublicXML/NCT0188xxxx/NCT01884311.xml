      The main objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics profile of Subgam-VF.
      The secondary objectives are to assess the safety of Subgam-VF and refine the dose adjustment
      coefficient for Subgam-VF needed for subjects switching from prior intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IGIV) therapy.

      This will be a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study.

      Following a screening period, eligible subjects will commence weekly Subgam-VF treatment;
      this is a 16% subcutaneous IgG product.

      Subjects will receive Subgam-VF for 26 weeks during which time safety will be assessed.

      After Week 21, PK sampling will commence.

      Follow-up visit (one week after the last Subgam-VF infusion, Week 27). All AEs will be
      monitored up to 28 days after the last Subgam-VF infusion by telephone contact (Week 30).

      Subgam-VF will be administered subcutaneously using infusion pumps.

      Subjects will be given diaries to record adverse event data as well as any infusions
      administered at home. In addition there will be a telephone follow up by an appropriately
      qualified site staff member on day 3 after each site administered and home administered
      infusion to check for any adverse reactions including infusion site reactions and remind
      subjects to document these in their subject study diary.
