  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of electric stimulation
      (electrolipolysis) in a home-based cardiovascular rehabilitation program in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in most industrialized countries.

      It is widely accepted that cardiac rehabilitation has a beneficial role in the control of
      modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. However, these cardiovascular rehabilitation programs
      are scarce and only a small fraction of the population who needs has access. So, it is
      pertinent to the displacement of these programs to the community context.

      Obesity has become a truly global epidemic among children and adults, as well as changing the
      metabolic profile: when occurs an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue (mainly central
      distribution) there are a set of changes / adjustments to the cardiac structure and function.
      The electrical stimulation of abdominal subcutaneous (electrolipolysis) is a procedure often
      used in physical therapy clinics to reduce waist circumference. However, the effectiveness of
      this intervention, the selection of parameters, and the duration of its effects in cardiac
      patients are not yet clarified in the literature.

    <measure>Cardiorespiratory Fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Cardiorespiratory Fitness at 8 weeks of Cardiac Rehabilitation Home-based Program</time_frame>
    <description>The stress test was performed according to the Bruce protocol on a treadmill. The test begins with the treadmill set to a low speed (2.7 km/h) and a 10% incline, and every 3 minutes the speed and angle of incline are increased. Generally the incline is increased by 2% at every level, until exhaustion.
It was measured resting, maximum and recovery heart rate; resting, maximum and recovery systolic blood pressure; resting, maximum and recovery diastolic blood pressure; resting, maximum and recovery double product; time and recovery time; speed; slope; and changes in functional capacity.</description>

    <description>This group had the exercise program, thrice a week for eight weeks.
The exercise protocol consists of 10 exercises: aerobic and resistance exercises. It was used a moderate intensity (60% of maximum heart rate of stress test with progression until 80%). Subjects were taught to monitor exercise intensity by measuring the manual heart rate, by using the scale of perceived exertion Borg (11-13), and by observation of signs.
The exercise protocol was done with supervision from a distance, using information technologies (SMS, phone, email ...), and when necessary it was resorted to routine meetings.</description>

    <description>This group had the exercise program after electrolipolysis, thrice a week for eight weeks.
The electrolipolysis consisted of 30-minute sessions: the first 15 minutes with a frequency of 30 Hz and the final 15 minutes with a frequency of 10 Hz; with a pulse time of 10 ms; and an intensity below the threshold of sensitivity (with a maximum of 750 μA). There were used 4 transcutaneous electrodes in the abdominal region (parallel position).
Microcurrent was done with supervision from a distance, using information technologies (SMS, phone, email ...), and when necessary it was resorted to routine meetings.</description>
