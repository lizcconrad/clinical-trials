    <textblock>
      In vivo deposition studies of aerosol administration during noninvasive ventilation are
      scarce in the current literature.

      We assessed 10 normal subjects in a crossover study evaluated by pulmonary scintigraphy
      aiming to compare radiaoaerosol pulmonary index and radioaerosol mass balance in the
      different compartments (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) of radiotagged aerosol administered
      using vibrating mesh nebulizers (VMN) and conventional jet nebulizer (JN) during noninvasive
      ventilation (NIV).

    <measure>Radioaerosol deposition index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 m</time_frame>
    <description>Inhalation was performed using diethilene triamine penta-acetic technetium (99mTc-DTPA) with radioactivity of 25 millicuries (Nobre et al., 2007). Both nebulizers were charged with 2.5 mg of salbutamol and 0.25 mg of ipratropium bromide and normal saline solution to complete a fill volume of 3 mL. The JN (Misty Max, Air Life, Yorba Linda, USA) with a particle MMAD of 5 µm (according to the manufacturer information) was positioned in the circuit using a &quot;T&quot; piece placed between the circuit leak and the mask, and operated with oxygen flow at 8 L/min. VMN (NIVO, Respironics®, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA) with an MMAD of 3.0 µm was placed in the elbow adapter at the mask.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radioaerosol mass balance in pulmonary and extrapulmonary compartments</measure>
    <time_frame>4 m</time_frame>
    <description>the same procedure was performed to analysis deposition in the nebulizer, circuits, inspiratory filter, expiratory filter and face mask. Counts representing stomach were obtained from posterior thorax and corrections for decay of technetium were used during extrapulmonary measurements. The analysis of deposition in pulmonary and extrapulmonary compartments was expressed as a percentage from the cumulative count in each compartment representing the total radioaerosol mass.</description>

    <description>Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP Synchrony, Respironics®, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA) was applied through face mask (Comfort Full 2, Respironics®, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA) attached with straps and pressure adjusted to12 cmH2O peak inspiratory pressure and 5 cmH2O of expiratory pressure at the beginning of the procedure. Patients were adapted to use NIV before starting measurements, pressures were titrated before reaching the established levels and just after this period masks were fitted using the straps. They were oriented to use a breathing pattern inspiring deeply and exhaling slowing to avoid ventilator-patient asynchrony.</description>
