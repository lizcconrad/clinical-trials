      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a potentially reversible, metabolically caused complication of
      acute or chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis. Due to the diseased liver's inability to
      remove toxins such as ammonia, which is produced in the gastrointestinal tract, the ammonia
      accumulates in the brain and causes forgetfulness, confusion, disorientation, concentration
      and memory problems, changes in mood, decreased alertness and responsiveness, changes in
      sleep habits, muscle tremors and stiffness, speech impairments, uncontrollable movements,
      agitation.

      This study will examine music as a possible external factor that could contribute to
      impairment in attention and progressive memory in cirrhotic patients while driving.
      Sustaining attention is important for learning and remembering new information, for e.g.
      keeping the car within lane and paying attention to cyclists and pedestrians. Prospective
      memory is the ability to remember to perform previously intended tasks at the appropriate
      time or occasion, for instance remembering the correct exit while driving on the highway.
      Impairment in any of these areas may result in serious consequences for patient with
      cirrhosis. There is evidence that some subsets of cirrhotic patients have a diminished
      ability to drive and significantly more motor vehicle crashes and traffic violations. In
      these patients, listening to music while driving may further jeopardize their driving
      ability, which in turn may lead to reduced quality of life and increased medical costs (from
      motor vehicle accidents).

      This is a cross-sectional study designed to determine if there is any effect of listening to
      music on attention and prospective memory in patients with cirrhosis. For these purposes,
      subjects will be asked to come for one study visit, which will last approximately 2 hours.
      During this visit, subjects will undergo a series of screening procedures (consent,
      assignment of subject identification number, demographics, medical history, physical
      examination, vitals, height, weight, and eligibility assessment). If they are found eligible,
      subjects will undergo several neuropsychological assessments to measure any effect of music
      on attention and prospective memory. These assessments include including Number Connection
      Test (NCT), Digit Symbol Test (DST), Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) and
      Inhibitory Control Test (ICT).

      Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, partially blocking blood
      flow and preventing the liver's ability to control infections, removes bacteria and toxins
      from the blood, and to produce proteins to regulate blood clotting and bile to absorb fats
      and fat-soluble vitamins. With an estimated prevalence between five and ten percent,
      cirrhosis is the twelfth leading cause of death by disease, leading to 27,000 deaths per
      year. Heavy alcohol consumption and hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis B and C) are the major
      contributors to this disease's prevalence (NDDIC, 2003).

      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a potentially reversible, metabolically caused complication of
      acute or chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, which is characterized by neuropsychiatric
      abnormalities. Nearly 70% of cirrhotic patients experience mild levels of HE and
      approximately 30% of end-stage patients experience significant HE symptoms, many approaching
      coma (Mullen et al., 1999). Although the pathophysiology of HE is not yet clearly understood,
      the accumulation of ammonia in the brain due to the liver's inability to remove toxins
      (including ammonia) is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of HE. Other factors,
      which are not mutually exclusive, include increased GABA-ergic tone, selective alterations of
      the blood-brain barrier permeability and changes in neurotransmitter systems. The broad
      spectrum of symptoms in HE include forgetfulness, confusion, disorientation, concentration
      and memory problems, changes in mood, decreased alertness and responsiveness, changes in
      sleep habits, muscle tremors and stiffness, speech impairments, uncontrollable movements,
      agitation (Ferenci et al., 2002).

      The diagnosis of HE is essentially based on clinical history and laboratory findings such as
      elevated ammonia levels. Additionally, specialized psychometric tests such as the number
      connection test (NCT), Digit Symbol Test (DST) and Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score
      (PHES) have been used in quantifying the minor deficits that may be present in patients with
      early HE.

      Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a category of early HE without any overt
      neuropsychiatric symptoms but with subtle cognitive deficits (Ferenci et al., 1998). It is a
      common complication of cirrhosis and has been reported in 20% to 74% of patients (Dhiman et
      al., 2010), depending on the test used for diagnosis. It results in deficits in specific
      cognitive domains such as attention, vigilance, response inhibition, executive function and
      prospective memory. These deficits are often not apparent from a routine neurological exam or
      MMSE but can be detected on psychometric testing. The prompt identification and treatment of
      MHE are essential because MHE predicts progression to overt HE and impairs the capacity to
      drive which can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life (Romero-Gomez et al.,
      2001; Wein et al, 2004) .

      Treatment of HE with or without liver transplantation has been shown to reverse the cognitive
      deficits and improve quality of life (Prasad et al., 2007; Sidhu et al., 2011). Although the
      PHES and NCT are the gold standard for diagnosing MHE, their utility is limited due to
      expensive copyright, a need for trained psychologists and the lack of reimbursements from
      insurance companies. A simpler test would therefore be beneficial to internists who could
      easily implement it in the clinic setting.

      The inhibitory control task (ICT) is a computerized psychometric test that has been
      introduced recently as a diagnostic tool for MHE. It measures the ability to sustain
      attention and to inhibit responses to relevant stimuli, 2 basic cognitive domains that are
      impaired in MHE. During the ICT, the patient is presented with a continuous stream of letters
      at 500-ms intervals and interspersed within these letters are the letters X and Y. Subjects
      are instructed to only respond when the letters &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are alternated (called targets),
      independent of the letters between them. In contrast, patients are instructed to refrain from
      responding, i.e. inhibit their response, when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are not alternating (called lures).
      Higher rates of target response, lower rates of lure response and shorter reaction times
      indicate better attention and response inhibition. One study by Bajaj et al. (2008) showed
      the ICT to be a reliable test with 87% sensitivity for the diagnosis of MHE, with MHE
      patients having higher ICT lures and lower targets compared to patients without MHE.

      Patients with MHE have deficits in attention and prospective memory which are cognitive
      domains that are important to activities such as driving. Sustaining attention is important
      for learning and remembering new information, for e.g. keeping the car within the lane while
      driving and paying attention to pedestrians and cyclists. Prospective memory involves both
      working memory (to formulate, initiate, and modify plans of action) and retrospective memory
      (to recall what needs to be done at a particular time or in response to an external cue), for
      instance, remembering the correct exit while driving on the highway. The act of driving
      requires the ability to sustain attention and utilize prospective memory under stressful
      conditions. Impairment in any of these areas may result in serious consequences for patient
      with chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis. Indeed, some studies of cirrhotic patients
      have shown that those with MHE have a diminished ability to drive and significantly more
      motor vehicle crashes and traffic violations than those without MHE (Bajaj et al., 2007,
      2009). The reasons behind this are thought to be not only the obvious cognitive deficits, but
      also a greater tendency to fatigue at the wheel and poor insight into the cognitive
      deficiencies (Kircheis et al., 2009). In fact, driving simulator tests and questionnaire
      surveys have shown that patients with MHE who have been diagnosed using the ICT have impaired
      navigational skills and significantly higher crash rates (Bajaj et al., 2008, 2009).

      In addition to the potential value of the ICT in detecting MHE, the test may be useful in
      uncovering temporary insults to attention and working memory that may arise in the presence
      of external stimuli such as music. Listening to music while driving is a pervasive practice
      and the relationship between background music and driving performance has been studied in the
      past (Unal et al., 2012; van der Zwaag et al., 2012). However these studies did not
      specifically address patients with cirrhosis, who are a population at higher risk of traffic
      accidents. The hypothesis of our study are (1) cirrhotic patients with MHE are expected to
      have lower ICT scores than patients without MHE and (2) these deficits are expected to worsen
      in the presence of music, suggesting music as a possible factor that could contribute to
      impaired attention and working memory, and hence impaired driving ability in cirrhotic
      patients. To this end, various types of music, including classical and heavy metal, will be
      used as a means of distracting cirrhotic patients while they are administered the ICT, to
      determine if there is any effect of listening to music on ICT scores. In addition to the ICT,
      the Digit Symbol Test, Number Connection Test, Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT),
      Stroop test, Fisk Fatigue Impact Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale will also be administered
      to quantify the degree of HE. While the use of ICT may not be appropriate for definitively
      predicting driving fitness, it may be valuable in uncovering deficits in attention and memory
      that arise while listening to music, which may ultimately aid in the counseling and education
      of patients regarding safe driving practices.
