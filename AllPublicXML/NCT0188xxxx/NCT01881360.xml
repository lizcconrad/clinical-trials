  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia patients frequently suffer from symptoms similar to those of adult celiac
      disease, raising the possibility that some fibromyalgia patients experience oligosymptomatic
      celiac disease or non-celiac gluten intolerance. The objective of this study is to compare
      the effect of a gluten-free diet with a hypocaloric diet in patients with fibromyalgia and
      celiac-type symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder, is characterized by generalized chronic
      musculoskeletal pain that is usually accompanied by several other clinical manifestations
      that contribute to a diminished quality of life, such as sleep disturbances, chronic fatigue,
      mood disorders, and cognitive difficulties. Many patients with fibromyalgia suffer from
      gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms that are similar to those experienced by adult
      celiac disease patients such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation,
      fatigue, pain and mood changes. This raises the possibility that some patients with
      fibromyalgia may also suffer from oligosymptomatic celiac disease or non-celiac gluten
      intolerance. On the other hand, the emerging evidence linking obesity with fibromyalgia and
      the high prevalence of overweight among fibromyalgia patients suggest a potential benefit for
      weight loss among these patients. Thus, the main objective of this study is to compare the
      efficacy of a gluten-free diet (GFD) with a hypocaloric diet (HCD) in patients with
      fibromyalgia that also experience celiac-type symptoms.
