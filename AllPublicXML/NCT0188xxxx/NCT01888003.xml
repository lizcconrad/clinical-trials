  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to gain further insight into the comparative effectiveness of
      treating patients, who are found to be anemic before their elective surgery, with a series of
      weekly subcutaneous doses of a drug given before surgery, which stimulates the natural
      production of red blood cells (a so-called erythropoietic stimulating agent [ESA]) along with
      intravenous iron, in reducing the need for blood transfusions (donated by someone other than
      the patient) during and after adult total hip arthroplasty (hip replacement surgery). The
      effects of a Preoperative Anemia Management Program (PAMP) on the patient's quality of
      recovery, health-related quality of life, fatigue, and rehabilitation pattern after surgery
      will also be examined. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed to compare the cost of
      these commercially available, FDA-approved medications versus the cost of transfused blood

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient blood management (PBM) involves the timely and conscientious use of the current best
      evidence in making medical and surgical decisions about the care of patients to maintain red
      blood cell levels, optimize blood clotting, and minimize blood loss, in an effort to improve
      patient outcome. PBM focuses on the treatment of the individual patient and comprises
      transfusion therapy and drug therapy. PBM is based on three points: (1) optimization of the
      (preoperative) red blood cell volume, (2) reduction of diagnostic, therapeutic, or
      intraoperative blood loss, and (3) increasing individual tolerance towards anemia and
      accurate blood transfusion triggers. PBM primarily identifies patients at risk for
      transfusion and provides a management plan aimed at reducing or eliminating anemia and the
      need for blood transfusion donated from someone other than the patient (allogeneic
      transfusion), thus reducing the risks, blood bank inventory pressures, and the escalating
      costs associated with transfusion. The implementation of a formal UAB Preoperative Anemia
      Management Program (PAMP) may help achieve consistent PBM.

      Efforts will be made to coordinate patients' scheduled surgery date and their initial
      evaluation in the UAB Highlands Hospital Preoperative Assessment, Consultation, and Treatment
      (HPACT) Clinic, so that their first PACT Clinic visit occurs approximately 14 days prior to
      the planned total hip replacement or total knee replacement

Iron sucrose: AMG patients will receive a standardized and well-accepted intravenous dose of 200 mg of iron sucrose (Venofer®) at −14 days and −7 days before their planned surgery, and if indicated, based upon laboratory testing on the day of their surgery (if patient has a Hgb &lt; 13.0 g/dL and hematocrit between 30% and 39%, for males and females). An additional dose will be given on postoperative day 2.
Epoetin Alfa: AMG patients will receive a standardized and well-accepted subcutaneous dose of 40,000 IU of epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) plus an intravenous dose of 200 mg of iron sucrose (Venofer®) at −14 days, −7 days before their planned surgery, and if indicated, based on labs, testing on the day of their surgery</description>

          <description>Group of patients who are diagnosed preoperatively as being anemic (defined as a Hgb &lt; 13.0 g/dL and MCV &lt; 100 fL, with a hematocrit between 30% and 39%, for males and females), who will receive our current, conventional perioperative standard of care, which does not involve any preoperative anemia management (other than laboratory testing). CTG patients will undergo routine perioperative laboratory testing/screening.
Blood Transfusion: An evidence-based, goal-directed blood transfusion protocol will be applied in AMG, CTG, and NAG patients during and after their surgical procedure to control for health provider variation in transfusion criteria and practices. This blood conservation protocol will consist primarily of the application of a restrictive transfusion trigger (Hgb &lt; 8 g/dl) (21,22) but will also take into consideration the patient's intraoperative estimated allowable blood loss and hemodynamic stability.</description>
