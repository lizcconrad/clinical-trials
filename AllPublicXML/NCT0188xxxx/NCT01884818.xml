  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study includes two phases. In phase one the reliability of thoracic spine mobility
      measurements are studied in subjects with thoracic spine pain. In phase two the reliable
      measurements are used to measure the effects of thoracic spine manipulation in subjects with
      thoracic spine pain. The changes in pain is measured as well.

      In second phase the control group receives TNS treatment six times at home as a placebo so
      that the power of TNS is limited to very low level. The number of treatments are controlled
      as well as the time of treatment. The treatment group receives six manipulation treatments
      within 3 week period. The effects are measured immediately after the treatment weeks, and 3
      and 8 week follow-up. Moreover the one year follow-up will be performed by mail
      questionnaire.

      Outcome measures are intensity of pain (VAS, Roland-Morris questionnaire) thoracic mobility
      (measured with computer, tape measurements, inclinometer and manually).
