      The purpose of the study is:

        1. To conduct a pilot SMART (Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized) study with the
           long-term goal of developing a personalized treatment for child depression.

        2. To collect pilot data on ways to personalize treatment for child depression using
           cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), caregiver-child treatment, or both.

    <textblock>
      Child depression is among the most prevalent and impairing pediatric conditions and
      constitutes a major public health concern. Unfortunately, treatment benefits are relatively
      modest and short-lived with sizeable percentages of children who maintain depressive symptoms
      following treatment. This problem may be addressed in part by personalizing treatment,
      including determining which children will benefit from CBT, which children will benefit from
      caregiver-child treatment, and which children will benefit from both. The goal of the current
      study is to pilot test an innovative experimental design called Sequential, Multiple
      Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART), which is used for development of personalized
      treatments, collect pilot data, and assess the acceptability and feasibility of using this
      design, in preparation for a full-scale SMART in a larger clinical trial and for the
      development of personalized treatment.
