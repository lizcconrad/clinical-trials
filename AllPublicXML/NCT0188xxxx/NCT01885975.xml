      The investigators' hypothesis is that patients with apical ballooning syndrome (ABS) will
      manifest a personality profile that differs than that of a population of similar range of
      ethnic and socioeconomic status.

        This study will be conducted among participants in the Mayo Clinic Apical Ballooning
        Registry. These patients were prospectively diagnosed with Apical Ballooning Syndrome at
        the time of presentation with their acute illness, and consented to participation in a
        registry. They are residents of Olmsted County, and the surrounding regions for which the
        Mayo Clinic serves as a tertiary care center. Enrollment in the registry requires
        satisfaction of standard criteria for the diagnosis of ABS and includes the administration
        of a standardized questionnaire. Subjects have agreed to participate in yearly follow up
        questionnaires about their health status.
