  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2a randomized double blind placebo controlled, in 30 Parkinson's disease (PD)
      subjects who are treated with oral levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) and suffer from motor
      fluctuations. The aim of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, the levodopa
      pharmacokinetics, the need for oral LD dose adjustment and the usability of the ambulatory
      drug delivery pump following repeated dosing of ND0612 in a conventional home setting in
      Parkinson's disease patients. Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile of levodopa
      and carbidopa, pump usability and the potential clinical effect of ND0612 will be explored in
      subjects with PD and motor fluctuations.
