  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the glaucoma filtering surgery failures (intraocular pressure rises again), the options
      is start to use the hypotensive eye drops again (medical treatment). However, in some cases
      (encapsulated blebs), there is a simple surgical revision that can revival the primary
      failure surgery. It calls transconjunctival needling revision. In this study, the
      investigators compare the efficacy of this revision versus medical treatment in 12-month
      follow up in eyes with encapsulated blebs.

      To compare the efficacy of transconjunctival needling revision (TNR) with 5-fluorouracil
      versus medical treatment (MT) in glaucomatous eyes with uncontrolled intraocular pressure
      (IOP) due to encapsulated bleb after trabeculectomy Prospective, randomized, interventional
      study. A total of forty eyes of 39 patients with elevated IOP and encapsulated bleb diagnosed
      at maximum 5 months after primary trabeculectomy with mitomycin C were included. The eyes
      were randomized to either TNR with 5-fluorouracil or MT (hypotensive eyedrops). A maximum of
      two TNR per patient was allowed in the needling arm. All eyes were followed up for 12 months.
      Success of treatment was defined as IOP â‰¤ 18mmHg and 20% reduction from baseline at last
      follow up.
