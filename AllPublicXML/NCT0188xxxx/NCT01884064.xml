      This study investigated the short term effects of repeated administrations of
      repetitive-transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on clinical changes and investigate
      neurophysiologic responses to rTMS of the activated motor system in patients with FHD.

      Purpose: The ability of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to
      enhance intracortical inhibition has motivated its use as a potential therapeutic
      intervention in focal hand dystonia (FHD). In this preliminary investigation, we assessed the
      physiologic and behavioral effects of multiple sessions of rTMS in FHD. Methods: 12 patients
      with FHD underwent five daily-sessions of 1 Hz rTMS to contralateral dorsal premotor cortex
      (dPMC). Patients held a pencil and made movements that did not elicit dystonic symptoms
      during rTMS. We hypothesized that an active but non-dystonic motor state would increase
      beneficial effects of rTMS. Five additional patients received sham-rTMS protocol. The area
      under curve (AUC) of the motor evoked potentials and the cortical silent period (CSP) were
      measured to assess changes in corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition,
      respectively. Behavioral measures included pen force and velocity during handwriting and
      subjective report.

    <description>Subjects performed an isometric abduction contraction of the index finger against a strain gauge coupled to a load cell. A single TMS pulse was applied 2-3 s after contraction initiation and subjects were instructed to relax 2-3 s after stimulation. The duration of the CSP was measured on a trial-by-trial basis and was delineated by the first superimposed TMS-evoked EMG spike (onset) and the return of activity to 50% of prestimulus EMG signal (offset). The mean CSP duration was calculated for each block of measurements. The duration of CSP is thought to be related to intracortical GABAergic synapse-mediated inhibition in the stimulated cortical region. Measures of CSP have been shown to be reliable in repeated measures studies to determine an effect of intervention within a group of subjects (Orth and Rothwell 2004; Borich et al., 2009). Values are calculated as the value recorded at the latest time minus the earliest time point.</description>

        <description>Subjects performed an isometric abduction contraction of the index finger against a strain gauge coupled to a load cell. A single TMS pulse was applied 2-3 s after contraction initiation and subjects were instructed to relax 2-3 s after stimulation. The duration of the CSP was measured on a trial-by-trial basis and was delineated by the first superimposed TMS-evoked EMG spike (onset) and the return of activity to 50% of prestimulus EMG signal (offset). The mean CSP duration was calculated for each block of measurements. The duration of CSP is thought to be related to intracortical GABAergic synapse-mediated inhibition in the stimulated cortical region. Measures of CSP have been shown to be reliable in repeated measures studies to determine an effect of intervention within a group of subjects (Orth and Rothwell 2004; Borich et al., 2009).
