      RATIONALE: Tomato-soy juice may slow the growth of tumor cells. Studying samples of blood and
      tissue from patients with prostate cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors understand the effect of tomato-soy
      juice on biomarkers.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of tomato-soy juice and its
      effect on biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer undergoing prostatectomy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of toxicity associated with tomato-soy juice in
           patients undergoing prostatectomy.

      Secondary

        -  Quantify changes in the content and distribution of soy isoflavones and tomato
           phytochemicals (carotenoids and polyphenols) to the prostate and correlate tissue
           content and patterns with blood and urinary concentrations of these compounds and their
           metabolites.

        -  Determine blood hormonal patterns and biomarkers of oxidative stress that favor prostate
           cancer prevention.

        -  Investigate histopathologic and molecular biomarkers associated with prostate
           carcinogenesis that may serve as surrogate endpoint biomarkers and provide information
           regarding their ability to be modulated by the tomato-soy juice.

        -  Examine several critical histopathologic endpoints, including systemic hormones,
           cell/matrix interactions in the tumor microenvironment, and molecular processes within
           the tumor cells (tumor grade and nuclear morphometry, tumor stage, proliferation index,
           apoptotic index, and angiogenesis/vascularity).

        -  Determine if consumption of tomato-soy juice alters molecular markers in the human
           prostate, including neuroendocrine markers such as IGF-I and IGF-BP3, signal
           transduction markers such as PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) and phospho-AKT,
           and angiogenesis regulators such as VEGF (vascular epithelial growth factor).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive tomato-soy juice daily for 4 weeks. Patients then undergo
      prostatectomy.

      Patients complete urologic symptom and quality-of-life questionnaires.

      Blood, urine, and tissue samples are collected for biomarker and pharmacokinetic analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven carcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Have chosen radical prostatectomy (or cystoprostatectomy) for treatment of their
             disease after presented all possible options by medical team.

          -  Not receiving neoadjuvant hormonal or chemotherapy (other clinical trials)

          -  Not currently taking lycopene, soy dietary supplements, or &quot;alternative&quot; products
