  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, fixed-dose
      parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety of orvepitant (60 mg/day) versus
      placebo in subjects with a diagnosis of noncombat-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD), whose symptoms are considered moderate or severe.

      Following an initial screening visit, subjects fulfilling the study inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will enter a pre-treatment screening phase to permit evaluation of the laboratory
      and ECG assessments and to confirm eligibility for inclusion into the study. This screening
      phase will be a minimum of 7 days, but no longer than 21 days. At the completion of the
      screening period, eligible subjects will be randomized at the baseline visit to receive
      either orvepitant 60mg/day or placebo (1:1 ratio). Those subjects randomized to receive
      placebo will receive study medication identical in appearance to that received by subjects
      assigned to receive orvepitant.

      Efficacy will be assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) as the primary
      efficacy measure. Key secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on the Davidson Trauma Scale
      (DTS), the Short PTSD Rating Interview (SPRINT), the Clinical Global Impression- Global
      Improvement and Severity of Illness Scales (CGI-I and CGI-S, respectively), the Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ)
      and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

      Safety will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events (side effects) and through periodic
      laboratory evaluations (blood tests), vital signs assessments (e.g., blood pressure, heart
      rate, temperature) and heart function measurements (electrocardiograms, or ECGs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to test the safety and effects of orvepitant, an
      investigational drug for the treatment of noncombat-related PTSD.

      Efficacy will be assessed using standard symptom and severity rating scales (questionnaires).
      The Clinicain Adminstered PTSD Scale (CAPS) will serve as the primary measure of efficacy.
      Secondary efficacy endpoints include the CAPS subscale clusters (Re-Experiencing, Avoidance
      and Numbing, and Hyperarousal), the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the Short PTSD Rating
      Interview (SPRINT), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Clinical Global
      Impression- Global Improvement and Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-I and CGI-S, respectively),
      the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index (PSQI).

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs or side effects),
      physical examinations (including vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate), clinical
      laboratory assessments (blood tests), electrical recordings of the heart (electrocardiograms
      or ECG's), the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS), Massachusetts Sexual
      Function Questionnaire (MSFQ), Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) scale and
      weight change.

      Blood samples will be taken at different time points to assess blood levels of orvepitant in
      patients, allowing the relationship between amount of orvepitant in the body and efficacy to
      be studied.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of orvepitant (60mg/day)
      versus placebo (a &quot;sugar pill&quot;, with no active ingredients). The secondary objectives include
      assessing the safety and tolerability of orvepitant, assessing the profile of appearance and
      disappearance of orvepitant in the body (blood) following administration (i.e., assessing how
      long the drug remains in the body), and lastly to examine the relationship between blood
      levels of the drug and efficacy (i..e, the change in CAPS score relative to what it was
      before starting the study medication).

      Following an initial screening visit, subjects fulfilling the study entrance criteria will
      enter a pre-treatment screening phase to permit evaluation of the laboratory and
      electrocardiogram assessments and to confirm eligibility for inclusion into the study. This
      screening phase will be a minimum of 7 days, but no longer than 21 days. Upon completion of
      the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned at the baseline visit to
      one of two treatment regimens: orvepitant 60mg/day or placebo for a 12-week treatment phase.
      The chances of receiving each of the two possible treatments will be equal. Orvepitant will
      be administered as tablets. Those subjects randomised to receive placebo will receive study
      medication identical in appearance to that received by subjects assigned to receive
      orvepitant.

      During the treatment phase, subjects will be required to return to the clinic at the end of
      Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. In addition, all subjects will be required to return for a
      follow-up visit 14 days after the last dose of study medication. In addition, all subjects
      with ongoing adverse events at the 14-day follow-up visit will be required to return for a
      further follow-up visit 28 days after the last dose of study medication. Women of
      child-bearing potential will also be required to attend the 28-Day follow-up visit for a
      pregnancy test. A further test will be performed 42 Days following the end of treatment.

      Male and female outpatients between the ages of 18 to 64 years inclusive with a primary
      diagnosis of noncombat-related PTSD will be enrolled into this study. A total of
      approximately 240 subjects are expected to be enrolled at approximately 25 different study
      sites in North America.

    <description>The PSQI was a self-rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and disturbances. Individual items (19) generate 7-component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction. The global score generated by addition of individual score excluding use of sleeping medication component. It contains 15 objective (about frequency of sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality) and 4 subjective (typical bedtime, wake-up time, sleep latency and sleep duration) items with score range from 0: no to 3: severe difficulty. The PSQI Global Score ranges from 0 to 21 and a global score &gt; 5 was suggestive of significant sleep disturbance. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MSFQ was derived from the Guided Interview Questionnaire for males and from the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale. The questionnaire includes five items with a score ranging from 1-6 (1: greater than normal; 2: normal; 3: minimally diminished; 4: moderately diminished; 5: markedly diminished and 6: totally absent with total score 5-30; higher score indicating more dysfunction). The areas of sexual functioning included were total score and erectile dysfunction (males only). A total score was used as a global measure of sexual dysfunction. A follow-up version of the questionnaire includes an additional sixth item of the participant's global impression of improvement, with a score ranging from 1 to 6. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS used to assess severity and change of suicidality by integrating both behavior and ideation and to be completed by the participants. The SSRS track change in the severity/density of suicidality. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions; rated on 1-5 point scale, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. If the answers to the first 2 ideation questions were &quot;yes,&quot; the clinician asked questions 3-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were &quot;no,&quot; then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt and preparatory acts or behaviors. Participants analyzed were number of participants with at least one C-SSRS assessment after the first dose of study medication (that is on treatment or post treatment).</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS used to assess severity and change of suicidality by integrating both behavior and ideation and to be completed by the participants. The SSRS track change in the severity/density of suicidality. It assessed intensity of ideation (a potentially important marker of severity), specifically asking about frequency, duration, intrusiveness, controllability, and deterrents. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions; rated on 1-5 point scale, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The clinician asked 5 questions: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation without intent to act, active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act and active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent. Participants analyzed were number of participants with at least one C-SSRS assessment after the first dose of study medication (that is on treatment or post treatment).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 17-item Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS) Total Severity Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The CAPS was a 30-item clinical interview. Both frequency (0: never; 4: daily or all the time) and intensity (0: none or no problem with symptoms; 4: extreme, incapacitating) ratings were made on a 5-point scale. The CAPS total severity score was based on the 17 items that assess the frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms. There were 8 items assessing associated features (guilt, hopelessness, memory impairment, overall response validity, global PTSD severity, global improvement and social and occupational impairment). The total score 0-136, higher scores means more severity, &lt; 20: few symptoms or being asymptomatic, 20-39: mild or subthreshold PTSD, 40-59: threshold and moderate PTSD, 60-79: severe PTSD symptoms and &gt; 80: extreme PTSD symptoms. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>The Time to (Maintained) Clinical Response in Each Participants</title>
        <description>The CAPS was a 30-item clinical interview. Both frequency (0: never; 4: daily or all the time) and intensity (0: none or no problem with symptoms; 4: extreme, incapacitating) ratings were made on a 5-point scale. The CAPS total severity score was based on the 17 items that assess the frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms. There were 8 items assessing associated features (guilt, hopelessness, memory impairment, overall response validity, global PTSD severity, global improvement and social and occupational impairment). The total score 0-136, higher scores means more severity, &lt; 20: few symptoms or being asymptomatic, 20-39: mild or subthreshold PTSD, 40-59: threshold and moderate PTSD, 60-79: severe PTSD symptoms and &gt; 80: extreme PTSD symptoms. The time required to maintain CAPS response has been summarized.</description>

        <description>The CAPS was a 30-item clinical interview. Both frequency (0: never; 4: daily or all the time) and intensity (0: none or no problem with symptoms; 4: extreme, incapacitating) ratings were made on a 5-point scale. The CAPS total severity score was based on the 17 items that assess the frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms. There were 8 items assessing associated features (guilt, hopelessness, memory impairment, overall response validity, global PTSD severity, global improvement and social and occupational impairment). The total score 0-136, higher scores means more severity, &lt; 20: few symptoms or being asymptomatic, 20-39: mild or subthreshold PTSD, 40-59: threshold and moderate PTSD, 60-79: severe PTSD symptoms and &gt; 80: extreme PTSD symptoms. Remitter defined as a participants who has a CAPS total score &lt;20. Percentage of participants were calculated by total number of responders divided by number of participants assessed multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>The CAPS was a 30-item clinical interview. Both frequency (0: never; 4: daily or all the time) and intensity (0: none or no problem with symptoms; 4: extreme, incapacitating) ratings were made on a 5-point scale. The CAPS assessed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for PTSD, including criteria B-D (core symptom clusters of re-experiencing). The re-experiencing subscale cluster score was derived from the CAPS. The possible range was 5 to 25 with lower score indicates less severe symptoms and with a greater score indicating greater PTSD symptom severity. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the CAPS Avoidance/Numbing (A/N) Subscale Cluster Score at Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12</title>
        <description>The CAPS was a 30-item clinical interview. Both frequency (0: never; 4: daily or all the time) and intensity (0: none or no problem with symptoms; 4: extreme, incapacitating) ratings were made on a 5-point scale. The CAPS assessed DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD, including criteria B-D (core symptom clusters of A/N). The re-experiencing subscale cluster score was derived from the CAPS. The possible range is 7 to 35 with lower score indicates less severe symptoms and with a greater score indicating greater PTSD symptom severity. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Responding, Based on a Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement (CGI-I) Score of 1 or 2, by Visit Week</title>
        <description>The global improvement items were rated on a 1-7 scale with 0 means not assessed (1: very much improved, 2: much improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: much worse, 7: very much worse). For the global improvement item, the clinician indicated their assessment of the participant’s total improvement or worsening compared with that individual's condition at the start of the study (the Baseline visit) whether or not the change was judged to be due to drug treatment. Responder was defined as a participant who had a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 (‘very much improved’ or ‘much improved’). It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Percentage of participants were calculated by total number of responders divided by number of participants assessed multiplied by 100.</description>

For the severity of illness item, the clinician indicated his/her assessment of the participant severity of illness considering their total clinical experience with the particular population being studied. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short PTSD Rating Review (SPRINT), by Visit Week</title>
        <description>The SPRINT consists of 8 items that assess the core symptoms of PTSD, as well as related aspects of somatic malaise, stress vulnerability and functional impairment. Each item was rated on a 5 point scale (0: not at all, 1: a little bit, 2: moderately, 3: quiet a lot and 4: very much), total score 0-32; with higher scores means more severity. Also, it provided the information about how the participant feeling (as a percentage) and symptoms improved since beginning of treatment (rated on a 5 point scale [0: worse, 1: a no change, 2: minimally, 3: much and 4: very much]). The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Self-rated Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), by Visit Week</title>
        <description>This instrument consists of 17 items which parallel the DSM criteria for PTSD. Both frequency (0: never; 4: daily or all the time) and intensity (0: none or no problem with symptoms; 4: extreme, incapacitating) rated using 5-point scale. There were 8 items assessing associated features (guilt, hopelessness, memory impairment, overall response validity, global PTSD severity, global improvement and social and occupational impairment). The DTS cluster includes intrusion (items 1-4, 17 [score 0-40]), avoidance/numbing (A/N; items 5-11 [score 0-56]) and hyperarousal (items 12-16 [score 0-40]). The total score (0-136) was added, lower score indicates less symptoms and higher scores means more severity, &lt;20: few symptoms or being asymptomatic, 20-39: mild or subthreshold PTSD, 40-59: threshold and moderate PTSD, 60-79: severe PTSD symptoms and &gt; 80: extreme PTSD symptoms. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the DTS Cluster Sub Score</title>
        <description>This instrument consists of 17 items which parallel the DSM criteria for PTSD. Both frequency (0: never; 4: daily or all the time) and intensity (0: none or no problem; 4: extreme, incapacitating) rated using 5-point scale and added to get total score. There were 8 items including guilt, hopelessness, memory impairment, overall response validity, global PTSD severity, global improvement and social and occupational impairment. The DTS cluster includes intrusion (items 1-4, 17 [score 0-40]), A/N (items 5-11 [score 0-56]) and hyperarousal (items 12-16 [score 0-40]) with lower score indicates less symptoms and higher scores means more severity, &lt;20: few symptoms or being asymptomatic, 20-39: mild or subthreshold PTSD, 40-59: threshold and moderate PTSD, 60-79: severe PTSD symptoms and &gt;80: extreme PTSD symptoms. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Global Score, by Visit Week</title>
        <description>The PSQI was a self-rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and disturbances. Individual items (19) generate 7-component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction. The global score generated by addition of individual score excluding use of sleeping medication component. It contains 15 objective (about frequency of sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality) and 4 subjective (typical bedtime, wake-up time, sleep latency and sleep duration) items with score range from 0: no to 3: severe difficulty. The PSQI Global Score ranges from 0 to 21 and a global score &gt; 5 was suggestive of significant sleep disturbance. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the PSQI Addendum for PTSD (PSQI-A) Global Score, by Visit Week</title>
        <description>The PSQI-A was self-report instrument to assess disruptive nocturnal behavior (DNB) in PTSD participants with 7 types of DNB. These items include frequency of 1: hot flashes, 2: general nervousness, 3: memories or nightmares of traumatic experience, 4: severe anxiety or panic, not related to traumatic memories, 5: bad dreams, not related to traumatic memories, 6: episodes of terror or screaming during sleep without fully awakening and 7: episodes of acting out dreams, such as kicking, punching, running, or screaming. Each item was rated on a scale (0: not in the past month, 1: less than once a week, 2: once or twice a week and 3: three or more times a week) with global score range of 0-21. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the CAPS Recurrent Distressing Dreams Item (B2) at Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12</title>
        <description>The B2 asked participant about ‘Have you ever had unpleasant dreams about the event(s)? How often in the past month?’ Both frequency (0: never; 4: daily or all the time) and ‘at their worst, how much distress or discomfort did these dreams cause you? Did these dreams wake you up? [If yes, ask:] What were you feeling or doing when you awoke? How long does it usually take to get back to sleep? [Listen for report of panic symptoms, yelling, posturing] intensity (0: none or no problem with symptoms; 4: extreme, incapacitating) ratings were made on a 5-point scale. The total score 0-8, higher scores means more severity. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), by Visit Week</title>
        <description>The HAM-D was observer-rated depressive symptom rating scale to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in participants with primary depressive illness. The items were ranked on a scale of 0-4 (0: absent; 4: greatest severity) or 0-2 (0: no difficulty; 2: difficulty falling asleep). In addition to the total score (0-66; with higher score indicates more depression), the HAM-D anxiety factor score (sum of items 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17) and the melancholia subscore (sum of items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 13) of the 17-item HAM-D scale was analyzed. The melancholia subscale was derived from three formal psychometric criteria (calibration, ascending monotonicity and dispersion). It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Cognitive and Physical Function Questionnaire (CPFQ) Total Score, by Visit Week</title>
        <description>The Massachusetts CPFQ was a brief self-report scale to measure cognitive and executive dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders. The CPFQ comprises 7 questions assessing each of the most common complaints of depressed participants reporting fatigue or cognitive/executive problems. Each question was rated on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1: greater than normal, 2: normal, 3: minimally diminished, 4: moderately diminished, 5: markedly diminished and 6: totally absent functioning with total score 7-42; higher score indicating more dysfunction. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Massachusetts Sexual Function Questionnaire (MSFQ) Total Score and Erectile Dysfunction Score in Males</title>
        <description>The MSFQ was derived from the Guided Interview Questionnaire for males and from the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale. The questionnaire includes five items with a score ranging from 1-6 (1: greater than normal; 2: normal; 3: minimally diminished; 4: moderately diminished; 5: markedly diminished and 6: totally absent with total score 5-30; higher score indicating more dysfunction). The areas of sexual functioning included were total score and erectile dysfunction (males only). A total score was used as a global measure of sexual dysfunction. A follow-up version of the questionnaire includes an additional sixth item of the participant’s global impression of improvement, with a score ranging from 1 to 6. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MSFQ Total Score in Females</title>
        <description>The MSFQ was derived from the Guided Interview Questionnaire for males and from the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale. The questionnaire includes five items with a score ranging from 1-6 (1: greater than normal; 2: normal; 3: minimally diminished; 4: moderately diminished; 5: markedly diminished and 6: totally absent with total score 5-30; higher score indicating more dysfunction). The areas of sexual functioning included were total score used as a global measure of sexual dysfunction. A follow-up version of the questionnaire includes an additional sixth item of the participant’s global impression of improvement, with a score ranging from 1 to 6. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MSFQ Items (Diminished/Absent Libido; Arousal Difficulties; Orgasm Difficulties/Anorgasmia and Degree of Sexual Satisfaction) Scores</title>
        <description>The MSFQ was derived from the Guided Interview Questionnaire for males and from the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale. The questionnaire includes five items with a score ranging from 1-6 (1: greater than normal; 2: normal; 3: minimally diminished; 4: moderately diminished; 5: markedly diminished and 6: totally absent). The areas of sexual functioning included were diminished/absent libido; arousal difficulties; orgasm difficulties/anorgasmia and degree of sexual satisfaction. A follow-up version of the questionnaire includes an additional sixth item of the participant’s global impression of improvement, with a score ranging from 1 to 6. It was assessed at Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline was defined as value on Day 1 (pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Number of Participant With Suicidal Behavior Based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) During and Post Treatment</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS used to assess severity and change of suicidality by integrating both behavior and ideation and to be completed by the participants. The SSRS track change in the severity/density of suicidality. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions; rated on 1-5 point scale, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. If the answers to the first 2 ideation questions were “yes,” the clinician asked questions 3-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were “no,” then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt and preparatory acts or behaviors. Participants analyzed were number of participants with at least one C-SSRS assessment after the first dose of study medication (that is on treatment or post treatment).</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS used to assess severity and change of suicidality by integrating both behavior and ideation and to be completed by the participants. The SSRS track change in the severity/density of suicidality. It assessed intensity of ideation (a potentially important marker of severity), specifically asking about frequency, duration, intrusiveness, controllability, and deterrents. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions; rated on 1-5 point scale, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The clinician asked 5 questions: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation without intent to act, active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act and active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent. Participants analyzed were number of participants with at least one C-SSRS assessment after the first dose of study medication (that is on treatment or post treatment).</description>
