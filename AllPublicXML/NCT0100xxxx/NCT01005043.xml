      The primary objectives of this trial are the determination of feasibility and toxicity of
      Heavy Ion Radiotherapy (C12) in patients with non-resectable osteosarcoma. Secondary
      endpoints are tumor response, disease free survival and overall survival. The aim is to
      improve outcome for patients with non-resectable osteosarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. For
      effective treatment, local control of the tumor is absolutely critical, because the chances
      of long term survival are &lt;10% and might effectively approach zero if a complete surgical
      resection of the tumor is not possible. Up to date there is no curative treatment protocol
      for patients with non-resectable osteosarcomas, who are excluded from current osteosarcoma
      trials , e.g. EURAMOS1. Local photon radiotherapy has previously been used in small series
      and in an uncontrolled, highly individualized fashion, which, however, documented that high
      dose radiotherapy can, in principle, be used to achieve local control. Generally the
      radiation dose that is necessary for a curative approach can hardly be achieved with
      conventional photon radiotherapy in patients with non-resectable tumors that are usually
      located near radiosensitive critical organs such as the brain, the spine or the pelvis. In
      these cases Heavy Ion Radiotherapy (HIT) may offer a promising new alternative. Moreover,
      compared with photons, heavy ion particles provide a higher physical selectivity because of
      their finite depth coverage in tissue. They achieve a higher relative biological
      effectiveness. Phase I/II dose escalation studies of HIT in adults with non-resectable bone
      and soft tissue sarcomas have already shown favorable results.

      Methods/Design: This is a monocenter, non-randomized study for patients older than 6 years of
      age with non-resectable osteosarcoma. Desired target dose is 60-66 Cobalt Gray Equivalent
      (GyE). Weekly fractionation of 6 x 3 Gy E is used. HIT will be administered exclusively at
      the Ion Radiotherapy Center in Heidelberg. Furthermore, FDG-PET imaging characteristics of
      non-resectable osteosarcoma before and after HIT will be investigated prospectively. Systemic
      disease before and after HIT is targeted by standard chemotherapy protocols and is not part
      of this trial.

      The primary objectives of this trial are the determination of feasibility and toxicity of
      HIT. Secondary endpoints are tumor response, disease free survival and overall survival. The
      aim is to improve outcome for patients with non-resectable osteosarcoma.

    <description>Desired target of Heavy ion radiotherapy is 60 to 66 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (GyE), whenever possible. It is applied through 1 - 3 isocenter treatment portals. Dose distributions are calculated and dose volume histograms (DVH) are generated. A α/β-ratio of 2 is used for biological plan optimization. Fractionation is planned to be equivalent to 6 x 3 GyE / week. Dosage to organs at risk is minimized. Treatment continues for 20 to 22 days or until one of the following criteria applies:
Other illness that prevents further administration of treatment, Patient or legal guardian decides to withdraw from the study, or changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of high grade osteosarcoma with or without metastases

          -  Non-resectable tumor of the pelvis, the skull base or the spine, respectively,
             incomplete or intralesional tumor resection - as confirmed after evaluation by two
             orthopedic surgeons (respectively neurosurgeons in case of spine tumors): one local
             surgeon and one referee surgeon of the University of Heidelberg.

          -  Age older than 6 years before start of radiotherapy

          -  Adequate performance status (Karnofsky &gt;60%)

          -  Adequate blood cell production before the start of HIT in patients with pelvic or
             spine tumors as defined by: total white cell count (WBC) &gt;1,0/nl; neutrophils &gt;
             200/µl; platelet count &gt;20/nl

          -  No febrile neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 200/µl)

          -  Written informed consent of the patient or the legal guardians

        Non-resectable tumor site means primary tumors affecting anatomic areas of the human body
        where a surgical total resection (R0) of the tumor is not possible for technical reasons,
        for example osteosarcoma of the pelvis, spine or the skull base. In any other cases,
        surgical resection is recommended.

        Non-resectability has to be confirmed after evaluation by two orthopedic surgeons
        (respectively neurosurgeons in case of spine tumors): one local surgeon and one referee
        surgeon of the University of Heidelberg.

        In some cases surgery of the tumor might be possible after HIT. Then we recommend surgical
        resection of residual tumor afterwards.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age younger than 6 years

          -  Previous radiotherapy of the field that has to be radiated now

          -  Implanted metal within the planned radiation field, that leads to significant
             artefacts within the target volume

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents during the time of HIT

          -  Performance status (Karnofsky) &lt; 60%)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  No written informed consent of patient or the legal guardians
