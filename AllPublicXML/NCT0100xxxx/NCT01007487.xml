      Hypothesis: Plastic wound retractors reduce passage of bacteria from the abdomen to the
      surgical incision site in abdominal surgery

      Currently, plastic wound retractors are used in abdominal surgery to facilitate access to the
      abdominal cavity. This study aims to establish whether they also prevent bacteria crossing
      from the abdominal cavity to the surgical incision site. Patients undergoing abdominal
      surgery in which a plastic wound retractor (Alexis®)is used are eligible for inclusion in the
      study. Swabs are taken from the inside and the outside of the plastic wound retractor prior
      to removing the retractor from the abdomen. The bacterial flora from swabs taken inside and
      outside the plastic wound protector are then compared to see if there is any difference
      between inside and outside the retractor. Bacteria are classified as 'enteric'(i.e. from the
      gastrointestinal tract) or 'skin' bacteria, depending on their usual location. The study aims
      to establish whether a plastic wound retractor (Alexis®) reduces translocation of enteric
      bacteria to the surgical incision site.

      Plastic wound retractors are currently used in abdominal surgery for wound retraction. They
      allow access to intra-abdominal organs through an incision in abdominal surgery. Plastic
      wound retractors may also act as a barrier to bacterial translocation from the abdominal
      cavity to the wound. The purpose of this study was to compare microbial flora from inside and
      outside the plastic wound retractor to establish whether plastic wound retractors affect
      bacterial translocation.

      METHODS This multi-centre prospective observational study is being conducted between November
      2007 and January 2010. Patients undergoing elective or emergency abdominal surgery in which
      an Alexis® wound retractor is used are eligible for inclusion in the study. Swabs are taken
      from inside and outside the Alexis® wound protector immediately prior to removal of the wound
      protector from the abdominal cavity. Swabs undergo gram stain and culture. &quot;Inside&quot; the wound
      swab is defined as the part of the wound protector in contact with the intra-abdominal
      organs, &quot;outside&quot; is the part in contact with the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Results from
      inside and outside swabs are then compared to establish whether there is a difference in
      bacterial flora. The study aims to establish whether a plastic wound retractor (Alexis®)
      reduces translocation of enteric bacteria to the surgical incision site.
