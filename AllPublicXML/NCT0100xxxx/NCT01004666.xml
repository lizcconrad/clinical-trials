    <textblock>
      Detection of breast cancer as early as possible is an ongoing imaging challenge.The purpose
      of the current study is to assess the clinical performance of the new scintigraphic
      technology, a dedicated breast gamma camera composed by the new generation of CZT
      detectors,for assessment of breast pathology specifically in women where current imaging
      techniques, mainly mammography are suboptimal. These cohort are patients with dense breast
      tissue and patients who are at high risk for breast cancer by a combination of other metrics,
      including family history and genetic testing. BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility gene), is
      particularly a relevant health problem among Ashkenazi Jews in Israel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a breast-dedicated gamma camera has been used for assessment of breast malignancy
      in over 1000 women in Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA. Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI), which
      utilizes a Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) gamma camera for scintimammography, has been shown to
      have a high sensitivity (91%) for the detection of breast lesions &gt; 5 mm in diameter and 69%
      for tumors smaller than 5mm.

      In Israel , genetic high- risk for breast cancer is highly relevant. We will offer the new
      imaging technology, to a wide patients population/group from all over Israel , in which the
      referring physician and/or the breast-imaging physician will look for additional imaging
      modality. Therefore this stage will include:

        -  Women with equivocal findings on Mammography, US and/or MRI

        -  Women with discrepancy between CBE(clinical breast examination)and breast imaging

        -  Women with dense breast

        -  Women in high risk for Breast Cancer

      Before the imaging procedure each woman will need to fill detailed questionnaire, specific
      for the study, that will include information on her medical history, family history,
      gynecology information, menstrual phase, use of hormones etc.

      The images will be correlated with other imaging tests including mammography, US and MRI. We
      will follow up the women for at least 6 months, including biopsy findings and or other
      clinical and imaging exams.

      This phase will include 500 women.
