  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The past 10 years of research in persons more than 6 months post stroke have shown certain
      types of rehabilitation can help &quot;re-wire&quot; the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      can be used to monitor this re-wiring by mapping the brain's function (measuring brain
      activity). Recent research suggests that TMS can be used for both prognosis (determining
      future function) and to determine what type of rehabilitation therapy will work best after
      stroke. The purposes of this research study are to: 1) determine changes in brain activity
      during the first 6 months after stroke (to determine how the brain &quot;re-wires&quot;); 2) compare
      changes in recovery of motor function with changes in brain re-wiring; 3) determine the
      ability of TMS to &quot;predict&quot; functional outcome in the first 6 months after stroke.

      The primary hypotheses are: 1) functional recovery will be correlated with TMS changes (as
      measure motor threshold (MT), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and recruitment curves; 2)
      baseline TMS will predict future functional outcomes at 3 and 6 months.
