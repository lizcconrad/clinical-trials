  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to assess the effects of habitual dietary protein intakes
      across the acceptable macronutrient distribution range with lean beef/pork or soy/legumes as
      the predominate sources of protein on indices of daily appetite and mood, and on postprandial
      appetite, mood, energy expenditure, and glycemic responses during energy-restricted weight
      loss in overweight adults.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Increasing protein intake from lean beef/pork or soy/legumes sources will result in progressively decreased daily composite hunger and desire to eat, and increased fullness. The responses will not be different between groups of subjects.</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increasing the protein content of a test will result in progressively more robust and sustained changes in postprandial appetite and energy expenditure and blunted glycemic response. The responses will not be different between the groups of participants.</measure>
