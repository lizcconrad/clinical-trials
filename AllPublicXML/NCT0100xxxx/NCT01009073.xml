      This is a three arm study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-263 when
      administered in combination with erlotinib (Arm A), to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of ABT-263 when administered in combination with irinotecan (Arm B), and to evaluate
      safety of ABT-263 monotherapy (Arm C).

             any dose) or any drugs or herbal supplements that affect platelet function, with the
             exception of low-dose anticoagulation medications such as heparin that are used to
             maintain the patency of a catheter.

          -  Subject has received aspirin or warfarin within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug.

          -  Subject has consumed grapefruit or grapefruit products within 3 days prior to the

             dose of study drug.

          -  Received ABT-263 within 3 days prior to the first dose of study drug (not applicable
             to ABT-263 monotherapy).

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is an unsuitable candidate to receive
             ABT 263.

          -  Subject has received rifampin within 4 days prior to first dose of study drug in Arm A
             (ABT-263 and erlotinib) or Arm C (ABT-263 Monotherapy) and within 7 days prior to
             first dose of study drug in Arm B (ABT-263 and irinotecan).
