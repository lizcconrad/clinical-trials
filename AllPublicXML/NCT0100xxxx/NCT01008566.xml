    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cixutumumab when given
      together with sorafenib tosylate in treating patients with advanced liver cancer. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as cixutumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cixutumumab together with
      sorafenib tosylate may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMC-A12 given in conjunction with
      standard doses of sorafenib to patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      II. To describe the toxicity and tolerance of IMC-A12 at each dose studied in combination
      with standard-dose sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC.

      III. To evaluate the impact of IMC-A12 on biomarkers related to the IGF-1R/IGF pathway which
      is thought relevant to HCC progression and drug resistance.

      IV. To obtain preliminary assessments of efficacy through description of progression-free
      survival (PFS) and objective response rate (RR).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of cixutumumab followed by an extended
      accrual phase in which patients are treated at the maximum-tolerated dose.

      Patients receive cixutumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral sorafenib
      tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
