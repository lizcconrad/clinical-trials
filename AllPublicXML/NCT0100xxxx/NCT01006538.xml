    <textblock>
      Wet age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blind registration in the
      UK. Standard treatment involves regular eye injections of a drug called ranibizumab
      (Lucentis). For most patients, ranibizumab maintains their vision but the effect of the drug
      is temporary, and they therefore require monthly hospital visits and typically six injections
      into the eye every year, probably for life.

      This study tests a new surgical device that delivers a focal dose of radiation (epimacular
      brachytherapy) to the macula (the part inside the back of the eye that gives fine central
      vision), to try and reduce or eliminate the need for ongoing, regular eye injections. The
      trial compares epimacular brachytherapy to ongoing standard treatment with ranibizumab.

      Whereas most studies of this new surgical device target patients who have not yet commenced
      any treatment, this study targets those who are requiring frequent eye injections, as there
      are limited surgical resources and these resources are best directed to those who have not
      fully responded to ranibizumab therapy, or whose response is shortlived. These patients have
      the most to gain from a device that may reduce their burden of treatment. The findings in
      untreated disease cannot be extrapolated to this discrete subset of patients, hence the need
      for a study that targets refractory disease.

      It is hypothesised that epimacular brachytherapy will reduce the frequency of Lucentis®
      (ranibizumab) re-treatment that patients require, whilst maintaining visual acuity.

      The eye is designed like a camera, with a lens at the front and a film at the back. Using
      this analogy, the retina is the film in the camera. In the center of the retina is the
      macula, the region that absorbs focused light from the lens and creates an image of the
      outside world that is then transmitted to the brain.

      The commonest cause of irreversible blindness in developed nations is age related macular
      degeneration (AMD). There are two types, 'dry' and 'wet' AMD. Wet AMD is also called
      neovascular AMD: It is the most damaging type and can blind people in a matter of weeks.
      Neovascular AMD is due to the growth of blood vessels under the retina, similar to a wound
      healing process. The blood vessels grow in two patterns, classic (15%) and occult (85%);
      these can be visualized with fluorescein angiography, a commonly used technique that
      photographs the macula after a fluorescent dye is injected into the arm. In most research on
      AMD, vision is assessed using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
      vision chart, with results quantified in numbers of letters read correctly, from 0 (very poor
      vision) to 100 (very good vision).

      A new treatment has recently been licensed in the UK called ranibizumab (trade name,
      Lucentis). This is an antibody that reduces the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF), a chemical that mediates new blood vessel growth. This drug is injected into the eye
      at regular intervals (up to 12 a year, and typically 6 a year). Patients receiving 12
      ranibizumab injections per year have a greater than 90% chance of maintaining their vision
      over 12 months (1-2). Another drug called bevacizumab (Avastin) has been used off label
      (without a licence) in the UK, USA and other countries, and this also targets VEGF. In
      non−randomized trials it showed similar results to ranibizumab, and is currently being
      assessed in head−to−head trials with ranibizumab in the UK and the USA.

      One of the drawbacks of ranibizumab therapy is that patients require regular injections into
      the eye. In the UK, NICE recommends patient with newly diagnosed wet AMD receive three
      consecutive monthly injections of ranibizumab, followed by 'as required' therapy based on
      disease activity. They estimate that patients receive eight injections in the first year, six
      in the second, and ongoing treatment thereafter. Patients require monthly hospital visits for
      life and each injection caries a small but cumulative risk of complications such as bleeding
      inside the eye, infection, detachment of the retina, raised eye pressure, and systemic
      effects such as stroke. A treatment that produced a more durable reduction in disease
      activity might reduce these risks, be more cost effective for the health service, and reduce
      the considerable burden of treatment for patients and their carers, with the prospect of
      fewer hospital visits. It would also give patients an alternative choice, should they not
      wish to undergo such regular eye injections.

      Radiation has the potential to produce a more durable therapeutic effect, by targeting the
      proliferating cells that cause visual damage in wet AMD. It is well known that radiation can
      modify the wound healing process, which is a biological process similar to neovascular AMD.
      Previous studies with external beam radiation have shown an effect on the progression of
      macular degeneration. However vision was not improved - possibly due to the type of radiation
      used, the accuracy of delivery, and collateral damage to neighbouring structures.

      Epimacular brachytherapy delivers local, controlled radiation 1−3 mm into the macula, during
      an operation called a vitrectomy. The proposed device will be CE marked (approved for
      clinical use) and is manufactured by NeoVista, who have completed preliminary trials to
      assess the safety and feasibility of treating naive (newly diagnosed) neovascular AMD with a
      single application of brachytherapy. Initial data showed that epiretinal treatment stabilised
      vision for most patients with neovascular AMD. Phase II trials using the device with two
      concomitant doses of bevacizumab showed promising results with 91% of patients maintaining
      vision (losing fewer than 15 ETDRS letters), with an average improvement of 8.9 ETDRS letters
      (3). The percentage of patients whose visual acuity improved by more than 3 lines (15 letters
      on the ETDRS scale) was 38%. These results are similar to the large studies of monthly
      ranibizumab. A mean gain of 8.9 letters is more than twice the visual gain reported in large
      studies (HORIZON) of 'as required' dosing, as occurs in the UK.

      A large, international, randomized, multicentre study of the device, used with two
      concomitant injections of ranibizumab, is now underway (the CABERNET study). Recruitment is
      occuring in the hospital of the applicant, and two other UK sites, with more sites to follow.
      The CABERNET study uses the device in treatment naive disease and was favourably reviewed by
      the Southwest Research Ethics Committee (07/H0206/50).

      Whilst the CABERNET study will provide high quality data in treatment naive disease, it is
      not possible to rely on this study in relation to previously treated disease. Prior therapy
      with ranibizumab modifies the disease process, and those that respond poorly to injections
      differ from the majority, suggesting differences in the underlying disease process. It is
      therefore necessary to study the subset of patients with refractory disease, if valid
      clinical conclusions are to be reached. Furthermore, because there is limited vitreoretinal
      surgical capacity it is logical to offer surgical intervention to patients who have not
      responded fully to ranibizumab, rather than aim to treat all patients presenting with
      wet-AMD. To this end, an uncontrolled study (MERITAGE) using the device in refractory,
      previously treated disease has commenced, having received a favourable opinion from the
      Southwest Research Ethics Committee (07/H0206/55). The present randomised controlled trial
      (MERLOT) follows on from the Phase II MERITAGE study. It targets previously treated disease,
      and patients that are receiving regular ranibizumab, to determine if the device benefits this
      large subset of patients.
