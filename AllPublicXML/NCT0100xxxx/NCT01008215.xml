      Can a simple and cost-free tool help family physicians to improve dosing of the blood thinner
      warfarin?

      Warfarin is a blood thinner with a variable effect and requires regular blood monitoring and
      dose adjustments. Some family practices do not have the facilities or funding to use
      commercial tools than can assist with stabilizing the effect of warfarin. The investigators
      will test whether a simple and cost-free dosing tool can help these practices to improve
      warfarin management.

      If this simple tool improves warfarin management, it will be freely available for practices
      in Canada and around the world. This will help physicians who have no access to more costly
      and/or complicated tools improve their warfarin dosing practice in a systematic fashion, and
      thereby maximize the health benefit of warfarin.

    <textblock>
      Warfarin reduces the risk of thromboembolism, but requires regular blood monitoring to keep
      the international normalized ration (INR) within a narrow therapeutic range to achieve
      maximum benefits. A low proportion of time spent within the therapeutic INR range, (TTR) is
      associated with reduced warfarin efficacy and potentially harmful results. To optimize TTR,
      international guidelines recommend the use of systematic evidence-based dosing methods
      (anticoagulation clinic, computerized systems, manual algorithm and patient self-management).
      A survey in the Hamilton area revealed that half of family physicians manage warfarin dosing
      without assistance from an evidence-based method. The simple manual dosing algorithm is a
      simple tool that helped increase the TTR at the Hamilton General Hospital's anticoagulant
      clinic to an excellent 73% among patients with target INR range 2-3. We will test whether the
      simple dosing algorithm can help to improve warfarin dosing of family physicians who are not
      assisted by evidence-based methods. We will randomize family practices to either use the
      simple dosing algorithm or to manage warfarin dosing as usual, to test whether the simple
      dosing algorithm achieves a superior TTR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Family practices that:

               1. currently do not employ an evidence-based dosing method (anticoagulant clinic,
                  computer system, manual algorithm or patient self-testing),

               2. manage warfarin maintenance dosing in at least 10 patients with target INR 2-3,
                  and

               3. have at least one family physician providing written informed consent.

          -  Patients who:

               1. are on long-term warfarin treatment (&gt; 6 weeks before study entry and expected to
                  continue for at least 6 more months) with target INR 2-3, for whom warfarin is
                  managed by a participating family physician,

               2. patient provides written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Family practices that:

               1. are planning to start employing an evidence-based method for warfarin dosing
                  within the next year,

               2. are not expected to enroll at least 10 patients on long-term warfarin treatment
                  with target INR 2-3.

          -  Patients:

               1. with &lt; 3 months warfarin management prior to the baseline observation,

               2. patients on warfarin with a target INR other than 2-3, and

               3. patients for whom warfarin is managed by a physician who is not participating in
                  the trial.
