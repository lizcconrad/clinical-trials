      Biopsies of the outer thigh muscle and serum samples will be collected from untreated healthy
      subjects. These biological samples will be provided to the Diabetes Research Unit
      Translational Biomarker Laboratory for use in developing and validating human muscle malonyl
      CoA and serum malonate biomarker assays.

      This non-drug method study was terminated on November 19, 2009. The decision to terminate was
      based on safety concerns (biopsy-related pain) observed in the first set of subjects. Four
      subjects were give a sample and did not tolerate it well. No data was collected to report.

    <description>Collection of muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis will be performed by a consulting specialist. The first muscle biopsy (Day 1, 2 hour) will be obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of the non-dominant leg. The second biopsy (Day 1, 4 hour) will be obtained from the same vastus lateralis muscle on the same leg approximately 10 centimeters from the first muscle biopsy site.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Female subjects will be of
             non-childbearing potential.

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject or a legally acceptable
             representative.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic,
             allergic, (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal
             allergies at time of dosing), muscle disease, diabetes, or severe uncontrolled
             hypertension.

          -  Any significant bleeding diathesis which could preclude recovery from the biopsy
             procedure. ASA, ibuprofen, and any other oral anti platelet agent should be
             discontinued at least 7 days prior to procedure.

          -  Prothrombin time (PT)/INR and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) above
             the respective local laboratory normal ranges.

          -  Abnormal CK as per CRU laboratory ranges.

          -  Subjects with either a medical history of or physical evidence of keloid scar
             formation upon physical examination.

          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating a clinically significant abnormality.

          -  Females of child bearing potential, pregnant or nursing females or females less than 6
             months postpartum from the scheduled date of collection.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to lidocaine or any component of the study procedure.

          -  Participation in non-routine rigorous exercise (eg, road races, heavy lifting, etc.)
             within one week prior to the muscle biopsy procedures.

          -  Professional athletes.
