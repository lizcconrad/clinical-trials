  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the use of a new FDA-approved non-invasive
      bio-impedance cardiac monitor, ICON, to detect hemodynamic effects during sedation in
      children undergoing radiology procedures. The purpose of the study is to determine the
      ability of the ICON monitor to identify the anticipated and documented hemodynamic changes in
      children which occur in response to Dexmedetomidine sedation. The investigators postulate
      that if the ICON device can trend hemodynamic changes, if any, during dexmedetomidine (DEX)
      sedation in children the investigators can delineate changes in cardiac output, stroke
      volume, and systemic vascular resistance associated with observed changes in heart rate and
      blood pressure.
