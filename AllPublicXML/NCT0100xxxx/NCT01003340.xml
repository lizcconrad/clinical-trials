  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that a home-based asthma intervention, the
      Wee Wheezers program, delivered by the Community Health Workers and tailored to the needs of
      the investigators community, will improve anti-inflammatory medication adherence, parental
      asthma knowledge and management behaviors, which in turn will reduce asthma morbidity
      (defined as days with asthma symptoms) and health care utilization (defined as asthma-related
      Emergency Department visits) among low-income, minority children with persistent asthma in
      the Bronx.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma disproportionately burdens low-income inner city and minority children residing in
      inner cities. Daily use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) control symptoms and reduce asthma
      morbidity. Less then 50% of children with persistent asthma adhere to such therapy. Poor
      adherence to ICS medications is one of the major contributors to asthma morbidity. One way to
      reduce asthma disparities is to work in partnership with communities. Community Health
      Workers (CHWs) share the ethnic, cultural, social, and environmental experiences of the
      people in the community. Although, CHW home interventions have been successful in reducing
      asthma allergens, no studies using CHWs to deliver a previously identified evidence-based
      home intervention to improve ICS adherence and health outcomes in a population of inner-city,
      minority children with persistent asthma have been found. Objective: To evaluate the
      effectiveness of an evidence-based asthma home intervention, the Wee Wheezers program,
      tailored to the needs of the community and delivered by CHWs, in improving medication
      adherence, health outcomes and parental management behaviors among low-income, minority
      children with persistent asthma in the Bronx.
