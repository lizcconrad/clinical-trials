  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The original Joint Outcome Study (JOS) enrolled 65 boys with hemophilia from 16 sites
      nationally. The subjects were randomized to one of two arms (prophylaxis or an enhanced
      episode-based treatment)and were followed prospectively until the age of six. At the age of
      six, the proportion of children on each treatment arm who developed bone or cartilage damage
      as determined by X-Ray or MRI was assessed. In addition, the function and structure of the
      index joints (defined as knees, ankles, and elbows)were evaluated using a physical assessment
      scale specially designed for preschool children.

      The specific aim of the Joint Outcome Study Continuation (JOSC) is to extend observations of
      the children participating in the original JOS until the subjects reach the age of 18 years
      in order to determine the natural history of joint development in hemophilia and the impact
      of primary or secondary prophylaxis on the prevention, limitation, or reversal of hemophilic
      arthropathy. In addition, plasma and DNA will be collected and banked yearly for current and
      future studies of biomarkers and predictors of hemophilia outcomes.
