  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a non-invasive peristaltic pulse
      pneumatic device (PCD) in the treatment of intermittent claudication in patients having
      documented peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pneumatic device to be studied is FDA
      approved for the treatment of venous disease. While anecdotal evidence exists supporting a
      decrease in claudication symptoms, there are no previously published data on studies
      employing this compression device in the treatment of arterial disease. The investigators'
      primary hypothesis is that patients randomized to the intervention arm of the trial will
      experience an increase in mean walking ability as compared to the group receiving medical
      standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common disorder, affecting 12% of adults older than 50
      years of age. Approximately one third of these patients experience intermittent claudication,
      defined as pain in the thigh or calf muscles during walking and that resolves with rest.
      Lower extremity pain is often severe enough to significantly limit ambulation, forcing many
      patients to seek medical care. Current treatments include two FDA-approved medications,
      supervised walking programs, arterial angioplasty and/or stent placement, and open arterial
      bypass surgery. The problem is that noninvasive treatments are oftentimes ineffective, while
      invasive treatments are effective but expensive.

      A non-invasive lower extremity treatment that has shown success in treating lymphedema and
      venous insufficiency will be studied during this protocol to assess its effects on
      claudication symptoms. Half of the participants in this prospective, single-center randomized
      controlled trial will be treated with a pneumatic compression device in a home treatment
      program, while half will receive standard medical therapy. If effective, potential benefits
      are high, providing relief of personal disability and avoidance of costly surgical
      intervention.
