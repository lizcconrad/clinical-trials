  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase.
      Higher response rates were observed in a subset of patients with female gender, Asian
      ethnicity, no smoking history, mutations in EGFR tyrosine kinase, high EGFR gene copy number
      and adenocarcinoma histology. However, the therapeutic effect of Erlotinib is not confined to
      patients whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations and other predictors of efficacy of this agent.
      And these tests require time and sufficiently large specimens for processing, whereas many
      patients with advanced NSCLC are diagnosed based on cytology alone.

      This study was designed to evaluate FLT-PET or FDG-PET usefulness in the early assessment of
      treatment response and in predicting patient outcome after erlotinib monotherapy for patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer prospectively. Changes in tumor FLT or FDG uptake 7 days
      after the initiation of treatment will be compared between responders and nonresponders based
      on subsequent CT scans.

      1. Primary objectives:

           To see whether the % change in SUVmax of a tumor with FLT-PET or FDG-PET at 7 days after
           initiating erlotinib treatment compared with baseline SUVmax (ΔSUVmax) would predict the
           tumor's responsiveness. And the responsiveness will be decided with the CT scan after 6
           weeks of erlotinib treatment.

        2. Secondary objectives:

      To compare ΔSUVmax and the degree of tumor shrinkage in longest diameter during erlotinib
      treatment.

      To see ΔSUVmax in the tumors with stable disease. To see the time to progression and overall
      survival according to ΔSUVmax. To compare the result of FDG-PET and FLT-PET.

             Patients must have recovered to NCI CTCAE v3.0 grade I from all toxicities. But 1st
             line erlotinib treatment is also allowed.

          -  At least 1 week since the last radiotherapy. Patients must have recovered from all
             acute toxicities from radiotherapy.

          -  Patients must have adequate hematologic, renal and liver function as defined by Hb &gt;
             9g/dL, neutrophils &gt; 1000/mm3, platelets &gt; 50,000/mm3, creatinine &lt; 2mg/dL, and AST
             (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) &lt; 5 x UNL (upper normal limit).

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests and other study procedures.

          -  Written and voluntary informed consent understood, signed and dated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior EGFR TKI treatment.

          -  Major surgery within 3 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  Previous (less than 3 years ago) or current malignancies at sites other than
             curatively treated in situ carcinoma of cervix, or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin.

          -  Severe medical illness or active infection that would impair the ability to receive
             erlotinib.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.
