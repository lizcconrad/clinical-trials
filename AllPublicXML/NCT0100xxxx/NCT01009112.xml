  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to trauma, especially when it manifests as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),
      results in numerous negative consequences for patients, families, and society. Some of the
      most frequent, disturbing, and treatment resistant symptoms of PTSD are nightmares and
      insomnia. This study will examine whether treatments specifically targeted at those sleep
      disorders can improve clinical outcomes and increase health-related quality of life in
      individuals recently exposed to war-related trauma. Hypotheses are that treating nightmares
      and insomnia will improve both nighttime and daytime symptoms of PTSD, as well as quality of
      life.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>CBT for Insomnia</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients change their sleep times and habits in order to reduce alertness and &quot;over thinking&quot; when they are trying to sleep. This helps them learn how to sleep overnight in one solid block of time</description>

    <arm_group_label>Imagery Rehearsal Therapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients &quot;rescript&quot; the narrative of a nightmare to eliminate the distressing elements and create a new pleasant dream scene. They then rehearse this scene in their imagination at least twice each day. This reduces the frequency and intensity of the target nightmare and often reduces other nightmares, too.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Prolonged Exposure</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This behavioral treatment for PTSD involves 1) systematic and repeated exposure to objects and situations that are avoided due to trauma-related distress, 2) prolonged, repeated recounting of trauma memories through visualization, and 3)therapist-guided discussions of thoughts and emotions related to the exposure exercises. The goals of PE are to reduce the anxiety and distress elicited by trauma-related memories and situations, show patients these memories and situations are distinct from the trauma, and teach patients they can tolerate the distress caused by these memories and situations.</description>
