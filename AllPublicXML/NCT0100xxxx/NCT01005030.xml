  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the utility of blood plasma infrared
      spectroscopy (biospectroscopy) in distinguishing subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease
      from healthy controls.

      Oxidative stress has been implicated as a factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease
      (PD). The overall goal of this proposal is to use a novel metabolomics platform, based on
      near infrared biospectroscopy, to detect oxidatively modified blood plasma constituents.
      These spectral findings can be used to model the degree of oxidative stress with a modeled
      &quot;stress index&quot; that may distinguish PD cases from healthy elderly controls.
