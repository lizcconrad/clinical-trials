    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of adding methotrexate to etanercept
      compared with etanercept monotherapy as measured by the percentage of participants achieving
      a 75% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at Week
      24.

          <title>Change Form Baseline in Percentage of Body Surface Area Involved With Psoriasis at Week 24</title>
          <description>A measurement of psoriasis involvement, given as the physician’s assessment of the percentage of the participant’s total body surface area (BSA) involved with psoriasis. The BSA numerical score was completed by a blinded assessor. A decrease from Baseline indicates improvement. Change from Baseline was calculated as Baseline score - Week 24 score; a positive change from Baseline therefore indicates improvement.</description>
