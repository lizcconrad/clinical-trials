  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MNI-513 positron emission
      tomography (PET) for detection/exclusion of cerebral amyloid beta in patients with
      Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine diagnostic efficacy of the MNI-513 PET scans in differentiating between patients
      with probable AD and HVs on the basis of neocortical tracer binding pattern, the PET scans
      will be visually assessed by a nuclear physician experienced in the field of neuro-imaging.
      PET scan findings will be classified either as abnormal (i.e., significant neocortical uptake
      in predefined regions) or as normal (i.e. no significant neocortical uptake in predefined
      regions). The nuclear physician will be unaware of the clinical diagnosis.
