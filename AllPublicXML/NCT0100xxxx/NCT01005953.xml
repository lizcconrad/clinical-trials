  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders continues to rise and the shortage of special
      education resources becomes more dramatic, the need for electronic tools that reduce the time
      burden of implementing an individual education plan (IEP) with pencil and paper methods
      becomes more apparent. SymTrend is going to expand its Internet and mobile
      computer/phone-based system for 1) collecting behavior data, 2) charting progress, 3)
      creating forms for #1 and #2, and 4) communicating within the IEP team, to include digital
      pen technology. Although this system will be tested with monitoring lower functioning
      children with autism, it has immediate relevance to a wide range of special education, mental
      health, and medical applications. The hypothesis is that this digital pen-based system will
      save time and money in the education of children on the spectrum and will enhance
      communication between schools and families.

      Project Summary: SymTrend is seeking funding to bring low-cost, technology-afforded power and
      efficiency to the special education (SPED) of a lower functioning child with autism (LFCA).
      Each LFCA has a federally mandated, individualized education plan (IEP). An effective IEP
      requires intensive school and home-based behavioral monitoring: iterations of behavioral data
      recording, progress charting, and team communication. SymTrend will extend the functionality
      of its current Internet and mobile system for behavioral monitoring to include the use of
      digital pen technology for recording on specially printed forms. The project will then test
      the two types of electronic monitoring (iPod Touch and digital pens) against current pencil
      and paper monitoring. It is hypothesized that an electronic system with four components -
      i.e., forms creation, data collection, progress charting, and team communication - will
      reduce the time burden of behavioral monitoring and enable schools to meet the IEP needs of
      its students within the constraints of very restrictive educational budgets.

      Objectives: The three objectives of this project are 1) to design and implement a
      four-component behavioral monitor for IEPs that is easy-to-use, cost-sensitive, and has the
      power and efficiency to optimize and sustain behavioral improvement in LFCA; 2) to
      incorporate functionality for an extensive range of a) learning contexts, b) types of
      behavioral measurement, and c) progress charting formats that meet IEP reporting
      requirements; and 3) to contrast electronic behavioral monitoring with standard paper methods
      in terms of: a) efficiency, b) power, and c) acceptance.

      Design and Methods: The test of the system will include a sample 15 children participating in
      one of two public school systems. LFCA will be monitored by parents and more than one type of
      professional both at school and at home. Monitoring will occur in the context of skill
      learning and disruptive behavior elimination. Professionals will keep track of their time and
      effort doing behavioral recording, charting, and communicating with other members of the IEP
      team. The research design includes within-subject comparisons of baseline paper monitoring
      versus electronic monitoring in terms of efficiency, power, and acceptance.

      Significance: The electronic behavioral monitoring system created to support IEP use with
      LFCA can also be used with higher functioning children with autism (HFCA), other
      developmental disabilities (e.

      g., ADHD), other clinical uses (e.g., depression and anxiety), academic use (e.g., university
      level behavioral science) and commercial use (e.g., human factors studies).

        Qualitative Family Research: This research is open to families with children 3-10 with
        autism who have broadband Internet access at home or at work, whose children receive
        services from more than one caregiver (OT, special educator, speech pathologist, behavioral
        analyst/therapist).

        Qualitative Professional Research: This research is open to professionals working with
        children 3-10 with autism who have broadband Internet access and who keep detailed records
        about the work they do with their clients.

        Quantitative Research: Only open to families and professionals who are part of two school
        districts: Cambridge, MA and Newton, MA, who also meet the above criteria.
