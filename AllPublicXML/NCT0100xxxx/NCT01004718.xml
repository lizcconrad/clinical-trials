      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as positron emission tomography or computed tomography,
      may help in detecting differences between Hodgkin lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      cancer cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying positron emission tomogaphy and
      computed tomography in determining differences in Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility of detection and quantification of differences in the temporal and
      spatial distribution of FDG uptake between lesions of HL and DLBCL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      scans 60 and 180 minutes after FDG administration.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for 24 hours.
