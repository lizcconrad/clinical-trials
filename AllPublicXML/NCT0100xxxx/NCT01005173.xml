      This study is a non-intervention, multicenter study to address biomarkers of acetaminophen
      toxicity in children. Specifically, the study will examine acetaminophen (APAP) protein
      adducts and markers of liver injury in the blood samples of hospitalized children and
      adolescents who are receiving standard doses of acetaminophen, and children and adolescents
      who are status post acetaminophen overdose. Ultimately, the data generated from this study
      will be used to establish second generation biomarkers of acetaminophen toxicity, based on
      specific adduct proteins, which can be used in future risk assessment studies of children
      receiving acetaminophen.
