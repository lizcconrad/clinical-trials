      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue samples from patients with breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify by mass spectroscopy and site-specific mutagenesis the post-translational
           modifications of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα1) that are responsible for ERRα1
           function as a constitutive activator rather than a down-modulator of transcription of
           estrogen response element-regulated genes in tumors of patients with breast cancer.

        -  Produce a panel of monoclonal antibodies to ERRα1 by standard hybridoma methods that can
           be used to distinguish between the activator and repressor forms of this receptor in
           these patients.

        -  Validate the utility for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays of some of the ERRα-specific
           sera by performing IHC and quantitative real-time PCR on some primary breast carcinomas.

        -  Correlate the results of IHC studies on archival paraffin sections of primary breast
           tumors using monoclonal antibodies to ERRα1, ERRα1 status, currently assayed biomarkers,
           and course of treatment with patient outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Breast tumor tissue samples are obtained from a tissue bank in the form of frozen
      tumors and paraffin-embedded sections on microarray blocks. Monoclonal antibodies (MOABs) to
      ERRα1 are produced using antigens in these tissue samples and immunohistochemical studies are
      performed using the MOABs. Cytogenetic studies are performed on DNA purified from these
      tissue samples.
