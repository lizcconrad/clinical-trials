      Introduction: Narrowing of the draining vein occurs in &gt;50% of hemodialysis fistula and left
      untreated will lead to loss of access. The narrowing is due to excessive growth of tissue in
      the vessel wall (intimal hyperplasia). The standard treatment is balloon dilatation. However,
      narrowing will inevitably recur in 2-3 months hence requiring further dilatation. Intimal
      hyperplasia also occurs in the heart and leg circulation. The drug paclitaxel has been used
      with great success in preventing intimal hyperplasia in these vessels following balloon
      dilatation. Administer locally, paclitaxel inhibits excess tissue growth in the vessel wall.
      The investigators believe that this drug will have similar effect in hemodialysis access..

      Objective: To assess the effect of paclitaxel in hemodialysis access with narrowing.
      Paclitaxel is delivered by a paclitaxel-coated balloon. This balloon dilates the narrow
      segment and simultaneously delivers paclitaxel to the vessel wall.

      Methodology: Patients with narrowed hemodialysis access are dilated with the
      paclitaxel-coated balloon or conventional balloon in randomized manner. The patency of the
      two groups are evaluated and compared at 6 months follow-up.

      Potential benefit: Decrease number of balloon dilatations and hence hospital admissions,
      improve dialysis fistula function, and decrease overall economic cost.
