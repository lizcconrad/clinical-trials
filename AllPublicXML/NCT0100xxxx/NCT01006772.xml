  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of disabilities worldwide. Stroke survivors commonly exhibit walking
      defects which lead to an altered, slow speed and asymmetric gait pattern. The main aims of
      rehabilitation are to enhance recovery of movement control and regain walking ability.
      Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs), braces which encompass the foot and ankle joint extending to a
      point below the knee, are commonly prescribed to address ambulation impairments in stroke
      patients. Their main function is to support the foot and allow a subject to walk safely with
      a gait approaching normality. This project will aim to evaluate the early provision of AFOs
      as an adjunct to standard physiotherapy on the walking ability of stroke survivors. Usual
      rehabilitation practice will be the control condition. Participants will be recruited from
      the stroke unit of Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow. They will be randomised into two groups.
      Participants allocated in the control group will receive usual clinical practice as per
      routine for stroke patients. The intervention group will receive custom made solid AFOs as an
      adjunct. They will be provided with three AFOs, one for use during rehabilitation and two
      which will be used only during the outcome assessment sessions for research purposes. The
      intervention phase will last 24 weeks. Gait analysis will be performed three times for each
      participant (at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks after enrolment) in the biomechanical laboratory of
      Strathclyde University. During these sessions force and movement data of patients walking
      will be recorded. Fortnightly time and distance factors of gait will be measured and a
      battery of functional tasks will be performed in the physiotherapy gym of the hospital using
      a simple video camera and a grid lino-mat. During all assessments participants with an AFO
      will be asked to walk with and without the AFO provided.
