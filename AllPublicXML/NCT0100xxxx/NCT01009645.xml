  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Influenza Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week following randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is receipt of influenza vaccination at appointment directly following the post-test. A pre-test was completed by participants during a telephone interview that occurred approximately two weeks prior to a scheduled clinic appointment. The post-test was completed via an in-person interview by participants immediately prior to their scheduled appointment. That is, the participants met with the Research Assistant, completed the post-test, and then proceeded to see their physician for a previously scheduled office visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recall Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week following receipt of message</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were given 8 statements about the flu/flu shot and asked to recall if they had seen the statement on the message they received via FedEx. Participants responded that statement had been &quot;presented as a fact,&quot; &quot;presented as a myth,&quot; &quot;presented, but I don't recall if it was a fact or a myth,&quot; or &quot;not presented.&quot; Participants scored 1 for each correct answer; 0 for each incorrect answer or for response &quot;I don't recall.&quot; Recall accuracy was calculated among each message format, range for recall accuracy was 0 - 8 with 0 indicating no correct answers and 8 representing 100% accuracy. Thus units of measurement are &quot;units on a scale&quot; to represent participant scores out of 8 on the recall items.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Eligible participants had scheduled appointments in a private medical clinic during October 2009 - March 2010. Potential participants were sent an opt-out letter indicating that they would be receiving a phone call to invite them to participate in a study if interested; those not opting out were contacted and asked to participate.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>If potential participants had already received the seasonal influenza vaccination for 2009 - 2010 or responded on the phone that they &quot;definitely intended&quot; to receive the vaccine, they were excluded from the study. These screening questions were asked prior to enrollment into the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Influenza Vaccination</title>
        <description>The primary outcome is receipt of influenza vaccination at appointment directly following the post-test. A pre-test was completed by participants during a telephone interview that occurred approximately two weeks prior to a scheduled clinic appointment. The post-test was completed via an in-person interview by participants immediately prior to their scheduled appointment. That is, the participants met with the Research Assistant, completed the post-test, and then proceeded to see their physician for a previously scheduled office visit.</description>

        <title>Recall Accuracy</title>
        <description>Participants were given 8 statements about the flu/flu shot and asked to recall if they had seen the statement on the message they received via FedEx. Participants responded that statement had been &quot;presented as a fact,&quot; &quot;presented as a myth,&quot; &quot;presented, but I don't recall if it was a fact or a myth,&quot; or &quot;not presented.&quot; Participants scored 1 for each correct answer; 0 for each incorrect answer or for response &quot;I don't recall.&quot; Recall accuracy was calculated among each message format, range for recall accuracy was 0 - 8 with 0 indicating no correct answers and 8 representing 100% accuracy. Thus units of measurement are &quot;units on a scale&quot; to represent participant scores out of 8 on the recall items.</description>
