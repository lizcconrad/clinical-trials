  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this study to learn more about colon and rectal cancer survivors. We want to
      know if survivors want more information about life after cancer. Do cancer survivors want to
      know more about their own cancer? Do cancer survivors want to know about their treatment? Do
      cancer survivors want to know what health care they should get in the future? We want to know
      what information to give to cancer survivors when they finish treatment.

    <description>This study is a cross-sectional survey study to be administered to adults who completed treatment for nonmetastatic colorectal cancer at MSKCC or at Queens Cancer Center (QCC) at Queens Hospital between 6 months and 2 years ago and have no evidence of disease at the time of study enrollment.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Questionnaire</intervention_name>
    <description>The questionnaire will be administered by telephone and will take approximately 20-30 minutes. The questionnaire will elicit survivor responses along five domains: knowledge about diagnosis and treatment, knowledge about ongoing risks and recommended testing, history of health care utilization since the end of treatment, preferences for relevant information about these topics, and employment after the end of cancer treatment.</description>
    <arm_group_label>Questionnaire</arm_group_label>
    <other_name>The questionnaire will be administered using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI)</other_name>
    <other_name>system. The CATI form of the questionnaire enables the interviewer to read aloud from a script and</other_name>
    <other_name>enter responses into the computer in real-time, regardless of whether the interview is conducted on the</other_name>
    <other_name>phone or in person. The CATI form of the questionnaire enables the interviewer to read aloud from a</other_name>
