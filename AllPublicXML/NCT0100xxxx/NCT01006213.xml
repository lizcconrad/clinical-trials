    <textblock>
      Overall mortality, such as that caused by cardiovascular disease, increases as weight
      increases. In the Framingham Study, it was shown that obesity is a cardiovascular risk factor
      independent of other risk factors such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and smoking.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine whether a group motivational intervention is more effective than the
           standard intervention for treatment of overweight and obesity and most importantly to
           maintain the attained weight loss on a permanent basis.

        2. To assess whether this intervention is more effective than reducing cardiovascular risk
           factors (lipid profile, apo B-100, apo A-1, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein,
           hypertension, diabetes mellitus) associated with overweight and obesity, and the overall
           cardiovascular risk in these patients.

      Design: Randomized, multicenter, interventional clinical trial in patients with overweight
      and obesity. Randomized assignment of the intervention by Basic Health Areas (BHAs). Two
      groups will be established in geographically separate areas, one of which will receive the
      group motivational intervention (intervention group) and the other will receive standard
      follow-up (control group). BHAs located in the same building will be assigned the same group
      (control or intervention) to avoid potential contamination. hypertensive treatment or with a
      diagnosis of hypertension in their clinical history.

      Study Scope: Primary care. The study will be conducted in 24 BHAs of Hospitalet de Llobregat
      and Barcelona during 26months follow-up period. Haematic analyses will be in the carried out
      at the reference laboratory.
