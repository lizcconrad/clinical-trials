    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this observational
      study is to collect data concerning the treatment outcomes and safety for children and adults
      who are prescribed Norditropin®. Specific objectives include: 1) developing models defining
      the relationship of Norditropin dose to changes in insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and
      treatment outcomes, accounting for independent factors such as age, gender and puberty and 2)
      determining the relative predictive values of peak growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I levels and
      other factors before treatment to clinical outcomes.
