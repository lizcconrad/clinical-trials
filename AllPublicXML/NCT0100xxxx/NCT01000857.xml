      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of
      paroxetine CR (controlled-release) at the dosage of 25mg/day using the proposed final market
      tablet of CR 25mg in Japan with that of standard paroxetine IR(immediate-release ) at the
      dosage of 20mg/day using the currently marketed tablet of IR 20mg in Japan.

      This study is an open, randomized, repeat dose, two-period crossover design in Japanese
      healthy male volunteers. This clinical trial is designed primarily to compare the
      steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of paroxetine CR at the dosage of 25mg /day (25mg once
      daily for 14 days) using the proposed final market tablet of CR 25mg in Japan with that of
      paroxetine IR at the dosage of 20mg/day (20mg once daily for 14 days) using the currently
      marketed IR 20mg tablet in Japan, by the crossover oral repeat dosing manner.
