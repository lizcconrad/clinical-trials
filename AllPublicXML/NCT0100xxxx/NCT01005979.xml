    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and
      toxicity when cyclophosphamide, rituximab and lenalidomide (Revlimid) are combined for the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic
      lymphoma (SLL).

          3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          4. Relapsed/refractory B-cell CLL or SLL

          5. All previous cancer therapy, including radiation, hormonal therapy and surgery, must
             have been discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to treatment in this study.

          6. Patients must have received at least one prior therapy and must meet the NCI Working
             Group (NCI WG) Criteria for treatment of B-CLL as described in Appendix D.

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2 at study entry
             (see Appendix C).

          8. Laboratory test results within these ranges (unless related to CLL involvement):

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 /mm3

               -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm³

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL requires creatinine
                  clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min by Cockroft-Gault formula.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT)

         10. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 milli-International Units (mIU)/mL

             must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO
             acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional
             effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking
             lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use
             a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful
             vasectomy. All patients must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about
             pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure. See Appendix A: Risks of Fetal
             Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods, AND also

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that

          2. Pregnant or breast feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed
             while taking lenalidomide).

          3. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Evidence of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) by Cairo-Bishop criteria (Appendix
             J) (subjects may be enrolled upon correction of electrolyte abnormalities).

          5. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline.

          6. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide.

          7. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while
             taking thalidomide or similar drugs.

          8. Any prior use of lenalidomide.

          9. Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments.
