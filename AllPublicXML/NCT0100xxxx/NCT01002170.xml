      In all treatments of tuberculosis, the second-line drugs are usually less effective but have
      more drug toxicity than the first-line ones. For the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis
      (MDR-TB) patients, who are resistant to the major first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs such as
      Rifampin and Isoniazid, the second-line agents, like Cycloserine in this research, are in
      frequent use. Taking patients' safety into consideration, therapeutic drug monitoring of
      Cycloserine has been listed as a routine examination during the tuberculosis treatment and
      established a suggested Cycloserine serum concentration of 20~35 mcg/mL.

      While this suggested drug concentration was set up, it isn't suitable to all races in the
      world. The investigators plan to develop the therapeutic drug monitoring protocols and a
      suggested treating concentration fitting for Asian (Taiwanese). In addition, through this
      research, the investigators can also realize that factors causing different pharmacokinetics
      and the clinical outcomes in different Cycloserine level.
