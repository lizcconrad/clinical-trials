      Study hypothesis: the Stentys self-expandable Stent results into a better alignment of the
      struts to the vessel wall than a balloon-expandable stent within a few days after the
      procedure in acute myocardial infarction patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stent strut malapposition and stent underexpansion are a common phenomenon in AMI as a result
      of the changing anatomy after an AMI has occurred (thrombus dissolution, resolution of spasm)
      with the traditional balloon-expandable stent treatment. A self-expanding stent might lead to
      better stent strut apposition as it follows the contours of the vessel wall due to its
      self-expanding properties. This might result into better long term clinical outcomes like
      lower thrombosis rates.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject 18 years old.

          2. Acute Myocardial Infarction defined as presence of at least two of the three items
             below:

               1. Detection of rise of cardiac biomarkers with a least one value above the 99th
                  percentile of the upper reference limit (URL)

               2. Symptoms of ischaemia (chest pain) &gt;20 minutes

               3. ECG changes indicative of new ischaemia: new ST-T changes (ST deviation ≥0.2mV
                  precordial leads and/or ≥0.1mV limb leads) or new LBBB)

          3. Reperfusion expected to be achieved within 12 hours from the onset of symptoms

          4. Subject understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent
             prior to the catheterization procedure.

          5. Subject is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluation and can be contacted
             by telephone.

          6. Acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

          7. Male or non-pregnant female subject.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Reference vessel diameter &gt;2.5mm and &lt;4.0mm by visual estimate.

          2. Target lesion &lt;30mm in length by visual estimate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug study that has not
             completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study
             endpoints.

          2. Coronary or cardiac intervention or major surgery of any kind within 30 days prior to
             the procedure.

          4. Patients on anticoagulation therapy (Coumadin)

             study or to comply with follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific integrity of
             the study.

         10. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 6 months.

             clopidogrel or ticlopidine, cobalt, nickel, or sensitivity to contrast media, which
             cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

         14. Known serum creatinine level &gt;2.5mg/dl or presence or history of renal failure

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unprotected left main coronary artery disease (obstruction greater than 50% in the

             graft to the left anterior descending (LAD) or left circumflex (LCX) artery or a
             branch thereof).
