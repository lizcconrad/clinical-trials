  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test the effectiveness of Cognitive-Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT) for children and adolescents suffering from Body Dysmorphic Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to develop and investigate the effects of a CBT protocol
      for children and adolescents with BDD. It is important to investigate CBT in this population
      given the disorder's early onset and poor trajectory if left untreated.

      In the first phase of this trial, we will develop the treatment manual, adapting the adult
      manual for use in a pediatric population. In the second phase of this trial we will test the
      effectiveness of the CBT treatment in 12 pediatric BDD patients. We intend to treat 12
      children and adolescents with BDD. All patients will receive CBT. We will also examine
      treatment feasibility and acceptability (e.g., retention and reasons for treatment refusal
      and dropout, expectancy, and motivation), and we will explore predictors of outcome.
      Therapeutic progress will be broadly assessed with measures of beliefs, behaviors, mood,
      functioning, and quality of life before, during, and after treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of DSM-IV BDD or its delusional variant, which must be present currently and
             for at least 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Total score of at least 24 on the 12-item BDD-YBOCS, adolescent version, which
             includes a score of at least 2 on item 1 (1-3 hours/day of preoccupation with the
             perceived defect)

          -  Score of at least moderate on the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity
             (CGI-Severity)

          -  Score of &lt; 60 on the Child Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS)

          -  Ability to communicate meaningfully with the investigators and competent to provide
             written assent; both parental informed consent and adolescent assent must be obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recent (within the past 6 months) suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation as indicated
             by a K-SADS score of 4 or higher that is active or warrants consideration of
             hospitalization

          -  Need for inpatient or partial hospital treatment

          -  Current psychotherapy and failure to benefit from ten or more sessions of previous CBT
             treatment

          -  Participants can be receiving psychotropic medication, but they must be on a stable
             dose for 2 months prior to the study baseline assessment and maintain this dosage
             throughout the course of the study
