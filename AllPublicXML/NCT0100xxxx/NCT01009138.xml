      This work is supported by the &quot;Kompetenznetz Diabetes mellitus (Competence Network for
      Diabetes mellitus)&quot; funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (FKZ 01GI0809).

      Approximately one third of diabetic patients has elevated depressive symptoms. The majority
      of these patients are suffering from a subthreshold depression. In spite of the fact that
      subthreshold depression has an equivalent negative impact on the prognosis of diabetes as
      clinical depression, there is no specific intervention tool. The main objective of this
      project is to develop a diabetes specific cognitive behavioural treatment (DS-CBT) for
      diabetic patients with subthreshold depression. In a randomized trail DS-CBT is compared to
      standard diabetes education. A total of 188 diabetic patients will be recruited and randomly
      assigned to the two treatment conditions. The expected main outcome is the reduction of
      subthreshold depression under DS-CBT in a 12 month follow up. Secondary variables are
      improvement of glycaemic control, quality of life, diabetes self-management as well as
      reduction of health care costs and modification of inflammatory parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated rates for depression in diabetic patients are of clinical significance for
      diabetology. Depressive disorders are doubled compared to patients without diabetes. A
      meta-analysis showed that a proportion of 20% of diabetic patients showed subthreshold
      depression, defined as elevated depressive symptoms without meeting criteria for clinical
      depression. Depression in diabetes is associated with a reduced quality of life, more
      diabetes related distress, and higher health related costs. But besides this, depression in
      diabetes seems to be an independent negative prognostic factor for morbidity and mortality.
      Furthermore subthreshold depression is a major barrier of an effective self-management of the
      disease.

      Until now antidepressive therapies are only evaluated in clinically depressed diabetic
      patients. For the majority of depressed diabetic patients suffering from subthreshold
      depression no evaluated specific intervention concept exists. Since subthreshold depression
      often is associated with diabetes related distress a diabetes specific intervention was
      developed to support patients to increase their problem solving skills, modify their
      depressive cognitions and improve their coping with diabetes related distress. It consists of
      five sessions and is delivered as a group intervention.

      This study is an efficacy trial. In this randomized trial the efficacy of this newly
      developed intervention is compared to a control condition consisting of five standard
      diabetes education lessons. The primary outcome variable is the reduction of depressive
      symptoms twelve months after the intervention. Secondary outcome variables are the quality of
      life, metabolic parameters, self-care behavior and other psychosocial aspects. Furthermore
      the possible covariation between change of depressive symptoms and inflammatory and immune
      markers will be analyzed.

    <measure>Depressive Symptoms (CES-D Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess depressive symptoms. The CES-D assesses the frequency of 20 typical symptoms of depression during the previous week on a 4-point Likert scale. Summing of the item scores estimates the total score with a range between 0 and 60 and higher scores indicating more severe depressive mood. Based on the measurement of depressive symptoms at baseline and 12-month follow up, the difference of the test scores between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (EQ-5D TTO Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol Five Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D) was used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The EQ-5D assesses five dimensions of HRQOL using a 3-point scale. The item scores are weighted based on population data and used to calculate a standardised total score from 0 to 1 with higher scores indicating better HRQOL. Based on the measurement of HRQOL at baseline and 12-month follow up, the difference of the test scores between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes-specific Distress (PAID Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The Problem areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID) was used to assess diabetes-specific distress. The PAID assesses diabetes-specific distress using 20 items and a five-point Likert scale (0 - 4). Item scores are summed and transformed to a range from 0 - 100 with higher scores indicating higher distress. Based on the measurement of diabetes-specific distress at baseline and 12-month follow up, the difference of the test scores between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Self-Care (SDSCA Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure (SDSCA) was used to assess diabetes self-care. The SDSCA assesses the number of days of the previous week (0 - 7) on which several specific self-care activities (appropriate diet, physical activity, self-monitoring of blood glucose, foot care) were performed. The item scores are summed and averaged to a total score from 0 to 7 with higher scores indicating better overall self-care. Based on the measurement of diabetes self-care at baseline and 12-month follow up, the difference of the test scores between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Acceptance (AADQ Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance and Action Diabetes Questionnaire (AADQ) was used to assessment of diabetes acceptance. Using 11 items on diabetes-related experiential avoidance behaviours and a 5-point Likert response scale (1 - 5), the AADQ estimates the overall level of diabetes acceptance. Item scores are summed to a total score between 11 and 55 with higehr scores indicating better acceptance. Based on the measurement of diabetes acceptance at baseline and 12-month follow up, the difference of the test scores between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glycemic Control (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The HbA1c was used as measure of glycemic control. All blood samples were analysed in a central laboratory using the Bio-Rad II Turbo analyser; the measurement units were %-points. Based on the measurement at baseline and 12-month follow up, the difference of the HbA1c values between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory Marker IL-6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The inflammatory marker Interleukin 6 (IL-6) was assessed as measure of distress-related immune activity. The differences of the serum-concentrations between baseline and 12 month follow up were calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory Marker IL-1Ra</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The inflammatory marker Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was assessed as measure of distress-related immune activity. The differences of the serum-concentrations between baseline and 12 month follow up were calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory Marker Hs-CRP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 month FU</time_frame>
    <description>The inflammatory marker high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was assessed as measure of distress-related immune activity. The differences of the serum-concentrations between baseline and 12 month follow up were calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-care Costs: Health-care Utilisation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months-FU</time_frame>
    <description>Several aspects of interest regarding diabetes-related health-care costs were assessed in order to evaluate potential reductions of health-care costs following the treatment. Measurement was performed using retrospective interview refering to the previous 6 months: The assessed aspects were 1.) the number of out-patient medical appointments as a measure of costs related to health-care utilisation, 2.) the number of days on sick leave as a measure of costs related to non-productive time and 3.) the number of daily taken prescription medications as a measure of costs related to medication intake. For each aspect, the difference of the numbers between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>

        <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess depressive symptoms. The CES-D assesses the frequency of 20 typical symptoms of depression during the previous week on a 4-point Likert scale. Summing of the item scores estimates the total score with a range between 0 and 60 and higher scores indicating more severe depressive mood. Based on the measurement of depressive symptoms at baseline and 12-month follow up, the difference of the test scores between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>

          <title>Diabetes Acceptance (AADQ Score)</title>
          <description>The Acceptance and Action Diabetes Questionnaire (AADQ) was used to assessment of diabetes acceptance. Using 11 items on diabetes-related experiential avoidance behaviours and a 5-point Likert response scale (1 - 5), the AADQ estimates the overall level of diabetes acceptance. Item scores are summed to a total score between 11 and 55 with higehr scores indicating better acceptance. Based on the measurement of diabetes acceptance at baseline and 12-month follow up, the difference of the test scores between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>

        <title>Health-care Costs: Medication Intake</title>
        <description>Several aspects of interest regarding diabetes-related health-care costs were assessed in order to evaluate potential reductions of health-care costs following the treatment. Measurement was performed using retrospective interview refering to the previous 6 months: The assessed aspects were 1.) the number of out-patient medical appointments as a measure of costs related to health-care utilisation, 2.) the number of days on sick leave as a measure of costs related to non-productive time and 3.) the number of daily taken prescription medications as a measure of costs related to medication intake. For each aspect, the difference of the numbers between baseline and 12 month follow up was calculated.</description>
