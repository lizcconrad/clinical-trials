  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to identify if certain sequences (patterns) of key genes (called
      polymorphisms) may predict a response to fertility medications. The investigators will also
      determine if the individual response to fertility medications affects pregnancy rates in
      in-vitro fertilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All IVF patients who meet inclusion criteria and not exclusion criteria will be asked to
      participate in this study. Upon consent, a blood sample will be obtained in 2 EDTA containing
      lavender topped tubes before, during or within 3 months after their IVF cycle. Genomic DNA
      will be extracted and saved for genotyping.

      The Investigators will collect data on each individual's age, ethnic background, and
      estradiol levels on the day of hCG administration, total gonadotropin amount, clinical
      pregnancy rates, basal FSH levels, and occurrence of OHSS. The Investigators will then
      analyze all samples from all patients for their FSH receptor genotypes.

      Patients will be compensated $75 via a check within 6-8 weeks of their blood drawn.

        Patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization will be recruited. Inclusion criteria will limit
        the patient population to those patients most likely to have normal ovarian function since
        age or disease related ovarian dysfunction will confound interpretation of our results.
