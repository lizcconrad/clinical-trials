      The purposes of this study are :

        -  to investigate the safety and clinical efficacy of sole therapy with DLBS1425 in
           suppressing disease-(tumour) progression in subjects with advanced/metastatic breast
           cancer; and

        -  to determine the minimal effective and safe dose of DLBS1425 in the therapy of
           advanced/metastatic breast cancer
