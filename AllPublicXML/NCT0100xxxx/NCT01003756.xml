    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in the Community Hospital in Svendborg (OUH Svendborg Sygehus) in
      collaboration with University of Southern Denmark and Odense University Hospital.

      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of preoperatively delivered
      neuromuscular exercise on self perceived physical function, pain and Quality of Life in
      patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement. Secondary area of interest is physical
      performance, muscle function, and level of physical activity.

      The project will be conducted in two phases:

        -  A pilot project focusing on the logistics of the upcoming randomized controlled trial
           (RCT) and determination of test-retest reliability of specific muscle strength variables
           for the patients of interest

        -  A randomized and controlled trial where the intervention is preoperative neuromuscular
           exercise and the controls receive standard instructions.
