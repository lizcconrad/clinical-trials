    <textblock>
      To provide long term safety data for rizatriptan in children and adolescents. The primary
      hypothesis of the study is that rizatriptan is well tolerated in the long term treatment of
      acute migraine in pediatric patients age 12-17 years.

    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with study drug administration.

    <measure>Percentage of Participant's Migraine Attacks With Pain Freedom at 2 Hours Post Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was assessed using a 5-Face Pain Scale ranging from 1=no pain to 5=very bad pain. Pain freedom (PF) was defined as a reduction in severity from a rating of 5, 4, 3 or 2 (mild, moderate or severe pain) before the dose to a rating of 1 (no pain) at 2 hours after dosing. Pain intensity ratings were reported in diaries returned at visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after Screening visit. PF at 2 hours was summarized as follows: the percentage of treated attacks with PF at 2 hours was calculated for each patient first, then the mean across all patients was calculated.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With AEs Within 14 Days Post Any Dose</title>
        <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with study drug administration. Participants reported AEs in a diary and these were collected by the study site at visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after Screening visit. AEs were assessed in a phone contact 14 days after the last dose of study medication. Participants with an AE occurring within 14 days after any dose administered during the study are counted once in this summary.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participant's Migraine Attacks With Pain Freedom at 2 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was assessed using a 5-Face Pain Scale ranging from 1=no pain to 5=very bad pain. Pain freedom (PF) was defined as a reduction in severity from a rating of 5, 4, 3 or 2 (mild, moderate or severe pain) before the dose to a rating of 1 (no pain) at 2 hours after dosing. Pain intensity ratings were reported in diaries returned at visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after Screening visit. PF at 2 hours was summarized as follows: the percentage of treated attacks with PF at 2 hours was calculated for each patient first, then the mean across all patients was calculated.</description>
