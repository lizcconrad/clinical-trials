      A prospective, open-label, unicentric phase II trial, historical control and non-randomized.

      The study will try to evaluate the efficiency and safety of the experimental treatment using
      a cell therapy product (tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine) in patients
      with glioblastoma multiforme in whom a gross total resection is feasible. Patients will
      receive standard first-line therapy (surgery before radio-chemotherapy) along with the
      experimental treatment. The experimental treatment consists in subcutaneous vaccination with
      a suspension of autologous dendritic cells (cells from the same patient) produced by cell
      culture from monocytes from the same patient extracted by leukapheresis and pulsed with a
      lysate of the patient´s tumoral tissue. The first four vaccines will be administered on a
      monthly basis, concomitantly with the standard chemo and radiotherapy treatments, the next
      four vaccines, every other month and the four last vaccinations every three months.The
      results obtained will be compared with those of an historical control study, where patients
      received a standard treatment without the experimental vaccine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histological diagnosis of glioblastoma that have not received any
             previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment.

          -  Patients are able to give informed consent and willing to comply with the protocol
             requirements during the study period.

          -  Age between 18 and 70 years

          -  Negative pregnancy test In female fertile subjects

          -  Patient is, in the investigator's opinion, willing and able to comply with the
             protocol requirements.

          -  Complete/Total resection of tumour with surgery guided by fluorescence microscopy and
             5-aminolevulinic acid, observed with post operative magnetic resonance imaging. The
             residual lesion must be null or ≤ 1 cm3 by contrast capturing.

          -  Enough tumor tissue available for the cellular vaccine elaboration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with infections, severe diseases or hepatic, renal or medullary failures,
             that in the investigator's opinion, are not eligible to participate in the study.

          -  Participation in other clinical trial. If the patient has participated in other
             clinical trial within previous months, the patient has to complete the washout period
             required by de the investigator.

          -  Patients with diagnosis of other neoplasia, except basal cell or squamous cell skin,
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix properly treated or other tumour curatively treated
             and no evidence of relapse for at least 3 years. Those cases with coexisting tumours
             of long-term survival prediction will be considered individually.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.

          -  Patients who need immunosuppressive drugs.

          -  Positive serology for HIV , hepatitis B (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus.
