  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis patients have their blood filtered by a machine as their kidneys no longer work. To
      get blood in and out of these patients it is possible to perform a surgical procedure to
      increase to size and durability of a vein in the arm to allow repeated needle insertion. This
      enlarged vein is called a fistula. There is some evidence that ultrasound scanning the blood
      vessels in the arm before surgery can improve the chances of a successful procedure. The
      investigators aim to test whether scanning all patients is better than scanning only those
      who are difficult to assess by physical examination alone.

      We will recruit all patients undergoing primary vascular access procedures in our unit who
      meet inclusion criteria. They will be randomised to either surgery based on clinical findings
      with duplex ultrasound only if requested by surgeon, or routine duplex ultrasound prior to
      surgery.
