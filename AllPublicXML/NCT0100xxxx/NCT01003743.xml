      Registry is designed to evaluate use of endolumenal tissue anchors for soft tissue
      approximation to repair a dilated gastric pouch and gastrojejunal anastomosis in
      post-Roux-En-Y gastric bypass patients presenting with weight regain. Registry will also
      assess tissue anchor durability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age

          2. Patient is &gt; 2 yrs post-Roux-en-Y bypass surgery

          3. Patient initially achieved &gt; 50% EWL after Roux-en-Y bypass surgery

          4. Patient is a reasonable risk to undergo general anesthesia

          5. Patient is able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has an esophageal stricture or other anatomy/condition that would preclude the
             use and passage of the endolumenal instruments

          2. Physician determines another causal factor for weight regain other than stoma or pouch
             dilation

          3. Patient is non-mobile or has significant impairment of mobility that will limit
             compliance with post-op exercise
