  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide, and in about 80% of
      cases, it is a lifelong, disabling illness. It is a multi-dimensional disease that is
      associated with symptoms that have been characterized as positive, negative, and cognitive.
      CDS is a core feature of schizophrenia, and most individuals with schizophrenia exhibit
      cognitive impairment. Attention disorders, slow information processing, working memory
      disorders, and lack of flexibility for adaptive strategies are symptoms of cognitive
      impairment that have a devastating impact on the function, employment, and social status of
      patients with schizophrenia.

      Older typical neuroleptic medications (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) do not improve
      cognition. In fact, haloperidol has been shown to induce cognitive impairment in
      schizophrenic patients.

      Novel atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, clozapine, and olanzapine, seem to
      produce gains in cognition. This improvement may reflect a diminution of extrapyramidal side
      effects of the typical high potency neuroleptics. Alternatively, it might reflect more
      effective symptom reduction by the novel antipsychotics, or direct cognitive enhancement
      through the effects of the newer agents on a variety of neurotransmitters, their receptors,
      and gene expression. Even when the newer antipsychotic medications improve cognition, they do
      not normalize it.

      Presently, there are no approved therapies for CDS. However, in schizophrenic patients,
      nicotine improves multiple cognitive domains, including working memory and attention.
      Furthermore, based on a strong body of evidence ranging from genetic mapping to clinical
      trials, the alpha7 NNR subtype has emerged as a primary therapeutic target relevant to CDS
      and other core symptoms of schizophrenia
