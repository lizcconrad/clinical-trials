  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on health status and risk behaviors, as well as basic
      demographic and biomedical information for a group of HIV positive adolescents receiving care
      at the ATN sites.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a cross sectional study intended to be conducted at each of the 15
      Adolescent Medicine Trials Units (AMTUs) participating in the ATN and to enroll all
      participating patients followed at each site. This approach will allow for the examination of
      the broad spectrum of youth participating in the ATN, including those newly entered into
      care.

      Psychosocial and risk-taking behavioral data will be collected using Audio Compute-Assisted
      Self-Interview (ACASI); biomedical information will be collected through medical chart
      abstraction.

    <description>Participants will have biomedical information extracted from their medical chart, will complete the ACASI questionnaire and have a face-to-face post-ACASI debriefing interview administered. Participants who do not have a documented HIV-1 viral load and/or CD4+ T-cells count from within the previous six months will also have venipuncture performed to obtain a blood sample for these tests to be performed.</description>
