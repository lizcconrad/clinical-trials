      The purpose of the study is to determine if cytidine 5'diphosphocholine (CDP-choline, a
      naturally occurring chemical in your body) has efficacy in reducing the methamphetamine
      craving of the subjects with methamphetamine dependence craving and helping them maintain the
      abstinence. In addition, investigators will measure the brain N-acetyl aspartate (a biologic
      marker for neuronal viability) level of participants to determine if brain deficits induced
      by methamphetamine may recover by taking CDP-choline.
