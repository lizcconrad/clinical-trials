    <description>Test material (V53-028 and V53-030) and control test material (8% Homoslate SPF 4) were applied to test area. Following exposure to a series of Ultraviolet light exposures, SPF scores were recorded at 16 to 24 hours post-exposure, to determine the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) of protected and unprotected skin. SPF was calculated as the MED of protected skin divided by the MED of unprotected skin. Expected SPF 15 is a score on a scale; range 11.34 (worst) to 19.83 (best).</description>

          <title>Determination of Ultraviolet A Protection Factor (PFA)</title>
          <description>Test materials (V53-028 and V53-030) were applied to test area. Following a series of Ultraviolet radiation A (UVA) exposures, scores were recorded at 2 and 4 hours post-exposure, to determine the Minimal Persistent Pigment-Darkening Dose (MPPD) of protected and unprotected skin. PFA was calculated as the MPPD of protected skin divided by the MPPD of unprotected skin. Expected PFA is a score on a scale; range 6.40 (worst) to 15.62 (best).</description>
