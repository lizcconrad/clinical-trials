  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It
      is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for
      maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility
      that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A
      specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of
      DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally
      delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the
      nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 2a trial that will enroll boys with nonsense
      mutation DMD/BMD who have lost independent mobility due to the disease. This study will
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ataluren (PTC124) and will also evaluate efficacy
      outcomes in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned that this Phase 2a, open-label, safety and efficacy study will be performed at
      5 sites in the US and 1 site in the UK.

      The study will enroll ~30 boys with nonsense mutation DMD/BMD who have been nonambulatory for
      at least one year. Enrollment will be stratified to ensure evaluation of ~15 participants who
      are receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy and of ~15 participants who are not receiving
      chronic corticosteroid therapy. Subjects will take ataluren 3 times per day (at breakfast,
      lunch, and dinner) for 48 weeks (~1 year). Study assessments will be performed at clinic
      visits during screening, every 6 weeks for 2 visits and then every 12 weeks until the end of
      the study. Additional safety laboratory testing is required 4 times during the course of the
      study; this may be performed at the investigational site, at an accredited local laboratory
      or clinic, or in the subject's home using a nursing service.
