      Background: Increased serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been associated
      with airway inflammation in asthma and may serve as a surrogate marker for the presence of
      airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in this set-up. This study was designed to evaluate the
      predictive value of hs-CRP for AHR assessed by metacholine challenge test (MCT), in adults
      with suspected Asthma.
