      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving pegaspargase together
      with combination chemotherapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the complete response rate in patients with newly diagnosed acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia treated with pegaspargase in combination with hyper-CVAD regimen
           comprising cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin
           hydrochloride, methotrexate, and cytarabine.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  To determine the half-life of pegaspargase when administered in combination with
           hyper-CVAD regimen.

        -  To monitor the development of neutralizing antibodies to pegaspargase when administered
           in combination with hyper-CVAD regimen.

        -  To assess minimal residual disease by flow cytometry at the end of courses 1A and 1B.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Hyper-CVAD regimen (courses 1, 3, 5, and 7): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over
           2-3 hours twice daily on days 1-3, dexamethasone IV on days 1-4 and 11-14, methotrexate
           intrathecally (IT) on day 2, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 2 hours and pegaspargase
           IV over 1-2 hours on day 4, vincristine sulfate IV on days 4 and 11, and cytarabine IT
           on day 8.

        -  High-dose methotrexate/cytarabine regimen (courses 2, 4, 6, and 8): Patients receive
           methotrexate IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1, methylprednisolone IV twice daily
           on days 1-3, methotrexate IT on day 2, cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice daily on days 2
           and 3, pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on day 3, and cytarabine IT on day 8.

      Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease also receive
      oral imatinib mesylate daily beginning at diagnosis.

      Patients who complete 8 courses of chemotherapy and are not candidates for hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation receive maintenance therapy off study.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetics
      and neutralizing antibody assays.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months.

             prior to registration for patient convenience. Prior steroid therapy is allowable, ≤5
             days prior to the start of the regimen.

          -  Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within the last 30
             days.

          -  WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception for the
             entire study period. Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because
