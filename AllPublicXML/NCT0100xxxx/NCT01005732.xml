      Purpose - To determine the effectiveness of custom-fit pressure garment therapy in the
      prevention of hypertrophic scarring in healed burns.

      Background - Approximately one million people are burned each year in the United States. The
      most devastating outcomes following burns is the ugly, itchy, hypertrophic scar that
      interferes with work and all other aspects of life. Pressure garment therapy is routinely
      used to minimize hypertrophic scarring even though there is no scientifically valid data that
      this therapy is efficacious. Pressure garments are extremely unattractive, expensive and
      uncomfortable and their use needs to be based upon valid data.

      Goals and Objectives - The investigators plan to determine the effectiveness of pressure
      garment therapy in the control of hypertrophic scarring in healed burns.

      Methods - The I-ScanÂ® device was designed to measure pressure at the body/environment
      interface and allows clinicians to deal with pressure-related problems for at-risk patients.
      It has been widely used in rehabilitation medicine but not with burn survivors. The
      investigators will use this device to measure the pressure at the garment/skin interface. 2)
      Furthermore, the few studies that have been attempted to determine efficacy have used between
      subjects designs. Since burn depth is extremely variable from patient to patient and since
      hypertrophic scarring is greatly influenced by age and race/origin, the between subjects
      design requires very large numbers of subjects. The investigators will use a within wounds
      design studying forearm burns and applying pressure to half of the wound and no pressure to
      the other half. The investigators will then compare hardness, color, thickness and clinical
      appearance.

    <measure>Pressure Under Compression Garment</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12 months (follow-up visits 1-5)</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure measurements were obtained at the scar/garment interface using the I-ScanTM System (Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, MA). The device was calibrated and the pressure determined in mmHg. Pressure measurements were obtained by a therapist not involved in the care of the patient, who was trained in the use of the device. Therefore pressure ''dose'' was measured directly. Values reported are averaged over indicated visits.</description>

    <measure>Durometer (Hardness) of Wound</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12 months (follow-up visits 1-5)</time_frame>
    <description>A single Rex Durometer Hand Model 1600, Type 00, without a foot attachment (Rex Gauge Company Inc., Glenview, IL) was used to measure scar hardness throughout the study. This device measures hardness of light foams, sponge rubber gels, and animal tissue in &quot;durometer units&quot; (range 0=soft, 100=hard). Measurements were obtained with the person in the sitting position with the forearm supported in a horizontal position on a desk and the shoulder adducted. The area of interest was triangulated and measurements obtained at the corners were averaged; the sides of the triangle were 3-5 cm.</description>

    <measure>Color of Wound</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately12 months (follow-up visits 5)</time_frame>
    <description>A Chromameter Minolta CR-300 (Konica Minolta, Ramsey, NJ) measured skin color. Skin surface illuminated by pulsed xenon arc lamp. Light reflected perpendicular to surface collected for a tri-stimulus color analysis. One measurement consisted of three flashes of illumination in order to obtain a mean value. Measurement values are in the L*a*b* color space was described by The Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE)(L=brightness [100=white,0=black], a=red-green[red=60,green=-60], b=yellow-blue[yellow=60,blue=-60])</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thickness of Wound</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 12 months (follow-up visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Scar thickness in millimeters was obtained with high-frequency ultrasonography in the Department of Radiology. Several machines and probes were used over the years each with accuracy to 0.5 mm. The area of interest was triangulated and measurements obtained at the corners were averaged; the sides of the triangle were 3-5 cm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Appearance of Wound</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 12 months (follow-up visit 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs of wounds showed final cosmetic result. The two compression areas for each photograph were labeled distal (D) and proximal (P). We asked 11 experts (blinded as to the compression of the rated zones) to judge which zone (D or P) had the better cosmetic appearance or whether there was no difference. Votes were tallied according to the unblinded compression zone (i.e., high/normal and low). We report number of participants for which the rating experts all agreed or did not all agree (i.e., voted the other zone or &quot;no difference&quot;) that the indicated zone had the better appearance.</description>

          <title>Pressure Garment on Burn Wound</title>
          <description>Pressure garment therapy was started within 2 weeks of re-epithelialization. A custom-fit pressure garment was fabricated by Medical Z Inc. (Medical Z, San Antonio, TX) and designed such that it applied pressure to only one-half of the wound, proximal or distal (according to coin toss by a consistent individual not involved in data collection for the study). The standard LycraÂ® 6-way stretch fabric was designed to apply 17â24 mm Hg to the normal/high compression zone and &lt;5 mm Hg to the low compression zone. Subjects were instructed to wear the garments 23 hours per day, removing them only for bathing.</description>

          <title>Pressure Under Compression Garment</title>
          <description>Pressure measurements were obtained at the scar/garment interface using the I-ScanTM System (Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, MA). The device was calibrated and the pressure determined in mmHg. Pressure measurements were obtained by a therapist not involved in the care of the patient, who was trained in the use of the device. Therefore pressure ââdoseââ was measured directly. Values reported are averaged over indicated visits.</description>

        <description>A single Rex Durometer Hand Model 1600, Type 00, without a foot attachment (Rex Gauge Company Inc., Glenview, IL) was used to measure scar hardness throughout the study. This device measures hardness of light foams, sponge rubber gels, and animal tissue in &quot;durometer units&quot; (range 0=soft, 100=hard). Measurements were obtained with the person in the sitting position with the forearm supported in a horizontal position on a desk and the shoulder adducted. The area of interest was triangulated and measurements obtained at the corners were averaged; the sides of the triangle were 3â5 cm.</description>

        <description>Photographs of wounds showed final cosmetic result. The two compression areas for each photograph were labeled distal (D) and proximal (P). We asked 11 experts (blinded as to the compression of the rated zones) to judge which zone (D or P) had the better cosmetic appearance or whether there was no difference. Votes were tallied according to the unblinded compression zone (i.e., high/normal and low). We report number of participants for which the rating experts all agreed or did not all agree (i.e., voted the other zone or &quot;no difference&quot;) that the indicated zone had the better appearance.</description>

            <title>Pressure Garment on Burn Wound</title>
            <description>Pressure garment therapy was started within 2 weeks of re-epithelialization. A custom-fit pressure garment was fabricated by Medical Z Inc. (Medical Z, San Antonio, TX) and designed such that it applied pressure to only one-half of the wound, proximal or distal (according to coin toss by a consistent individual not involved in data collection for the study). The standard LycraÂ® 6-way stretch fabric was designed to apply 17â24 mm Hg to the normal/high compression zone and &lt;5 mm Hg to the low compression zone. Subjects were instructed to wear the garments 23 hours per day, removing them only for bathing.</description>
