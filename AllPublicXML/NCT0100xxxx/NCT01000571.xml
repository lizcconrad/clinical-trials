      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated H1N1 swine-origin
      monovalent influenza vaccine in immunocompromised children and young adults.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study. This study will not dictate vaccine
      administration, nor the vaccine product to be used. It will collect data in St Jude patients
      who will receive the vaccine as part of their clinical care per institutional guidelines.
      Research participants will receive two doses of inactivated H1N1 swine-origin monovalent
      influenza vaccine administered 28 days apart as part of clinical care. Each dose contains 15
      mcg of hemagglutinin antigen (HA).Follow-up visits will be scheduled 28 days after each dose
      and at day 208+/- 14 days for blood work. The day of administration of the first vaccine dose
      is counted as day 0. At each of these visits, blood will be collected to assess for
      immunogenicity. Research participants will be given a diary card to record symptoms for 28
      days . They will be asked to bring this diary back at the next visit. Other vaccine-related
      adverse events will also be collected by retrospective chart review.

      Children and young adults between the ages of 6 months and 21 years and 13 kg or greater in
      body weight who have an underlying diagnosis of cancer, HIV, sickle cell disease or receipt
      of a stem cell transplant more than a year prior to study entry and who will receive
      inactivated H1N1 swine-origin monovalent influenza vaccine in the winter/fall of 2009-2010 as
      part of their routine clinical care.

      Blood sample collection will be done according to the description provided in the
      institutional policy manual. When possible, blood draws will be made through existing
      implanted catheters. If the research participant does not have a catheter, a peripheral
      venipuncture will be performed. Serum and whole blood for immune assays will be frozen at
      -20ºC or in liquid nitrogen until processed in batched assays.
