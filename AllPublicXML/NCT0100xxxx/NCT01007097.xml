  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of
      TAK-875, once daily (QD), in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAK-875 is under clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in
      humans. Non-clinical as well as Phase I clinical data suggest that TAK-875 stimulates insulin
      secretion only at elevated blood glucose levels.

      This study is being conducted to study glycemic effects and safety of TAK-875 compared with
      placebo and glimepiride in subjects with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled on a
      stable dose of metformin as monotherapy.

      Subjects participating in this study are required to fast for 8 hours prior to each study
      visit, and will be educated in recognition and self-management of hypoglycemia. In addition,
      during this Run-in Period compliance with study medication will be documented. Subjects who
      are less than 80% or more than120% compliant with the single-blind, placebo regimen during
      the run-in period will not be randomized.

      At the conclusion of the Run-in period, appropriate subjects will be randomized into the 12
      week double-blind treatment period.
