      The purpose of this study is to compare and determine the efficacy of combined N-acetyl
      cysteine and clomiphene citrate(CC)with combined metformin and CC in infertile women with
      Polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS)not responding to treatment with Clomiphene alone.

      In combined NAC-CC group group,patients received NAC (200 mg per sachet, SEDICO, Egypt) for
      5-6 weeks from the 1st day of of spontaneous or induced menstruation (in a dose of 1.8 g
      orally in three divided doses, 3 sachets per dose). All patients in other group received
      metformin HCl (Cidophage®; Chemical Industries Development, Egypt), 500 mg thrice daily for
      5-6 weeks from the 1st day of spontaneous or induced menstruation. Then after the end of this
      period, patients in either group received 100 mg CC (Clomid®; Global Napi
      Pharmaceuticals,Cairo, Egypt) for 5 days starting from day 3 of spontaneous or induced
      menstruation. With persistent anovulation, it was increased by 50 mg for the next cycle.
      Patients continued treatment for three successive cycles using the same protocol. NAC and
      metformin were stopped only when pregnancy was documented.
