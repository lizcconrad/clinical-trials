    <description>Risk/benefit ratio was calculated as the percentage of participants who experienced a study-drug related toxicity of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Grade 3 or higher, divided by the Kaplan-Meier estimated percentage of participants surviving one year.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to date of objective PD or death from any cause up to 35.8 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>DCR was the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD). Response determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter ever recorded since study treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions; SD was defined as small changes that did not meet the above criteria.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Survival Without Toxicity (SWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to date of toxicity or date of death up to 34.6 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>SWT was defined as the time from randomization to a study-drug related toxicity. Toxicity was defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) Grade 3 or 4 or death. Participants who do not have a CTCAE Grade 3 or higher toxicity and are alive will be censored at the date of last contact.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the date of randomization to date of first observation of clinical or objective progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST v1.0) criteria and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter ever recorded since study treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants who were not known to have died or had PD were censored at the date of last contact.</description>

          <description>PFS was defined as the date of randomization to date of first observation of clinical or objective progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST v1.0) criteria and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter ever recorded since study treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

        <description>DCR was the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD). Response determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter ever recorded since study treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions; SD was defined as small changes that did not meet the above criteria.</description>
