      Introduction.

        -  There is a demand for evidence whether treadmill therapy is more efficient than
           traditional walking training as an intervention for patients with hemiplegia after
           cerebral stroke.

      Design.

        -  A randomized controlled trial.

      Material.

        -  Stroke patients with moderate to severe functional deficits referred to inpatient
           medical rehabilitation.

      Method.

        -  Comparing a treatment group receiving treadmill training with body weight support with a
           treatment group receiving conventional walking training.

      Study aim:

        -  Investigate whether treadmill therapy is more effective than traditional functional
           training in restoring walking and transfer in patients with moderate to severe
           ambulatory deficits after stroke.
