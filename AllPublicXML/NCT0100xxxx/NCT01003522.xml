  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether the use of airways stents (metal tubes to open and keep open narrowed
      airways) together with the standard treatment increases the proportion of patients who can
      complete a 6min walking distance (6MWD) test at 2 weeks +/- 2days in patients with
      breathlessness due to lung cancer, when compared to standard treatment alone.
