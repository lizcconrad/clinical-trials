    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled and opened trial designed to compare the effects of an
      interdisciplinary moderate-intensity lifestyle modification program vs. conventional
      treatment by primary care physicians.

      We want to show the benefits of coherent interdisciplinary care in the obesity clinic of CHUS
      (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke) in comparison to the conventional treatment
      in order to:

        -  Improve subjects' characteristic features of metabolic syndrome: weight, waist
           circumference, fatty mass, plasma lipid profile, blood pressure, fasting glycaemia, and
           HbA1c;

        -  Improve our patients' nutritive practices;

        -  Decrease our patients' sedentary lifestyle;

        -  Improve our patients' motivation to lose weight, and to improve their quality of life;
           We also wish to define predictors of answer in order to better select the patients if
           necessary, and evaluate the costs incurred by the health system.

      Eligible participants recruited from patients, referred through the obesity clinic were
      separated into two groups.

      The interdisciplinary treatment group received interventions at our clinic for 6 months.. The
      intervention included a visit every 6 weeks including a nursing consultation (listening,
      psychological support, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure), an endocrinologist
      consultation, a nutritionist consultation (initial evaluation of food intake and
      counselling), a psychologist consultation if needed, an interactive group information session
      (to discuss the following: diet, psychological aspects associated with obesity, physical
      education, complications and pharmacological treatments of obesity), and a questionnaire on
      the individual costs of their visit.

      A control group was monitored during this 6 months by their family physician, as per usual.

      A biological assessment, questionnaires, and tests will be carried out in beginning and end
      of program: the questionnaires are to evaluate the physical activity (Sallis, Canada fitness
      survey); the quality of life (IWQOL-Lite, SF-36); the motivation (analogical visual Scales);
      knowledge (pretest and post-test); and costs. Tests to assess physical activity (6-minute
      walk test and accelerometer) will also be administered.

      After the first 6 months, both groups were followed at the obesity clinic for another 12
      months.
