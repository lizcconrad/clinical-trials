  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to precise the effect of a large amount of weight loss induced by
      gastric bypass on the endocannabinoid system (plasma and adipose tissue) of morbidly obese
      patients and to determine the influence of a gastric bypass surgery compared to a lifestyle
      intervention with equivalent weight loss on the endocannabinoid system
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system has been associated with the development of
      obesity, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in both animals and humans.

      Obese patients, especially those with abdominal obesity, have significantly higher levels of
      endocannabinoids. No influence of moderate (5%) body weight loss (induced either by diet
      intervention or sibutramine) on the peripheral activity of the endocannabinoid system gastric
      bypass (GB) surgery is the most efficient treatment of obesity Hormonal pathways may
      participate to the weight reducing effect of the procedure.The endocannabinoid system is
      present in the gastrointestinal tract.

      In animals, sustained weight loss after GB is characterized by reduction of endocannabinoids
      levels.

      The endocannabinoid levels will be studied (baseline and after stimulation) in:

        -  Normal-weight subjects

        -  Obese subjects before and after gastric bypass surgery

        -  Obese subjects before and after a lifestyle intervention

    <description>The evaluation of the endocannabinoid system consist in the determination of plasma concentration of the 2 main endocannabinoids (2AG and AEA) before (5 blood samples) and after (5 blood samples) after consumption of a calibrated food. As a comparator, ghrelin will be measured at the same time.</description>
