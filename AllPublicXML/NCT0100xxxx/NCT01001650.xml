      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a non-replicating,
      metabolically active Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine in malaria-naïve
      healthy volunteers following multiple-dose subcutaneous (SC) or intradermal (ID)
      administration.

      In addition, the investigators wish to evaluate PfSPZ vaccine-mediated protection against P.
      falciparum challenge in the following 4 groups (see below) and compare protective efficacy of
      the PfSPZ vaccine when given by SC v ID administration in all these groups:

        -  Group 1: 4 doses of 7,500 PfSPZ/immunization,

        -  Group 2: 4 doses of 30,000 PfSPZ/immunization,

        -  Group 3: 4 doses of 135,000 PfSPZ/immunization

        -  Group 4: 4 or 6 doses of 135,000 PfSPZ/immunization.

      If &gt; 80% protective efficacy is not achieved in Groups 1, 2, or 3, volunteers in Group 4 will
      receive a fifth and sixth dose.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first clinical trial of the Pf SPZ vaccine is a Phase 1 trial in non-immune healthy adult
      volunteers. Sanaria is the Sponsor and PATH MVI is funding the trial. The study will be
      conducted as a collaborative effort between Sanaria, PATH MVI, the NMRC Malaria Program (U.S.
      Military Malaria Vaccine Program), and the Center for Vaccine Development at the University
      of Maryland at Baltimore (CVD-UMB). The study will take place at the NMRC Malaria Program
      Clinical Trials Center on the campus of the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD and
      at the CVD and/or General Clinical Research Center, UMB. The study is designed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of successively higher doses
      of the vaccine administered by the subcutaneous (SC) or intradermal (ID) route.

      There will be 4 groups of volunteers with each group comprised of a subset of volunteers who
      receive the vaccine by the SC route and a subset who receive the vaccine by the ID route.

      Groups 1-3: The first 3 groups will receive 3 ascending doses of vaccine administered as 4 SC
      or ID injections separated by 4 week intervals (7,500 PfSPZ/dose, 30,000 PfSPZ/dose, and
      135,000 PfSPZ/dose respectively). Each of these groups will be challenged a minimum of 3
      weeks after the final dose by exposure to A. stephensi mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum
      sporozoites. All 3 groups will be followed for safety until 48 weeks after the first
      immunization.

      Group 4: Group 4 will start a minimum of 3 weeks after the first immunization of Group 3. If
      there is &gt; 80% efficacy in one or more of the subsets of Groups 1, 2, or 3 (SC or ID), Group
      4 volunteers will receive 4 immunizations (just like Group 3) but will not have experimental
      challenge; they will simply be followed for safety for 12 months after the first
      immunization. The FDA has requested that we follow a group of volunteers receiving the
      highest dose (135 PfSPZ/immunization) without challenge at 3 weeks. However, if there is NOT
      &gt; 80% efficacy in one of more subsets of Groups 1, 2, or 3, after a 6 month observation
      period, Group 4 volunteers will receive two additional monthly immunizations (Immunizations
      #5 and #6) followed by challenge at approximately 3 weeks after the sixth immunization. All
      volunteers in Group 4 will be followed for safety until 52 weeks after the first
      immunization.

          6. Agree not to travel to a malaria endemic region during the entire course of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any history of malaria infection, or travel to a malaria endemic region within 6
             months prior to first immunization.

          4. Has evidence of increased cardiovascular disease risk (defined as &gt; 10%, 5 year risk)
             as determined by the method of Gaziano (Gaziano 2008). Risk factors include sex, age
             (years), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), smoking status, body mass index (BMI,
             kg/mm2), reported diabetes status, and blood pressure.

          5. Current use of systemic immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy.

          6. An abnormal EKG, defined as one showing pathologic Q waves and significant ST-T wave
             changes; left ventricular hypertrophy; any non-sinus rhythm excluding isolated
             premature atrial contractions; right or left bundle branch block; or advanced
             (secondary or tertiary) A-V heart block.

          7. Current significant medical condition (cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, or

          9. History of any other illness or condition which, in the investigator's judgment, may
             substantially increase the risk associated with the volunteer's participation in the
             protocol or compromise the scientific objectives. This may include psychiatric
             disorders (such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders, or schizophrenia) or
             behavioral tendencies (including active alcohol or drug abuse) discovered during the
             screening process that in the opinion of the investigator would make compliance with
             the protocol difficult.

         10. Plan for surgery between enrollment and challenge.

         11. Females who are pregnant or nursing, females who plan on becoming pregnant or plan to

             days prior to the screening visit, or plan to participate in another investigational
             vaccine/drug research during or within 1 month following participation in this study.

         14. Personal beliefs that prohibit the receiving of vaccine product containing human serum
             albumin within the diluent.

         15. Use or planned use of any drug with anti-malarial activity that would coincide with
             immunization or challenge.

         16. History of psoriasis or porphyria, which may be exacerbated after treatment with
             chloroquine.

         17. Anticipated use of medications known to cause drug reactions with chloroquine or
             atovaquone- proguanil (Malarone) such as cimetidine, metoclopramide, antacids, and
