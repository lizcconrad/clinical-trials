  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study of two types of continent ileal neobladder
      construction in patients undergoing cystectomy for primary bladder cancer. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to have either a T-pouch or a Studer pouch constructed at the time of their
      surgery. They will be followed long-term to determine the relative advantages and
      disadvantages of the two types of diversion. The investigators' hypothesis is that the
      inclusion of an antireflux mechanism in the T-pouch will result in significantly fewer
      episodes of symptomatic urinary tract infection, and will have a lower incidence of upper
      tract dilation and loss of renal function over the long term.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer who are considered
             candidates for a neobladder reconstruction are eligible for enrollment.

          -  Diagnosed with primary bladder cancer (any histology).

          -  Scheduled to undergo a radical cystectomy (cystoprostatectomy in men and anterior
             exenteration in women).

          -  Felt by the treating physician to be a candidate for an orthotopic neobladder urinary
             diversion.

          -  Be competent and willing to sign the informed consent.

          -  Patients may have received previous radiation therapy or intravesical or systemic
             chemotherapy. Patients with documented metastatic disease are not excluded as long as
             they are felt to be candidates for a continent neobladder urinary diversion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing radical cystectomy for any malignancy other than primary bladder
             cancer (for example prostate cancer or colon cancer invading the bladder,or a
             gynecologic malignancy), or non-malignant disease (such as a neurogenic bladder or
             radiation cystitis).

          -  Unwilling or unable to sign the informed consent.

          -  Not eligible for an orthotopic neobladder reconstruction.

          -  A history of other malignancy (except for stage I cancer treated with curative intent
             without evidence of recurrence, clinically localized prostate cancer either untreated
             or treated with prostatectomy or radiation therapy or hormone therapy,or non-melanoma
             skin cancer) within the previous 5 years.
