      The objectives of the current study are

        1. to evaluate the efficacy of escitalopram in treatment for post-traumatic stress
           disorder,

        2. to find the structural changes of brain using magnetic resonance imaging and its
           association with the symptoms reduction, and

        3. to look at the differences of brain imaging findings and symptoms changes according to
           genetic differences of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (a biological molecule
           facilitating neuronal growth in human).
