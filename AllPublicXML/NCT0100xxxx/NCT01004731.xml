  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the toxicity profile, response rate, and time to progression of
      Cetuximab administered in combination with either Carboplatin + Gemcitabine in patients with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer with positive EGFr expression.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of Cetuximab when used
      in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with EGFr positive,
      chemotherapy-naive, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Also, the study will determine the response rate in patients with EGFr positive
      chemotherapy-naive, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with Cetuximab in
      combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin as well as determine the time to progression in
      patients with EGFr positive chemotherapy-naive, stage IV NSCLC treated with Cetuximab in
      combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin.

    <description>A loading dose of Cetuximab (400 mg/m2 IV over 120 minutes) will be administered 1 week prior to chemotherapy. Thereafter, Cetuximab will be infused weekly at maintenance doses of 250 mg/m2 (over 60 minutes). On the first day of each new cycle of therapy, Carboplatin will be infused with Gemcitabine (Days 1 and 8). Patients will be evaluated for a tumor response following every two cycles of therapy. In the absence of progressive disease, patients may continue to receive additional therapy.</description>
