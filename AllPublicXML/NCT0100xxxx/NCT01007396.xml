    <measure>Annual Incidence of Tuberculosis Infection Among Newly Employed Doctors and Nurses in Korea</measure>
    <time_frame>QFT-IT test was performed at enrollment and repeated at point of one year after enrollment. So, the length of timw which from the start of the first test of very first participant to the end of second test of very last participant is 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The participants performed QuaniFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-IT test). Annual infection of tuberculosis infection was evaluated with the conversion of QFT-IT test through annual check up of QFT-IT test. The definitions for QFT-IT test conversion was based on the CDC definition (Baseline IFN-r &lt; 0.35 IU/ml and follow-up IFN-r ≥ 0.35 IU/ml).</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with negative conversion in follow-up QFT-IT test after LTBI treatment, out of those who had QFT-IT test conversion after one year of employment and agreed to undergo treatment for LTBI according to our recommendation
Participants with QFT-IT test conversion were recommended for LTBI therapy using 3 months of daily isoniazid and rifampicin, which was the regular treatment for LTBI in our institution.
The QFT-IT test was repeated after LTBI therapy. Negative conversion was defined as baseline IFN-r ≥ 0.35 and follow-up IFN-r &lt; 0.35 IU/ml.</description>
