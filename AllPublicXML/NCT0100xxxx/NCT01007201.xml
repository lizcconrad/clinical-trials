    <textblock>
      This is a laboratory-blinded study in healthy toddlers, children, and teenagers designed to
      investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an inactivated influenza H1N1
      vaccine (AdimFlu-S). There are 3 age strata, and each contains at least 50 subjects: greater
      than or equal to 1 year to less than 3 years, greater than or equal to 3 years to less than 6
      years, and greater than or equal to 6 years to less than 18 years. In each age strata, all
      eligible subjects received 2 injections of AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1) at a designated dosage level
      (7.5 μg, 15 μg and 15 μg for 1~&lt;3, 3~&lt;6 and 6~&lt;18 years, respectively) at 3 weeks apart.

      Following immunization, safety is measured by assessment of adverse events for 6 weeks
      following the first vaccination, serious adverse events and new-onset chronic medical
      conditions through 7 months post first vaccination, and reactogenicity to the vaccines for 7
      days following each vaccination. Immunogenicity testing includes hemagglutination inhibition
      (HAI) testing on serum obtained before first vaccination, and three and six weeks after first
      vaccination.
