      Cervical epidural steroid injections

        -  The hanging drop (HD) technique is commonly used for identifying the cervical epidural
           space.

        -  The hanging drop (HD) technique is using the negative pressure in the epidural space.

        -  The subject of debate whether the epidural space exhibits negative pressure.

        -  In a previous study, EP might be influenced by body position

        -  No report or peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate the cervical epidural pressure
           (CEP) now.

      The hypothesis of this study

        -  There is a difference in the cervical epidural pressure between in the prone and sitting
           positions

        -  To evaluate this hypothesis, CEPs in the prone and sitting groups were measured and
           compared in the two groups.

        -  Using a closed pressure measurement system

        -  Under fluoroscopic guidance.

      Cervical epidural steroid injections (CESIs)

        -  For the conservative management of head, neck, and upper extremity pain

        -  Important to identify the epidural space for minimizing the chance of a dural puncture
           injection

        -  Dural puncture injection makes CESIs prone to rare but catastrophic complication like
           permanent spinal cord injury

      The hanging drop (HD) technique

        -  Commonly used for identifying the cervical epidural space

        -  Using the negative pressure in the epidural space

        -  The subject of debate whether the epidural space exhibits negative pressure

      In previous studies using a closed pressure measurement systems

        -  The epidural pressure (EP) was commonly positive at the thoracic level in the lateral
           decubitus position.

        -  EP was consistently negative only in the sitting position.

        -  EP might be influenced by body position.

        -  The patient should be sitting for using the HD technique.

      No report or peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate the cervical epidural pressure (CEP)
      now.

      The hypothesis of this study

        -  There is a difference in the cervical epidural pressure between in the prone and sitting
           positions

        -  To evaluate this hypothesis, CEPs in the prone and sitting groups were measured and
           compared in the two groups.

        -  Using a closed pressure measurement system

        -  Under fluoroscopic guidance.

    <description>After aseptic preparation and skin infiltration with 1% lidocaine
20-gauge Tuohy needle (Tae-Chang Industrial Co., Kongju, Korea) was inserted in the midline at the C6 - C7 level
identification of the epidural space confirmed by injection of contrast medium under fluoroscope
injection of 5 mL of solution containing 10 mg of triamcinolone acetonide suspension and 1.5 mL of 0.75% levobupivacaine hydrochloride, and 3.5 mL of physiologic saline (0.9% NaCl).
Post-procedure, patients were observed for any adverse effects and followed with a neurological examination</description>
