    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study, which means that the goal is to see if the combination of
      Temsirolimus and Sorafenib is safe in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Sorafenib is a
      standard treatment for Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Temsirolimus is used to treat cancer in the
      kidneys. It is hoped that the addition of Temsirolimus will make Sorafenib more effective
      against Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma, however this can not be guaranteed. The addition
      of Temsirolimus to Sorafenib is not an FDA approved treatment for Advanced Hepatocellular
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide with an incidence
      of over 600,000 new cases and almost as many deaths annually.1 Advanced stages of disease at
      diagnosis often preclude curative treatments, and the overall prognosis of patients diagnosed
      with advanced HCC remains dismal with median survival of approximately 8 months.2-4 Until
      recently, systemic therapies for advanced HCC have demonstrated minimal benefit in these
      patients, largely due to compromised hepatic function from underlying liver disease as well
      as intrinsic tumor chemoresistance.5-9 In the past year, however, publication of the
      Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP) phase III trial
      demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced HCC
      treated with the biologic agent, sorafenib.4 Despite improvements in outcome with sorafenib,
      however, the median OS for patients with advanced HCC remains less than a year, and new
      therapies and combinations are in great need to combat this grim disease.

      Sorafenib is a small molecule bi-aryl urea with multikinase inhibitor activity. A primary
      target is the serine-threonine kinase, Raf-1. Sorafenib also has antiangiogenic activity,
      inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      receptors 2 and 3 and the platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR).10-12 Preclinical
      studies in HCC show that Raf-1 kinase signaling along with prolific tumor angiogenesis are
      common features, providing a molecular rationale for the efficacy of this agent.11,13-16
      Radiographically, HCC is a hypervascular tumor, providing additional clinical relevance to
      the exuberant angiogenesis observed in this tumor type in the preclinical setting.15 The
      efficacy of sorafenib in the SHARP trial validates the importance of these signaling pathways
      in HCC.

      Another signaling pathway which may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis is the phosphatase
      and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol-3'kinase (PI-3'K)/AKT pathway which activates
      the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, in turn triggering multiple downstream cell
      growth, survival, and angiogenesis signals.26-28 Dysregulated phosphorylation and activation
      of mTOR signaling may occur due to loss of function of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene,
      constitutive activation of PI-3'K, or activation of AKT by aberrant upstream growth factor
      receptor signaling.27 Activated mTOR forms complexes with other proteins, including
      regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) and Rictor.26 The mTOR-Raptor complex in turn
      phosphorylates protein 70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) as well as eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
      (eIF-4E) binding protein-1 (4E-BP1). P70S6K and 4E-BP1 regulate translation of a host of
      proteins, including several proteins involved in cell proliferation. Signaling through mTOR
      also stimulates angiogenesis.26,28-30 Activation of mTOR may induce endothelial cell
      proliferation as well as increase levels of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α,
      potentially via p70S6K-mediated translation versus decreased oxygen-dependent
      degradation.31-33 HIFs induce angiogenesis in response to cellular hypoxia by transcriptional
      activation of target genes including VEGF.32,34,35

      The mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, is a macrocyclic lactone rapamycin produced by the soil
      bacterium, Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Sirolimus demonstrates fungicidal, immunosuppressive,
      and antiproliferative properties and is widely used as an immunosuppressant in transplant
      patients to prevent allograft rejection.26,36 Inhibitors of mTOR are also under investigation
      as potential anti-cancer agents in multiple human malignancies due to the known proliferative
      effects of mTOR activation. Temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus are derivatives of
      sirolimus with similar antiproliferative properties in vitro.26

      Temsirolimus is a soluble ester analogue of sirolimus.37 Temsirolimus has been approved by
      the FDA for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and demonstrated a survival
      benefit as monotherapy by comparison with interferon alpha in a multicenter phase III
      trial.38,39 In that trial, 626 patients with previously untreated, poor prognosis, metastatic
      RCC were randomized to receive temsirolimus 25 mg intravenously weekly, 3 million units of
      interferon alpha subcutaneously three times weekly, or combination therapy with 15 mg of
      temsirolimus weekly plus 6 million units of interferon alpha three times weekly.39 The
      primary endpoint, overall survival, was 10.9 months in the temsirolimus group, by comparison
      with 7.3 months with interferon alpha and 8.4 months with combination therapy; both overall
      survival and progression free survival (PFS) were significantly prolonged in the temsirolimus
      group by comparison with interferon alpha alone (P = 0.008 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively).

      Combination of molecularly targeted therapies offers the theoretical potential for additive
      or synergistic inhibition of shared targets as well as targets in parallel pathways which may
      provide escape mechanisms from single-pathway inhibition. In the case of mTOR inhibitors,
      combination therapy with Ras pathway inhibition may augment efficacy by blocking a pathway
      upstream of mTOR kinase, while combination with antiangiogenic agents may enhance
      antiangiogenic effect.26,27
