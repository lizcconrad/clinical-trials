  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a multicenter, double blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled,
      randomized, event driven Phase II study of DTIC with or without bosentan as first-line
      treatment in patients with stage IV melanoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (1:1 bosentan : placebo) trial to evaluate the effect of
      bosentan in combination with DTIC on TTP or death in patients with metastatic melanoma stage
      IV.

      The patients will receive study medication (bosentan or placebo) and DTIC for 35 weeks to 105
      weeks; the study will be completed when 66 events (tumor progression, death due to underlying
      disease, other/additional anti-tumor therapy) have been observed.

      Study drug will be administered orally, 500 mg twice a day. DTIC will be given once every
      three weeks in a dosage of 1000 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) or in accordance with the
      Institution's DTIC treatment protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients 18 years of age or older

          2. Histologically proven malignant melanoma (Balch et al., J. Clin Oncol. 19(16):
             3635-48, 2001) with stage IV measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria
             (Therasse et al., J Natl Cancer Inst, 92(3): 205-16, 2000).

          3. Patients with prior radiation therapy (&gt; 30 days prior to study drug initiation) will
             be allowed provided the indicator lesion(s) used for this study was (were) outside the
             field of radiation or represent new lesions not previously irradiated.

          4. Patients who had no prior therapy with DTIC.

          5. Patients with cutaneous melanoma lesions must consent to having a biopsy obtained
             during the screening period and at the end of treatment for exploratory analysis of
             endothelin receptor expression. Biopsies obtained prior to the study that have been
             frozen in accordance with procedures specified for this protocol may be used.

          6. ECOG performance status (≤ 2)

          8. Female patients must be non-pregnant, non-breast feeding, and either post menopausal,
             surgically sterile, or practicing a reliable method of contraception (hormonal methods
             alone are not sufficient)

          2. Lactate dehydrogenase &gt; 1.5 x ULN

          3. Hemoglobin &gt;30% below the lower limit of normal

             disease.

          7. Received immunotherapy &lt; 30 days before treatment start (completed adjuvant
             immunotherapy for previous resected metastatic disease is allowed)

          8. Concurrent use of calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine A, tacrolimus), sirolimus,
             fluconazole or glibenclamide (glyburide) or expected to receive any of these drugs

          9. History of other malignancy in the last 5 years, with the exception of squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin treated with local resection and basal cell carcinoma

         10. CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis

         11. Ocular melanoma

         14. Use of therapy with another investigational drug within 4 weeks of the start of dosing
             with bosentan or plan to receive such treatment during the study

         15. Known drug or alcohol dependence or any other factor that will interfere with the
             conduct of the study

         16. Any standard contraindications for the use of DTIC as per Australian package insert
