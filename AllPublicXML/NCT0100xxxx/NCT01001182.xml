  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic debilitating disease, causing severe pain and
      progressive joint destruction and leading to partial loss of mobility. The disease has a
      severe impact on patients' quality of life, due to the pain and physical impairment it
      causes, which can also result in psychological and social difficulties. Moreover, the chronic
      nature of the disease deems necessary the long-term use of medication, causing significant
      costs to the patient and the healthcare system. The decline in functional ability can cause
      problems at work, with reduced productivity or even unemployment. In addition, RA can limit
      the patients' ability for self-care, hence imposing a further burden on the patients'
      families and the society.

      Many international studies have confirmed the reduced quality of life for people suffering
      from RA [1-3], as well as the large economic impact of the disease on the patients, the
      health system and society [4-6]. However, no assessment of the above impact of RA on the
      Greek population has been published so far.

      A wide research of the literature confirms the relationship between costs and quality of life
      on the one hand and functional ability (as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire)
      on the other hand. [7-8] The impact of functional ability on quality of life is
      straightforward, however studies also demonstrate that as disease symptoms progress, without
      proper treatment, the overall costs undertaken by the patient or the healthcare system can
      rise significantly. On the other hand, if effective treatment can lessen or postpone the most
      serious consequences of the disease (such as extensive joint damage that could lead to
      surgical replacement), the savings on healthcare can offset some of the costs of the more
      effective drug therapies.

      In the light of the above findings, it seems important that in order to properly assess
      therapeutic strategies for RA patients it is necessary to have an accurate view of the total
      burden of RA on the population. It is also important to be able to establish a robust
      relationship between functional ability and impact of RA on costs and quality of life.

      The study will use a prevalence-based approach, recruiting patients at various stages of
      disease. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially as per their order of appearance at the site,
      until the maximum allowed number of subjects is reached at each site.
