  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been recent interest into the potential role of mucosal barrier defects in the
      pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). There has been evidence of
      increased intestinal permeability in patients of IBS,and abnormal tissue resistance in NERD.
      Although the mucosa of Functional dyspepsia (FD) patients is endoscopically and
      histologically &quot;normal,&quot; it contains ultrastructural changes, activated immune cells, along
      with evidence of an increased release of mediators leading to gastric dysfunction. There is
      now consistent evidence indicating that mucosal barrier defects allow the passage of an
      increased load of bacteria, antigens and toxins which, in turn evoke activation of mucosal
      immune responses involved in the FD symptom.

      Confocal laser endomicrosopy is a newly developed device which allows in vivo and real time
      observation of gastrointestinal mucosa.In our pilot study we found that the contrast agent
      fluorescein sodium shew differences of leakage into intercellular spaces and crypt lumen
      among different patients of FD.

      This study is aimed to determine if there is microscopic changes detectable in the gastric
      mucosal epithelium through confocal endomicroscopy of FD patients, and to evaluate the
      relationship among minimal changes(transmission electron microscopy and Confocal laser
      endomicrosopy ), FD symptoms(symptom index form) , neuropeptides and immune
      responses(immunohistochemistry).
