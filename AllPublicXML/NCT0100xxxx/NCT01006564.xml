  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hormone therapy naive patients planned to be treated by radical radiotherapy after 3-6
             months of androgen suppression

          -  Patients with low-high risk histologically confirmed localised disease are eligible,
             with WHO performance status 0-1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unsuitable for functional MRI of the prostate or gold seed fiducial marker
             insertion (e.g. patients unable to tolerate endorectal MRI examination).

          -  No prior pelvic radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy, previous androgen therapy,
             patients unsuitable for radical radiotherapy, life expectancy &lt;10 years, previous
             active malignancy within last 5 years, co-morbid conditions likely to impact on the
             advisability of radical radiotherapy, full anticoagulation, other exclusions to MRI
             (e.g. hip prosthesis or fixation, claustrophobia, ferromagnetic implants).
