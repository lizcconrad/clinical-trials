  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the effects of the non-ergot dopamine
      agonist piribedil on vigilance and cognitive performances in patients with Parkinson's
      disease in comparison with other oral non-ergot dopamine agonists.

      It should be tested whether piribedil is superior to continued pramipexole or ropinirole
      treatment regarding improvement of reduced vigilance and cognitive performance in patients
      with Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      Treatment of motor symptoms associated with PD by non-ergot dopamine agonists has been proven
      to be effective, both as monotherapy and in combination with levodopa. Non-motor symptoms
      like cognitive or sleep-related disorders and disturbed vigilance, however, are common in PD
      and can significantly worsen health and quality of life of the patient and family members.
      Some of these non-motor symptoms may also be caused by the antiparkinsonian medication per
      se. The Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) initiated a review of dopamine
      agonists in relation to episodes of sudden onset of sleep already in 2000 which resulted in
      special warnings of somnolence and sudden sleep attacks in the non-ergot dopamine agonists'
      summary of product characteristics.

      Beneficial effects of piribedil on parameters of vigilance and cognition have been described
      in several studies. But, as it seems, no study has been performed so far to identify such
      effects in the setting of a comparative study with different oral non-ergot dopamine agonists
      in patients with PD, and utilizing vigilance and cognitive parameters as primary and main
      secondary objective. The neuropsychological tests being applied in this study are validated
      and routinely used tests in studies investigating different aspects of attention or vigilance
      and cognition.
