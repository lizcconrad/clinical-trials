    <textblock>
      After the KFDA (Korea Food and Drug Administration) approval of a new drug, an annual report
      of the drug's safety and efficacy data must be reported to the Health Authority in 6 years.
      In this Observational study, we will investigate the basic demographic, medical history,
      concomitant drug use, as well as dosing information of multiple myeloma patients using
      bortezomib (Velcade).

      After the KFDA approval of a new drug, an annual report of the drug's safety and efficacy
      data must be reported to the Health Authority in 6 years. In this Observational study, we
      will investigate the basic demographic, medical history, concomitant drug use, as well as
      dosing information of multiple myeloma patients using bortezomib (Velcade). We will collect
      the response rate according to the EMBT (European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant; a
      non-profit organization based in the Netherlands that promotes the transplantation of
      haemopoietic stem cells from all donor sources and donor types and related basic and clinical
      research, education, standardization, quality control, and accreditation for transplant
      procedures) or IMWG (the International Myeloma Working Group) criteria and the adverse events
      to assess the efficacy and safety. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered
