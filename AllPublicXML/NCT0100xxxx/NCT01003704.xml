  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (pain originating from where an amputated limb once was) is a common
      occurrence after lower extremity amputations, with some sources noting incidence to be as
      high as 60-80% six months after surgery. This pain can eventually subside, however, cases
      have been reported of incidence 10 years after surgery. This pain is not only physically
      detrimental, but can also be psychologically detrimental after a difficult to accept change
      in the body. Prior studies have been performed using regional anesthetic techniques
      (including spinals and epidurals) and different medications to attempt to reduce the
      incidence of phantom limb pain, however, the data have been mostly inconclusive. Of interest,
      prior studies have not addressed peripheral nerve blocks, a method of anesthesia/analgesia
      more commonly employed for amputations recently. The purpose of our retrospective study is to
      look at the incidence of phantom limb pain at our institution over a two year period to
      determine if peripheral nerve blocks result in a significantly reduced incidence compared to
      other techniques (spinal, epidural, general anesthesia only). In addition, there is little
      data on relation of reason for amputation and presence of preoperative neuropathy and
      incidence of phantom pain. As secondary endpoints, the investigators wish to investigate if
      certain reasons for amputation (trauma, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and others)
      and/or neuropathy lead to a higher incidence of phantom limb pain. The results of this study
      could impact future management of patients who are to receive amputations and may lead to
      further prospective studies on the topics involved.
