  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if there is a way the investigators can improve the
      techniques that they use to assist patients with their breathing during surgery. The majority
      of surgeries require patients to concurrently undergo general anesthesia. This usually
      includes a breathing tube and a machine that breathes for the patient during the duration of
      the surgery. The doctors would like to investigate the effects of this type of anesthesia to
      healthy adult patients and whether they can improve the way they give general anesthesia to
      patients. The investigators plan to ask approximately 200 patients to participate. If the
      patients decide to participate in the study,some additions will be made to the standard
      anesthetic care they receive. The patients will additionally be monitored for adequate
      oxygenation in their blood as well as level of inflammation in their blood and lungs. The
      patients' breathing tube will be bathed with warm normal saline and suctioned twice during
      the operation. When these procedures are done the patients will be asleep and not be aware of
      what is happening.

      The ability to provide mechanical ventilation that will not injure and may protect normal
      lungs during major surgical procedures of long duration may improve postoperative outcomes
      and decrease morbidity and mortality. The aim of the current study was to identify ventilator
      strategies that are less damaging to normal lungs. The investigators plan to compare three
      ventilation strategies commonly utilized in the operating room in normal lungs. One group
      will be ventilated with high tidal volume (15 mL/kg PBW) and low PEEP (3 cm H2O), another
      group ventilated with low tidal volume (6 mL/kg PBW) and low PEEP (3 cm H2O) and the final
      group ventilated with low tidal volume (6 mL/kg PBW) and high PEEP (10 cm H2O). This study
      will show the effects of these commonly used methods of ventilation on pulmonary mechanics,
      systemic and pulmonary inflammatory markers and outcomes in patients with normal lungs
      undergoing surgery of long duration.
