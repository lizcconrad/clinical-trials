  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is associated with gastric cancer in epidemiological
      studies.Gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia caused by H. pylori are considered as
      precancerous lesions, but whether H. pylori eradication improves these lesions is
      controversial.The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether Helicobacter pylori
      eradication improves glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia which are known to be
      precancerous condition in patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a primary etiological agent leading to chronic gastritis
      and peptic ulcer. The organism is also associated with gastric cancer in epidemiological
      studies. However, detailed mechanism of carcinogenesis remains unknown. Histolopathological
      studies indicate that chronic H. pylori infection progresses over decades through stages of
      chronic gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and cancer. Gastric atrophy and
      intestinal metaplasia are considered as precancerous lesions, but whether H. pylori
      eradication improves these lesions is controversial. And the issue has not been evaluated in
      gastric cancer patients. However, despite the lack of evidence proven by a well-designed
      study, current guidelines from Europe and Japan recommend H. pylori eradication treatment in
      patients who were treated for gastric cancer by surgically or endoscopically. Thus, it is
      important to evaluate whether H. pylori eradication can improve known precancerous lesion,
      i.e. glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia in gastric cancer patients. Such
      histological improvement may eventually reduce secondary gastric cancer development and
      provide evidence for current guidelines. Helicobacter pylori is a primary etiological agent
