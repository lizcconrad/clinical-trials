  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Midwest Advocacy Project (MAP) is a community-based multiple-site randomized practical
      behavioral trial of advocacy skill training for individuals with traumatic brain injury
      (TBI), their families, and significant others. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of a
      4-session advocacy training program to improve behavioral advocacy skills compared to
      self-directed advocacy training of the same session frequency. Groups will be randomly
      assigned to either a programmed group or a self-directed group in collaboration with the
      Brain Injury Associations of Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin each year over the 5 year study
      period. The primary outcome is pre-post measures of written and verbal advocacy skill
      measured by the Advocacy Behavior Rating Scale.

      It is hypothesized that subjects who receive programmed advocacy training will show greater
      positive change on pre-post measures of advocacy skill measures than subjects receiving
      self-directed training.
