  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized study on the comparison between aerobic training versus progressive resistance
      training over a 2 months period for older adults with type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that
      progressive resistance training is just as effective as aerobic training on Hba1c and could
      be an alternative training for those older diabetic patients who cannot participate in
      aerobic exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown the importance of aerobic training with respect to management of
      diabetes. However adoption of aerobic activities may be challenging for some individuals with
      diabetes, especially the elderly and the obese. There is increasing interest in resistance
      training and no study have looked at direct comparison between the two.

      Subjects with diabetes but is generally sedentary (determined by means of a questionnaire)
      were recruited and randomized in one of the two groups. Subjects are supervised in a group
      and a completer is defined as one who completed 18 sessions within 8 weeks.

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was drawn from each subject who fasted at least 10 hours overnight. Total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were measured using enzymatic colorimetric methods with cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase amino phenazone phenol and glycerol-3-phospahte oxidase-peroxidase amino phenazone phenol. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was measured using homogenous enzymatic colorimetric assay. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using the Friedewald formula.</description>
