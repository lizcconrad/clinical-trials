    <textblock>
      This trial iss conducted in Europe. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the
      hypoglycaemic response (the response to low blood sugar) to NN1250 (insulin degludec) in
      subjects with type 1 diabetes.

      The trial is designed as a two-period, crossover trial where the trial participant is
      randomised to one of two treatment periods.
