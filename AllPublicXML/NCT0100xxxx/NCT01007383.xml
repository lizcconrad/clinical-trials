      The purpose of this first-in-man trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      ascending single and multiple doses of LEO 27847 in healthy male subjects. The trial will be
      performed in two parts. In Part 1, single doses of LEO 27847 will be administered to healthy
      male subjects. In Part 2, multiple doses of LEO 27847 will be administered to healthy male
      subjects.

          -  Subjects must be in good health, as determined by a medical history, physical
             examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory evaluations
             (congenital non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia is acceptable)

          -  Subjects will have given their written informed consent to participate in the study

             mmHg and 50 bpm, respectively. Healthy young males with a pulse rate of between 45 and
             50 bpm may be included at the discretion of the investigator.
