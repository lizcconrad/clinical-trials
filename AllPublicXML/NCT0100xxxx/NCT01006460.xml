  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is clinical trial to document the efficacy of a proprietary standardized extract of
      Arctic root in comparison to a standardized commercial extract of ginseng and placebo from an
      every day consumer perspective to ameliorate mild depression, reduce stress and improve
      quality of life. A newly developed adaptogenic formulation, Adapt 232, was included into the
      study in order to evaluate its effect in comparison to the others.
