  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silicone gel is a self-drying silicone polymer that forms thin film after application onto
      the skin. Because silicone film is a medical device, silicone gel is also regarded as a
      medical device. Silicone gel has been on the market for many years for the management of scar
      in the phase of treatment as well as in the phase of prevention. In contrast to other methods
      that are expensive, invasive or inconvenient, silicone gel is convenient, non-invasive and
      also reasonably priced. However, the number of well-designed clinicial trials for efficacy
      and safety are not enough to provide robust evidences in making clinical decisions for scar
      management options. In a prospective, multi-center, investigator-blind randomized half-split
      study for patients undergoing cesarean sections, the investigators attempt to provide valid
      information for the efficacy and safety of silicone gel in the prevention phase of scar.

      Prospective subjects will be enrolled in the trial when eligibility screening and informed
      consent were made. One day after stitch out for cesarean sections, subjects will be asked to
      start applying silicone gel as the instruction to the randomly designated half of the wound 2
      times a day for 12 weeks. Subjects are asked to make visits on week 4, 8, and 12 for
      efficacy, safety and compliance evaluations. Obstetricians, dermatologists and medical
      imaging specialists are involved in the trial for the evaluation of efficacy, safety and
      compliance. Sample size calculation as well as statistical analysis will be conducted by a
      designated statistician. Study product will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost and
      patient visits and relevant lab exams will be conducted free of charge.
