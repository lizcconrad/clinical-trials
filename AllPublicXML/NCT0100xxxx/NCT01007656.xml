      -  Study design is multiple-dose, open-label study

        -  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety after twice daily GD Antrodia
           camphorata administration for 90 days in 30 healthy adult subjects.

             -  Primary objective: The mean change from baseline in laboratory assessment after
                twice daily GD Antrodia camphorata administration at 90th day in 30 healthy adult
                subjects.

             -  Secondary objective: The mean change from baseline in laboratory assessment after
                twice daily GD Antrodia camphorata administration at 10th, 20th, 30th, 45th and
                60th day in 30 healthy adult subjects.

        -  Safety Measurement:

             -  including SGOT(AST), SGPT(ALT), albumin, glucose, creatinine, uric acid,
                cholesterol, TG, r-GT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, D-Bil, BUN, TP, GLO
                will be documented at 1st, 10th, 20th, 30th, 45th, 60th and 90th day.

             -  vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature) will be documented
                at 1st, 10th, 20th, 30th, 45th, 60th and 90th day.

             -  Subjects will be monitored throughout the confinement portion of the study.

    <description>Direct bilirubin is referred to as conjugated bilirubin, which is water-soluble. It's taken up by the liver cells and conjugated to form the water-soluble bilirubin diglucuronide. It's used to diagnose and/or monitor liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis or gallstones. If direct bilirubin is elevated more than unconjugated bilirubin, there's typically a problem associated with decreased elimination of bilirubin by the liver cells.</description>

    <description>Bilirubin is released into the blood when red blood cells break down. The liver uses bilirubin to make bile. Normally there is only a small amount of bilirubin in the blood. High levels may be caused by liver or blood problems.</description>

          <title>Direct bilirubin</title>
          <description>Bilirubin is brownish yellow substance found in bile. It's produced when the liver breaks down old red blood cells. Bilirubin circulates in the bloodstream in two forms: indirect and direct bilirubin. Direct bilirubin is made by the liver from indirect form. This test can be used to check the liver function. Subjects would fast for 8 hours prior to study product administration at 7:30 in the morning. Blood would be sampled from an antecubital vein of the forearm for the laboratory measurement.</description>

          <title>Total bilirubin</title>
          <description>Total bilirubin is referred to the sum of direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin. Direct bilirubin is water- soluble form, made by the liver. Indirect bilirubin is not soluble in water due to the intramolecular hydrogen bond. Indirect bilirubin circulates in plasma. Total bilirubin test can be used to check liver function and haemolytic disease. Blood would be sampled from an antecubital vein of the forearm for the laboratory measurement at 7:30 in the morning. No smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption would be permitted for at least 48 hours before and during the study.</description>

        <title>Direct Bilirubin</title>
        <description>Direct bilirubin is referred to as conjugated bilirubin, which is water-soluble. It's taken up by the liver cells and conjugated to form the water-soluble bilirubin diglucuronide. It's used to diagnose and/or monitor liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis or gallstones. If direct bilirubin is elevated more than unconjugated bilirubin, there's typically a problem associated with decreased elimination of bilirubin by the liver cells.</description>
