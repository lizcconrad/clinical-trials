    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using the PEMFlex Solo II, a
      high-resolution camera for PET scan imaging, on an area of the body that has, or is suspected
      to have cancer will give researchers the same or better information about the disease
      compared to the images taken with a routine PET/CT.

      Researchers will compare the images taken using the PEMFlex Solo II to the images taken
      during your scheduled routine PET/CT scan, as well as any additional routine CT scan(s),
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan(s), and/or ultrasound image(s) you may have had within
      the last 30 days or may have in the next 30 days.

      If you agree to take part in this study, right after your already-scheduled routine PET/CT
      scan is complete, a study staff member will take you to a separate imaging room located in
      the same clinic area where your routine PET/CT scan was just performed.

      You will then sit in a chair as a study staff member positions the PEMFlex Solo II on either
      side of the area being checked for cancer. It will take about 20 minutes to set up the
      PEMFlex Solo II and take the PET scan images.

      Length of Study:

      After the PET scan images have been taken using the PEMFlex Solo II, your participation in
      this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study. The PEMFlex Solo II is commercially available and designed
      for PET scan imaging of the breast. The use of the PEMFlex Solo II for imaging other parts of
      the body is investigational.

      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A signed informed consent.

          2. Known or suspected primary or metastatic lesion of the extremities, head or neck as
             determined by biopsy, physical examination or noninvasive imaging studies including
             plain films, CT, MR, ultrasound or nuclear medicine imaging.

          3. Scheduled for routine clinical imaging at the ACB PET/CT facility.

          4. Participant must be at least 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels (&gt;200 mg/dl).

          2. Patient is unable to comprehend the requirements of the study.

          3. Patient is unable to undergo scanning of the known or suspected lesion with the
             high-resolution PEM (PET) scanner (due to body habitus, inability to comply with
             positioning requirements, etc.).
