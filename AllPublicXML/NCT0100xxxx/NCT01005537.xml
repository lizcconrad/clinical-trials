      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Biological therapy, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy using autologous
      lymphocytes, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from
      growing. Aldesleukin may stimulate the lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. Giving
      cyclophosphamide together with autologous lymphocytes and aldesleukin may be an effective
      treatment for metastatic melanoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving cyclophosphamide
      together with autologous lymphocytes and aldesleukin and to see how well it works in treating
      patients with metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and toxicity of cellular adoptive immunotherapy with autologous
           tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) following cyclophosphamide conditioning and
           post-infusion aldesleukin (IL-2) in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Assess the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred lymphocytes.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the antitumor effect of adoptively transferred autologous TIL following
           cyclophosphamide conditioning and post-infusion IL-2 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2 and autologous
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) IV on day 0. Beginning 6 hours after TIL infusion,
      patients receive high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) IV three times daily on days 0-5 (for up to 14
      doses) OR low-dose IL-2 subcutaneously twice daily on days 0-14 (for up to 28 doses).
      Patients may then receive two additional courses of TILs and low-dose IL-2 (with or without
      cyclophosphamide), if indicated.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
