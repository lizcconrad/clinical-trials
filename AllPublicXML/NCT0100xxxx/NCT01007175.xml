    <textblock>
      This primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetic properties of multiple ascending doses of ATN-103 administered subcutaneously
      (below the skin) to Japanese subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis and on a stable
      background of methotrexate. Some subjects will receive ATN-103 while other subjects will
      receive a placebo.
