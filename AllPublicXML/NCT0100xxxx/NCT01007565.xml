    <textblock>
      The investigators undertook to evaluate early postoperative pain levels after the volar
      plating of distal radius fractures performed under regional anesthesia, and to determine
      whether periarticular multimodal drug injections into the joint, ligament, periosteum,
      subcutaneous tissue, and skin, and into interosseous and superficial radial nerves (as an
      additional sensory nerve block) provide additional pain management benefits.

    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether periarticular injections (PI) had additional pain management benefits,
      patients were randomly allocated to two groups, that is, the PI and No-PI groups, using a
      randomization table. Members in the PI group received intra-operative periarticular
      injections and additional sensory nerve blocks just before skin closure. For the
      periarticular injections and additional sensory block, local analgesic solution was injected
      into the wrist joint, joint capsule, periosteum, subcutaneous tissue, skin, and around the
      anterior and posterior interosseous nerves and the superficial radial nerve.

      A volume of 2ml was injected into the joint capsule and periosteum, and of 3ml into the wrist
      joint, subcutaneous tissue, skin and into each nerve. The anterior interosseous nerve was
      blocked in the course of the pronator quadratus and posterior interosseous nerve in the 4th
      dorsal extensor compartment.

      The mixture of anesthetics consisted of 2 ampules of ropivacaine HCl (Naropin®, 0.75%,
      7.5mg/ml, 20ml/ⓐ), 1 ampule of morphine sulfate (5mg/ⓐ), 1 ampule of epinephrine HCL (1mg/ml,
      1ml/ⓐ) and normal saline 20cc.
