  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) wants to learn more about the number of calories in
      almonds and the mechanisms of the health effects of almonds. Epidemiologic studies have
      demonstrated an inverse or no relationship between nut consumption and body weight, despite
      the fact that nuts are an energy dense food. Intervention studies have shown that consumption
      of nuts has no effect on body weight or an effect that is significantly less than predicted.
      Fecal analyses in studies with peanuts, almonds, and pecans have found increased fecal fat
      and energy loss with nut consumption; however studies with almonds are lacking.

      The objective of this study is to measure the energy value of almonds in the human diet and
      study molecular mechanisms that may help explain the beneficial health effects of almonds.

      Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an inverse or no relationship between nut consumption
      and body weight, despite the fact that nuts are an energy dense food. Intervention studies
      have shown that consumption of nuts has no effect on body weight or an effect that is
      significantly less than predicted. Fecal analyses in studies with peanuts, almonds, and
      pecans have found increased fecal fat and energy loss with nut consumption; however studies
      with almonds are lacking.

      Previous studies have suggested that nut consumption imparts a variety of health benefits,
      including reduction of cardiovascular disease and improved satiety. However, studies of
      almonds are extremely limited. The aim of this study is to determine the energy value of
      almonds in the human diet and to probe mechanisms by which almonds impart health benefits.
      The metabolizable energy value of almond nuts will be calculated based on the chemical
      composition and energy content of the consumed diet and excreta. This will provide a better
      estimate of the energy value of almonds than simply calculating energy value based on Atwater
      factors. In addition to determining the energy value of almonds, we will evaluate the effects
      of almond-rich diets on plasma phytonutrient levels and on gene expression changes to
      determine what protective mechanisms are activated by almond consumption.
