      This is an open trial of ziprasidone (ZIP) in children and adolescents. It is designed to
      provide pilot data on the magnitude of ZIP's antipsychotic effects in psychotic youth, dosing
      ranges, acute safety, and tolerability. This would then inform the design of a rigorous,
      randomized controlled trial of ZIP in the pediatric population. The primary study hypothesis
      is that the proportion of pediatric subjects responding to treatment with ziprasidone will be
      comparable or greater than reported in trials of ziprasidone in adults.

    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two phases: an eight week acute phase and a 44 week continuation
      phase for those subjects who show a response during the first eight weeks. All treatment will
      be open label and monitored by research clinicians with expertise in treating psychotic
      youth. The initial titration is relatively slow to minimize side effects. A flexible dose
      strategy in which each individual's ultimate dose is determined by his/her response and side
      effects will be used. The maximal dose will be 160mg split as a BID dose. We estimate that
      the average dose will be 120mg/d. Concurrent use of benztropine, propranolol, and
      benzodiazepines (lorazepam and clonazepam) will be permitted as needed to treat any emergent
      extrapyramidal side effects and agitation. Concurrent use of antidepressants and mood
      stabilizers will be permitted in those subjects who have been on stable doses of
      antidepressants or mood stabilizers for at least four weeks at time of entry, or those with
      emergence of significant affective symptoms during the maintenance phase of the study.

    <description>20mg pills, dosing will be flexible, ranging from 10 to 160 mg divided BID or TID for the duration of the 52 week trial. In very rare cases, if the subject has shown some benefit and no side effects at a dose of 160mg and the treating clinician feels a further dose increase is necessary, the case would need to be presented to all of the other Principal Investigators for special consideration of further dose increases in 20 mg increments to an absolute maximal dose of 220mg.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 6 and 19 years old, male or female.

          -  Significant psychotic symptoms defined by a behavior score of at least 4 (moderate) on
             at least one of the psychotic items of Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) at
             baseline.

          -  Subjects will meet DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
             schizophreniform disorder.

          -  Subjects will be free of depot antipsychotic medication for at least six months.

          -  Good physical health.

             willing to give informed consent.

             will be permitted during the first eight weeks of the study only if the patient has

             for the first 8 weeks unless change or discontinuation is clinically indicated.
