    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to analyze tumour tissue from a group of subjects with renal
      cell carcinoma, who have been treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cancers have different clinical outcomes. The principal research objective is to study
      tumour tissue from renal cancer patients and try and understand why some cancers progress
      more rapidly than others. Further, another key aim of this study is to try and understand why
      some patients respond to treatment and others do not.
