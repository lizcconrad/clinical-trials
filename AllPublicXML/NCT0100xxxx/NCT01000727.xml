    <textblock>
      This study will test whether darapladib can safely lower the chances of having a
      cardiovascular event (such as a heart attack or urgent coronary revascularization (e.g.
      medical procedures performed to restore the normal blood flow in patients with
      atherosclerosis)) when treatment is started within 30 days after an acute coronary syndrome
      (also called ACS).

      Subjects who qualify for the study will be randomized 1:1 to either darapladib or placebo
      administered in addition to standard therapy. Following the baseline visit, subjects will be
      expected to return for clinic visits at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and every 6 months until
      the end of the study.

    <description>Coronary heart disease (CHD) death=occurrence of a fatal myocardial infarction (MI), death caused by documented cardiac arrest, death resulting from heart failure in a participant with known CHD, death from other forms of acute/chronic CHD, unwitnessed death of unknown origin, or sudden death. Acute MI=evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia. Prior MI diagnosed post-randomization (e.g., silent MI)=the development of new pathological Q waves with/without symptoms OR imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a nonischemic cause (pre-event imaging data required for verification of new abnormality), OR pathological findings of a healed/healing MI. Urgent coronary revascularization (CR) for MI=ischemic discomfort at rest that prompted CR during the same hospitalization or resulted in hospital transfer for the purpose of CR.</description>

Acute MI=evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia. Prior MI diagnosed post-randomization (e.g., silent MI)=the development of new pathological Q waves with/without symptoms OR imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a nonischemic cause (pre-event imaging data required for verification of new abnormality), OR pathological findings of a healed/healing MI. Urgent coronary revascularization (CR) for MI=ischemic discomfort at rest that prompted CR during the same hospitalization or resulted in hospital transfer for the purpose of CR.</description>

        <description>CHD death, acute MI, and prior MI diagnosed post-randomization are defined in the primary endpoint (major coronary events). Hospitalization for unstable angina=one of the following, but not fulfilling the criteria for MI: ischemic discomfort at rest associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes leading to hospitalization; ischemic discomfort at rest regardless of ECG changes leading to hospitalization and revascularization during the same admission; ischemic discomfort at rest in hospital associated with ECG changes; ischemic discomfort at rest in hospital without ECG changes resulting in revascularization during the same admission. NOTE: The event was not considered to be unstable angina if, after invasive/non-invasive testing or other diagnostic testing, the discomfort was found not to be caused by myocardial ischemia. Coronary revascularization procedures exclude PCI planned prior to randomization but performed after randomization.</description>

        <description>Acute MI is defined as evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia. Prior MI diagnosed post-randomization (e.g., silent MI)=the development of new pathological Q waves with/without symptoms OR imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a non-ischemic cause (pre-event imaging data required for verification of new abnormality), OR pathological findings of a healed/healing MI.
