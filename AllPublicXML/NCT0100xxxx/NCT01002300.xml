  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigations into the components of cognition damaged in frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
      demonstrate that patients with FTD show deficits in facial and verbal expression recognition,
      lack insight into what others think or might do (theory of mind skills), and in decision
      making tasks requiring processing of positive versus negative feedback. These cognitive
      functions are thought to be critical for appropriate social behavioural regulation (Blair,
      2003). Recent studies in animal models and humans suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin is
      an important mediator of social behavior and that oxytocin may facilitate emotion
      recognition, theory of mind processing, and prosocial behaviors (Donaldson and Young, 2008).
      Together, these findings suggest that upregulation of oxytocin dependent mechanisms of social
      and emotional cognition may be a valuable treatment approach in patients with FTD. The aim of
      this study is to determine how administration of intranasal oxytocin to patients with
      frontotemporal dementia affects behavior and processing of specific types of social and
      emotional information.The investigators' hypothesis is that oxytocin administration will
      improve emotional and social cognitive deficits in patients with FTD, resulting in improved
      decision making and behaviour.

    <description>Participants will receive 24 IU of oxytocin or placebo (Salinex saline nasal spray) intranasally 30 minutes prior to completing the experimental tasks. Two weeks later participants will return for a second visit and receive the alternate drug (either intranasal oxytocin or Salinex) prior to completing the experimental tasks.</description>
