  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The entire study protocol will last 13 weeks. Women will be randomly assigned to one of two
      experimental groups: high and low protein. All women will consume their unrestricted habitual
      diet during week 1 while baseline testing and measurements are taken. Starting at week 2,
      women in both groups will be counseled to consume a 750 kcal/day energy deficit diet
      containing either the RDA (LP group) or more than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) (HP
      group) for protein. The energy restriction period will continue for 12 weeks (through study
      week 13) and is expected to result in body weight reduction of approximately 17 pounds.
      Testing and measurements will be repeated during week 13.

    <description>Subjects will be required to follow their seven day menu plan for the 12 weeks of intervention. The HP menus will contain 30% protein, 45% carbohydrate, and 25% fat.

    <description>Subjects will be required to follow their seven day menu plan for the 12 weeks of intervention. The LP group menus will contain 18% protein, 57% carbohydrate, 25% fat. The LP group will follow a lacto-ovo vegetarian menu with no striated tissue foods. Subjects in the LP group will be provided with selected, portioned dairy products.</description>
