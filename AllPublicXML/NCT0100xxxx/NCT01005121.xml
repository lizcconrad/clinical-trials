      Patients with diabetic nephropathy and proteinuria, despite maximal anti- hypertensive and
      anti-glucose treatment, will receive colchicine for six months, 2 mg a day, during which
      their 24 hour urine protein and renal function tests will be monitored. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that colchicine will diminish proteinuria and might also help slow down the
      development of end stage renal failure in the long run.
