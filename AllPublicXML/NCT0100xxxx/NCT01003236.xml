  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable evidence that increased blood glucose results in the generation of
      reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to increased oxidative stress in a variety of
      tissues. This may lead to the activation of stress-sensitive intracellular signaling
      pathways, causing cellular damage and late complications of diabetes including renal injury.
      Although the investigators understanding of how hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress
      ultimately leads to tissue damage has advanced considerably in recent years, effective
      therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the development of this damage remain limited. The
      flavonoid complex silymarin, an extract from the milk thistle, and its major pharmacological
      active component silibinin are free radical scavengers and potent membrane stabilizers by
      preventing lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, during early stages of diabetes, flavonoids
      minimize oxidative stress, and inflammation which represent important factors in the
      development of diabetic nephropathy.

      In this study the investigators plan to evaluate the renoprotective effect of milk thistle
      extract on type II diabetic patients with kidney disease.
