  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that circulating endothelial cells (CECs) harbor key
      genetic and structural characteristics predisposing individuals to acute atherosclerotic
      plaque rupture and heart attack.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial injury and inflammation are pivotal underlying processes that put patients at
      risk for catastrophic vascular events including acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)
      and stroke. We seek to accelerate scientific discovery through clinically meaningful,
      innovative translational research, and are collaborating in a trans-disciplinary effort to
      define the DNA sequence of CECs and that of germ line DNA, along with RNA sequencing, mRNA
      expression profiling, and ultrastructural characterization of CECs in order to better
      understand the mechanisms leading to acute arterial plaque rupture and embolization of
      arterial endothelial cells in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This will enable us
      to create a molecular fingerprint that could identify and preempt individuals from suffering
      from such debilitating vascular conditions.

      Blood for each patient will be collected from arterial access established as part of standard
      of care or via venipuncture. Blood must be collected in the order listed below. By drawing
      the PAX gene tube first, the likelihood of contamination of the sample with vessel wall
      endothelial cells is decreased.

      Enrollment:

        1. x 8.5 ml PAX gene (blue top) tube

        2. x 10 ml EDTA purple top tubes

      Follow-up visits: (healthy controls only)

        Subjects will be recruited from the general in-patient and out-patient populations for
        myocardial infarction and/or vascular surgery. Healthy controls will be recruited from the
        general medical population and community.
