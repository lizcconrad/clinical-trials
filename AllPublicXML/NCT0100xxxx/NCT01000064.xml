  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether Vyvanse, a psychostimulant, can
      help with attention deficits due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Vyvanse is currently
      approved for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity (ADHD). The exact effects this
      drug may have on attention deficits caused by TBI are not known, but we expect that Vyvanse
      will be of some help in treating those types of problems as well. The study will utilize
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods, as well as neurobehavioral measures, to
      elucidate neural mechanisms of response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of inattentiveness, impulsivity, and poor persistence have been observed in both
      children and adults following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These often are among the most
      prominent symptoms manifested and may contribute to interference in a variety of other
      functional domains. Although there has been some use of psychostimulant medication to treat
      TBI-acquired attention deficits, it remains a relatively uncommon clinical practice. This
      study, by highlighting mechanisms of action, could serve to promote the appropriate use of
      this type of treatment for the patients.

    <measure>Assessment of Various Components of Attention, Related Cognitive Processes and ADHD Symptoms, Using Conners Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Preservations represent responses in which reaction time was less than 100 ms; these responses are assumed to be anticipatory, random, or slow/inattentive (i.e., carried over from the previous response) because it is physiologically impossible to respond accurately in so short a time. Higher T-scores, percentiles, and means indicate worse performance.</description>

    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Block Change measures inattention and vigilance. Lower values indicate less slowing in RT as the test progressed. High T-scores indicate decreased vigilance over time.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) Change assesses the ability to adapt to changing inter-stimulus intervals. Inter-stimulus intervals refers to the amount of time between presentation of stimuli. High t-scores indicate that RT increased as the ISI increased; negative values indicate that RT decreased as the ISI increased.
Less Hit RT ISI Change indicates less variability in RT depending on the speed of presentation.</description>

    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Standard Error (SE) measures inattention. Consistency of response times is measured by the standard error for responses to targets. Higher values indicate a greater amount of inattention.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Digit Span repeats strings of digits of increasing length said by the examiner in the same (forward) and in reverse (backward) order. It measures working memory and concentration with a range of scaled scores from 1-19, with higher scaled scores indicating better performance when compared to population norms.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Various Components of Attention, Related Cognitive Processes and ADHD Symptoms, Using the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale: Long Form (CAARS:L) &quot;Inattention/Memory Problems&quot; Sub-scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAARS:L is an assessment tool that prompts an observer to provide valuable information about the client. This instrument is helpful when considering a diagnosis of ADHD or related problem. High scores on the &quot;Inattention/Memory Problems&quot; sub-scale may indicate difficulty in concentration, difficulty planning or completing tasks, forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, and/or being disorganized.
T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) are used to measure ratings with higher t-scores indicating greater inattention and memory problems. When a t-score is around 60, this indicates greater risk.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF-A is a standardized rating scale developed to observe everyday behaviors associated with specific domains of the executive functions in adults ages 18 to 90 years. The &quot;Organization of Materials&quot; scale measures orderliness of work, living, and storage spaces.
T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) are used to interpret the individual's level of executive functioning on the BRIEF-A, with higher scores indicating more difficulty in a particular area.</description>

        <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Preservations represent responses in which reaction time was less than 100 ms; these responses are assumed to be anticipatory, random, or slow/inattentive (i.e., carried over from the previous response) because it is physiologically impossible to respond accurately in so short a time. Higher T-scores, percentiles, and means indicate worse performance.</description>

CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) Change assesses the ability to adapt to changing inter-stimulus intervals. Inter-stimulus intervals refers to the amount of time between presentation of stimuli. High t-scores indicate that RT increased as the ISI increased; negative values indicate that RT decreased as the ISI increased.
Less Hit RT ISI Change indicates less variability in RT depending on the speed of presentation.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Various Components of Attention, Related Cognitive Processes and ADHD Symptoms, Using the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale: Long Form (CAARS:L) &quot;Inattention/Memory Problems&quot; Sub-scale.</title>
        <description>The CAARS:L is an assessment tool that prompts an observer to provide valuable information about the client. This instrument is helpful when considering a diagnosis of ADHD or related problem. High scores on the &quot;Inattention/Memory Problems&quot; sub-scale may indicate difficulty in concentration, difficulty planning or completing tasks, forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, and/or being disorganized.
T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) are used to measure ratings with higher t-scores indicating greater inattention and memory problems. When a t-score is around 60, this indicates greater risk.</description>

          <title>Assessment of Various Components of Attention, Related Cognitive Processes and ADHD Symptoms, Using the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale: Long Form (CAARS:L) &quot;Inattention/Memory Problems&quot; Sub-scale.</title>
          <description>The CAARS:L is an assessment tool that prompts an observer to provide valuable information about the client. This instrument is helpful when considering a diagnosis of ADHD or related problem. High scores on the &quot;Inattention/Memory Problems&quot; sub-scale may indicate difficulty in concentration, difficulty planning or completing tasks, forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, and/or being disorganized.
T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) are used to measure ratings with higher t-scores indicating greater inattention and memory problems. When a t-score is around 60, this indicates greater risk.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Various Components of Attention, Related Cognitive Processes and ADHD Symptoms, Using the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) &quot;Organization of Materials&quot; Sub-scale.</title>
        <description>The BRIEF-A is a standardized rating scale developed to observe everyday behaviors associated with specific domains of the executive functions in adults ages 18 to 90 years. The &quot;Organization of Materials&quot; scale measures orderliness of work, living, and storage spaces.
T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) are used to interpret the individual’s level of executive functioning on the BRIEF-A, with higher scores indicating more difficulty in a particular area.</description>
