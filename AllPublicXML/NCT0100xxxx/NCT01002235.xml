  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of injecting VM202 in the
      leg muscle in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (DPN). The study will also assess the
      potential of VM202 to reduce the pain associated with DPN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is a serious complication of diabetes. This form of neuropathy carries
      a high risk of pain, trophic changes and autonomic dysfunction.

      Currently, there are no approved drugs or interventional strategies known to halt or reverse
      the progression of DPN. Treatments target pain reduction, physical function improvement,
      reduction of psychological distress, and quality of life improvements.

      There is currently no effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy, and good glycemic control
      is the only way to minimize the risk of occurrence. Clearly, it would be desirable to
      prevent, impede, or reverse the disrupting and often life-threatening manifestations of
      peripheral neuropathy by stimulating growth or regeneration of peripheral nerve axons.
