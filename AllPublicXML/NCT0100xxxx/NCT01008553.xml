  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fentanyl in opioid-naive
      participants with post-herpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome or post-operative
      pain syndrome who cannot obtain a sufficient analgesic effect by the treatment of non-opioid
      analgesics (drug used to control pain).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center (conducted in more than one center), double-blind (neither the
      participant nor the physician knows the assigned study drug), randomized (participants
      assigned study drug by chance), withdrawal study in opioid-naive participants with
      post-herpetic neuralgia (intense, typically intermittent pain along the course of a nerve
      caused by the varicella zoster virus), complex regional pain syndrome or post-operative pain
      syndrome. The study will consist of titration period (10-29 days) and double-blind period (12
      weeks) and the visits will include Day 5-7, 8, 15, 22, 29 in titration period and Day 2-4, 8,
      15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71 and 85 in double-blind period. All the eligible participants will
      receive one-day adhesive transdermal patch (patch containing a drug that is put on the skin
      so the drug will enter the body through the skin) of either fentanyl at the dose ranging from
      12.5 to 50 microgram/hour or matching placebo. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by time
      to withdrawal due to insufficient analgesic efficacy. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

          <description>One-day adhesive transdermal patch (patch containing a drug that is put on the skin so the drug will enter the body through the skin) containing fentanyl (JNS020QD) applied to chest, abdomen, upper arm or thigh and replaced every day, starting at the dose of 12.5 microgram per hour (mcg/hr) for at least first 2 days, which was increased by 12.5 mcg/hr at one time based on the medical examination of number of rescue treatments and visual analog scale (VAS) of the participants. The dose was increased up to maximum of 50 mcg/hr. The treatment was continued for 10-29 days and then the eligible participants from this group were randomly assigned to either of the two groups in the double-blind period.</description>

          <title>Fentanyl (Double-blind Period)</title>
          <description>Participants meeting the pre-defined criteria for transfer from titration period to double-blind period and randomly assigned to fentanyl group, were administered one-day adhesive transdermal patch containing fentanyl, applied to chest, abdomen, upper arm or thigh and replaced every day, the dose of which was same as the final application dose in the titration period (in the range of 12.5 to 50 mcg/hr). The treatment was continued for 12 weeks.</description>

          <description>Participants meeting the pre-defined criteria for transfer from titration period to double-blind period and randomly assigned to placebo group, were administered one-day adhesive transdermal placebo patch indistinguishable from fentanyl in appearance, applied to chest, abdomen, upper arm or thigh and replaced every day. The dose of fentanyl (from titration period) was gradually decreased to prevent withdrawal symptoms and the dose of the matching placebo was gradually increased up to same dose as the final application dose in the titration period (in the range of 12.5 to 50 mcg/hr). The treatment was continued for 12 weeks.</description>

        <description>The BPI-sf total score is an average of the pain interference score (mean value for the nine BPI-sf questions [questions inquiring about the extent of interference with activities by pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes)]) and pain subscale score (mean value for the scores for BPI-sf questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 [questions inquiring about the extent of pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine)]). Total score ranges from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating more pain.</description>
