      The objective of this study is to determine if concentrations of maraviroc in semen exceed
      the 50% and 95% inhibitory concentrations of HIV during the dose interval.

      The secondary objective is to determine the extent of maraviroc penetration into semen by
      obtaining semen to plasma ratios across the dosing interval, to determine the area under the
      concentration time curve of maraviroc in semen, and to determine the variability in the
      penetration of maraviroc into the seminal compartment over the maraviroc dosing period.

      The patient population will consist of 12 male HIV-positive patients who have been receiving
      stable antiretroviral therapy that includes maraviroc for a minimum of three months. Patients
      will be enrolled from one clinic in downtown Toronto and a hospital affiliated HIV specialty
      clinic in Ottawa, Ontario. Eligible patients will have evidence of full virologic suppression
      (HIV viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL) at least one month prior to enrollment in the study. No
      changes will be made to the patients antiretroviral therapy during the course of the study.

    <measure>Semen to Plasma Ratio of HIV Concentration During the Dosing Interval for Dar, Evr, Mar &amp; Ral.</measure>
    <time_frame>Semen samples were collected 30 minutes to 1 hour before the morning dose of medication (day 1), and then at hours 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 postdrug ingestion on days 2-6. Blood samples were collected within 1 hour of the semen sample.</time_frame>
    <description>We used a staggered sampling approach in which semen samples were produced by participants over several days at different sampling times relative to the morning dose of antiretrovirals. Speciﬁ- cally, semen samples were collected 30 minutes to 1 hour before the morning dose of medication (day 1), and then at hours 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 postdrug ingestion on days 2-6. We collected corresponding blood samples within 1 hour of the semen sample. For each participant a single value (the HIV concentration ratio) was calculated as the minimum HIV concentration in the semen over the minimum HIV concentration in the blood throughout the dosing interval.</description>

        <description>For each participant, the Maraviroc penetration ratio was calculated as the maximum Maraviroc concentration in the semen over the maximum Maraviroc concentration in the blood throughout the dosing interval.</description>
        <time_frame>Semen samples were collected 30 minutes to 1 hour before the morning dose of medication (day 1), and then at hours 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 postdrug ingestion on days 2-6. Blood samples were collected within 1 hour of the semen sample</time_frame>

Measuring semen samples: Measure semen sample concentrations, obtain semen to plasma ratios across the dosing interval, the area under the concentration time curve of maraviroc in semen, the variability in the penetration of maraviroc into the seminal compartment over the raltegravir dosing period.</description>
