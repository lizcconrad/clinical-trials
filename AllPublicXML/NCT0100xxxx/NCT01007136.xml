  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine whether application of a non-invasive battery powered device
      called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can improve recovery of hand weakness
      after stroke beyond what is achievable with rehabilitative treatment alone.
