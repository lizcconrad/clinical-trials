  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single center registry of patients who have received a Xience V everolimus-eluting stent at
      the Washington Hospital Center, with the primary objective to assess clinical success and
      safety at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year post-implantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventional cardiology was revolutionized by the invention of stents, initially with the
      bare-metal stents (BMS) and recently with the drug-eluting stents (DES). The everolimus
      eluting, Xience V stents have shown very promising results in randomized clinical trials,
      demonstrating a reduction of clinical and angiographic restenosis in comparison to BMS, and
      comparable clinically-driven target lesion revascularization rates in comparison with
      sirolimus-eluting stents. While registry data is available from outside of the United States,
      it will be important to collect &quot;real-world&quot; data regarding the stent usage and outcomes in
      the United States. In this study we propose to follow patients who received at least one
      Xience VÂ® Stent for at least 1 year post initial stent implantation.
