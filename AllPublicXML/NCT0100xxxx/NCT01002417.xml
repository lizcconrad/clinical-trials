  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is to examine whether MCS-2 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

      This is an adaptive trial design, that combines elements of a Phase 2b (dose ranging) study
      and a Phase 3 (hypothesis testing) study, the objectives for the two phases are separate.

      Phase 2b Objectives: The primary objective of the Phase 2b portion of this study is to
      evaluate, in a treatment-naïve population, the 0 mg (placebo), 15 mg, and 30 mg MCS-2 in
      terms of dose response and to determine the optimal dose to be used in the Phase 3 portion of
      this trial. The secondary objective of this portion of the study is to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of the 15 mg and 30 mg MCS-2.

      Phase 3 Objectives: The primary objective of the Phase 3 portion of this study is to
      evaluate, in a treatment-naïve population, the effectiveness of the MCS-2 (at the dosage
      determined in the Phase 2b portion of this study), as compared to MCS placebo (0 mg), in
      reducing the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia
      (BPH). The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      MCS-2 (at the dosage determined in the Phase 2b portion of this study), as compared to MCS
      placebo (0 mg).
