  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy profile of rectally administered
      budesonide foam administered as 2mg/25mL BID for 2 weeks followed by 2mg/25mL QD for 4 weeks,
      as compared to an equivalent volume of rectally administered placebo foam over the same
      dosing schedule, in subjects who present with a diagnosis of active, mild to moderate,
      ulcerative proctitis (UP) or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS). During the study, eligible
      subjects will be allowed to maintain previously established oral 5-ASA treatment at doses up
      to 4.8g/day.

      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess
      the efficacy and safety of budesonide foam in subjects with active mild to moderate proctitis
      or proctosigmoiditis. Approximately 430 subjects will be enrolled into the study and receive
      either placebo foam or budesonide foam twice a day for 2 weeks followed by once a day for 4
      weeks. Participation in the study will last approximately 11 weeks, depending on the timing
      of study visits.

      During the study, eligible subjects will be allowed to maintain previously established oral
      5-ASA treatment at doses up to 4.8g/day. Periodic safety monitoring, including physical
      examinations, vitals, laboratory testing, and recording of AEs and concomitant medications,
      will be performed during the study
