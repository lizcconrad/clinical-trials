      Research Hypothesis: Administration of BMS-663068, a prodrug for HIV attachment inhibitor
      BMS-626529, will result in a mean decrease of at least 1 log10 in HIV RNA at Day 9 following
      8 days of therapy in at least one dosing regimen that is safe and well tolerated in Clade B
      HIV-1 infected subjects.
