    <measure>Achievement of Sustained Difference in Inhibition of Intragastric Acidity Based on Median pH Values Between the Two Active Study Treatments at Steady-state on Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment dose to 4-hr post-dose on Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Median intragastric pH scores were collected at 5 minute intervals after treatment dose. The achievement of sustained difference was the earliest time for which a statistically significant difference was observed in the median intragastric pH scores for 3 consecutive 5-minute intervals. The earliest 3 time points for which a statistically significant difference was observed between the median intragastric pH values for the two active treatments for three consecutive 5-minute intervals are shown here.</description>

    <description>Median intragastric pH scores were collected at 5 minute intervals after treatment dose.

        <title>The Difference in the Onset of Action Based on Median pH Values Between the Two Active Treatments Compared to No Treatment on Day 1 and Day 7</title>
        <description>Median intragastric pH scores were collected at 5 minute intervals after treatment dose. The difference in the onset of action was the earliest 5 minute interval (from start of interval to end of interval) for which each active treatment presented a statistically significantly advantage over No treatment based on median pH values. The earliest 5 minute interval showing the difference in onset of action is reported here.</description>
