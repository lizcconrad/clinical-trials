      The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the LensAR laser system to
      surgically intervene within the crystalline lens. The primary goal of this initial study is
      to establish safety parameters as compared with conventional phacoemulsification procedures,
      and to evaluate the ability to provide an accurate and consistent anterior capsular opening
      (capsulotomy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must sign and be given a copy of the written informed consent form.

          -  Subjects must have elected to undergo lens extraction and foldable monofocal IOL
             implantation (ideally of the same type), and then elect to have the LensAR laser
             surgery.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations for a
             minimum of 12 months after surgery.

          -  Central 8 mm of clear cornea without vascularization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with prior anterior segment or vitreo-retinal surgical intervention in the
             eye to be treated.

          -  Subjects with lenticular cataracts with nuclear grading greater than Grade 4 on the
             LOCS III scale.

          -  Subjects who cannot attain ocular dilation of 7.0 mm.

          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology in the eye to be treated that is not directly
             improved by lens extraction and IOL implantation.

          -  Subjects with residual, recurrent, active ocular or uncontrolled eyelid disease or any
             corneal abnormalities (including endothelial dystrophy, guttata, recurrent corneal
             erosion, etc.) in the eye to be treated.

          -  Subjects with ophthalmoscopic signs of keratoconus (or keratoconus suspect) in the eye
             to be treated.

          -  Subjects with a history of severe dry eye not responding to therapy.

          -  Subjects with macular degeneration, history of retinal detachment, or any other fundus
             findings that would pose a risk to safety or an acceptable visual outcome in the eye
             to be treated.

          -  Subjects with a history of herpes zoster or herpes simplex keratitis.

          -  Subjects who have a history of steroid-responsive rise in intraocular pressure,
             glaucoma, or are a glaucoma suspect.

          -  Subjects with diabetic retinopathy, autoimmune disease, connective tissue disease,
             pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or clinically significant atopic syndrome.

          -  Subjects on chronic systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy that
             may affect wound healing, and any immuno-compromised subjects.

          -  Subjects who are using ophthalmic medication(s) other than artificial tears for
             treatment of ocular pathology including ocular allergy.

          -  Subjects using systemic medications with significant ocular side effects.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or of child-bearing potential and not practicing
             a medically approved method of birth control.

          -  Subjects with known sensitivity to planned study concomitant medications.

          -  Subjects who are participating in any other ophthalmic drug or device clinical trial
             during the time of this clinical investigation.
