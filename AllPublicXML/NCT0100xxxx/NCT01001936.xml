      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral SKI-606 (100,
      200, 300 or 400 mg) administered on a daily schedule to subjects with advanced malignant
      solid tumors and to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in this subject population. This
      study will also obtain preliminary information on the pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity
      of orally administered SKI-606 in subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors

             which no effective therapy is available

          2. Recovery from acute adverse effects of prior therapies to Â£ Grade 1 (excluding
             alopecia)

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 1

          4. Adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function

          5. Age 20 to 74 years

          6. Willingness of male and female subjects, who are not surgically sterile or
             postmenopausal, to use reliable methods of birth control for the duration of the study
             and for 6 months and 30 days after the last dose of test article for male and female,
             respectively

          7. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any systemic antitumor agents or any investigational agent within 28 days
             before the enrollment (42 days if the previous chemotherapy included nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C)

          2. Ongoing clinical requirement for administration of a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4

          3. Prior exposure to SKI-606 or any other Src-kinase inhibitor

          4. Major surgery or radiotherapy within 2 weeks before the enrollment (recovery from
             previous surgery should be complete before day 1)

          5. Subjects unable or unwilling to swallow SKI-606 capsules

          6. Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, as indicated by clinical symptoms,
             cerebral edema, requirement for corticosteroids and/or progressive growth

          7. Recent or ongoing clinically-significant gastrointestinal disorder

          8. Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          9. Subjects who meet the following criteria:
