  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze changes in core body- and skin temperature during
      pre-hospital and early in-hospital treatment of multi-traumatized patients. The researchers
      want to investigate when trauma patients get cold and to what extent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia is a common finding in severely traumatized patients. Decreases in core
      temperature during the course of initial evaluation and resuscitation are common, and can
      contribute to poor outcomes in multi-traumatized patients.

      In this study the temperature will be recorded continually with multiple skin probes and an
      ear-probe from the site of the accident to arrival in the intensive care unit (including time
      in primary surgery, if any).
