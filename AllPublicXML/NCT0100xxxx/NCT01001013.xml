      The objective of the study is to investigate the drug interaction between LC15-0444 and
      pioglitazone by comparing the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of LC15-0444 and
      pioglitazone are administered concomitantly and each alone in healthy male subjects.

      This study is a randomized, open-label, three-treatment, three-period, three-sequence and
      crossover design in healthy volunteers to evaluate tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics
      after the multiple administration of LC15-0444 and pioglitazone concomitantly or each alone.

      Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined by demographic information,
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
      within 3 weeks(-21 d ~ -2 d) before drug administration(1 d). Eligible subjects will be
      randomized to one of three sequence groups.

      According to the characteristics of anti-diabetic drugs, it is expected to be administered
      with other anti-diabetic drugs. Therefore, Drug-Drug Interaction with Pioglitazone should be
      identified in this trial.
