  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of allergic rhinitis is high and appears to be rising worldwide. Therefore, it
      is important and necessary to understand and visualize therapy effects on this disease. In
      this study we will demonstrate the effect of levocetirizine on nasal cavity dimensions by
      assessing not only standard nasal flow diagnostics such as rhinomanometry and acoustic
      rhinometry, but supplement exami¬nation procedures with long-term rhinometry and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). With the aid of a virtual model and computer fluid dynamics, we are
      able to simulate nasal air flow and provide three-dimensional visualization of the computed
      flow.

      In previous trials ([Bachert], [deBlic], [Day] and [Deruaz]) it has been shown that allergic
      symptoms, especially nasal congestion, diminish significantly under treatment with
      levocetirizine. We will demonstrate this anti-obstructive effect by comparing the reaction to
      nasal allergen challenge before and after four-week treatment with levocetirizine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be informed and give written informed consent for study participation

          -  Subject must be able to adhere to dose and visit schedules and meet study requirements

          -  Subject must be aged 18 to 65 (inclusive); gender and race are irrelevant

          -  Subject must have at least a two-year history of allergic rhinitis consistent with
             persistent allergic rhinitis (defined as symptoms of allergic rhinitis present on four
             days or more per week or for four or more consecutive weeks per year)

          -  In the previous pollen season, subject must have been sufficiently symptomatic, with a
             T6SS (reflective) symptoms severity score of at least 10 (out of max. 18). (Symptoms
             include nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, congestion, conjunctival itching, redness
             and tearing graded on a scale of 0 -absent, 1 - mild, 2 - moderate, 3 - severe)

          -  Subject must have a positive skin prick test at screening to one or more allergens in
             the local panel of seasonal allergens (e.g. grass, tree pollen), but not to perennial
             allergens. Subject must demonstrate an antigen-induced skin prick wheal of at least
             3mm greater in diameter than the diluent control.

          -  Subject must have had a positive nasal allergen challenge within the previous six
             months. (see [Riechelmann])

          -  Nonsterile or premenopausal female subjects must use a medically accepted method of
             birth control, e.g. oral contraceptives

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to fulfill all of the above mentioned inclusion criteria

          -  Insufficient ability to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the
             study

          -  Insufficient legal competence or insufficient knowledge of the German language

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the previous three months

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Positive skin prick test to frequently occurring perennial allergens, e.g. house dust
             mites, cats

          -  History of anaphylaxis and/or severe local reactions to skin testing with allergens

          -  Intolerable symptoms that would make participating in the study unbearable, especially
             the 45 min MRI-session

          -  Any viral inflammation of the upper respiratory system, acute or chronic sinusitis,
             rhinitis medicamentosa, nasal polyps, clinically relevant anatomic deviations of the
             nose, active or inactive tuberculosis of the respiratory tract, or asthma other than
             mild intermittent asthma treated with ß2-agonists on an as-needed basis

          -  Any kind of clinically significant disease, especially any signs of active persistent
             allergic rhinitis, which would interfere with the study evaluations.

          -  Known intolerance to levocetirizine or any other components of the study drugs

          -  Surgery of the nose or the nasal sinuses within the previous six months

          -  Any deviation from the norm in the physical investigation of any disease which in the
             investigator's judgment might require impermissible medication, influence study
             performance and results or affect the patients safety

          -  Intake of drugs which might interfere with the study results

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse
