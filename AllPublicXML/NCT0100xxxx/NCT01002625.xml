  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-04457845 has been shown to temporarily decrease the dream (REM) period of sleep in rats,
      which suggests that PF-04457845 is active in rat's brains. This study is designed to see
      whether this is also the case in man.

    <textblock>
      The trial was terminated prematurely December 3, 2009 owing to an operational error. There
      were no safety or efficacy concerns relating to the study and the decision to terminate the
      trial.
