    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether combination therapy with farletuzumab
      (MORAb-003), carboplatin, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is safe.

    <textblock>
      Farletuzumab (MORAb-003) is a monoclonal antibody that has the potential to be an effective
      agent against epithelial ovarian cancer (including primary fallopian tube and peritoneal
      adenocarcinoma) in combination with other drugs. Farletuzumab works by a different mechanism
      from other cancer therapeutics and has been shown to be well tolerated. This study allows the
      opportunity to determine if the combination therapy of farletuzumab, carboplatin, and PLD

        1. is safe, or

        2. to assess the potential drug-drug interaction, and

        3. to prolong response to chemotherapy.

    <description>All subjects will receive approximately 6 cycles with carboplatin (AUC5-6) i.v. and PLD (30 mg/m2) i.v. on Day 1 of every 4-week Combination treatment cycle. In addition, subjects will also receive weekly farletuzumab at 2.5 mg/kg administered i.v. Following completion of the Combination treatment period (carboplatin/PLD/farletuzumab therapy),maintenance treatment with single agent farletuzumab will be administered once Q3W at 7.5 mg/kg until disease progression as defined by GCIG CA-125 (i.e., CA-125 is less than or equal to 2 Ã— (ULN) documented on 2 occasions) or modified RECIST v.1.0 using CT or MRI.</description>
