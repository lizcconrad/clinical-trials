  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if the combination of ABT-888 and
      temozolomide is safe and effective in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.
      ABT-888 works by obstructing a DNA enzyme called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which
      helps repair cancer cells damaged by chemotherapy. By blocking the PARP enzyme, the cancer
      cells are unable to repair themselves and as a result die. The other drug in this study is
      temozolomide. Temozolomide is designed to damage DNA in order to prevent cancer cells from
      reproducing. Because PARP inhibitors, such as ABT-888, prevent cancer cells from repairing
      their own DNA, they enhance the potential of chemotherapy therapy like temozolomide to induce
      cell death. The combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide has been used in a clinical trial for
      treatment of other cancers and information for this research study suggests that the
      combination may help to inhibit growth in breast cancer.

      ONLY THE EXPANSION COHORT BELOW IS RECRUITING:

      BRCA CARRIER EXPANSION COHORT: The purpose of the expansion cohort is to further evaluate the
      activity and safety of this combination in BRCA mutation carriers with metastatic breast
      cancer.

      -  Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days. Participants will be given a supply of ABT-88 in the
           form of capsules which they will take twice daily on days 1-7 of each cycle.
           Temozolomide is also in capsule form and will be taken once daily on days 1-5 of each
           cycle.

        -  Participants will come into the clinic on day 1 of each cycle and will have the
           following tests and procedures performed: physical examination, vital signs and blood
           tests.

        -  On day 15 of cycles 1 and 2 and day 22 of each cycle, participants will have blood work
           done.

        -  An assessment fo the tumor by CT scan of the participants chest, abdomen and pelvis will
           be done every 2 cycles.
