      The aim of this study is to determine possible molecular changes on large scale gene
      expression profiling after treatment with Metvix photodynamic therapy (PDT) of actinic
      keratoses (AK) and cancerised field in renal transplant recipients.

    <textblock>
      Transplant recipients have an increased propensity to develop multiple areas field of
      cancerisation and subsequently to develop multiple actinic keratoses, which demonstrate an
      increased transformation rate into invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The incidence of
      cutaneous premalignant epithelial lesions such as actinic keratosis (AK) is increased
      compared with the immunocompetent population with a mean occurrence of 38% after 5 years of
      immunosuppression, compared with &lt;5% in the immunocompetent patients. Since the development
      of multiple AKs may portend further possibility extensive cutaneous carcinogenesis, early and
      aggressive treatment is essential to prevent the progression to invasive SCC.

      Although they may occur as single lesion, multiple actinic keratoses (AKs) are commonly
      present in areas of chronic actinic damage (field of AKs or field of cancerisation). The
      concept of &quot;field cancerisation&quot; suggests that the clinically normal appearing skin around
      AKs provides the basis for clonal expansion of genetically altered neoplastic cells. This is
      called sub-clinical AK lesions.

      In this study, the whole target area defined by the investigator will be treated by Metvix
      PDT: this means that both lesions and sub-clinical lesions will be exposed to Metvix PDT.
      Biopsies will be performed in both regions: lesional and peri-lesional ones. This will allow
      us to compare pre and post treatment molecular changes that occurred in these regions and so
      to evaluate if Metvix PDT acts on the sub-clinical lesions.
