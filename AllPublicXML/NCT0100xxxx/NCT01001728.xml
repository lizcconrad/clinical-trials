  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, two-arm, non-blinded crossover study investigating the impact of treatment
      position (prone versus supine) upon reproducibility of tumour bed position in patients
      undergoing breast radiotherapy following excision of early breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To establish whether or not the prone (face down) position reduces exposure of healthy tissue
      to radiation when compared to the supine position. To compare patient comfort and
      acceptability in each of the prone and supine positions. To perform a time and motion study
      for radiotherapy planned and delivered in each of the prone and supine positions.

    <description>Patients will lie on their fronts on an in-house designed board comprising an arm positioning device registerable to the couch-top, together with a styrofoam/ memory foam mattress. The ipsilateral breast will drop through an aperture in the mattress. The distance from the nipple to the superior, inferior and lateral aspects of the aperture will be recorded along with the distance of the nipple from the couch-top. Arms will be extended as far as possible above the head and the position of the arm immobilisation handles recorded. The head will be turned to the contralateral side. The contralateral breast will be pulled laterally such that it is as flat as possible beneath the patient. Measurements will be taken in order to relate the position of the bi-lateral tattoos to the orthogonal lasers. A fourth tattoo will be marked on the patient's back in line with the A-P laser. The position will be reproduced at treatment using measurements from the tattoo to the laser.</description>

    <description>For the supine position, patients will be positioned on a customized supine breast board co-registerable to the couch-top to CT and the treatment machines. Arms will be placed above the head in supports. Arm and head position will be recorded along with the angle of the board (which is adjusted such that the sternum is parallel to the couch-top). Tattoos will be marked bi-laterally and medially in a defined relationship to orthogonal lasers. The position will be reproduced at treatment using the above measurements, tattoos and lasers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Complete microscopic excision of early stage invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma
             (pT1-3b N0-1 M0) with breast preservation.

          -  Paired titanium clips marking anterior, posterior, and radial walls of excision cavity

          -  Ability to lie prone on breast board

          -  For left-sided breast cancer patients, cardiac and LAD doses must be ≤10% greater than
             those predicted for the supine position.

          -  For all patients, the following absolute dose constraints should be met: ≤5% of heart
             volume to receive 18Gy and ≤10% of ipsilateral lung volume to receive ≥20Gy

          -  Age ≥18

          -  PS ≤1

          -  No previous radiotherapy to the affected breast

          -  No concomitant herceptin

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.

          -  Written informed consent given according to ICH/GCP before registration/
             randomisation.

          -  Patients can only be randomised into this trial once.
