  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if thirty grams per day of flaxseed consumption for 4
      weeks could potentially reduce the serum lipid levels in children and adolescents with
      familial or severe hypercholesterolemia compared to those on placebo.

      The proposed study is a 4 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
      Participants will be recruited from the pediatric lipid disorder clinic at the Hospital for
      Sick Children, which provides consultations to and management of children with primary lipid
      abnormalities. Patients that meet the study criteria will be approached during their
      routinely scheduled clinic visits, until the sample size (N=30) be reached. Patients will
      randomly be assigned to the intervention or the placebo group. The intervention group will be
      given muffins and breads containing ground flaxseed. Two muffins and one slice of bread will
      be consumed per day to provide a total of 30g flaxseed to the experimental group. The control
      group will be given muffins and breads containing whole wheat flour in place of flaxseed.
      Participants will be instructed to eat one muffin for breakfast, one muffin as an afternoon
      snack, and one slice of bread as an evening snack every day for a 4-week period. The muffins
      and breads use in the study will be baked by an independent baker.
