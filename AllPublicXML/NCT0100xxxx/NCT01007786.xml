  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shunt failure remains a significant problem in pediatric patients with hydrocephalus. If
      reliable techniques for the accurate placement of ventricular catheters can be developed,
      shunt survival may improve. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      the ultrasound guided shunt insertion technique in the hands of experienced surgeons. The
      primary outcome measure is ventricular catheter location determined from post-operative brain
      images. The study is being conducted by the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN), a
      network established to conduct multi-institutional clinical trials on pediatric
      hydrocephalus. Pediatric neurosurgeons at HCRN centers enrolled in this study will perform
      either ultrasound guided shunt surgery or a conventional shunt surgery. Patients who undergo
      conventional shunt surgery will serve as a contemporary control group.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have clinical and radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus as determined
             by a pediatric neurosurgeon and require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (atrial, pleural,
             gallbladder and other shunt systems are excluded)

          -  Patients can have no prior history of shunt insertion for hydrocephalus. A history of
             an external ventricular drain, subgaleal reservoir-catheter, or subgaleal shunt is
             permissible

          -  Patients must be less than 18 years of age at the time of shunt insertion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active CSF or abdominal infection

          -  Spread of tumor in the subarachnoid space documented on enhanced imaging (CT or MRI)
             of the head or spine

          -  CSF leak without hydrocephalus

          -  Pseudotumor cerebri

          -  Dandy-Walker malformation or arachnoid cyst as a cause of hydrocephalus

          -  Loculations within the ventricular system

          -  Hydranencephaly, alobar holoprosencephaly or any other congenital anomaly of the brain
             that severely distorts the ventricular anatomy such that ventricular catheter location
             cannot be determined

          -  Other systemic disorders that would preclude the insertion/revision of a ventricular
             shunt

          -  Other difficulties that would preclude follow-up at one year (e.g. terminal illness
             with life expectancy less than 1 year)
