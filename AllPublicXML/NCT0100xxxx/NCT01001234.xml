    <measure>Pain Freedom at 2 Hours Post Dose in Participants Between 12 and 17 Years of Age</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post Stage 2 dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was assessed using a 5-Face Pain Scale ranging from 1=no pain to 5=very bad pain. Pain freedom was defined as a reduction in severity from a rating of 3, 4 or 5 (moderate or severe pain) at the Stage 2 baseline (15 minutes post Stage 1 dose) to a rating of 1 (no pain) at 2 hours post Stage 2 dose. Missing data were imputed by carrying forward the preceding Stage 2 pain intensity values. Missing Stage 2 baseline values were imputed by carrying forward the Stage 1 baseline value, if available.</description>

        <description>Pain intensity was assessed using a 5-Face Pain Scale ranging from 1=no pain to 5=very bad pain. Pain freedom was defined as a reduction in severity from a rating of 3, 4 or 5 (moderate or severe pain) at the Stage 2 baseline (15 minutes post Stage 1 dose) to a rating of 1 (no pain) at 2 hours post Stage 2 dose. Missing data were imputed by carrying forward the preceding Stage 2 pain intensity values.

          <title>Pain Relief at 2 Hours Post Dose in Participants Between 12 and 17 Years of Age</title>
          <description>Pain intensity was assessed using a 5-Face Pain Scale ranging from 1=no pain to 5=very bad pain. Pain relief was defined as a reduction in severity from a rating of 3, 4 or 5 (moderate or severe pain) at the Stage 2 baseline (15 minutes post Stage 1 dose) to a rating of 2 or 1 (mild or no pain) at 2 hours post Stage 2 dose. Missing data were imputed by carrying forward the preceding Stage 2 pain intensity values. Missing Stage 2 baseline values were imputed by carrying forward the Stage 1 baseline value, if available.</description>
          <population>Includes participants who did not respond to placebo in Stage 1, were randomized to and took Stage 2 study drug and had both Stage 2 baseline migraine severity (moderate or severe) and at least one post Stage 2 dose efficacy measurement prior to or including the 2 hour post dose time point. Those randomized to rizatriptan in Stage 1 were excluded.</population>
