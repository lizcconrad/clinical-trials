  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common cardiac condition affecting nearly 6 million Americans. Silent
      blood volume overload is common in patients with heart failure and is associated with
      increased risk of death. This study is designed to determine if adjustment of therapy based
      on direct measurement of blood volume will reduce risk of hospitalization and death when
      compared with therapy based on clinical assessment of blood volume in patients with chronic
      heart failure.

      Multicenter prospective randomized trial to compare heart failure management strategies based
      on clinical assessment of volume status vs. direct measurement of blood volume with a
      radioisotope technique. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a standard care strategy with
      guideline recommended treatment based on serial clinical assessment of blood volume or a
      measured blood volume strategy with guideline recommended treatment based on serial measured
      blood volume. All subjects will undergo blood volume measurement procedures, but the testing
      results will only be returned to the physician in the group assigned to management according
      to measured blood volume status. Subjects will be blinded to their study treatment assignment
      status.
