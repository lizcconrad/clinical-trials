  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center registry of patients treated with at least one Promus, everolimus-eluting,
      Stent, with the primary objective to assess clinical success and safety at 30 days, 6 months
      and 1 year post-implantation.

    <textblock>
      Interventional cardiology was revolutionized by the invention of stents, initially with the
      bare-metal stents (BMS) and recently with the drug-eluting stents (DES). The everolimus
      eluting stents have shown very promising results in randomized clinical trials, demonstrating
      a reduction of clinical and angiographic restenosis in comparison to BMS, and comparable
      clinically-driven target lesion revascularization rates in comparison with sirolimus-eluting
      stents. While registry data is available from outside of the United States, it will be
      important to collect &quot;real-world&quot; data regarding the stent usage and outcomes in the United
      States. In this study we propose to follow patients who received at least one PromusÂ® Stent
      for at least 1 year post initial stent implantation.
