  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutrophils are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Navarixin (SCH 527123, MK-7123) is an antagonist of the
      cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) and is thought to reduce neutrophil
      migration to the diseased lung. It is theorized that reducing neutrophil migration to the
      diseased lung will improve a participant's symptoms and the natural history of the disease.

      The study will consist of a 2-week screening period followed by a 2-year (104-week)
      double-blind treatment period. The 2-year Treatment Period will be made up of two phases: a
      26-week (6-month) dose range-finding phase with 3 active arms and 1 placebo arm (Period 1),
      followed by a 78-week (18-month) long-term safety and efficacy phase (Period 2). Participants
      participating in the original 6-month study (Period 1) may elect not to continue into the
      18-month extension study (Period 2).

      Hypothesis: navarixin, 50 mg, or the highest remaining dose if the 50-mg dose is
      discontinued, is superior to placebo with respect to improving airflow.

    <measure>Total Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool-Patient-Recorded Outcome (EXACT-PRO) Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At 26, 52 and 104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The total score on the EXACT-PRO questionnaire is used to determine the frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations of COPD. The 14-item EXACT-PRO questionnaire was to be completed by participants every evening to describe their experience of COPD during that day. Assessments were included for Breathlessness (5 items), Cough and Sputum (2 items), Chest Symptoms (3 items), and 4 additional items (Difficulty with Sputum, Tired or Weak, Sleep Disturbance, and Psychological State). Each item was measured on a 5- or 6-point scale. The total EXACT-PRO questionnaire score could range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a more severe health state.</description>

    <measure>Induced Sputum Absolute Neutrophil Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26, Week 52, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Induced sputum samples were to be obtained from participants via the nebulized method for analysis of absolute neutrophil counts at Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104. The reported Baseline least squares (LS) means and standard deviations (SDs) are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of pooled Baseline LS mean and SD values is the assumption that the Baseline LS mean and SD values are similar across treatment groups. The reported post-Baseline SDs are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) method using pooled SD values is the assumption that the SDs are similar across treatment groups.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD Patients (SGRQ-C) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26, Week 52, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ-C consists of 40 items aggregated into 3 component scores: Symptoms (frequency/severity), Activity (limited by breathlessness), Impacts (social functioning, psychological disturbances), and a Total score. Each response to a question is assigned a weight. Component scores are calculated by summing the weights from all positive items in that component, dividing by the sum of weights for all items in that component, and multiplying this number by 100. Component scores could range from 0-100, with a higher component score indicating greater disease burden. The Total score is calculated by summing the weights to all the positive responses in each component, dividing by the sum of weights for all items in the questionnaire, and multiplying this number by 100. SGRQ-C Total scores could range from 0-100, with a higher SGRQ-C Total score indicating greater disease burden. Participants were to assess their COPD symptoms, activity and impact at Baseline, Week 26, Week 52, and Week 104.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26, Week 52, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The BODE index is a composite score assessing COPD prognosis that consists of 4 variables that are individually scored: FEV1 percent predicted, 6-Minute Walk Test, Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale and body mass index (BMI). The FEV1 percent predicted was scored from ≥65% (0 points, less airway obstruction) to ≤35% (3 points, greater airway obstruction). The 6-Minute Walk Distance was scored from: ≥350 meters (0 points, good exercise capacity) to ≤149 meters (3 points, poor exercise capacity). The MMRC Dyspnea Scale was scored from: MMRC 0: Dyspneic on strenuous exercise (0 points) to MMRC 4: Cannot leave house; breathless on dressing/undressing (3 points). BMI was scored as: &gt;21 (0 points) and ≤21 (1 point). Variable scores were summed to produce a BODE index score. BODE index scores could range from 0 to 10, with a higher score correlating with an increased risk of COPD mortality. BODE index scores were to be assessed at Baseline, Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104.</description>

The 14-item EXACT-PRO questionnaire was to be completed by participants every evening to describe their experience of COPD during that day. Assessments were included for Breathlessness (5 items), Cough and Sputum (2 items), Chest Symptoms (3 items), and 4 additional items (Difficulty with Sputum, Tired or Weak, Sleep Disturbance, and Psychological State). Each item was measured on a 5- or 6-point scale. The total EXACT-PRO questionnaire score could range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a more severe health state.</description>

The reported Baseline least squares (LS) means and standard deviations (SDs) are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of pooled Baseline LS mean and SD values is the assumption that the Baseline LS mean and SD values are similar across treatment groups. The reported post-Baseline SDs are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) method using pooled SD values is the assumption that the SDs are similar across treatment groups.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD Patients (SGRQ-C) Total Score</title>
        <description>The SGRQ-C consists of 40 items aggregated into 3 component scores: Symptoms (frequency/severity), Activity (limited by breathlessness), Impacts (social functioning, psychological disturbances), and a Total score. Each response to a question is assigned a weight. Component scores are calculated by summing the weights from all positive items in that component, dividing by the sum of weights for all items in that component, and multiplying this number by 100. Component scores could range from 0-100, with a higher component score indicating greater disease burden. The Total score is calculated by summing the weights to all the positive responses in each component, dividing by the sum of weights for all items in the questionnaire, and multiplying this number by 100. SGRQ-C Total scores could range from 0-100, with a higher SGRQ-C Total score indicating greater disease burden. Participants were to assess their COPD symptoms, activity and impact at Baseline, Week 26, Week 52, and Week 104.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Body-Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise Capacity (BODE) Index Score</title>
        <description>The BODE index is a composite score assessing COPD prognosis that consists of 4 variables that are individually scored: FEV1 percent predicted, 6-Minute Walk Test, Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale and body mass index (BMI). The FEV1 percent predicted was scored from ≥65% (0 points, less airway obstruction) to ≤35% (3 points, greater airway obstruction). The 6-Minute Walk Distance was scored from: ≥350 meters (0 points, good exercise capacity) to ≤149 meters (3 points, poor exercise capacity). The MMRC Dyspnea Scale was scored from: MMRC 0: Dyspneic on strenuous exercise (0 points) to MMRC 4: Cannot leave house; breathless on dressing/undressing (3 points). BMI was scored as: &gt;21 (0 points) and ≤21 (1 point). Variable scores were summed to produce a BODE index score. BODE index scores could range from 0 to 10, with a higher score correlating with an increased risk of COPD mortality. BODE index scores were to be assessed at Baseline, Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104.</description>

        <title>Sputum Inflammatory Marker Levels: Interleukin 8 (IL-8)</title>
        <description>Induced sputum samples were to be collected from participants via the nebulized method prior to study drug administration at Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104. IL-8 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the sputum supernatant. The reported Baseline LS means and SDs are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of pooled Baseline LS mean and SD values is the assumption that the Baseline LS mean and SD values are similar across treatment groups. The reported post-Baseline SDs are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of an ANOVA method using pooled SD values is the assumption that the SDs are similar across treatment groups.</description>

        <title>Sputum Inflammatory Marker Levels: Matrix Metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9)</title>
        <description>Induced sputum samples were to be collected from participants via the nebulized method prior to study drug administration at Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104. MMP-9 levels were measured by ELISA in the sputum supernatant. The reported Baseline LS means and SDs are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of pooled Baseline LS mean and SD values is the assumption that the Baseline LS mean and SD values are similar across treatment groups. The reported post-Baseline SDs are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of an ANOVA method using pooled SD values is the assumption that the SDs are similar across treatment groups.</description>
