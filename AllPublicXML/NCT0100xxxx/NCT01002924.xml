      This extension protocol is for those subjects that have completed the allowed duration of
      participation in an Endocyte-sponsored clinical trial of EC145 (vintafolide) and have
      continuing evidence of clinical benefit (stable disease or better) at the time that they
      completed participation in that study.

      This extension protocol is for those subjects that have completed the allowed duration of
      participation in an Endocyte-sponsored clinical trial of EC145 and have continuing evidence
      of clinical benefit (stable disease or better) at the time that they completed participation
      in that study.

      Following confirmation of eligibility, subjects will receive intravenously-administered EC145
      at a dose of 2.5 mg. Dosing will occur on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of weeks 1 and 3 of
      each 4-week cycle. No therapy will be administered during weeks 2 and 4. Subjects randomized
      to non-EC145-containing treatment arms of EC145 trials are not eligible for this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have received prior treatment with EC145 within the context of an
             Endocyte-sponsored, IRB-approved clinical trial.

          -  Disease (i.e., cancer) that was considered &quot;stable&quot; at the last evaluation while
             participating in the previous EC145-containing study. &quot;Stable&quot; is defined as not
             having progression of disease per standard criteria (RECIST, etc). Stable disease may
             be indicated by previously attained complete or partial tumor shrinkage that has not
             progressed per standard criteria.

          -  No more than 10 weeks have elapsed since the last evaluation of &quot;stable disease&quot;.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2

          -  Must have recovered (to baseline/stabilization) from prior EC145-associated acute
             toxicities.

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic, and renal function.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

          -  Willingness to practice contraceptive methods for men and women of childbearing
             potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Development of a secondary malignancy requiring treatment.

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.

          -  History of receiving any investigational treatment or other systemic therapy directed
             at controlling cancer since the subject's last dose on the parent EC145 study.
