  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phase study, consisting of the following plan:

      Phase I - This is a pre-test of the feasibility and acceptability of the beta version of a
      computer-delivered intervention, Motivational Enhancement System for Adherence (MESA), as
      well as the control intervention Motivational Enhancement System for Health (MESH) at three
      selected AMTUs. Following analysis of the responses in Phase I and further modification of
      the intervention, Phase II will be initiated.

      Phase II - This is a pilot, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) testing a two-session
      computer-delivered intervention, MESA, designed to increase motivation for adherence to
      Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) among youth newly recommended to begin
      medications, as well as an attention control, MESH, matched for dose and delivery format.
      Phase II is open to all 15 AMTUs.
