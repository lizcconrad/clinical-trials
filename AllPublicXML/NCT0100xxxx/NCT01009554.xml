    <textblock>
      This study is 8 weeks long. People participating in this study will be asked to brush their
      teeth two times a day. Some people will get a mouthwash. People with a mouthwash will rinse
      two times a day after brushing their teeth. The mouth, teeth, tongue and gums will be looked
      at by a dentist. The dentist will look at the mouth to make sure the mouthwash does not
      irritate the mouth. The dentist will also look at the color of the teeth and amount of stain
      on the front teeth.

      This is an 8-week, randomized, observer-blind, controlled, parallel group clinical study
      design to assess the oral tissue tolerance of a potassium oxalate containing mouthrinse.
      Subjects will have their oral soft/hard tissues assessed and will be evaluated for stain
      levels and tooth color shades at Screening/Baseline (Visit 1), Week 4 (Visit 2), Week 6
      (Visit 3) and Week 8 (Visit 4). Subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth two times
      daily in their usual manner using the provided sodium fluoride toothpaste. Subjects assigned
      to the mouthrinse group will be instructed to rinse twice daily after brushing.

    <measure>Change in Tooth Color as Represented by ΔE at 8 Weeks Post Baseline From the CIElab Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The tooth color of the four maxillary incisor teeth (teeth #7-10, facial surface) was measured instrumentally using the MHT SpectroShade System. Assessments were made under standardized lighting conditions after participants brushed their teeth with water. The aperture tip was placed perpendicularly to the facial surface of the tooth and the color measured using the CIElab color system. The changes in the individual L*, a*, and b* color parameters were calculated to determine quantitatively the improvements in tooth lightness, redness, and yellowness, respectively. An overall change in tooth color was calculated using the CIE color equation ΔE = [(ΔL*)^2 + (Δa*)^2 + (Δb*)^2]^1/2. The ΔE was calculated per tooth and then averaged over the teeth for a participant.</description>

    <measure>Mean Stain Score Over All Tooth Sites at 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for area and intensity according to the following criteria. Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain covers entire area) and for the body of tooth on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored as 0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 1=thin line of stain, may be discontinuous; 2=thick line or band of stain; 3=stain covers entire area and for the body of tooth as 0=no stain present, natural tooth color, 1=stain limited to pits and grooves; 2=stain outside pits/grooves, up to 10% of surface affected; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females at least 18 years of age and in good general and oral health.

          -  Volunteers must read, sign, and receive a signed copy of the Informed Consent Form
             after the nature of the study has been fully explained.

          -  Willingness to use the assigned products according to instructions, availability for
             appointments and likelihood of completing the study.

          -  Willingness to refrain from using any breath freshener products or unassigned oral
             care products (i.e., oral care strips, candy-type mints, sprays, chewing gums, throat
             lozenges, cough drops, mouthwashes or teeth whitening products) throughout the
             duration of the study.

          -  Willingness to refrain from using any whitening products and smokeless tobacco
             products within one week prior to and for the duration of the study, in order to
             reduce alternate sources of potential irritation.

          -  A minimum of 16 natural teeth, including at least 10 of the 12 anterior teeth (#6-11,
             #22-27, however, #7-10 must be present), with scorable facial and lingual surfaces.
             Teeth that are grossly carious, fully crowned or extensively restored on facial and/or
             lingual surfaces, orthodontically banded, abutments, or third molars will not be
             included in the tooth count.

          -  Classic Vita® Shade minimum value of A2 or darker on at least 2 of the 4 maxillary
             anterior teeth (#7-10).

          -  Absence of abnormal or severely fissured tongue, geographic tongue, tongue piercing or
             any obvious tongue abnormalities that may interfere with the assessment of oral
             irritation.

          -  Adequate oral hygiene (i.e., brush teeth daily and exhibit no signs of oral neglect).

          -  Absence of neglected dental health (i.e. gross calculus deposits or rampant caries
             based on visual examination), significant oral soft tissue pathology,
             systemically-related gingival enlargement, tissue damage due to ill-fitting appliances
             or restoration, or extreme crowding or overlapping of teeth

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physical limitations or restrictions that might preclude use of normal oral hygiene
             procedures (i.e., toothbrushing, etc.).

          -  History of significant adverse effects following use of oral hygiene products such as
             toothpastes and mouthrinses.

          -  History or current evidence of significant oral soft tissue pathology, excluding
             gingivitis, based on the dentist's visual examination and at the discretion of the
             investigator.

          -  Prior participation in any oral hygiene or product clinical study within the previous
             30 days.

          -  Therapy with any medications, currently or within the last 30 days, which might
             interfere with the outcome of the study by affecting tooth color or stain formation
             (i.e., certain antimicrobial mouthrinses and antibiotics, such as chlorhexidine).

          -  Restorations on 10% or more of the facial surfaces of the maxillary anterior incisor
             teeth.

          -  Dental fluorosis, hypoplasia, restorations, tetracycline stains, or other enamel
             surface irregularities that may interfere with evaluation of the selected teeth.

          -  Visual evidence of Moderate/advanced periodontitis (ADA Type III, IV). Orthodontic
             bands, appliances, bridges, numerous crowns, removable orthodontic appliances or
             partial dentures.

          -  Self-reported pregnancy or lactation (this criterion is due to oral tissue changes
             related to pregnancy and nursing which can affect interpretation of study results).

          -  Regular use of whitening products within 1 week prior to Screening/Baseline. Other
             severe, acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational
             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of trial result and,
             in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for the
             entry into this trial.

        <title>Change in Tooth Color as Represented by ΔE at 8 Weeks Post Baseline From the CIElab Assessment</title>
        <description>The tooth color of the four maxillary incisor teeth (teeth #7-10, facial surface) was measured instrumentally using the MHT SpectroShade System. Assessments were made under standardized lighting conditions after participants brushed their teeth with water. The aperture tip was placed perpendicularly to the facial surface of the tooth and the color measured using the CIElab color system. The changes in the individual L*, a*, and b* color parameters were calculated to determine quantitatively the improvements in tooth lightness, redness, and yellowness, respectively. An overall change in tooth color was calculated using the CIE color equation ΔE = [(ΔL*)^2 + (Δa*)^2 + (Δb*)^2]^1/2. The ΔE was calculated per tooth and then averaged over the teeth for a participant.</description>

        <title>Change in Tooth Color as Represented by ΔE at 4 Weeks Post Baseline From the CIElab Assessment</title>
        <description>The tooth color of the four maxillary incisor teeth (teeth #7-10, facial surface) was measured instrumentally using the MHT SpectroShade System. Assessments were made under standardized lighting conditions after participants brushed their teeth with water. The aperture tip was placed perpendicularly to the facial surface of the tooth and the color measured using the CIElab color system. The changes in the individual L*, a*, and b* color parameters were calculated to determine quantitatively the improvements in tooth lightness, redness, and yellowness, respectively. An overall change in tooth color was calculated using the CIE color equation ΔE = [(ΔL*)^2 + (Δa*)^2 + (Δb*)^2]^1/2. The ΔE was calculated per tooth and then averaged over the teeth for a participant.</description>

        <title>Change in Tooth Color as Represented by ΔL at 6 Weeks Post Baseline From the CIElab Assessment</title>
        <description>The tooth color of the four maxillary incisor teeth (teeth #7-10, facial surface) was measured instrumentally using the MHT SpectroShade System. Assessments were made under standardized lighting conditions after participants brushed their teeth with water. The aperture tip was placed perpendicularly to the facial surface of the tooth and the color measured using the CIElab color system. The change in the individual L* color parameter was calculated. The ΔL was calculated per tooth and then averaged over the teeth for a participant.</description>

          <title>Change in Tooth Color as Represented by Δb at 8 Weeks Post Baseline From the CIElab Assessment</title>
          <description>The tooth color of the four maxillary incisor teeth (teeth #7-10, facial surface) was measured instrumentally using the MHT SpectroShade System. Assessments were made under standardized lighting conditions after participants brushed their teeth with water. The aperture tip was placed perpendicularly to the facial surface of the tooth and the color measured using the CIElab color system. The change in the individual b* color parameter was calculated. The Δb was calculated per tooth and then averaged over the teeth for a participant.</description>

        <title>Mean Stain Score Over All Tooth Sites at 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for area and intensity according to the following criteria. Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain covers entire area) and for the body of tooth on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

        <description>The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for intensity according to the following criteria. The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region is unrelated to the area covered with stained pellicle. All four regions were assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale as 0=no stain, 1=faint stain (can be seen with close examination), 2=moderate stain (clearly visible and aesthetically unacceptable), 3=heavy, dark stain (obvious and aesthetically unacceptable).</description>

          <description>The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for intensity according to the following criteria. The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region is unrelated to the area covered with stained pellicle. All four regions were assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale as 0=no stain, 1=faint stain (can be seen with close examination), 2=moderate stain (clearly visible and aesthetically unacceptable), 3=heavy, dark stain (obvious and aesthetically unacceptable).</description>

          <title>Mean Stain Area Over All Tooth Sites at 6 Weeks</title>
          <description>The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for area according to the following criteria. Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored as 0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 1=thin line of stain, may be discontinuous; 2=thick line or band of stain; 3=stain covers entire area and for the body of tooth as 0=no stain present, natural tooth color, 1=stain limited to pits and grooves; 2=stain outside pits/grooves, up to 10% of surface affected; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected.</description>

        <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). Stain area for mesial and distal regions were scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain covers entire area). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

          <title>Mean Stain Score for Interproximal (Mesial and Distal) Sites at 8 Weeks</title>
          <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). Stain area for mesial and distal regions were scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain covers entire area). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

          <title>Mean Stain Score for Gingival Sites at 6 Weeks</title>
          <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). Stain area for gingival regions were scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain covers entire area) and for the body of tooth on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

          <description>The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). The gingival regions were scored for intensity according to the following criteria. The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region is unrelated to the area covered with stained pellicle.

        <title>Mean Stain Score for Body Sites at 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). Stain area for the body of the tooth was scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

          <title>Mean Stain Score for Body Sites at 4 Weeks</title>
          <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). Stain area for the body of the tooth was scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

          <title>Mean Stain Intensity for Body Sites at 6 Weeks</title>
          <description>The facial and lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). The body regions were scored for intensity according to the following criteria. The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region is unrelated to the area covered with stained pellicle. The body regions were assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale as 0=no stain, 1=faint stain (can be seen with close examination), 2=moderate stain (clearly visible and aesthetically unacceptable), 3=heavy, dark stain (obvious and aesthetically unacceptable).</description>

        <title>Mean Stain Score for Facial Sites at 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The facial surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for area and intensity according to the following criteria. Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain covers entire area) and for the body of tooth on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for intensity according to the following criteria. The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region is unrelated to the area covered with stained pellicle. All four regions were assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale as 0=no stain, 1=faint stain (can be seen with close examination), 2=moderate stain (clearly visible and aesthetically unacceptable), 3=heavy, dark stain (obvious and aesthetically unacceptable).</description>

          <title>Mean Stain Intensity for Facial Sites at 4 Weeks</title>
          <description>The facial surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for intensity according to the following criteria. The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region is unrelated to the area covered with stained pellicle. All four regions were assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale as 0=no stain, 1=faint stain (can be seen with close examination), 2=moderate stain (clearly visible and aesthetically unacceptable), 3=heavy, dark stain (obvious and aesthetically unacceptable).</description>

          <description>The facial surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for area according to the following criteria. Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored as 0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 1=thin line of stain, may be discontinuous; 2=thick line or band of stain; 3=stain covers entire area and for the body of tooth as 0=no stain present, natural tooth color, 1=stain limited to pits and grooves; 2=stain outside pits/grooves, up to 10% of surface affected; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected.</description>

        <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for area and intensity according to the following criteria. Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain covers entire area) and for the body of tooth on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

          <title>Mean Stain Score for Lingual Sites at 8 Weeks</title>
          <description>The mean stain score (0-9) per participant was determined by multiplying the individual area and intensity scores from each region and summing them then dividing by the number of sites scored. The lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for area and intensity according to the following criteria. Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain covers entire area) and for the body of tooth on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected). The intensity of yellow-brown stains occurring in each region was assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=no stain; 3=heavy, dark stain).</description>

          <description>The lingual surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (teeth #6-11 and #22-27) were scored using the Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index. Each surface was divided into 4 regions (gingival, mesial, distal, and body). All four regions were scored for area according to the following criteria. Stain area for mesial, gingival, and distal regions were scored as 0=no stain present, natural tooth color; 1=thin line of stain, may be discontinuous; 2=thick line or band of stain; 3=stain covers entire area and for the body of tooth as 0=no stain present, natural tooth color, 1=stain limited to pits and grooves; 2=stain outside pits/grooves, up to 10% of surface affected; 3=stain outside pits/grooves, over 10% of surface affected.</description>
