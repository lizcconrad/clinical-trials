  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this grant is to develop and test a proven computer based quality
      improvement/behavior change e-Health system (CHESS--Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support
      System) to help prevent relapse in alcohol dependent patients being discharged from
      residential treatment. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that ACHESS (Addiction CHESS)
      will improve competence, relatedness and autonomy, which will reduce the days of risky
      drinking over a 12-month period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The system to be tested (ACHESS - Addiction CHESS) will be delivered through a new modality
      (smart-phone rather than PC) to make access more widespread, focus on new patients (alcohol
      dependent patients leaving residential care), offer optional audio delivery to improve access
      for those who have literacy challenges and be enhanced with services tailored to relapse
      prevention. ACHESS will offer: 1) communication with peer support groups and addiction
      experts; 2) timely monitoring to assess risk of relapse, 3) reminders and alerts to encourage
      adherence to therapeutic goals; 4) addiction-related educational material and tools tailored
      to the needs of the particular patient, 5) access to selected Internet based resources and 6)
      communication with a care manager. Patients randomly assigned to ACHESS will learn to use it
      prior to discharge from residential care.

    <description>Those in the ACHESS arm will also be given a smart-phone with access to the ACHESS system (the intervention) for a full 12 months. The ACHESS intervention includes: 1) the Core CHESS system that has been tested in several diseases, 2) a proactive computer-based relapse prevention system, 3) data transfer from the phone to a computer accessible by the patient's counselor/care manager, and 4) systems for the patient to maintain contact with his/her Care Manager</description>
