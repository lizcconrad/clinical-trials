  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia in hospitalized elders is associated with less positive outcomes in rehabilitation,
      increased likelihood of readmission, increased comorbidity and mortality, and increased
      length of hospital stay. In light of an increase in the elderly population in Denmark, the
      consequences of dysphagia, and the importance of minimizing the risk of disability and
      frailty, it is vital to emphasize safe participation of the elderly dysphagic patient in
      eating, drinking and swallowing. Danish occupational therapists have an important role in the
      dysphagia management, but no Danish evidence-based occupational therapy assessments for
      dysphagia of elderly medical patients exist. In order to oblige this lack, the objective of
      the study is to provide an assessment tool with operational definitions of dysphagia which
      includes the complexity of performance in eating, drinking and swallowing, is evidence-based,
      and guides occupational therapists in the treatment planning in a client-centred and
      purposeful manner.

      The study involves a quantitative approach, and is initiated by a translation and cultural
      adaptation of the Canadian &quot;The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment&quot; (MISA). Hereafter, the
      psychometric qualities are tested. On basis of the data collected for the psychometrics, the
      prevalence and characteristics of dysphagia in the study population are investigated.
      Provided that the psychometric testing of the MISA reveals satisfactory levels, the effect of
      using the MISA in the treatment planning is investigated.

      It is hypothesized that:

      The Danish translation of the MISA will demonstrates satisfactory content validity,
      reliabilities, convergent validity, known-groups validity, predictive validity, criterion
      validity, high levels of sensitivity/specificity and are responsive to change.

      Dysphagia is prevalent in elderly medical patients at the time of admission to acute medical
      care and there can be found a correlation between dysphagia severity and the presence of
      comorbidity, disability, frailty, the length of hospital stay, the place of discharge and the
      number of readmissions for elderly medical patients.

      The study is divided into four study parts.

      Study I aims to translate and cultural adapt the MISA into Danish occupational therapy
      terminology, to secure equivalency between the original and the translated version, and to
      test its interrater- and intrarater reliability as well as internal consistency.

      Study II aims to investigate the convergent validity, known-groups validity, predictive
      validity and the responsiveness of the MISA.

      Study III aims to test the criterion-related validity and the diagnostic accuracy of the MISA
      using the Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) and the Assessment of Motor and
      Process Skills (AMPS) as gold standards; and to compare the diagnostic accuracy for
      aspiration of the MISA compared to the Water Swallow Test, when using the FEES as the gold
      standard.

      Study IV aims to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of dysphagia in elderly
      medical patients, and to identify its potential associations between comorbidity, disability,
      frailty, length of hospital stay, place of discharge and number of readmissions.
