    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to evaluate the effect of a mixture of probiotics on the
      prevention of traveler's diarrhea (TD) in subjects who travel to a country with a high risk
      for developing TD. Subjects will be asked to take one capsule containing a mixture of
      probiotics or a placebo capsule a day, within the week before departure, during the travel
      and up to 3 days after return. They will note the following outcomes in a diary: occurence of
      diarrhea, number and consistency of stools, duration of the diarrhea, presence of
      diarrhea-related symptoms and need for rescue medication.

      The present study will examine if the use of the probiotics capsule reduces the occurence of
      traveler's diarrhea as compared to the placebo capsule.
