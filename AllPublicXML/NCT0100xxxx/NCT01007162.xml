      Patients' perceptions of their medical care are of increasing importance to educators,
      researchers, and clinicians. The emphasis on patient experience and satisfaction is
      consistent with the trend towards holding health care professionals accountable to their
      consumers. Our understanding and advancement of patients' experience and satisfaction with
      care forms a pivotal role in ensuring individuals engage with healthcare services, adhere to
      therapies, and maintain ongoing relationships with providers. Experiences are best explored
      using interview techniques such as phenomenological interviewing. In our study we propose to
      use a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Phenomenology is a way of qualitatively
      exploring a person's experience and their personal meanings from those experiences. It is an
      approach that considers the structure of a person's subjective experience and explores areas
      that might be hidden. A phenomenological approach looks for patterns that are shared by
      particular instances or experiences. The evaluation of patient satisfaction and experience is
      based on valuing patients' subjective perception of an experience. In our study, a
      phenomenological approach will generate a comprehensive description of a phenomenon or lived
      experience (i.e. stay in the Critical Care Unit). We will interview a sample of patients to
      explore experiences and to gain their meanings of their stay in critical care. This will
      hopefully lead to thinking around ways of improving patient experiences, satisfaction and
      care.
