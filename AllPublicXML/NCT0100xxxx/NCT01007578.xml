    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine plasma levels of paclitaxel and catheter
      tolerability subsequent to treating patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease
      (PAOD) with paclitaxel-coated balloon catheters.

      This is an open-labeled multicenter study to investigate plasma levels and catheter
      tolerability following application of paclitaxel-coated balloon catheter angioplasty in
      patients with stenotic or occluded femoro-popliteal arteries due to atherosclerosis. Safety
      will be assessed by changes in blood cell (leukocytes, neutrophils and thrombocytes) counts,
      and changes in serum biochemistry parameters. Tolerability will be assessed by adverse event
      occurences related to the paclitaxel-coating and/or device by the investigator.
