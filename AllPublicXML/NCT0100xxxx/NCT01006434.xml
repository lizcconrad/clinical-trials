      Thrombolysis using Alteplase (tPA) is still the only approved specific therapy for acute
      ischemic stroke (AIS). Current guidelines in western countries recommend an tPA dose of
      0.9mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 90mg for patients weighing more than 100kg. However, larger
      dose-finding rtPA trials for intravenous thrombolysis in AIS are missing. Based on results
      from research on myocardial infarction only a few open label studies with low case rates were
      initiated to evaluate the optimal dose for tPA in cerebral ischemia. These studies suggested
      a narrow therapeutic range with decreased efficacy in lower dosages and an increased risk for
      thrombolysis related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at doses above 0.95mg/kg. The ECASS-1
      trial which used a dosage of 1.1mg/kg rt-PA showed significantly higher rate of large
      parenchymal hemorrhages compared to trials using 0.9mg/kg. Therefore accurate dosing is
      crucial. In the acute phase two aspects complicate rtPA dosing in AIS: First, unlike in other
      diseases many stroke patients are unable to communicate information on their body weight (BW)
      because of their stroke symptoms (e.g. aphasia, decreased consciousness). In addition motor
      symptoms prohibit easy weighing procedures in many patients. Second, the ultra-early and
      narrow time window for treatment does not allow time loss to weigh each patient in the
      emergency situation. Therefore routinely the attending physician has to make a visual
      estimation of the patient's BW. This may be inaccurate and may cause dosing errors which has
      been shown for other weight based emergency medication. There is little data on tPA-dosing
      errors in stroke patients and prospective data are lacking. The aim of our study is to
      evaluate availability of BW-information, accuracy of estimations and final dosing of tPA in a
      routine clinical setting. Therefore the investigators evaluate different sources of body
      weight estimations and also compare visual estimation with recently proposed anthropometric
      measurements for body weight approximation. Finally, impact of dosing errors on safety and
      efficacy are analyzed.

      The initial phase will consist of 100 enrolled patients as a pilot phase for further power
      calculations. Based on the results of the pilot phase enrollment will continue. The
      envisioned inclusion target is up to 800 patients.
