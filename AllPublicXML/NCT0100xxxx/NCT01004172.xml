  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well the combination of bevacizumab
      and carboplatin works in treating breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Bevacizumab is
      an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body) that is made in the
      laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Usually
      chemotherapy drugs attack fast growing cancer cells in the body. Bevacizumab works to slow or
      stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors. When
      the blood supply is decreased, the tumors don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need to
      grow. Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds and has been
      approved for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Information from other research studies
      suggests that the combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin may be effective in treating
      breast cancer.

           overall survival and treatment response

        -  Exploratory analysis to evaluate CTCs using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
           for HER2 gene amplification to examine the relationship between the HER2 status of a
           patient's primary breast cancer, metastatic lesions, and CTCs

        -  Exploratory analysis to evaluate HER2-positive CTCs using FISH for EGFR gene

    <description>CNS objective response rate is the percentage of participants that achieve CNS complete or partial response as follows:
CNS complete response (CR) is achieved if all of the following are satisfied:
Complete resolution of all measurable (&gt;= 1 cm in longest dimension [LD]) and non-measurable brain metastases
No new CNS lesions (defined as any new lesion &gt;= 6 mm in LD)
Stable or decreasing steroid dose
No new/progressive tumor-related neurologic signs or symptoms
No progression of extra-CNS disease as assessed by RECIST
CNS partial response (PR) is achieved if all of the following are satisfied:
-&gt;/= 50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all measurable (&gt;/= 1 cm in LD) brain metastases compared to baseline

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 2 cycles on treatment. Off treatment, participants were followed every 3 months for progression and overall survival. Duration of follow-up for this study cohort approximated up to 3 years.</time_frame>

No new CNS lesions (defined as any new lesion &gt;= 6 mm in LD)
Stable or decreasing steroid dose
No new/progressive tumor-related neurologic signs or symptoms
No progression of extra-CNS disease as assessed by RECIST
CNS partial response (PR) is achieved if all of the following are satisfied:
-&gt;/= 50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all measurable (&gt;/= 1 cm in LD) brain metastases compared to baseline
No progression on non-measurable lesions
No new CNS lesions (defined as any new lesion &gt;/= 6 mm in LD)
