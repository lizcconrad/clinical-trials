    <textblock>
      Omeprazole is a safe drug listed in OTC drug due to its safety. It acts by irreversible
      inhibition of K/H ATP ase pump and also Na/K ATP ase, Na/H ATP ase.Considering these actions
      the effect of omeprazole on decreasing intra ocular pressure is an issue of debate.In this
      Randomized Clinical Trial conducted in labafinejad hospital, patients with glaucoma who need
      to take omeprazole due to GI problem are evaluated in two groups including placebo and drug
      users. The effect will be finally assessed.
