        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men (18-41 years of age) with male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia)

          -  Subjects with no experience of treatment using dutasteride

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol

          -  Subjects who prescribed with dutasteride according to the Prescribing Information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Considering the nature of observational study, GSK Korea encourages the doctors
             participating in this study to enrol the subjects prescribed with dutasteride
             following the locally approved Prescribing Information. Subject who give informed
             consent is enrolled. However, if institution waives the requirement for informed
             consent, informed consent is not required. In this case, monitoring does not proceed.
