  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the change in the expression of FcεRI receptors of blood basophils and
      dendritic cells after 16 weeks of treatment with omalizumab as compared with placebo, in
      adult patients with non-atopic severe persistent asthma, uncontrolled despite optimal
      therapy.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Expression of FcεRI Receptors of Blood Basophils</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Venous blood samples were collected at screening and at Week 16. Flow cytometry analysis determined the FcεRI receptors expression of blood basophils (mean fluorescence intensity(MFI)). Relative change in mean fluorescence intensity at the end of study was expressed as a percentage of baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Expression of FcεRI Receptors of Dendritic Cells</measure>

    <description>Venous blood samples were collected at screening and at Week 16. Flow cytometry analysis determined the FcεRI receptors expression of dendritic cells (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)).

    <measure>Change in Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FeNO was measured at baseline, and after 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of treatment. Absolute change in FeNO was expressed at each time point versus baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Induced Sputum Eosinophil Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The induced sputum eosinophil count was measured in a subset of patients in selected centers. Sputum samples were collected at screening and Week 16. Sputum eosinophil count was expressed as a percentage of total nonsquamous cells. Absolute change in sputum eosinophil count was expressed versus baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Score of the Shortened Version of the Asthma Control Questionnaire (Symptoms Plus Short-acting β2-agonist)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The shortened version of the asthma control questionnaire (symptoms plus β2-agonist) consists of 6 subscores (nighttime waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheeze and rescue short-acting β2-agonist use) between 0 and 6 (0 = no impairment; 6 = maximum impairment) and a total score between 0 and 6 (subscores mean value). Absolute change in total score and subscores count was expressed versus baseline value. A decrease in score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nasal Symptom Global Score and Individual Components</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal symptom score calculated from six scales assessing the nasal symptom severity (sneezing, runny nose, congestion, itchy nose, postnasal drip and nasal symptoms overall). These six scores were rated on a scale from 1 to 7, with 7 being the worst rating. Absolute changes in these six scores were expressed versus baseline values. A negative change indicates improvement. The range of the global score was from 1 to 7, since this is the mean value of all the subscores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician and Patient Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GETE is an assessment of asthma symptoms controlled in response to asthma treatment. The evaluation was performed independently by both investigator and patient using the same 5 point scale. The scale points are: excellent, good, moderate, poor and worsening. A good or excellent response is suggested as a means of defining a patient who has responded to treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) From Baseline to 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. At least three maneuvers were performed at each sampling timepoint. The FEV1 recorded was taken from the maneuver obtained from the single best test curve. The best test curve was defined as the spirogram that gave the largest FEV1.</description>

    <description>Asthma-related events were: unscheduled medical visits, emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Details of exacerbations requiring oral or IV corticosteroids were recorded at each visit.</description>

          <description>Venous blood samples were collected at screening and at Week 16. Flow cytometry analysis determined the FcεRI receptors expression of blood basophils (mean fluorescence intensity(MFI)). Relative change in mean fluorescence intensity at the end of study was expressed as a percentage of baseline value.</description>
