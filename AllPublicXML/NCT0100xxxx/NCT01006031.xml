      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of high doses of both peginterferon-alfa 2a
      (360 ug per week) plus ribavirin (800 mg b.i.d.) in HIV-infected patients with compensated
      liver cirrhosis by HCV genotype 1 or 4 without previous virological response(*) to a standard
      dose treatment of both drugs.

      (*) Non previous virological response: no decrease of plasma RNA-HCV at least 2 log10 after
      12 weeks in treatment or breakthrough viremia while on treatment.

      Additionally, this study will evaluated the influence of simultaneous peginterferon-alfa 2a
      and ribavirin plasma concentrations on early viral response (EVR) and sustained viral
      response (SVR) in these patients.

      Method: Pilot clinical trial, phase II-III, open labeled multicenter in which patients from
      several hospitals of the Servicio Andaluz de Salud will be enrolled.

      The usual clinical and analytical follow up will be performed but additional blood samples
      will be obtained for determination of interferon and ribavirin plasma levels. The primary end
      point will be a sustained virologic response (defined as an undetectable serum HCV-RNA after
      24 weeks after the cessation of treatment). Likewise, rapid virological response (at 4 weeks
      of treatment), early virological response (at 12 weeks), and end of treatment response rates
      will be evaluated as well as their relationships with the plasma interferon an ribavirin
      concentrations determined by ELISA and HPLC, respectively. The safety and tolerability of the
      studied medications will be evaluated by means of clinical adverse events, physical
      examination and laboratory results. The evolution of liver fibrosis will be evaluated
      comparing the basal and end of treatment results of transient elastometry.

    <description>Pegylated interferon alfa-2a (360 ug per week) plus oral Ribavirin (800 mg b.i.d.) for 48 or 72 weeks. The treatment will be discontinued for patients who did not achieve a reduction with respect to baseline of at least 0.5 log10 IU/ml in plasma RNA-HCV levels at week 4 or 2 log10 UI/ml at week 12 and will be considered as viral failures.
Duration: 48 weeks for patients reaching an undetectable plasma RNA_HCV at week12 and 72 weeks for those without a negative viremia at week 12 but a reduction of at least 2 log10 IU/ml in RNA-HCV levels.</description>
