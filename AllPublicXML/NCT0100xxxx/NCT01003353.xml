  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the effects of strength training on maximal strength, walking
      ability and neural function in chronic stroke patients. The strength training intervention in
      this study is different to all previous interventions for stroke patients.

      Maximal Strength Training (MST) involves weights of up to 90% of the participants 1
      repetition maximum and has a focus on the explosive development of force. This study will use
      these principles for unilateral leg press and plantarflexion exercises. Only 2 previous
      studies have investigated high intensity strength training for stroke patients and they used
      intensities of 80% 1RM. Previous MST interventions have shown large increases in strength,
      rate of force development and this has transferred to improved walking economy.

      The investigators predict that MST will give large increases in strength, improved rate of
      force development (RFD) and walking economy. The investigators expect that better neural
      function will account for the improvements. This study could provide evidence for the
      adoption of a completely different method of strength rehabilitation for stroke survivors.

    <description>Training will be carried out 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Each session will include a warm up, strength training and warm down. The total time will be approximately 1 hour. The training will consist 2 exercises (leg press and plantarflexion). Participants will train each leg individually with 4 sets of 4 repetitions at 90% of the 1 repetition maximum.</description>
