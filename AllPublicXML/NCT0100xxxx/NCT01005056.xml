      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Marvelon® in the
      prevention of pregnancy.

      Post-marketing surveys are not considered applicable clinical trials and thus the results of
      this survey will not be posted at its conclusion. The results will be submitted to public
      health officials as required by applicable national and international laws.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with willingness to prevent pregnancy and to take Marvelon® in compliance with
             the approved dosage and administration method

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with constitution of hypersensitivity to ingredients of this product.

          -  Woman with estrogen-dependent tumor (for instance, breast cancer, cancer of uterine
             body and uterine myoma), cancer of uterine cervix, or suspected of them. [aggravation
             or manifestation of tumor may be induced.]

          -  Patients with abnormal genital bleeding for which diagnosis has not been established
             [Genital cancer is suspected. If bleeding is due to genital cancer, aggravation or
             manifestation of cancer may be induced.]

          -  Patients with thrombophlebitis, embolism pulmonary, cerebrovascular disorder, coronary
             diseases, or a history thereof [blood coagulation capacity may be increased and these
             symptoms may be aggravated.]

          -  Smoker aged 35 years or older taking 15 or more pieces of tobacco per day [It has been
             reported that cardiovascular disorder including myocardial infarction is liable to
             occur.]

          -  Patients with migraine accompanied by signal symptom (scotoma scintillans, star-shaped
             flash, etc.) [It has been reported that compared with patients without concomitant
             symptom, in patients with concomitant symptom cerebrovascular accidents (apoplectic
             ictus, etc.) are more prone to occur.]

          -  Patients with heart valve disease accompanied by pulmonary hypertension or fibrillary
             waves. Patients with heart valve disease with a history of acute bacterial
             endocardiosis [It has been reported that cardiovascular disorders such as thrombosis,
             etc. are liable to occur.]

          -  Patients with diabetes accompanied by vascular lesion (diabetic nephropathy, diabetic
             retinopathy, etc.) [It has been reported that cardiovascular disorders such as
             thrombosis, etc. are liable to occur.]

          -  Women with constitution of thrombosis [It has been reported that cardiovascular
             disorders including thrombosis, etc. are liable to occur.]

          -  Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [It has been reported that
             cardiovascular disorders including thrombosis, etc. are liable to occur.]

          -  Patient within 4 weeks before operation, within 2 weeks after operation, within 4
             weeks of after delivery or at rest for a long-term period [Blood coagulation capacity
             is increased and the risk of occurrence of adverse reactions in the cardiovascular
             system may become high.]

          -  Patients with serious hepatic disorder [Since metabolic capacity is decreased, the
             burden on the liver increases, and the symptom may be aggravated.]

          -  Patients with hepatic tumor [The symptom may be aggravated.]

          -  Patients with lipid metabolism disorder [It has been reported that cardiovascular
             disorders including thrombosis, etc. are liable to occur. Since there is a possibility
             of lipid metabolism being affected, the symptom may be aggravated.]

          -  Patients with hypertension (excluding mild hypertension) [It has been reported that
             cardiovascular disorders including thrombosis, etc. are liable to occur. The symptom
             may be aggravated.]

          -  Patients with otosclerosis [The symptom may be aggravated.]

          -  Patients with a history of jaundice, persisting itching or gestational herpes during
             pregnancy [The symptom may be aggravated.]

          -  Pregnant or possibly pregnant women [Refer to the section &quot;Use during Pregnancy,
             Delivery or Lactation&quot;.]

          -  Lactating women [Refer to the section &quot;Use during Pregnancy, Delivery or Lactation&quot;.]

          -  Women before puberty [Early epiphysiodesis may occur.]
