    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary anemia that causes the red blood cells to change
      their shape from a round and doughnut-like shape to a half-moon/crescent, or sickled shape.
      People who have SCD have a different type of hemoglobin (protein that carries oxygen). This
      different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change into a crescent shape under
      certain conditions. Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because they often get stuck in the
      blood vessels blocking the flow of blood and can cause inflammation and injury to important
      areas of the body. All babies are born with hemoglobin called fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Soon
      after birth, HbF production slows down and another hemoglobin called adult hemoglobin (HbA)
      is made. Clinical studies have shown that increasing the amount of HbF in the blood may
      prevent sickling of the red blood cells. Vorinostat has been used in the treatment of cancers
      and in other research studies and information from those suggests that it may help treat SCD
      by increasing the amount of HbF in the blood. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine the effectiveness and safety of vorinostat when used to treat SCD.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA), when
           administered orally, in a pulsed fashion, once-a-day for 3 consecutive days every week,
           in inducing a 4% absolute increase or a 100% increase in fetal hemoglobin percent levels
           (HbF%) in subjects with severe sickle cell disease who have failed prior therapy.

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effect of vorinostat on F-cell levels.

        -  To determine the changes in y-globin, B-globin and E-globin RNA levels during treatment
           with vorinostat.

        -  To describe the dose-response characteristics of vorinostat in inducing fetal hemoglobin
           in sickle cell disease.

      Exploratory

        -  To determine the extent and duration of global histone acetylation with intermittent
           vorinostat dosing.

        -  To correlate the status of polymorphisms near the BCL11A, c-myb, and HBB gene loci, all
           of which are associated with levels of fetal hemoglobin, to assess for an association of
           polymorphism status with therapeutic response to vorinostat.

        -  To evaluate red blood cell rheology before and after treatment with vorinostat.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This was a single stage design to evaluate induction of HbF on treatment with target
      enrollment of 15 patients. A 25% success rate was considered evidence of activity in this
      patient population while 5% success rate deemed ineffective. If at least 3 patients achieved
      success, the treatment would be considered promising. With 15 eligible patients, the
      probability of observing this was 0.76 assuming a true rate of 25% and 0.04 assuming a true
      rate of 5%.

    <measure>Percent Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF%) Induction Success Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>HbF% was measured at baseline and weekly on treatment. Median duration of treatment was 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Success will be defined by comparing the maximum HbF% on study drug to the HbF% at baseline. An absolute increase in HbF% of 4% of more, or an increase to 100% or more of baseline in patients with HbF under 4% at baseline will be considered a success. HbF% induction success rate is calculated as the count of successes divided by the count of patients in the analysis population.</description>

        <title>Percent Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF%) Induction Success Rate</title>
        <description>Success will be defined by comparing the maximum HbF% on study drug to the HbF% at baseline. An absolute increase in HbF% of 4% of more, or an increase to 100% or more of baseline in patients with HbF under 4% at baseline will be considered a success. HbF% induction success rate is calculated as the count of successes divided by the count of patients in the analysis population.</description>
