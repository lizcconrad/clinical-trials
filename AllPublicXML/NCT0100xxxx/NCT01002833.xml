  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates display a wide genetic diversity with possibly different
      properties to induce immune responses. These properties could directly influence the ability
      to induce protective efficacy. Since 1998 an experimental human malaria infection model at
      the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center (RUNMC) has been very successful in answering
      questions with regards to immunological mechanisms of human Pf infection. To date only the
      NF54 strain of Pf has been deployed in this Nijmegen model. However, investigation of
      heterologous Pf challenge is not only highly informative for our basic understanding of
      induction of immune responses but also provides an essential model for protective capacity
      testing in the clinical development of candidate malaria vaccines. Recently, the parasite
      culture laboratory of the RUNMC has been able to overcome technical hurdles to produce
      infectious mosquitoes of two genetically different isolates from different geographical
      regions to increase the portfolio for Phase IIa trials. These isolates, PfA and PfB will be
      compared with the NF54 strain for parasitic, immunological and clinical features in humans.
