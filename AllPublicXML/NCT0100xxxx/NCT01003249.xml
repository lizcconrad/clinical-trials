  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunctional voiding is often associated with constipation. The association of constipation
      with urologic pathologic processes has previously been described since the 1950's, but it was
      only over the past decade that clinicians have paid more attention to this relationship and
      recognized it existence with the term dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES). This term is
      used to reflect the broad spectrum of functional disturbances that may affect the urinary
      tract including that of functional bowl disturbances and can be classified as follows:

        -  Functional disorder of filling: overactive bladder, over distention of bladder or
           insensate bladder, which may be associated with fecal impaction or rectal distention
           with infrequent bowel movements

        -  Functional disorder of emptying: over-recruitment of pelvic floor activity during
           voiding causing interrupted and/or incomplete emptying also associated with defecation
           difficulties due to non- relaxation of the puborectalis muscle, dyssynergic defecation
           or pain with defecation Several different therapeutic options have been used for
           patients with dysfunctional voiding mainly to decrease bladder outlet obstruction. These
           treatments including, alpha adrenergic antagonists, and botulinum toxin are less than
           optimum. One possible explanation for these drug failures includes the inability of
           these medications to relax the striated muscles of the pelvic floor necessary for
           voiding.

      To date there has been no data to evaluate the role of baclofen on the striated muscle of the
      external anal sphincter, essential in the defecation process.

      Outcome Measure(s)

        1. Efficacy of baclofen vs. placebo on dysfunctional voiding as measured with uroflometry
           and EMG; patients' symptoms score questionnaires and diaries.

        2. Efficacy of baclofen vs. placebo on the external anal sphincter muscle dysfunction via
           patient symptoms and questionnaire.

      3. The safety of baclofen in patients with dysfunctional voiding (urinary and defecatory).

    <description>Diagnosis of dysfunctional bladder is based on symptoms demonstrating no relaxation or over stimulation of external urinary sphincter during voiding. Symptoms will be scored by International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire- Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life (ICIQ-LUTSqol). The ICIQ-LUTSqol is a patient-completed questionnaire for evaluating quality of life (QoL) in urinary incontinent patients There are 20 items and the score range is 10-200. Higher scores denotes better outcomes.</description>

Then patients initially assigned to the baclofen group will be assigned to the placebo group, and those assigned to the placebo group will be assigned to the baclofen group.
