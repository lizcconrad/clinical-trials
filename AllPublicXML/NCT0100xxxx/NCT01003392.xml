  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coffee is a worldwide drink, been part of any culture. There are some concerns about effects
      of coffee on the health. Recently, epidemiological studies have shown benefits of coffee
      drinking to diabetics and also to prevent diabetes in populations. We aim to understand some
      effects of coffee and not only caffeine over vascular system, in special coronary artery
      disease patients, diabetics end normal people.

      Patients will have a wash-out period (21 days) with no coffee or other caffeine-drinks. Then
      they will be submitted to treadmill test, MAPA, Holter-ECG and vascular reactivity study,
      biochemical and inflammatory plasma dosages, as basal. Then they will start a period of
      coffee drinking over 4 weeks; and all exams will be repeated. We will study two types of
      coffee, arabica and robusta; with two types of toasted beans(regular and soft). Also regular
      and decaffeinated coffee. A total of 300 (100 normal people, 100 diabetics, 100 coronary
      disease) individuals will be tested.
