    <textblock>
      Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent cause of vertigo of
      peripheral vestibular origin with life time incidence of 2.4%. BPPV is characterized by bouts
      of acute whirling vertigo lasting less than one minute provoked by changes in head position
      in relation to the gravitational vector. The vertigo is accompanied by typical rotational or
      horizontal nystagmus that is often demonstrated by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and less
      frequently by testing for positional nystagmus. BPPV pathogenesis is currently explained by
      the fall of otoconia (calcium-carbonate crystals) or otoconial debris from the tectorial
      membrane of the otolithic organs into the dependant semicircular canals (canalithiasis) or
      adherence of such particles to the semicircular canal's cupula (cupulithiasis). Under these
      circumstances, the semicircular canal which normally responds only to angular velocity and
      acceleration is stimulated by gravity. Otoconial remnants as free floating particles inside
      the semicircular canal arms or attached to the cupula have been observed by few
      investigators. Although the presence of such particles explains most characteristics of the
      positioning nystagmus described in BPPV, it does not account for the dizziness and
      disequilibrium which are described by many patients even without changes in head position and
      the continuation of such symptoms after successful treatment of BPPV as evidenced by the
      resolution of positional vertigo and nystagmus.

      The study hypothesis is that otolithic pathology is an important component in the
      pathogenesis of BPPV explaining these symptoms, BPPV recurrence, and the refractoriness of
      some BPPV cases to the vastly employed particles repositioning treatments. In the present
      study the Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) testing would be employed to measure
      the function of one of the otolithic organs - the saccule. The study objectives are: 1. To
      investigate possible malfunction of the saccule in patients suffering from BPPV. 2. To look
      for association between saccular pathology and BPPV recurrence and between such pathology and
      BPPV treatment failure. 3. To study possible relation between saccular pathology and
      continuation of dizziness and disequilibrium despite the resolution of positional vertigo.
