  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate response rate, survival, safety and tolerability of
      YM155 given in combination with rituximab in subjects with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an outpatient study. All subjects enrolled in this study will receive YM155 and
      rituximab given during 14 day cycles. Each subject will be assessed at the end of each cycle
      to determine if he or she may continue to the next cycle. Each subject will be eligible to
      continue receiving the combination regimen in this study until one of the discontinuation
      criteria is met.

      If a subject discontinues treatment without progressive disease (PD) that subject will
      complete follow-up visits every 12 weeks for 1 year or until initiating another systemic
      anti-lymphoma treatment, exhibiting PD, or death.

      Each subject will be contacted by the study site every 12 weeks for survival following the
      End of Treatment Visit. The contacts will continue until death or for no more than 1 year.
