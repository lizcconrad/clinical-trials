  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, to demonstrate lot-to-lot consistency of the
      vaccine, to address the relevant concomitant vaccine administrations and to provide a
      comparison between GSK Biologicals' Hib conjugate vaccine and the licensed monovalent Hib
      vaccine ActHIB as well as the licensed combination product Pentacel in infants at 2, 4, 6 and
      15-18 months of age. This study is designed with a primary and a booster phase.
