  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile spasms constitute a type of catastrophic epilepsy syndrome occuring in young
      children. The ketogenic diet has been shown to be very effective in these children. The
      modified Atkins diet is a less restrictive option than the ketogenic diet, which has been
      effective in preliminary studies on refractory epilepsy in children, adolescents and adults.
      Modified Atkins diet may be of special importance in infants, as proteins are not restricted,
      hence no problems with growth are expected. Hence this pilot study has been planned to
      evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the modified Atkins diet in infantile spasms
      refractory to conventional treatment (ACTH, vigabatrin, and anti-epileptic drugs).
