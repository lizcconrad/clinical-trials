      The study is recruiting 50 patients initiating or switching to Atripla and comparing them to
      250 individuals previously followed in a prospective study of HIV+ low income individuals
      recruited from homeless shelters, single room occupancy hotels and free meal food lines as
      part of the UCSF Reach Study. Adherence will be measured through monthly unannounced pill
      counts and electronic medication monitors.
