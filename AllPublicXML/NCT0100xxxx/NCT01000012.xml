    <intervention_name>Becker 50 Expander/Breast implant</intervention_name>
    <description>The breast implant is comprised of the Becker implant and the injection dome/fill tube and has a low bleed, gel-filled outer lumen and an adjustable saline-fillable inner lumen. The inner lumen can be gradually filled with saline over an extended period of time via the fill tube by injecting saline through the injection dome. Once expanded to the desired volume, the fill tube and injection dome are removed through a small incision under local anesthetic, and the prosthesis remains in position as a breast implant.
The Becker 50 Expander/Breast Implant has a 50% gel volume and a 50% saline volume, so a 400cc implant would nominally have 200cc of saline and 200cc of silicone. The Becker 50 Expander/Breast Implant is available in sizes from 300 to 700cc.</description>

    <description>The breast implant is comprised of the Becker implant and the injection dome/fill tube and has a low bleed, gel-filled outer lumen and an adjustable saline-fillable inner lumen. The inner lumen can be gradually filled with saline over an extended period of time via the fill tube by injecting saline through the injection dome. Once expanded to the desired volume, the fill tube and injection dome are removed through a small incision under local anesthetic, and the prosthesis remains in position as a breast implant.
The Becker 25 Expander/Breast Implant has a silicone gel volume of approximately 25% and saline volume of approximately 75%. The Becker Expander/Breast Implant is available in sizes 150 - 800cc.</description>
