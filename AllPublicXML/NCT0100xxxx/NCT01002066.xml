  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of wide scale RDT use at the primary
      health care level in previously high malaria endemic area during malaria pre-elimination
      phase for improved targeting of anti-malarial drugs, malaria surveillance and epidemic
      alertness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last 6 years Zanzibar has undergone a dramatic change in malaria epidemiology and
      burden of disease, with a marked decline of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among febrile
      children from approximately 30% to 1% or below and a reduction of crude child mortality of
      50% Overuse of the expensive ACTs will not only be a substantial financial burden on the
      health care system in Zanzibar, but will also spur anti-malarial drug resistance with
      devastating effect on global malaria control efforts and prevent other causes of fever from
      being appropriately treated, e.g. pneumonias which require antibiotics. Rapid Diagnostic
      Tests (RDTs), based on antigen detection of P. falciparum, are proposed as a future
      cornerstone to improve diagnostic efficiency also at the peripheral health care level beyond
      the reach of microscopy services

      IMCI algorithms based on clinical symptoms could potentially be made more efficient and cost
      effective if simple parasitological diagnostic methodologies were incorporated. Zanzibar is
      among the first regions to incorporate RDT in the IMCI guidelines in Africa, which provides a
      unique research opportunity to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating RDT
      in the existing IMCI algorithm.

      Another key challenge for Zanzibar is to monitor potential development of parasite resistance
      to ACT when the number of malaria positive patients is insufficient to conduct standard in
      vivo efficacy trials. We propose that RDT could play a critical new role also in this regard.
