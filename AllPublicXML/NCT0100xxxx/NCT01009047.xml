    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-release (ER)
      paliperidone compared to aripiprazole (atypical antipsychotic) in symptomatic (having
      symptoms) adolescent participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of
      emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations
      [imagining things], and withdrawal into the self) .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center), double-blind (neither physician nor
      participant knows the name of the assigned drug), randomized (study drug is assigned by
      chance), active-controlled (paliperidone ER is compared to aripiprazole), parallel-group (a
      medical research study comparing the response in 2 or more groups of participants receiving
      different treatments), flexible-dose (the physician has the freedom to give different doses
      to the participant depending on how they respond to treatment) study designed to determine
      the efficacy and safety of paliperidone ER in symptomatic adolescents (12 to 17 years of age)
      with schizophrenia. The total duration of the study will be approximately 29 weeks. The study
      consists of 3 phases: a Screening phase up to 3 weeks (with a possible overlapping washout
      period), a Double-blind acute phase of 8 weeks, and a Double-blind maintenance phase of 18
      weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (paliperidone ER
      or aripiprazole flexible oral doses). Dosage will be adjusted at the scheduled visits.
      Efficacy of the participants will primarily be evaluated through Positive and Negative
      Syndromes Scale (PANSS). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale with each item rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology), designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PANSS Total Score at Day 182</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 182</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Marder Factor Negative Symptoms Score at Day 56 and 182</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56 and Day 182</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS negative subscale based on marder factor assesses 7 negative-symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, with a range of 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Other Marder Factors Scores at Day 56 and 182</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56 and 182</time_frame>
    <description>The subscales based on marder factors are: positive symptoms, disorganised thoughts factor, uncontrolled hostility/excitement factor, and anxiety/depression factor. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, with a range of 8 to 56 for positive symptoms, 7 to 49 for disorganized thoughts and 4 to 28 for Uncontrolled hostility/excitement and anxiety/depression. Higher score indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Other PANSS Factors and Subscales at Day 56 and 182</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56 and 182</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS provides a total score (sum of the scores of all 30 items) and scores for 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56 and 182</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical stability is defined as a decrease of 20 percent or more from Baseline in PANSS total score and CGI-S score less than or equal to 4 at Days 56 and 182, no hospitalizations due to psychiatric illness and no emergence of clinically significant suicidal or homicidal ideation during the maintenance phase.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Score at Days 56 and 182</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56 and 182</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the Clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scores at Day 56 and 182</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56 and Day 182</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale assesses degree of a participants' dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The results of the assessment are converted to a numerical score to rate degree of difficulty (1=absent to 6=very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on 4 domains there will be 1 total score (total score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals). Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With PANSS Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56 and 182</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale with each item rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology), designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Participants with PANSS response were defined as those who achieved greater than or equal to 20 percent or higher reduction from Baseline in the PANSS total score at Day 56 and 182.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the Clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <description>The PSP scale assesses degree of a participants' dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The results of the assessment are converted to a numerical score to rate degree of difficulty (1=absent to 6=very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on 4 domains there will be 1 total score (total score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals). Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>
