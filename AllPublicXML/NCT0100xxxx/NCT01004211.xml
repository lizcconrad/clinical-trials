  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, fluorescence and narrow band imaging cystoscopy have been tested in many prospective
      within patient trials but only as an &quot;add on&quot; procedure. This results in a bias that does not
      allow to determine the real impact of such innovative technologies on bladder cancer
      management. Hereby we propose the first prospective randomized trial which compares narrow
      band imaging trans urethral resection as a stand alone procedure versus white light
      transurethral resection. The primary end point is to assess the recurrence rate of bladder
      cancer lesions with each treatment modality. The study is designed to disclose an inferior
      recurrence rate (estimated 10%) in the group treated by narrow band imaging transurethral
      resection respect to the control group, treated by standard transurethral resection.
