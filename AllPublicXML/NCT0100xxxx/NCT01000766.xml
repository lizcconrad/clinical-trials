  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to try to develop new blood tests that may help doctors identify
      if a drug is hurting a person's liver.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that there are liver-specific particles, called mRNA, that are identifiable
      in a person's blood sample during liver injury caused by some drugs. The purpose of this
      study is to try to develop new blood tests that may help doctors identify if a drug is
      hurting a person's liver, perhaps early in the process before significant injury or illness
      have occurred.
