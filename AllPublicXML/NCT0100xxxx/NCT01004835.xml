      The objective of this study is to obtain blood or saliva samples to define genes for migraine
      and pain diseases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that over one-third of the world's population suffers from persistent or
      recurrent pain. Migraine is highly heritable and the majority of juveniles who suffer from
      the disorder have a mother or father who also have the disease. The blood or saliva samples
      will go through DNA analysis and be sequenced for candidate genes or subjected to
      whole-genome sequencing. By creating a MAPS GeneBank from these patients' blood/saliva
      donations we will ultimately be able to define genes for migraine and pain diseases.

      Approximately 20 milliliters of blood will be dispensed as follows: 2 X 8.5 ml PAX DNA Tubes
      OR 2 mLs of Saliva may be collected from each patient in a provided container. Saliva will
      only be collected on those individuals who do not wish to undergo phlebotomy for blood
      collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Family members (genetic duo or trio), consisting of an adolescent 10 to 18 years of
             age and at least one of their biologic parents willing to be participate in trial

          2. Adolescent and at least 1 biologic parent with Migraine diagnosis confirmed by Dr.
             Christy Jackson

          3. Is reliable, cooperative and willing to comply with all protocol-specified procedures
             and/or sub-study if consented

          4. Able to understand and grant informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has been previously enrolled in the MAP GeneBank at Scripps Clinic Registry

          2. Has a significant chronic medical condition (i.e.chronic meningitis or a secondary
             origin/cause of headache) which, in the investigator's option, may interfere with the
             patient's optimal participation in the study

          3. Treatment with any investigational agents or devices within 30 days preceding
             enrollment in the study

          4. Has undergone ECT within 90 days preceding enrollment in the study
