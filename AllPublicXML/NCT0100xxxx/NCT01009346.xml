      1. Phase I: To estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of RAD001 in combination with
           cetuximab and cisplatin for treatment of metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and
           neck (SCCHN).

        2. Phase II: To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) of RAD001 at MTD in
           combination with weekly cetuximab and cisplatin on days 1 and 8 of each 28 day cycle in
           patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN,

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To estimate the complete and partial response rate of RAD001 at MTD in combination with
           weekly cetuximab and cisplatin on days 1 and 8 of each 28 day cycle in patients with
           recurrent or metastatic SCCHN,

        2. To explore if the clinical activity of this regimen correlates with markers of the
           EGF-R/mTOR pathway in tumor tissue by serial sampling of tumor.

        3. To explore the role of FDG PET imaging as an early indicator of response to this
           combination.

    <description>Phase I will be a dose finding study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of daily RAD001 in combination with weekly cetuximab and cisplatin on Day 1, 8 of each 28 day cycle. The combination will be explored in successive cohorts of 3 patients each. The first cohort of 3 patients will receive doses corresponding to the first dose level. A full safety evaluation will be conducted when these patients have completed 8 weeks of therapy (2 cycles). If 0/3 patients treated at a dose level have a DLT, then a new cohort of 3 patients will receive treatment at the next dose level. If 1/3 patients have even one DLT, then 3 more patients will be treated at same dose level. If none of these patients has a DLT, then the next higher dose level will be administered to the next cohort of 3 patients; otherwise the inferior dose level will be considered the MTD. If &gt;2/3 patients have a DLT, then the inferior dose level will be considered the MTD.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous
             cell carcinoma of the head and neck, with recurrent or metastatic disease.

          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20
             mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. See Section 11 for
             the evaluation of measurable disease.

          3. Patients must have had no prior monoclonal antibodies or small molecule
             tyrosine-kinase inhibitors for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. In
             addition, no prior chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is
             allowed.

          4. If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be
             evidence of progression since the radiation. Patients must be greater than or equal to
             12 weeks from completion of prior curative intent therapy including surgery,
             radiation, or systemic anticancer therapy. If palliative radiation therapy is given
             for recurrent or metastatic disease, patients must be greater than or equal to four
             weeks from treatment.

          5. No concurrent malignancy except curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with prior history of
             malignancies must be disease free for greater than or equal to two years.

          6. Age &gt;18 years.

          7. Life expectancy of greater than 4.5 months.

          8. ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A).

          9. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL

               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal
                  or within normal institutional limits. or

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;3.0 X institutional upper limit of normal - creatinine
                  within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal 3.1.8

         10. As the investigational agent RAD001 requires enteral administration, patients must be
             able to receive adequate enteral nutrition by mouth or through a G-tube device.

         11. The effects of RAD001 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. For this reason and because agents used in this trial are known to
             be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to RAD001 or other agents used in the study.

          5. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             the isoenzyme CYP3A are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances known
             or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A isoenzymes are provided in the
             appendix.

          6. Patients receiving chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive
             agents are ineligible.

          7. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycin
             (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or its excipients.

          8. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g. ulcerative disease; uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection).

          9. Patients with active bleeding diathesis or patients on oral anti-vitamin K agent
             (excluding low dose warfarin).

         10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, severely impaired lung function or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements Severely impaired lung function is
             defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and /or O2
             saturation that is 88% or less on room air.

         11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RAD001 is a mTOR inhibitor with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with RAD001, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study.

         12. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RAD001. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

            <description>Phase I will be a dose finding study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of daily RAD001 in combination with weekly cetuximab and cisplatin on Day 1, 8 of each 28 day cycle. The combination will be explored in successive cohorts of 3 patients each. The first cohort of 3 patients will receive doses corresponding to the first dose level. A full safety evaluation will be conducted when these patients have completed 8 weeks of therapy (2 cycles). If 0/3 patients treated at a dose level have a DLT, then a new cohort of 3 patients will receive treatment at the next dose level. If 1/3 patients have even one DLT, then 3 more patients will be treated at same dose level. If none of these patients has a DLT, then the next higher dose level will be administered to the next cohort of 3 patients; otherwise the inferior dose level will be considered the MTD. If &gt;2/3 patients have a DLT, then the inferior dose level will be considered the MTD.</description>
