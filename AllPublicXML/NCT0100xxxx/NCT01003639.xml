  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also called pseudotumor cerebri, is a disorder of
      elevated intracranial pressure of unknown cause [Corbett, et al., 1982; Wall, et al., 1991].
      Its incidence is 22.5 new cases each year per 100,000 overweight women of childbearing age,
      and is rising [Garrett, et al., 2004] in parallel with the obesity epidemic. It affects about
      100,000 Americans. Most patients suffer debilitating headaches. Because of pressure on the
      optic nerve (papilledema), 86% have some degree of permanent visual loss and 10% develop
      severe visual loss [Wall, et al., 1991]. Interventions to prevent loss of sight, all with
      unproven efficacy, include diet, diuretics such as acetazolamide, repeated spinal taps, optic
      nerve sheath fenestration surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures. The
      purported goal of these therapies is to lower intracranial pressure; however, it is unclear
      which treatments work and by what mechanism. None of these strategies has been verified by
      properly designed clinical trials. Thus, there is confusion, uncertainty, and weak scientific
      rationales to guide treatment decisions. This trial will study subjects who have mild visual
      loss from IIH to (1) establish convincing, evidence-based treatment strategies for IIH to
      restore and protect vision, (2) follow subjects up to 4 years to observe the long-term
      treatment outcomes and (3) determine the cause of IIH. To meet those aims, the trial will be
      divided into a 12-month intervention phase and a 3-year observational phase. Subjects are not
      required to complete the observational phase of the study, but will be asked to do so and
      consented for the observational phase of the study at the conclusion of the intervention
      phase (12 months).

      Clinical Phase: Phase II Investigators: NORDIC Network sites Study Centers: 38 study centers
      Coordinating Center - University of Rochester Statistical Center - University of Rochester
      Study Period Planned enrollment duration: 2 years Planned duration of treatment: 6 months
      followed by open-label treatment Planned duration of follow-up: 4.5 years Study Objectives:
      The primary objective is determining the efficacy of diet plus acetazolamide vs diet alone in
      reducing or reversing visual loss in subjects with mild visual loss.

      The secondary objective is to identify proteomic and genetic risk factors for IIH by
      screening a large cohort of IIH patients and controls.

      Study Population This project will enroll 166 individuals with IIH who are 18-60 years of
      age. We anticipate that the population will be primarily composed of women in the
      childbearing years that are overweight. 154 control subjects will also be enrolled. Control
      subjects will be matched as closely as possibly by age, sex, race, ethnicity and weight to
      subjects enrolled at the site.

      Study Design: Multi-center, double-blind randomized intervention study followed by a 4-year
      observation period. Subjects will be randomized to diet and acetazolamide or diet and
      placebo. The study will use 250 mg acetazolamide or matching placebo tablets taken with food
      at meals and at bedtime. The subject will begin with one tablet four times daily, at meals
      and at bedtime for the first week. Beginning on Day 7, subjects will increase the dosage by 1
      tablet every 4 days until a final dosage of 4 tablets four times daily (4 grams) is reached
      or side effects prohibit increasing the dosage further. If the study drug is not tolerated at
      a dose of 250 mg, then 125 mg (1/2 tablet) will be tried. If this is not tolerated, no
      pharmacologic treatment will be given.

      After the 6 month visit, all subjects will transition from study medication to acetazolamide
      (open label) by replacing one tablet of study drug with 250 mg of acetazolamide every four
      days. The acetazolamide dose will be titrated in a manner similar to the initial study drug
      schedule to the maximum tolerated dose of acetazolamide. To avoid treating subjects (who may
      have initially been assigned to placebo) unnecessarily, any subject with grade 0-1
      papilledema will be tapered off study drug but not placed on acetazolamide unless they have
      persisting headaches or pulse-synchronous tinnitus. If so, they will be placed on
      acetazolamide regardless of the low papilledema grade. At the 9-month follow-up visit, we
      will make sure that the subjects' vision is stable after the transition off of study
      medication. After the 9 month visit, medication will be prescribed by the subject's treating
      physician. The intervention phase of the study will end at the subject's 12 month visit and
      subjects will be invited to participate in the observational phase of the study and consented
      to do so if willing.
