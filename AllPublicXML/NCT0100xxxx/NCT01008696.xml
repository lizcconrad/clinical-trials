  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the treatment effects of rabeprazole and lansoprazole
      depending on the genotyping (process of determining the genetic constitution) of CYP2C19 in
      treating reflux esophagitis (caused by gastroesophageal reflux; deterioration of the
      protective lining on the inner wall of the lower esophagus); and to evaluate the cure rate of
      reflux esophagitis on endoscopy (a thin flexible tube with a microscopic camera at the end
      which is passed down your throat into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) after treatment
      with rabeprazole and lansoprazole.

      This is a prospective (study following participants forward in time), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center),
      randomized (study drug assigned by chance) study in participants with reflux esophagitis. The
      study will include 4 visits: Visit 1 (Screening period of up to 14 days), Visit 2 (Day 1),
      Visit 3 (Day 29+3), and Visit 4 (Day 56). After Screening, eligible participants will be
      analyzed on Visit 2 (Day 1) for symptoms during past week, At visit 3 (Day 29+3) participants
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups: rabeprazole 20 milligram (mg) or
      lansoprazole 30 mg group. Participants will receive rabeprazole 20 mg tablet orally once
      daily for 28 to 56 days or lansoprazole 30 mg capsule orally once daily for 28 to 56 days. A
      post-study follow-up visit will be conducted only if participant will be affected by any
      serious adverse event within 30 days after the completion of study drug. Participants will
      primarily be assessed for the cure rate of reflux esophagitis based on endoscopy of 2 groups.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Reflux esophagitis evaluated by endoscopy as per LA Classification graded as: A=1 or more mucosal breaks no longer than 5 millimeter (mm) that did not extend between tops of 2 mucosal folds, B=1 or more mucosal breaks more than 5 mm long that did not extend between tops of 2 mucosal folds, C=1 or more mucosal break continuous between the tops of 2 or more mucosal folds but involves less than 75 percent of circumference, D=1 or more mucosal break involving at least 75 percent of circumference. Participants that were not categorized in any of the above mentioned grades (A to D) were considered as cured of reflux esophagitis. Participants were classified as CYP2C19 homozygous extensive, heterozygous extensive and poor metabolizers.</description>

        <description>Reflux esophagitis evaluated by endoscopy as per LA Classification graded as: A=1 or more mucosal breaks no longer than 5 millimeter (mm) that did not extend between tops of 2 mucosal folds, B=1 or more mucosal breaks more than 5 mm long that did not extend between tops of 2 mucosal folds, C=1 or more mucosal break continuous between the tops of 2 or more mucosal folds but involves less than 75 percent of circumference, D=1 or more mucosal break involving at least 75 percent of circumference. Participants that were not categorized in any of the above mentioned grades (A to D) were considered as cured of reflux esophagitis.
