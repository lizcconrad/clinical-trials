  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid medications are commonly used for pain relief. When given over time, physical
      dependence can occur. This results in unpleasant side effects--such as agitation and
      nausea--if opioid medications are suddenly stopped. However, we do not know how withdrawal
      affects the brain. We know that a medication named Ondansetron can help ease or prevent
      symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. Through imaging of the brain by fMRI, we hope to
      see how opioid withdrawal, with and without the administration of ondansetron, affects brain
      activity.

      During the study, each participant attended three separate lab-based acute opioid withdrawal
      sessions. The first session was undertaken in a mock MRI scanner and was designed to
      determine if participants could tolerate withdrawal in the scanning environment. Participants
      who were able to successfully and safely tolerate opioid withdrawal while in the scanner were
      approved to continue with the following study sessions. Participants were then pretreated
      intravenously (IV) with either 0.9% normal saline placebo or 8mg ondansetron. Later,
      participants in all sessions received IV naloxone (10mg/70kg) to precipitate opioid
      withdrawal. Participants were assigned to ondansetron or placebo pretreatment conditions in a
      randomized, double-blinded, and counter-balanced order. Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale
      (OOWS) and Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) were assessed throughout the study to
      quantify withdrawal. Study timeline progressed as follows: T=-165, 8mg ondansetron or placebo
      infusion, T=-135, Morphine infusion (10mg/70kg), T=-41 preparation for MRI, T=-21, start MRI,
      T=-13, baseline OOWS/SOWS, T=-9, start of fMRI, T=0 Naloxone induced withdrawal, T=5, OOWS,
      T=15, OOWS, T=20, Retrospective OOWS.

    <description>Changes are reporting using Spearman's correlation coefficient, using within-subject factors of time (pre-naloxone, post-naloxone) and pre-treatment (placebo, ondansetron). Changes in Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) and Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) with correlation coefficient &gt;0.45 are reported. The OOWS consists of 13 observable physical symptoms assessed over a 5-minute observation period and scored as present (score of 1) or absent (score of 0). The total OOWS scores is determined by summing the scores of the 13 items. OOWS scores can range from 0 to 13; lower scores correspond to fewer symptoms. SOWS consists of 16 physical and emotional symptoms rated by the participant on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), to indicate the extent to which the symptom describes how they are feeling at the time. The total SOWS score is determined by summing the scores of the 16 items. Scores range from 0 to 64; lower scores correspond to fewer symptoms.</description>

    <description>The OOWS consists of 13 observable physical symptoms that are assessed over a five-minute observation period and scored as present (score of 1) or absent (score of 0). The total OOWS scores is determined by summing the scores of the 13 items. OOWS scores can range from a low of 0 to a high of 13. A score of 0 would suggest that no objective signs of withdrawal were observed while a score of 13 would suggest that every observable sign of withdrawal was observed.</description>

The total SOWS score is determined by summing the scores of the 16 items. Scores range from a low of 0 to a high of 64. A score of 0 would suggest that the individual is experiencing no symptoms of withdrawal while a score of 64 would suggest that the individual is experiencing all 16 symptoms of withdrawal to the fullest extent possible.</description>

        <description>Changes are reporting using Spearman's correlation coefficient, using within-subject factors of time (pre-naloxone, post-naloxone) and pre-treatment (placebo, ondansetron). Changes in Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) and Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) with correlation coefficient &gt;0.45 are reported. The OOWS consists of 13 observable physical symptoms assessed over a 5-minute observation period and scored as present (score of 1) or absent (score of 0). The total OOWS scores is determined by summing the scores of the 13 items. OOWS scores can range from 0 to 13; lower scores correspond to fewer symptoms. SOWS consists of 16 physical and emotional symptoms rated by the participant on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), to indicate the extent to which the symptom describes how they are feeling at the time. The total SOWS score is determined by summing the scores of the 16 items. Scores range from 0 to 64; lower scores correspond to fewer symptoms.</description>

          <title>Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) Score 20 Minutes Following Ondansetron or Placebo Administration</title>
          <description>The SOWS consists of 16 physical and emotional symptoms that are rated by the participant on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), to indicate the extent to which the symptom describes how they are feeling at the time. The total SOWS score is determined by summing the scores of the 16 items. Scores range from a low of 0 to a high of 64. A score of 0 would suggest that the individual is experiencing no symptoms of withdrawal while a score of 64 would suggest that the individual is experiencing all 16 symptoms of withdrawal to the fullest extent possible.</description>
