    <textblock>
      This study is to identify the preferred vaccine dosage (of antigen and adjuvant) and schedule
      (one or two administrations) of the cell-derived H1N1sw monovalent vaccine in healthy
      children/adolescents based on European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products
      for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP) criteria, and safety and tolerability.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, single-blind, dose-ranging study. Subjects were
      randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either 3.75μg of cell-derived H1N1sw vaccine formulated
      in half (i.e., half the content of the European-licensed adjuvanted seasonal influenza
      vaccine) MF59 adjuvant (3.75_halfMF59) or 7.5μg of cell-derived H1N1sw vaccine formulated
      with full MF59 (7.5_fullMF59). Subjects were not informed of their allocated doses. Two
      vaccinations were administered IM three weeks apart. Subjects in both the vaccine groups were
      stratified into three age strata: 6 to 35 months, 3 to 8 years and 9 to 19 years. Blood
      samples were collected at day 1 (baseline), three weeks after the first vaccination (day 22)
      and three weeks after the second vaccination (day 43). Sera were tested by Hemagglutination
      Inhibition (HI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays. Local and systemic reactions were
      collected for the first week following each injection using Diary Card (i.e., day 1 to day 7
      and day 22 to day 28). All adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and AEs that
      led to withdrawal from the study and related prescription medications were collected for the
      entire study period.
