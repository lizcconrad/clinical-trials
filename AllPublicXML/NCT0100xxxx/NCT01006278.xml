      This investigation describes a novel complex of structural degradation proteins that is
      associated with pain in individuals with meniscal pathology undergoing arthroscopic partial
      meniscectomy. The presence of the complex in the synovial fluid of the knee is sensitive and
      specific for the painful state compared with similar aged controls. The absence of the
      complex in asymptomatic controls makes it a useful biomarker for the disease state.

      Background: Molecular biomarkers associated with knee pain may be useful as diagnostic tools,
      prognostic indicators, and surrogate endpoints for therapeutic trials. This study describes a
      novel complex of structural degradation proteins which are present in the knees of patients
      with meniscal pathology.

      Methods: This prospective cohort study included 30 patients with knee pain, mechanical
      symptoms, and MRI positive for meniscus tear who elected for arthroscopic partial
      meniscectomy after failing conservative management. Synovial fluid was aspirated at the time
      of surgery and assayed for a complex of structural degradation proteins by means of
      heterogeneous ELISA. The results were compared to knee aspirates from 10 asymptomatic
      volunteers with no pain. The complex was identified by a proteomic analysis of including
      multiplexed-bead immunoassay, purification by anion exchange and size exclusion
      chromatography, and mass spectrometry of individual chromatographic fractions.

    <description>patients 18 years of age or greater with a history of knee pain for more than three but less than six months who failed conservative management with the presence of mechanical symptoms including locking, catching, or giving way; positive physical exam findings including joint line tenderness, McMurray's exam, or Steinman's exam; and MRI of the knee positive for meniscus tear in a location correlating with physical examination. Exclusion criteria were as follows: the presence of high grade gonarthrosis including Kellgren-Lawrence grade IV; a history of prior knee surgery or trauma; ligamentous incompetence on examination or MRI; and diagnosis of inflammatory arthritides, crystalline arthropathies, or other rheumatologic diseases.</description>
