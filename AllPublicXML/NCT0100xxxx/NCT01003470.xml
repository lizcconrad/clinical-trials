      should remain hemiplegia within 15～90 days after stroke. After randomization the patients
      will receive 4 sessions of 30 minutes' duration during a period of 4 weeks. The outcome
      measurement is completed both in the different times as follows: before treatment, after the
      first treatment, 7, 14, 28days after treatment and follow up at 6 months after treatment.

      acupuncture plus rehabilitation group.The patients in the three groups are blinded as to
      which treatment method they received. The central randomization is used in this trial, which
      is performed by the Drug Clinical Research Center of Shanghai University of TCM of China.
