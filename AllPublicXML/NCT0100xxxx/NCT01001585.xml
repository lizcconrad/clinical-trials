      Summary. At the present, the investigators do not have the perfect anesthetic for
      mitochondrial patients. When possible, consideration should be given to the use of local
      anesthetics in small amounts. When a general anesthetic is necessary, they each carry
      significant risks and have been associated with poor outcomes. At present it is not possible
      to eliminate one group as less safe than others. What is clear is that these patients must be
      monitored more closely than other patients. The advent of the bispectral index (BIS) monitor
      may allow us to monitor their depth of anesthesia more closely and thus expose these patients
      only to the minimum amount of drug necessary to carry out the surgical procedure.

      Purpose. The investigators hypothesize that specific mitochondrial diseases, in particular
      those that decrease complex I function, make certain children hypersensitive to volatile
      anesthetics. These same patients may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes following
      general anesthesia. The specific aims of this application are:

        1. Determine which molecular defects in mitochondrial function lead to alter sensitivity to
           the VA sevoflurane.

        2. Establish the relative safety of sevoflurane in treatment of patients with mitochondrial
           disease.

      The investigators plan to monitor patients with mitochondrial disease using expanded measures
      of cardiovascular stability and measurements of brain electrical activity while slowly
      inducing general anesthesia. The investigators will use those measurements to limit the
      amount of anesthetic these patients receive in an attempt to minimize their risk. In
      addition, the investigators will correlate their sensitivity to the type of mitochondrial
      defect so that the investigators may be able to predict which patients are likely to have an
      increased sensitivity.

    <description>Only children with a BIS greater than 95 prior to inhalation of sevoflurane will be included in the study. Inductions will be done using a tight fitting mask with continuous monitoring of end tidal gas concentrations. During induction, concentration of inspired sevoflurane will begin at .5%, and slowly increased by 0.5% every two minutes, until a Bispectral Index (BIS) of 60 or less is reached. Inspired sevoflurane will be increased only after end tidal concentration of sevoflurane is constant for at least one minute. Each induction (except for the patients requiring very low doses of sevoflurane) will take approximately 10 minutes.</description>
