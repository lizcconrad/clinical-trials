  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levodopa is the main drug treatment for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa can cause unwanted and
      uncontrolled movements called dyskinesias (LID). The severity of these movements can range
      from subtle to extremely debilitating. These movements may or may not interfere with normal
      activities such as putting on a coat or brushing ones teeth. Current estimates of the
      occurrence rate of LID range from 12 % to 100% after one year of levodopa treatment. These
      estimates used reporting mechanisms such as self-report and doctor-reported. These reporting
      mechanisms are not reliable. We will use an objective measure of dyskinesia in the first 5
      years of treatment for Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this protocol is to use an
      objective measure to estimate dyskinesia onset.

    <textblock>
      Nearly all Parkinson's disease (PD) patients eventually develop abnormal and unwanted
      movements (dyskinesias; LID) caused by the gold standard treatment, Levodopa. The severity of
      these movements can range from subtle to extremely debilitating and may or may not interfere
      with normal activities such as putting on a coat or brushing ones teeth. Current estimates of
      the prevalence of LID widely range from 12 % to 100% affected after one year. The purpose of
      this study is to estimate the median onset time of levodopa induced dyskinesia in newly
      treated Parkinson's disease patients. All participants will complete seven overnight visits
      at the OCTRI Inpatient unit over 5 years. During the next day, participants will complete a
      mental task while standing on a force plate for one minute every half hour until the end of
      the study. A levodopa IV infusion will occur from 0900 to 1100.
