    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin work in treating
      patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate of combination pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) (Alimta) and
      carboplatin (Paraplatin) in recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube
      carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free interval, overall survival, and adverse effects among
      patients receiving this drug combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 8-15 minutes and carboplatin IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial ovarian,
             primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma

          -  Patients must have received at least 1 prior platinum and taxane based chemotherapy
             regimen; patients may have failed no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens

          -  Patients must have &quot;platinum sensitive&quot; disease, which will be defined as those
             patients with relapsed disease who had an initial complete remission, and relapsed
             more than 6 months after completion of initial platinum based chemotherapy

          -  Recurrent disease must be confirmed by:

               -  Bidimensionally measurable disease which can be measured by physical examination
                  or by means of medical imaging techniques (measurable disease)

                    -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately
                       measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each
                       lesion must be &gt;= 2.0 cm when measured by conventional techniques, including
                       palpation, x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging
                       (MRI), or &gt;= 1.0 cm when measured by spiral CT; all measurable lesions up to
                       a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total representative of
                       all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be
                       recorded and measured at baseline; all baseline evaluations of disease
                       status should be performed as close as possible to the start of treatment

                       and reported as the baseline sum LD; the baseline sum LD will be used as
                       reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the
                       measurable dimension of the disease; all other lesions (or sites of disease)
                       should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at
