  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of preoperative incentive spirometry (IS) as
      an aid to improve postoperative lung function. The hypothesis is that application of a
      standardized protocol of preoperative respiratory care teaching and exercise will improve
      lung performance that will subsequently result in prevention of postoperative pulmonary
      complications and that increasing the duration of preoperative use better improves lung
      mechanics postoperatively. The investigators propose to compare a patient population that
      uses IS as currently prescribed in the routine course of care (only to be familiar with
      preoperatively, but use postoperatively) against a population that uses IS with a
      standardized regimen for at least 3 days prior to the operation in terms of preoperative IS
      volumes, intraoperative pulmonary mechanics, postoperative IS volumes, and incidence of
      postoperative pulmonary complications.

    <description>After the operation, the patients to be discharged on the same day were approached in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and requested to use the spirometer again. The volume (best out of 2 attempts) was recorded together with the same vital signs recorded preoperatively. Patients who were admitted to the hospital were requested to use the spirometer again on postoperative day 1. The largest IS volume (out of 2 attempts) was recorded. The data presented is the mean largest IS volume the day after surgery.</description>

          <title>Control Group</title>
          <description>Patients assigned to the control group were educated on the proper technique of using the incentive spirometer to familiarize themselves with the device. Subjects were instructed to use it for 3 breaths once per day so that they would able to use the device properly and consistently. All patients in this group used the device at least 3 days prior to their surgical procedure.</description>

          <title>Experimental Group</title>
          <description>Patients assigned to the experimental group were instructed to use the incentive spirometer by inhaling as slowly and deeply as possible in a set of 10 times and were asked to repeat the process at least 5 times every day until the day of surgery. All patients in this group used the device at least 3 days prior to their surgical procedure.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Our analysis was limited to measuring lung volumes up until postoperative day 1.Extending this study a few days postoperatively likely would allow us to achieve a better understanding of the course of respiratory function recovery.</limitations_and_caveats>
