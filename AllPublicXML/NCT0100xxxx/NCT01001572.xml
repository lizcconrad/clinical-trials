  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the efficacy and safety of the valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg single-pill
      combination in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension not adequately controlled
      (MSDBP ≥90 mmHg and &lt;110 mmHg) on valsartan 160 mg alone.

    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (MSDBP) From Baseline to Week 8 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Three arterial blood pressure (BP) determinations were made after the participant was in the sitting position for 5 minutes according to the American Heart Association guidelines using a calibrated standard aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer or a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer. The change in the MSDBP was calculated comparing the Week 8 readings to the readings taken at Baseline. The change from baseline in MSDBP was analyzed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with treatment and center (pooled as appropriate) as factors and centered baseline MSDBP as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (MSDBP) From Baseline to Week 8 Endpoint</title>
        <description>Three arterial blood pressure (BP) determinations were made after the participant was in the sitting position for 5 minutes according to the American Heart Association guidelines using a calibrated standard aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer or a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer. The change in the MSDBP was calculated comparing the Week 8 readings to the readings taken at Baseline. The change from baseline in MSDBP was analyzed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with treatment and center (pooled as appropriate) as factors and centered baseline MSDBP as a covariate.</description>
