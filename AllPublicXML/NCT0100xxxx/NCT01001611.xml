      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and confirm hypoglycemic efficacy and safety of
      CKD-501 as mono therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes treated once daily for 24 weeks in
      comparison to placebo.

      Diabetes Mellitus is classified into type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus according
      to the causes of diabetes onset and the treatment of symptoms.

      In type 2 diabetes, the combination of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency is working.
      Diabetes mellitus causing many complications and hospitalization is one of chronic metabolic
      disorder and diabetes mortality rate has been gradually increasing percentage.

      CKD-501 is highly selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist that
      decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and liver resulting in increased
      insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. In vivo, It
      demonstrates that CKD-501 improves even more glycemic and lipid control in comparison to
      rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.

      The aim of this phase 3 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CKD-501 once daily
      for 24 weeks as a monotherapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the extension study
      for additional 28 weeks is designed to confirm long term safety of CKD-501 as an oral
      hypoglycemic agent.
