    <textblock>
      PLX3397 is a selective inhibitor of Fms, Kit, and oncogenic Flt3 activity. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered
      PLX3397 in patients with advanced, incurable, solid tumors in which these target kinases are
      linked to disease pathophysiology. The secondary objective is to measure the pharmacodynamic
      activity of PLX3397 via blood, plasma and urine biomarkers of Fms activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 and older

          -  Solid tumors refractory to standard therapy

          -  For the Extension cohorts, patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria
             and meet the following disease-specific criteria:

               -  For advanced or recurrent mucoepidermal carcinoma (MEC) of the salivary gland,
                  patients must not be candidates for curative surgery or radiotherapy.

               -  For pigmented villo-nodular synovitis (PVNS), patients must have a histologically
                  confirmed diagnosis of inoperable progressive or relapsing PVNS, or resectable
                  tumor requesting mutilating surgery, as well as demonstrated progressive disease
                  in the last 12 months.

               -  For gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), patients must have failed previous
                  therapy with imatinib and sunitinib. Patients with known PDGFR mutations are
                  excluded, but mutation testing is not required for study entry.

               -  For anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), patients must have histologically or
                  cytologically diagnosed advanced ATC.

               -  For metastatic solid tumors with documented malignant pleural and/or peritoneal
                  effusions, patients must not be receiving specific therapy for the effusion or
                  have an indwelling drain.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months

          -  Adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific anti-cancer therapy within 3 weeks of study start

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Refractory nausea or vomiting, or malabsorption

          -  Mean QTc &gt;= 450 msec (for males) or QTc &gt;= 470 msec (for females)
