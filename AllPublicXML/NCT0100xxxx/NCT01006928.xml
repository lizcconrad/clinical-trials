  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is a traumatic event for parents. They cope with threatening and unfamiliar
      environment of hospital, losing the parental role, and frustration. The NICU team is the main
      support source for these parents. Support and providing information are most important for
      parents, as they can have some control, involvement and self confidence during the
      hospitalization, and also feel healthier. The hypothesis of this study is that better support
      to parents lead to better subjective health feeling by them.

      The study will be held among mothers to infants in NICU who are at least 7 days old. The
      study will use a questionaire to assess the subjective health feeling and the estimation of
      the support from the team. Sample size is about 150 mothers.
