  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A specific group of neurons in the brain produces hypocretin, a peptide which has been
      established as an important regulator of sleep and wakefulness. Activation of these neurons
      (increased hypocretin) stabilizes wakefulness; impairing or blocking these neurons (decreased
      hypocretin) promotes sleep. Evidence suggests that these neurons may be involved in the
      hypnotic properties of several anesthetics, and play a role in the induction and emergence
      from anesthesia. In humans there is a considerable inter-individual variability in hypocretin
      levels. This study aims to investigate how hypocretin levels affect the anesthetic care and
      recovery of patients undergoing elective hip surgery.
