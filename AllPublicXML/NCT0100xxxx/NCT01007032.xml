    <textblock>
      In this study, patients will initially receive intravenous (I.V.) IMC-A12 every 2 weeks or
      every 3 weeks for 6 weeks (one cycle). After the first cycle, patients experiencing a best
      overall response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease will continue to
      receive IMC-A12 at their cohort dose and schedule until there is evidence of progressive
      disease (PD), or until other withdrawal criteria are met. Patients will be enrolled at one
      study center, located in the National Cancer Center Hospital - East, Kashiwa, Japan.
      Approximately 20-30 patients are anticipated.

      Patients in this single-center, open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study will initially
      receive intravenous (I.V.) IMC-A12 every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks for 6 weeks (one cycle).
      After the first cycle, patients experiencing a best overall response of complete response
      (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) will continue to receive IMC-A12 at their
      cohort dose and schedule until there is evidence of progressive disease (PD), or until other
      withdrawal criteria are met.

      A minimum of three patients will be enrolled in each cohort. The starting dose in Cohort 1
      will be 6 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks. Dose escalation from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2 (10
      mg/kg administered every 2 weeks) will occur once at least three patients in Cohort 1 have
      completed one cycle of therapy (ie, completed the initial 6 week treatment period or
      discontinued therapy due to an IMC-A12 -related adverse event [AE]).

      Enrollment into Cohort 3 (starting dose: 15 mg/kg administered every 3 weeks) will not
      proceed until all patients have completed one cycle of therapy (as defined above) in Cohort
      2. Similarly, patients will be enrolled in Cohort 4 once at least three patients have
      completed one cycle of therapy in Cohort 3; patients in Cohort 4 will receive 20 mg/kg
      administered every 3 weeks. Toxicity data for each cohort will be reviewed prior to any dose
      escalation. No intrapatient dose escalation is permitted. Patients in any cohort who do not
      complete the first 6 weeks of treatment for reasons other than an IMC-A12 -related toxicity
      will be replaced.

      A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events, if considered by
      the investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to IMC-A12 : Grade 4
      neutropenia lasting &gt; 7 days; Grade 4 anemia; Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia; Grade ≥ 3
      neutropenia associated with fever; Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, excluding
      electrolyte abnormality and Grade 3 hyperglycemia; Grade 4 hyperglycemia; and/or Grade 4 or
      uncontrollable hypertension.

      If three patients complete the first 6-week cycle (according to the definition outlined
      above) with no DLTs, dose escalation to Cohort 2 may proceed. If one DLT is observed in the
      initial three patients of Cohort 1 (or any cohort) during Cycle 1, three additional patients
      will be enrolled into that cohort. If no additional DLTs are observed, dose escalation may
      continue as described above.

      If two or more patients in Cohort 1 experience a DLT, six patients will be enrolled into
      Cohort 1A (receiving 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks). If two or more patients experience a DLT in dose
      Cohort 3, six patients will be enrolled into dose Cohort 3A (10 mg/kg every 3 weeks). If two
      or more patients experience a DLT in dose Cohorts 2 or 4, six additional patients will be
      enrolled into the previous cohort (Cohort 1 or Cohort 3, respectively), and the previous
      cohort will be considered the maximum tolerated dose for that dosing schedule. If two or more
      patients in any cohort experience a DLT on Week 7 or beyond (after Cycle 1), the data will be
      reviewed and enrollment may be suspended. The Sponsor and Principal Investigator, with
      reference to the review of the Independent Data Safety Evaluation Committee (established in a
      separate document), will determine whether enrollment should resume.
