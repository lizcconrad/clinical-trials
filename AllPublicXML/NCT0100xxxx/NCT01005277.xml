      RATIONALE: Studying samples of DNA from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in DNA samples from patients with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Collect DNA samples from patients with cytogenetically, well characterized, and
           uniformly treated acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia for use in
           analysis of a wide range of host factors influencing etiology and outcome of the
           disease.

        -  Identify host factors that can be determined at onset of treatment to predict outcome of
           chemotherapy, and thus modify the therapy administered.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected DNA samples are analyzed for polymorphisms at a variety of
      loci. Gene expression and expression profiles are correlated with genotype and therapy
      outcomes.
