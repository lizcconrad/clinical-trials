  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The build up of plaque in the wall of the artery supplying blood to the brain poses a risk of
      stroke when the plaques become unstable and fragile. It is important to determine which
      patients are most at risk so that surgery can be performed. There is evidence that the risk
      is greatest when these plaques become oxygen deficient (hypoxic). The investigators wish to
      use PET imaging to identify hypoxic plaque, to help decide whether and when to perform
      surgery. The investigators have developed radiotracers (imaging agents) for this purpose, and
      this study is to determine whether they will work in patients.
