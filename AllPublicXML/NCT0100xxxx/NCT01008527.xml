  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine what side effects CP 870,893 may cause when given
      with an immune stimulant called Oncovir poly IC:LC along with a melanoma vaccine. The CP
      870,893, the Oncovir poly IC:LC and the melanoma vaccine are investigational drugs that have
      not been combined in patients before, and that have not been approved for sale by the Food
      and Drug Administration. The Oncovir poly IC:LC is intended to stimulate the body's immune
      system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibodies such as CP 870,893 are chemicals made by immune cells naturally found in the human
      body. CP 870,893 was produced in cells grown from a hamster but is fully human in
      composition. The vaccine contains peptides (pieces) from two different proteins called
      NY-ESO-1 and gp100. Each one is made by 50-100% of melanomas. These proteins can be
      recognized by the immune system. They will be injected under the skin of the participant's
      thigh in combination with, or without an oil-based substance, called &quot;Montanide ISA 51 VG&quot;.
      The Montanide ISA 51 VG is an adjuvant or &quot;assistant&quot; which stimulates the body's immune
      system. The peptides in the vaccine, the Montanide ISA 51 VG, the Oncovir poly IC:LC and the
      CP 870,893 antibody are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but the FDA is
      permitting their use in this study. It is believed that the CP 870,893 and the Oncovir poly
      IC:LC will boost the body's immune response against the melanoma vaccine, although this
      vaccine has not been proven to help the patient's melanoma.

    <description>Patients get the study drug Oncovir poly IC:LC with or without CP 870-893. Up to 6 groups of 3 to 10 patients each will be treated in this study. The first group (between 3 and 6 patients) gets peptide vaccine with poly IC:LC. Second, third and fourth groups of 3 to 6 patients receive peptide vaccine with poly IC:LC and the antibody CP 870,893 at increasing doses from 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg. CP 870-893 will be given to 10 patients at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg to patients in the fifth group, and 0.2 mg/kg to the sixth group. The CP 870,893 will be given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes and will be given once every 2 weeks for the first 6 infusions. CP-870-893 will then be given every 4 to 6 weeks for 3 injections. The final 3 injections of CP 870,893 will be given every 8 to 12 weeks. These infusions will take place on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 21, 25, 33, 41, and 53 for a total of 12 infusions.</description>

    <description>Study drug will be administered open-label as an intravenous solution, followed by observation. Study drug will be supplied as a liquid intravenous solution in vials containing 10 mg/mL of CP870,893. CP 870,893 will be administered at a dosage of 0.01, 0.025 or 0.05 mg/kg at 0.24 mg/mL infused via a syringe pump over 15 minutes, or at 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg/dose as an i.v. infusion in saline at a concentration of 0.24 mg/mL in an IV bag of up to 100 mL over 30 minutes (controlled by a volumetric pump) for not more than 30 minutes, with a 10 cc flush at the end that should be administered at the same rate as the CP 879,893 infusion.</description>
