      Aim:

      To examine the effects of the caregiver psychoeducational consultation program in reducing
      caregiver burdens, depression, sleep quality, and improving the experience in close
      relationship, positive meaning of illness and quality of life.

      This is the 2-year study. The design adopts the randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      caregivers of patients with spouse caregivers of resectable metastatic colorectal cancer will
      be randomly assigned into two groups: one group receiving usual care, another group receiving
      the caregiver psychoeducational consultation program (CPCP). The usual care includes
      providing education materials only. Measurement time-points include pre intervention, post
      intervention, &amp; then 1, and 3 months after the end of intervention for the maintenance
      effect.
