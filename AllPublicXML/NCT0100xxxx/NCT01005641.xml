    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors are the standard treatment for hormone responsive advanced breast
      cancer. The combination of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane with with another breast cancer
      drug that blocks epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Erb-2 activity (lapatinib) is
      being studied for the possibility of improving response to therapy, and delaying resistance
      to endocrine therapy.

      The recommended dose of lapatinib will be determined in the first part of the study. In the
      second part of the study, patients will receive the recommended dose of lapatinib and
      exemestane daily, taken orally.
