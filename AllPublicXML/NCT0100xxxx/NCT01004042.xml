      The primary objective of this study is to determine the alterations in quality of life and
      self-steem after BOTOX® injections in the glabella in depressed and non-depressed patients.

      The secondary objective of this study are:

        -  to elaborate a description of the muscles involved in the Veraguth Fold

        -  to evaluate depressive symptoms using Beck Depression Inventory before and after Botox®
           injections.

        -  to elucidate that depression is not a contraindication for botulinum toxin injections.

      The study consists of two groups: one with diagnosis of depression (diagnostic criteria from
      DSM-IV-TR and MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview - Brazilian version 5.0) and
      other without diagnosis of depression.

      Subjects with depression will be part of group 1. They must be using a therapeutic dose of
      antidepressant for at least 2 months before the intervention prescribed by a psychiatrist.

      Subjects with no diagnosis of depression will be part of group 2. Subjects included in the
      study will receive injections of 20 U (as minimal dose) to 40 U (as maximum dose) of BTX-A
      (BOTOX®/Allergan, USA) diluted in 0.9% saline, according to standard injections of 4U in 5
      points of glabellar area as the treatment.

      Four visits will be scheduled. Visit 0 (baseline), Visit 1 (intervention), visit 2 (4 weeks),
      visit 3 (8 weeks) visit 4 (12 weeks).

      The scales for the assessment of depressive symptoms, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), will
      be applied at visits 1,2,3,4; WHOQOL BREF will be applied at baseline visit and 4.

      Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale will be applied in all visits. Photographs will be taken as well
      as the dermatological evaluation of the wrinkles and folds will be assessed using a 4-points
      validated Severity Wrinkles Scale, and psychiatric evaluation as well, in both groups.
