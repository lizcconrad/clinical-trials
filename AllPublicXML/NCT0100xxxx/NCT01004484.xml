      Hypothesis:

        -  Daily consumption of yogurt containing probiotic bacteria (Bb12) and inulin will
           significantly decrease whole gut and intestinal segmental transit time

        -  The effect of accelerating intestinal transit will be associated with other GI
           physiology parameters including stool frequency and stool consistency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous preliminary study we have shown that daily consumption of a probiotic yogurt
      drink containing probiotic bacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12) and inulin significantly
      accelerate colonic transit time in non-patients population with functional bowel symptoms. In
      this study we investigate the physiologic effect(s) of yogurt with the same bacteria and
      inulin on gastrointestinal function by assessing its effect on the whole gut and segmental
      transit time using SmartPill™ - a recently introduced device of measuring intestinal transit
      time. The proposed study will provide additional information on the effect on the whole gut
      transit as well as on other segments of the GI tract (stomach and small bowel). Assessment of
      transit time in the proposed study will be done following 10 to 14 days of the probiotic
      yogurt consumption.
