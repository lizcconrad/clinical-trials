      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from young patients
      with very low risk Wilms tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To validate the utility of CUGBP2, HMGA2, and MEIS2 mRNA expression and 11p15
           methylation to define a population of pediatric patients with very low risk Wilms tumor
           (VLRWT) that have virtually no risk of relapse.

        -  To validate the utility of WT-1 mutation and 11p15 loss of heterozygosity analysis to
           determine a population of VLRWT that have a higher risk of relapse when not treated with
           chemotherapy.

        -  To validate the utility of NFYA, STRA6, TOB2, PDCD4, and SP3 mRNA expression to predict
           relapse in VLRWT.

        -  To investigate the feasibility of broadening the definition of VLRWT through analysis of
           stage I and II epithelial differentiated tumors registered on clinical trial COG-Q9401
           (NWTS-5) for CUGBP2, HMGA2, MEIS2, and 11p15 methylation.

      OUTLINE: Previously banked tumor tissue samples are analyzed for mRNA expression of CUGBP2,
      HMGA2, and MEIS2 via reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR and are classified as loss of
      heterozygosity (LOH), loss of imprinting, or neither via 11p15 analysis. Samples are also
      analyzed for WT-1 mutation via quantitative PCR and 11p LOH using 11p15 methylation analysis
      and expression of NFYA, STRA6, TOB2, PDCD4, and SP3 via quantitative RT-PCR
