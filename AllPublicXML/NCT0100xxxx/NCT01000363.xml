    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to increase access to diabetes education by delivering it in a
      culturally-appropriate community setting and by involving different members of the diabetes
      care team including physicians, diabetes educators, and health promoters/community health
      workers.

      Diabetes medical group visits will be held at the Grady North DeKalb satellite clinic the
      third Thursday of the month starting in October 2009. There will be two cohorts of patients-
      English speaking patients and Spanish speaking patients. Each group will be scheduled for 4
      2-hour group visits throughout a period of 9 months. These visits will be every 8 weeks for
      each group. During the visit, the patient will be seen by a physician, attend a diabetes
      education session, re-fill their diabetes medications and receive lab orders.

      Patients who participate in the diabetes group visits should achieve improvement in Clinical
      outcomes - better A1C levels, reduced blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels ; adherence
      to evidence-based medicine - keeping appointments and scheduling eye exams, foot-checks,
      and/or taking medication as prescribed; behavioral outcomes- goal setting, achievement of
      goals, problem solving; access - attendance at educational sessions; ability to obtain
      affordable medications and devices; and satisfaction among patients and health professionals.

    <description>Each group will be scheduled for 4 2-hour group visits throughout a period of 9 months. These visits will be every 8 weeks for each group. During the visit, the patient will be seen by a physician, attend a diabetes education session, re-fill their diabetes medications, get orders for labs due, vaccinations and diabetes-related referrals.
This visit will only focus on the patient's diabetes care. Each patient will continue to see their regular physician for their health care.
All of the services that will be provided at the medical group visit are standard of care and are the same that the patient will receive in a one-on-one visit. However, this format will allow the patient to been seen by the physician and receive diabetes education in one visit.</description>
