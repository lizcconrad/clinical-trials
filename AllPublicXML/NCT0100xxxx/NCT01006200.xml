      This study is aimed to determine factors leading to obstructive granulation tissue formation
      after placement of Self-Expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS) in patients with benign tracheal
      diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From August 2001 to September 2007, patients with benign tracheal stenosis who underwent
      endoscopic tracheal stent placements at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a
      university-affiliated hospital in Northern Taiwan, were evaluated.

      Definition of airway conditions Dynamic collapse (tracheao-malacia) was defined as tracheal
      lumen narrowing on expiration under bronchoscopic examination. Structural tracheal stenosis
      was defined as tracheal stenosis excluding dynamic collapse. Etiologies of structural
      tracheal stenosis were post-intubation or tracheostomy, post-tuberculosis infection,
      granulation tissue formation cause previous SEMS re-stenosis, previous SEMS fracture,
      corrosive injury with stricture, mediastinitis cause airway stricture, and goiter
      compression.

      Obstructive granulation tissue formation after SEMS implantation was defined as granulation
      tissue obstructing the lumen of the SEMS under bronchoscopic examination, including the
      proximal and distal ends.

      Significant variables, such as structural obstruction airway before SEMS implantation was
      entered into a forward logistical regression analysis to determine the net effect of each
      predictor while controlling the net effects of others to obstructive granulation tissue
      formation. Obstructive granulation tissue formation curves between patients with and those
      without structural tracheal stenosis before SEMS implantation were compared by log rank test.

        Patients with benign tracheal stenosis who underwent endoscopic tracheal stent placements
        at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a university-affiliated hospital in Northern Taiwan,
        were evaluated.

        Chest surgeon were routinely consulted to evaluate feasibility of silicon stent placement
        in benign airway obstruction. All patients in our study were those unsuitable to receive
        silicon stent placement.
