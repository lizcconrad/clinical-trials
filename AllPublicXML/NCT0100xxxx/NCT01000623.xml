    <textblock>
      Rationale: Venlafaxine may help relieve hot flashes in women who have had breast cancer.
      Hypnosis or focused attention may help control hot flashes in postmenopausal women. It is not
      yet known whether giving venlafaxine together with hypnosis or focused attention is more
      effective in treating hot flashes.

      Purpose: This randomized clinical trial is studying venlafaxine together with hypnosis or
      focused attention in treating patients with hot flashes.

      Objectives:

      I. To evaluate the effect of hypnosis plus venlafaxine versus focused attention with
      venlafaxine versus hypnosis plus a placebo versus focused attention plus a placebo for
      reducing hot flashes.

      II. To evaluate the side effects associated with hypnosis with venlafaxine versus focused
      attention with venlafaxine versus hypnosis plus a placebo versus focused attention plus a
      placebo for reducing hot flashes.

      III. To evaluate the effects of the four treatment arms on mood, sleep, hot flash
      interference and menopause quality of life.

      IV. To explore the role of expectancy and hypnotizability as moderators of the effect of each
      of the four treatment arms in reducing hot flashes.

      Outline: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms. Patients receive oral
      venlafaxine or a placebo and practice hypnosis or focused attention.

             allowing women of childbearing potential with hot flashes to participate would
             introduce a hormonal heterogeneous population that would confound the ability to
