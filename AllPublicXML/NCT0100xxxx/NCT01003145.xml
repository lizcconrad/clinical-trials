  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, laboratory-blinded study in healthy male and non-pregnant female
      designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an inactivated
      influenza H1N1 vaccine (AdimFlu-S). In the adult cohort, all volunteers were randomized in a
      1:1:1 ratio to receive 2 injections of AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1) 15 mcg HA at 3 weeks apart, 2
      injections of AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1) 30 mcg HA at 3 weeks apart or 1 injection of AdimFlu-S
      (A/H1N1) 15 mcg HA. In the elders cohort, all volunteers were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive 2 injections of AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1) 15 mcg HA at 3 weeks apart or 2 injections of
      AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1) 30 mcg HA at 3 weeks apart.

      Following immunization, safety was measured by assessment of adverse events for 6 weeks
      following the first vaccination, serious adverse events and new-onset chronic medical
      conditions through 7 months post first vaccination; and reactogenicity to the vaccines for 7
      days following each vaccination. Immunogenicity testing included hemagglutinin inhibition
      (HAI) testing on serum obtained before first vaccination, and three and six weeks after first
      vaccination.
