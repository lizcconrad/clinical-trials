  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leprosy is an infectious disease of slow evolution, manifested primarily by signs and
      symptoms dermatoneurological with skin lesions and peripheral nerve, especially in the eyes,
      hands and feet. The prevention of disability is essential for the control of complications.
      Objective: To evaluate the physical and functional status of hands, feet and eyes, for the
      appearance and evolution of sensory and motor deficiencies and classification of disability
      (WHO) of a group of leprosy patients to compare and monitor the result treatment on the
      progression of neuropathy and recurrence of reactions. Methodology: We performed initial
      physical therapy evaluation and final, after 12 months. We conducted a clinical trial of a
      series of 26 cases evaluated with newly diagnosed leprosy, treated by standard medication.
      There were used methods of qualitative and quantitative. An illustrated manual of guidelines
      was especially developed for this study.
