  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational study product used in this clinical trial is a soft drink containing an
      arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) preparation extracted from wheat bran (hereafter called
      Wheat Bran Extract, WBE).

      The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of the intake of two WBE doses on
      various parameters of gastrointestinal health. Additionally, safety was analyzed using
      treatment emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and clinical blood parameters.
