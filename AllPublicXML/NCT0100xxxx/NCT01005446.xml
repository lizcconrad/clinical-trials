      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use and efficacy of the Reverse® Shoulder
      Prosthesis for treatment of rotator cuff deficiency in subjects who are candidates for a
      total shoulder replacement (primary and revision subjects).

      Reverse shoulder arthroplasty for the treatment of rotator cuff deficiency and glenohumeral
      arthritis have shown favorable outcomes in pain and function over the short and medium term.
      A prospective, multi-center study on the outcomes of subjects treated with the RSP would be a
      valuable addition to the literature and give important information regarding an
      ever-increasing treatment option for subjects with rotator cuff deficiency. The study will
      take place at multiple sites across the United States and will be managed by the DJO Surgical
      Clinical Affairs Department. The study will include only subjects who meet the indications
      for use criteria for the Reverse® Shoulder Prosthesis and who are candidates for total
      shoulder replacement surgery.
