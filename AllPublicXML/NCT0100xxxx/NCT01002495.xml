      A phase I/II, open label, dose-escalation, multicenter, 12 month study designed to assess the
      safety and tolerability of catheter based percutaneous myocardial injection of VM202 in
      patients with chronic refractory myocardial ischemia. The study will consist of three (3)
      cohorts with a total of 4 subjects enrolled in each cohort. Endocardial injections will be
      performed with the MyoStar Injection Catheter under guidance of the NOGA XP Cardiac
      Navigation System.

          -  Stable chronic refractory angina classified as Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
             functional class II - IV

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥30% and ≤ 50%;

          -  Clinical signs and symptoms of significant ischemia by treadmill test or Stress
             imaging (SPECT, Echo or CARDIAC MRI acceptable)

          -  Subjects must be able to complete a minimum of 3 minutes, but no more than 10 minutes
             on a Modified Bruce treadmill protocol.

          -  Patients on maximal medical therapy including at least 2 of the following (unless
             hemodynamic parameters or intolerance contraindicate their use):(a) Long acting
             nitrate, (b) Beta Blocker or (c) Calcium Channel Blocker (d) Ranolazine. Optimal
             medical regimen for each subject will be decided by the referring cardiologist or
             principal investigator. Patients must be on stable medical regimen for 30 days prior
             to enrollment.

          -  Coronary angiogram within 1 year to confirm the presence of coronary disease which is
             not amenable to standard revascularization procedures.

          -  Candidates must not be eligible for any other revascularization procedures. The
             participant and his/her coronary film must have been discussed with an independent
             cardiac surgeon and must have been denied for CABG or PTCA. Participants who are
             marginal or poor candidates for conventional revascularization will be considered
             eligible if the risks of performing a CABG or PTCA procedure outweigh the potential
             benefit and/or such a procedure is unlikely to offer a worthwhile clinical benefit.
             The criteria defining such cases may include, but may not be limited to, the following
             examples:

               -  Diffuse or distal vessel disease

          -  Subjects with childbearing potential must take acceptable measure to prevent pregnancy
             during the course of the study.

          -  Subject capable of understanding with the protocol and signing the informed consent
             document prior to any study related procedure.
