  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a practice procedure for lymphatic drainage mapping
      with the intent of providing a new tool that could potentially be used for radiation
      treatment planning. High-risk prostate cancer patients who are scheduled to be treated with
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may be eligible to enroll in this study. 99mTc-sulfur
      nanocolloid, a radiopharmaceutical (&quot;tracer&quot;) will be injected by a urologist using
      transrectal ultrasound guidance (TRUS)at the UCSF Urology Clinic. Participants will then
      undergo SPECT/CT imaging at the UCSF Nuclear Medicine Clinic. This study will evaluate the
      feasibility of transporting patients to the Nuclear Medicine Clinic for imaging within 1-3
      hours after administration of 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The entire study procedure involves 1) preparation of 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid, 2)
      administration of 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid with transrectal ultrasound guidance, 3) transfer
      of the patient to the Nuclear Medicine clinic for SPECT/CT (Infinia Hawkeye, GE Healthcare)
      imaging, and 4) tomographically capturing distributions of 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid uptake in
      the patient's lymphatic drainage sites within a practical image acquisition time (1-3 h
      postinjection) considering the patient transit time between injection and imaging.

      Administration of 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid will be performed at the UCSF Urology clinic. The
      injection will be performed following the clinically accepted method that has been described
      by European investigators. 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid imaging utilizes trace amounts of
      radioactivity. 100-200 MBq (2.7-5.4 mCi) of 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid will be administered
      into two lobes of the prostate gland under transrectal ultrasound guidance with three
      fractions each into peripheral and central zone of the prostatic apex, mid portion, and base.
      1% Lidocaine may be administered for local anesthesia per routine clinical protocol as deemed
      appropriate by the performing urologist.

      The procedure will be considered feasible if the practice procedure (from injection to
      completion of imaging) is successfully implemented within 3 hours of injection (including
      patient transport time). Imaging will be considered successful if radiotracer is
      qualitatively detected within the prostate and local lymphatic system.

    <description>There was only one arm for this study. All participants who had prostate cancer received 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid injection and imaged by SPECT/CT within 3 hours of injection. The imaging studies qualitatively detected radiotracer distribution within the prostate and local lymphatic system. The detection of the radiotracer distribution was performed by experienced attending nuclear medicine physicians at UCSF. The qualitative detection includes visual lymph node uptake seen by SPECT scans overlaid on coregistered CT scans.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Diagnosis of definitive high-risk prostate cancer

          -  Clinically eligible and scheduled for definitive IMRT treatment with pelvic lymph
             nodal radiation (not a study procedure)

          -  At least one of the following risk factors:

               1. Pathologically confirmed pelvic nodal involvement;

               2. Enlarged pelvic lymph nodes (greater than 1 cm in the short axis) visible on CT
                  or MRI images, or

               3. Greater than 15% risk of lymph node involvement calculated using the equation:
                  Risk of positive nodes (%) = (2/3) prostate specific antigen (PSA) + [(Gleason
                  score - 6)] × 10]. This formula is used to estimate the pathologic stage of
                  prostate cancer with preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason
                  score, and adopted by many radiation oncology clinics, including our own
                  radiation oncology physicians.

             requirements of the protocol
