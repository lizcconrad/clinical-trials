  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The elimination of the carbohydrate galactose is used in daily clinical work with liver
      patients as a quantitative measure of metabolic liver function, as the liver test &quot;The
      Galactose Elimination Capacity&quot;, GEC. We are working to develop a PET/CT scanning procedure
      for providing 3D images of the hepatic galactose elimination and measurement of regional
      values. This may be used for example for planning resection or stereotactic radiotherapy of a
      patient with malignant tumor in the liver. Will the patient be able to tolerate removal of
      the necessary part of the liver? We will include 10 patients with liver cirrhosis and 6
      healthy human subjects. Direct measurements of the hepatic galactose elimination (successive
      constant iv infusions of galactose in increasing doses with measurements of blood
      concentrations of galactose in blood from an artery and a liver vein, and measurements of
      liver blood flow by indocyanine green, Ficks principle) are compared with PET/CT measurements
      after iv injection of a 18F-labelled galactose analog, FDGal.

      Based on previous studies in pigs, we perform detailed calculations of the hepatic galactose
      elimination kinetics by the two methods, including estimation of a factor (&quot;lumped constant&quot;)
      for recalculating PET/CT data to data for natural galactose.

      Besides possible practical clinical importance, the project elucidates basic problems
      concerning liver metabolism using PET.
