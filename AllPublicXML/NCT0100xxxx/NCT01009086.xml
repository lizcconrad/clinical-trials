  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (participants are assigned different treatments based on chance),
      double-blind (neither the participant nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is
      being taken, or at what dosage), parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated
      at the same time), and multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study. Approximately,
      615 participants will participate in this study. Participants will be assigned to one of
      three treatment groups: Group I: ustekinumab 45 mg, Group II: ustekinumab 90 mg, and Group
      III: placebo group (an inactive substance). Participants will receive either 45 mg
      ustekinumab or 90 mg ustekinumab at Weeks 0, 4, and every 12 weeks until Week 88 as
      randomized to respective groups. Participants in placebo group will receive placebo at Weeks
      0, 4, 16, and 20 and 45 mg ustekinumab at Weeks 24 and 28 followed by every 12 weeks dosing
      until Week 88. Participants who do not have greater than or equal to 5 percentage improvement
      in their disease (tender and swollen joints) will be eligible for an early escape.
      Specifically, during early escape at Week 16, participants in Group I will receive 90 mg
      ustekinumab, for participants in Group II same dosing schedule will be continued, and
      participants in placebo group will receive 45 mg ustekinumab. Safety evaluations will include
      assessments of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and physical examination. The
      maximum study duration will be approximately 108 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response at Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR 20 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 20 percent improvement from baseline in swollen (66 joints) and tender (68 joints) joint counts and greater than or equal to 20 percent improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) Participant's assessment of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm), 2) Participant's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm), 3) Physician's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 centimeters [cm]) 4) Participant's assessment of physical function as measured by the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI) (score of 0-3 in 8 functional areas) and 5) C reactive protein.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Disability Index Score as Measured With the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 (no difficulty), to 3 (inability to perform a task in that area). The average score across the functional areas yields an overall HAQ-DI score which ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). In psoriatic arthritis, a decrease in score of 0.30 indicates clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants (With &gt;= 3% Baseline Body Surface Area (BSA) Psoriatic Involvement) Who Achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI 75) Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a physician-administered assessment tool used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). A PASI 75 response is defined as greater than or equal to 75 percent improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR 50 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 50 percent improvement from baseline in swollen (66 joints) and tender (68 joints) joint counts and greater than or equal to 50 percent improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) Participant's assessment of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm), 2) Participant's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm), 3) Physician's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm) 4)Participant's assessment of physical function as measured by the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI) (score of 0-3 in 8 functional areas) and 5) C reactive protein.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 70 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR 70 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 70 percent improvement from baseline in swollen (66 joints) and tender (68 joints) joint counts and greater than or equal to 70 percent improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) Participant's assessment of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm), 2) Participant's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm), 3) Physician's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm) 4) Participant's assessment of physical function as measured by the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI) (score of 0-3 in 8 functional areas) and 5) C reactive protein.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Total Modified Van Der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) Score for the Combined Radiographic Data From Studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The modified vdH-S score is a radiographic evaluation of hand and feet erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) for 20 joints per hand and 6 joints per foot with a total score ranging from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher score and positive score changes indicate more radiographic damage and radiographic progression, respectively. As per protocol, analysis for this outcome measure used pooled data from 2 studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and PSA3002) because initial power assumptions showed that 900 participants would be required to evaluate impact of ustekinumab on structural damage (SD) progression. The 2 studies, (which had similar study designs and dosing regimens with difference to prior exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapies), were intended to independently measure efficacy in terms of signs, symptoms and physical function, while effects on SD progression is provided from an integrated analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Disability Index Score as Measured With the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI)</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 (no difficulty), to 3 (inability to perform a task in that area). The average score across the functional areas yields an overall HAQ-DI score which ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). In psoriatic arthritis, a decrease in score of 0.30 indicates clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

        <description>The PASI is a physician-administered assessment tool used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). A PASI 75 response is defined as greater than or equal to 75 percent improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Total Modified Van Der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) Score for the Combined Radiographic Data From Studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002</title>
        <description>The modified vdH-S score is a radiographic evaluation of hand and feet erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) for 20 joints per hand and 6 joints per foot with a total score ranging from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher score and positive score changes indicate more radiographic damage and radiographic progression, respectively. As per protocol, analysis for this outcome measure used pooled data from 2 studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and PSA3002) because initial power assumptions showed that 900 participants would be required to evaluate impact of ustekinumab on structural damage (SD) progression. The 2 studies, (which had similar study designs and dosing regimens with difference to prior exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapies), were intended to independently measure efficacy in terms of signs, symptoms and physical function, while effects on SD progression is provided from an integrated analysis.</description>

            <description>Participants received subcutaneous injections of placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 16, and 20. At Week 24 participants crossed over to receive subcutaneous injections of ustekinumab 45 milligram (mg) at Weeks 24 and 28 and every 12 weeks thereafter with the last dose at Week 88. If early escape, subcutaneous injections of 45 mg ustekinumab were given at Weeks 16, 20, and 28 and every 12 weeks thereafter with the last dose at Week 88. For participants entering early escape, a subcutaneous placebo injection was given at Week 24 to maintain the blind.</description>
