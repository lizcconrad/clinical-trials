      This trial investigates pemetrexed and cisplatin followed by pemetrexed and cisplatin in
      combination with radiotherapy in participants with locally advanced, non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of the study is to assess the antitumor activity as measured by
      progression free survival 1 year after start of treatment with study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will receive 2 cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin. If the participants
      achieve complete response, partial response or stable disease as defined by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, have ≤35% of the total calculated
      lung volume receive more than 20 Gy (V20) according to the 3-dimensional (3-D) radiotherapy
      planning Dose Volume Histograms, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
      performance status of 0 or 1, have no residual neurological toxicity &gt; Grade 2 according to
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), they will receive 2 additional cycles
      of pemetrexed and cisplatin, combined with radiotherapy. The combination of radiotherapy will
      begin 22 to 36 days after completion of the second infusion of induction therapy with
      pemetrexed-cisplatin.

    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from study enrollment to the first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment. For participants who received subsequent systemic anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study drug) prior to objectively determined PD or death, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to start of postdiscontinuation chemotherapy. If a participant did not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then PFS was censored at the enrollment date, regardless whether or not objectively determined PD or death had been observed for the participant.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Objective Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of first dose through end of follow-up [up to 30 weeks (1 cycle=21 days)]</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with confirmed complete response (CR), confirmed partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0) criteria, as well as participants with a not evaluable/tumor response unknown. CR: disappearance of all tumor lesions. PR: either a) at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as a reference baseline sum LDs, or b) complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (not worsening) of 1 or more nontarget lesions. In either case, no new lesions appeared. SD: small changes that did not meet above criteria. PD: at least a 20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Participants who discontinued study treatment (for reasons other than progression) before entering concurrent phase were considered to have non-evaluable response.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Study treatment had 2 phases and follow-up. Induction phase: 2 cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin. Then, if eligible, the concurrent phase: 2 more cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin and thoracic radiotherapy. Follow-up period: Started when treatment discontinued or completed, and lasted up to 2 years after first dose of pemetrexed.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Induction phase (2 cycles). Pemetrexed: 500 milligrams per square meter (mg/m²) intravenous infusion on Day 1 of 21-day cycle. Cisplatin: 75 mg/m² intravenous infusion on Day 1 of 21-day cycle.
Participants eligible for concurrent phase (2 more cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin treatment and radiotherapy) if they had complete response, partial response, or stable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines), total lung volume receiving more than 20 gray (Gy) ≤35% (dose volume histogram), 0 or 1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, no residual neurological toxicity &gt;Grade 2 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events).
Thoracic Radiotherapy: 2 Gy/fraction after completion of pemetrexed and cisplatin infusions on Day 1 of Cycle 3 and continued daily (5 days per week) until total delivered dose was 66 Gy, over approximately 7 weeks.
Folic acid, Vitamin B12 supplements, and prophylactic dexamethasone administered per approved pemetrexed label.</description>

          <title>Stage of Disease</title>
          <description>Classification based on American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging System for lung cancer (sixth edition, 2002). Disease stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. Stages range from 0 (not spread) to IV (spread throughout the body). Stage IIIA is a locally advanced cancer that spread to lymph nodes within the chest area. Stage IIIB is a locally advanced cancer that spread to nearby tissue or far away lymph nodes, or has fluid, containing cancer cells, built up between the layers lining the lungs.</description>

        <title>1 Year Progression Free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from study enrollment to the first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment. For participants who received subsequent systemic anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study drug) prior to objectively determined PD or death, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to start of postdiscontinuation chemotherapy. If a participant did not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then PFS was censored at the enrollment date, regardless whether or not objectively determined PD or death had been observed for the participant.</description>
