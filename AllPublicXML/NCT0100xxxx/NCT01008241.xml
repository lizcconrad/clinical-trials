  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this cross-sectional study is to gain an understanding of the knowledge and
      attitudes regarding end of life issues and hospice care among a sample of residents of South
      Florida recruited through time and space sampling. This study is being conducted by OMS3 COM
      research fellow Heather Ruff as part of the research fellowship requirements.

      Participants will complete a paper and pencil questionnaire that measures 4 domains of
      interest (advanced care planning; end of life care; hospice care and death and dying) as well
      as demographic factors (age, marital status, education etc.). It is estimated that the survey
      will take 15 minutes to complete. Data will be collected anonymously, with no personal
      identifying information. The instructions on the questionnaire state that by completing the
      questionnaire, the participant is providing consent to participate in the study. We will use
      time and space sampling methods to recruit up to 250 participants at community venues (i.e.,
      beaches, street corners, parks, pedestrian malls, and other public venues were people
      congregate) in South Florida. At each venue, we will define a specific area; persons who
      enter the defined area will be approached, screened for eligibility (18 years of age or older
      and a resident of South Florida), and if eligible, invited to participate by trained research
      staff. Sampling intervals will be determined by traffic flow at each venue. If a person
      agrees to participate they will be given a paper and pencil copy of the survey to complete on
      the spot. Participants will be given $1.00 as a token of appreciation. Data entry and data
      analyses will be done using SPSS.
