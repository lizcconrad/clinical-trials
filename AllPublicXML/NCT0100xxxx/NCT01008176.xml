    <textblock>
      Cutting back on sleep duration has developed into a common, highly prevalent habit in the
      adult population, and may lead to a major health problem. Large epidemiological studies have
      demonstrated that short sleep duration is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). The investigators' preliminary data on the effects of experimental sleep
      reduction have shown elevation of blood pressure (BP) and inflammatory markers, such as
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C reactive protein (CRP), suggesting that both may play an important
      role in linking sleep loss and CVD risk. With this background, the investigators hypothesize
      that restoring sleep homeostasis, i. e. getting adequate amounts of sleep, is an effective
      behavioral intervention in the treatment of elevated BP.

      The investigators will test this hypothesis in subjects with BP above normal and with short
      habitual sleep duration, as verified by sleep logs and actigraphic recordings. Subjects will
      either undergo 6 weeks of mild sleep extension, in which 60 min of bedtime will be added to
      the habitual sleep duration, or subjects will maintain their habitual sleep duration for the
      following 6 weeks.

      Regarding their first specific aim, the investigators expect that sleep extension across 6
      weeks will lower BP, inflammatory (IL-6, CRP, cell adhesion molecules) and autonomic markers
      (catecholamines). In particular, the investigators expect that in subjects with mild BP
      elevation, i. e. with pre-hypertension, sleep extension leads to normalization of BP.

      This study presents a very first approach in using sleep behavior components for the
      treatment of elevated BP. Therefore, the investigators' second specific aim will characterize
      the strength of associations between changes in sleep duration, BP, and inflammation, and
      they will explore factors that are predictive for these changes. In particular, adiposity, as
      measured by percent body fat, has frequently been shown to be related to short sleep duration
      and inflammatory processes, but the role of adiposity in modulating the physiological
      consequences of changes in sleep duration has never been addressed.

      If the investigators' hypothesis is correct, sleep extension may be considered as an
      additional component in current lifestyle intervention programs in combating and preventing
      hypertension.
