    <measure>Percent Surface Microhardness (SMH) Recovery of Enamel Specimens Exposed to NaF Toothpaste (1426ppmF) and AmF Toothpaste (1400ppmF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>SMH recovery test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Difference in percent SMH recovery was calculated by comparing study NaF toothpaste (1426ppmF) with reference AmF toothpaste (1400ppmF).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent SMH Recovery of Enamel Specimens Exposed to NaF Toothpaste (1426ppmF), NaF Toothpaste (675ppmF), NaMFP/NaF Toothpaste (1400ppm F) and Placebo (0ppmF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>SMH test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Differences in percent SMH recovery due to study and reference toothpastes were calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Enamel Fluoride Uptake Potential</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Enamel fluoride uptake was determined using the microdrill enamel biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride (F) divided by the area of the enamel cores. The difference between treatments was calculated with respect to fluoride uptake by enamel.</description>

        <title>Percent Surface Microhardness (SMH) Recovery of Enamel Specimens Exposed to NaF Toothpaste (1426ppmF) and AmF Toothpaste (1400ppmF)</title>
        <description>SMH recovery test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Difference in percent SMH recovery was calculated by comparing study NaF toothpaste (1426ppmF) with reference AmF toothpaste (1400ppmF).</description>

        <population>Per protocol (PP) population: All randomized participants who received at least one dose of the study treatments and provided at least one measurement SMH.
