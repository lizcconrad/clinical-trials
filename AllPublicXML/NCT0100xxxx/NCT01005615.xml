  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether functional electrical stimulation (FES) promotes neurological and
      physical recovery in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

      The researchers will investigate the extent of functional recovery in patients with spinal
      cord injury who receive functional electrical stimulation in the upper extremities compared
      with patients who do not receive FES.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, single-blinded, in-subject controlled (A-B type) trial will be
      performed in patients with SCI receiving an upper extremities non-FES assisted exercise
      protocol compared with patients receiving upper extremities ergometry in combination with
      FES. Neurological and functional outcome measures will be obtained at baseline (time 0),
      after 1st 4 months of intervention (4 months), after 1 month washout (5 months),after 2nd 4
      months intervention (9 months), and 3 month after completing the last intervention (12
      months).

    <description>While undergoing the non-FES exercise intervention, the subjects will receive a specific, individualized exercise regimen, consisting of strengthening, stretching, splinting and any other therapeutic interventions that do not use electrical stimulation. Than a 1 month washout period,the subjects will remain seated in their primary wheelchair throughout the treatment. The subjects will exercise for 60 minutes/session, three times a week for 4 months.</description>
