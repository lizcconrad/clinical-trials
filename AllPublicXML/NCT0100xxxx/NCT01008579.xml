    <textblock>
      Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are assessments of health status or health-related
      quality of life. The EuroQol-5D (EQ5D) is an example of a generic instrument to assess
      health-related quality of life. The investigators will use the EQ5D in the Falls Prevention
      Clinic as part of routine clinical assessment at baseline, 6 months and 12 months to track
      patient care in a cohort of 300 older adults who are at high-risk of falls.

      1. Purpose: We will use the EQ5D in the Falls Prevention Clinic as part of routine clinical
           assessment at baseline, 6-months and 12-months to track patient care in a cohort of 300
           older adults who are at high-risk of falls.

        2. Objectives:

      O1: Our primary objective is to use a routinely administered patient reported outcomes
      measure, the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), in older adults at high risk of falls to determine patients
      self-reported health status over a 12-month followup period.

      O2: Our secondary objective is to develop an explanatory model and a predictive model of
      covariates that explain significant gains or losses in health related quality of life.
