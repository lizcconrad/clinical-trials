      Objectives:

      A) To gather pharmacodynamic measurements and assess blood levels of the active ingredients
      in AHIST over the dosage interval period of 12 hours.

      Hypothesis: Hysteresis curves plotting each active ingredient's blood levels over a 12-hour
      dosage interval will substantiate S5 Symptom Diary scores (IE: evidentiary therapeutic window
      data);

      B) To report subjective scores by subjects rating the efficacy of a single dose AHIST in
      relieving nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, and post-nasal drip over a
      12-hour dosage interval.

      Hypothesis: Greater than 66% of subjects will document clinically significant relief over a
      12-hour period from one dose of AHIST;

      C) Report any side effects or adverse drug reactions and rate the severity of any incidence.

      Hypothesis: Not more than one patient will have an adverse event significant enough to
      warrant withdrawal; side effects will be mild with the most frequently reported side effect
      occurring in less than 10% of patientsâ€”drowsiness.

      This Phase 1 clinical trial will be a single dose pharmacokinetics study comprised of 21
      individuals with five blood draws over a 12 hour period. Additionally, subjects will
      subjectively score symptom relief and report any side effects from the single dose of AHIST.
      Schulman Associates Institutional Review Board (Cincinnati, OH) will approve the study
      protocol and statement of informed consent. Each study participant will give written informed
      consent (See Attachment A). Safety will be assured through close observation and physical
      examination of subjects before, during and at study conclusion. This interventional study
      will be conducted during the spring allergy season of 2010.

      MAGNA plans to show that chlorpheniramine tannate is a safe and effective B.I.D. drug
      treatment regimen, &quot;indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic
      rhinitis in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Treated symptoms include nasal
      congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, itchy/watery eyes, and post nasal drip syndrome
      [reduction in tickly cough (acute or chronic), mucus in the back of the throat, sore throat,
      and hoarseness].&quot;

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and females of any ethnic group between 18 and 60 years of age.

          2. History of moderate to severe Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR) for at least two years.

          3. Subjects' symptoms resulting from the irritation of sinus, nasal and upper respiratory
             tract tissues will include the five symptoms (&quot;S5&quot;) that are the focus of this study:
             nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, and post nasal drip.

          4. Prior to study drug administration, subjects' good health will be confirmed by medical
             history, physical examination, and urine dip pregnancy test.

          5. Allergic hypersensitivity will be confirmed by an appropriate test as deemed necessary
             by the physician or well established patient medical history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy or lactation.

          2. Immunotherapy unless at stable maintenance dose.

          3. Presence of a medical condition that might interfere with treatment evaluation or
             require a change in therapy including but not limited to high blood pressure or
             urinary retention problems.

          4. Alcohol dependence.

          5. Use of any other investigational drug in the previous month.

          6. Subjects presenting with asthma requiring corticosteroid treatment.
