  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how dietary fats and oils influence the
      absorption of beneficial plant pigments (carotenoids) from vegetables. The study will examine
      changes in blood carotenoids in response to eating a salad with different fats/oils.
