      Study Objective: To demonstrate equivalent clinical and radiologic outcomes as &quot;gold
      standard&quot; (ABG) in a representative clinical model (foot and ankle fusions)

      Study Hypothesis: Augment™ Injectable is an equivalent bone grafting substitute to autologous
      bone graft in applications as shown by superiority analysis for safety and non-inferiority
      analysis for effectiveness

      Study Rationale: Evaluate a fully synthetic bone graft material to facilitate fusion in
      conditions or injuries requiring bone graft in a representative clinical fusion model and
      thus the opportunity to provide equivalent union rates as ABG without necessitating an
      additional invasive procedure to harvest the graft

      Musculoskeletal problems are pervasive throughout the population in all age groups and in
      both sexes. Half of Americans will need services for fractures at some point in their
      lifetime according to a widely published article presented at the 2003 annual meeting of the
      American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS). Many musculoskeletal problems, such as
      fractures and non-unions require bone graft to ensure adequate bone healing. One of the most
      widely used options for bone graft is autologous bone however; clinical difficulties have
      been associated with ABG (autologous bone graft). Most of these difficulties result from the
      harvest of the bone graft, including increased operative time, hospital stay and cost,
      increased blood loss, post-operative pain, risk of infection and/or fracture. The morbidity
      associated with ABG and its limited amount available to be harvested has directed surgeons to
      look for a better alternative for a chemotactic, mitogenic, and angiogenic bone graft
      substitute as an alternative for fracture augmentation to accelerate healing (St. John et al,
      2003).

      Currently, there are no generally accepted alternatives to ABG for fusion procedures of the
      foot or ankle. In order to demonstrate a product's effectiveness, it is necessary to show
      equivalence to autogenous bone graft in terms of safety and effectiveness. The purpose of
      this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Augment™ Injectable Bone Graft (Beta-TCP/
      Bovine Collagen matrix + rhPDGF-BB) in facilitating equivalent mean time to union as ABG in
      this foot and ankle fusion model. Our hypothesis is that the intraoperative application of
      Augment™ Injectable Bone Graft (Augment™ Injectable) in foot and ankle fusion procedures will
      demonstrate at least equivalent efficacy to that of the gold standard of autogenous bone
      graft while avoiding the trauma and sequelae associated with an additional surgical
      procedure.
