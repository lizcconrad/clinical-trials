        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Habitual spherical soft contact lens wearer who wears a contact lens with a
             recommended replacement schedule of 2 weeks or monthly.

          -  Wears lenses at least 5 days per week and at least 12 hours per day.

          -  Removes contact lenses daily or, if prescribed by their regular eye care practitioner,
             sleeps overnight in contact lenses no more than 6 consecutive nights.

          -  Reports 2 or fewer common lens-related symptoms with current contact lenses with a
             frequency of &quot;frequently&quot; or &quot;always&quot;.

          -  Able to achieve distance visual acuity of at least 20/40 in each eye at the dispense
             of each pair of study lenses.

          -  Has acceptable or optimal fit for each eye at the dispense of each pair of study
             lenses.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eye injury or surgery within twelve weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Pre-existing ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting.

          -  Currently enrolled in any clinical trial.

          -  Any use of medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Currently sleeping in contact lenses for more than 6 consecutive nights.

          -  Currently wearing daily disposable contact lenses and certain protocol-specified lens
             brands.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
