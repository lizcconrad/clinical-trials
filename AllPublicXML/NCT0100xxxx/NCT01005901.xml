    <measure>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the 23 hour 15 minute and 23 hour 45 minute post-dose FEV1 readings. Mixed model used baseline FEV1,baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score After 26 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) captures changes from baseline. The TDI score is based on three domains with each domain scored from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), to give an overall score of -9 to +9, a negative score indicating a deterioration from baseline. A TDI focal score of 1 is considered to be a clinically significant improvement from baseline. Mixed model used baseline TDI, baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</description>

        <description>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) captures changes from baseline. The TDI score is based on three domains with each domain scored from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), to give an overall score of -9 to +9, a negative score indicating a deterioration from baseline. A TDI focal score of 1 is considered to be a clinically significant improvement from baseline.

        <title>Quality of Life Assessment With St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score After 26 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>SGRQ is a health related quality of life questionnaire consisting of 51 items in three components: symptoms, activity, and impacts. The lowest possible value is zero and the highest 100. Higher values correspond to greater impairment in quality of life. Mixed model used baseline SGRQ, baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</description>
