  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test the effectiveness of two treatments aimed at increasing
      language and social skills in children with autism spectrum disorder. If children show
      improvement in these treatments, we hope that the availability of public services for
      minority and low income families will be increased. Minority and low income families with
      children between 22 and 33 months of age with Autism Spectrum Disorders may join.

    <description>Four days a week for 2.5 hours a day the child will participate in a classroom with peers in an attempt to increase social communication, language abilities, and other skills. Parents will also receive education sessions 1-3 times per month for 1-2 hours each. Treatment will last for 6 months.</description>

    <description>Parents are taught strategies on how to interact with their children to increase their skills. Parent training sessions are given 2 times a month at our center and once a month at home for 60-90 minutes each. Treatment will last for 6 months.</description>

    <description>The Center-Based classroom intervention focuses on providing children with an invigorating, motivating learning environment in which emerging skills and knowledge are skillfully brought to a higher level of maturity, integrated with existing abilities, and used functionally. Providing an enriched environment with toys, structured learning, and opportunities for ongoing engagement week may offer the children experiences that they would not otherwise have (Ramey &amp; Ramey, 1998). Parent training sessions will focus on strategies aimed at improving child social engagement and communication and on topics related to autism characteristics, learning styles, interventions, and resources.</description>

    <description>Parent training sessions will focus on teaching parents strategies for enhancing their child's social engagement and communication. Since parents will be using these strategies across all activities throughout the day, there is an increased likelihood of generalization. For parents of minority and underserved children, this may be the first exposure to responsive interaction strategies (Rudy &amp; Grusec, 2001).</description>

             judgment of PDD-NOS or autism by the study team

          -  Children must have an age equivalent of 8 months or greater for non-verbal ability
             based on the Mullen Visual Reception and Fine Motor scales

          -  Parents must agree to participate in the study and commit to having their child
             participate in the intervention to which they are randomized for 6 months

             home)

        Exclusion Criteria:
