  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is testing the investigational drug IMC-1121B administered to Japanese
      participants with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to standard therapy or for
      whom no standard therapy is available. The rationale for performing this trial is to
      establish the safety profile and the pharmacokinetics of IMC-1121B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single center, open-label, single-arm, Phase 1 study will enroll approximately 15 to 18
      participants. The actual size will vary depending on the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
      observed and the resultant sizes of the cohorts. Participants will receive IMC-1121B,
      administered intravenously, once every 2 or 3 weeks for 6 weeks (one cycle). After one cycle
      of treatment, participants who have an objective response or stable disease may continue to
      receive IMC-1121B at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or other withdrawal
      criteria are met. A minimum of three participants will be enrolled in each cohort. Dose
      escalation in successive cohorts will occur once all participants complete one cycle of
      therapy.

      Participants will be enrolled sequentially into each cohort.

      A completed participant will be either a participant who completes the initial 6 week
      treatment period (Cycle 1) or a participant who discontinues therapy for an IMC-1121B related
      toxicity during Cycle 1. Participants who do not complete the first 6 weeks of treatment for
      reasons other than an IMC-1121B -related toxicity will be replaced. Toxicity data for each
      cohort will be reviewed prior to dose escalation. Upon completion of all required safety
      evaluations during the initial 6 weeks, the next cohort of new participants will be treated
      at the next higher dose level using a dose escalation scheme.

    <description>Cycle 1: Upon completion of enrollment criteria confirmed at screening, the first dose of study medication should be administered within 7 days. The infusion will be planned every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks on the same day of the week of the first infusion. Dose escalation to Cohort 2 may occur in the absence of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first three participants treated in Cohort 1 during the initial 6-week dosing period (Cycle 1). The same procedure will be followed for dose escalation from Cohort 2 to Cohort 3. If 1 of 3 participants in any cohort experiences a DLT in the first 6 weeks (Cycle 1), 3 additional participants will be enrolled in that cohort. Dose escalation to the next cohort may occur if less that 2 of 6 participants experience a DLT during Cycle 1.</description>
