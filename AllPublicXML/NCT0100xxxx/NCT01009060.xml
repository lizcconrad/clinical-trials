    <measure>Change From Baseline in Composite Score of CSSB Following Dosing With GSK239512</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The CSSB is a computerized battery with following domains (score range): Verbal memory (0-75), working memory (0-28), motor speed (0-100), verbal fluency, attention and speed of information processing (0-110) and executive functions with higher score representing better performance. Two Baseline CSSB testing were conducted; the first on the day prior to commencing dosing (Day -1) and the other test pre-dose on Day 1: the average of the two tests was used as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time minus score at Baseline. For each individual task from the CSSB, the Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. A composite score was calculated by averaging all the measures, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. Higher the composite score, better is the performance. Z-score is the measure of standard deviation away from the mean score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Composite Score of Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) at Week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>MCCB measures functioning across various cognitive domains and is comprised of ten tests that assess seven cognitive domains (speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition). Its measurements are based on timed paper-and-pencil, computerized, and orally-administered tests, as well as spatial tests using geometric cubes. MCCB composite T scores are between 40 and 60 (normal range) and &lt; 40 (below normal range). Higher scores indicate better performance. The Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. If either measurement meant to be used in the mean was missing, then the Baseline value was the non-missing assessment. If both were missing, then Baseline was considered missing and the task was excluded from the analysis. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time post Baseline minus score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) at Week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>BPRS is the clinician rating of psychiatric symptoms; higher score indicates higher severity; 18-items scored 1-7; lower score is 18 and highest score is 126. The Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. If either measurement meant to be used in the mean was missing, then the Baseline value was the non-missing assessment. If both were missing, then Baseline was considered missing and the task was excluded from the analysis. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time post Baseline minus score at Baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) at Week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The SANS was a tool used to assess five symptom complexes to obtain clinical ratings of negative symptoms in par. with schizophrenia. Complexes include: affective blunting; alogia (impoverished thinking); avolition/apathy; anhedonia/asociality; and disturbance of attention. Assessment was conducted on six-point scale (0=not at all to 5=severe) for a total scoring range of 0-120. Lower scores represent better performance. The Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. If either measurement meant to be used in the mean was missing, then the Baseline value was the non-missing assessment. If both were missing, then Baseline was considered missing and the task was excluded from the analysis. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time post Baseline minus score at Baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in University of California and San Diego (UCSD) Performance Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) at Week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The UPSA is a measure of Functional Capacity and assesses skills involved in community tasks. It is composed of five subdomains- comprehension and planning, finance, communication, mobility and house management. When combined, measures functional capacity. The comprehension and planning ranges from 0 to 14, the finance ranges from 0 to 11, the communication ranges from 0 to 12, the mobility ranges from 0 to 9, and the house management ranges from 0 to 4. Then a medication management score of 0 to 37 is added. In total, the Assessment is thus scored on a 0 to 87 scale, with higher scores indicating better performance. The Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. If either was missing, then the Baseline value was the non-missing assessment. If both were missing, then Baseline was considered missing and the task was excluded from the analysis. Change from Baseline was score at a given time post Baseline minus Baseline score</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Composite Score of CSSB Following Dosing With GSK239512</title>
        <description>The CSSB is a computerized battery with following domains (score range): Verbal memory (0-75), working memory (0-28), motor speed (0-100), verbal fluency, attention and speed of information processing (0-110) and executive functions with higher score representing better performance. Two Baseline CSSB testing were conducted; the first on the day prior to commencing dosing (Day -1) and the other test pre-dose on Day 1: the average of the two tests was used as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time minus score at Baseline. For each individual task from the CSSB, the Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. A composite score was calculated by averaging all the measures, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. Higher the composite score, better is the performance. Z-score is the measure of standard deviation away from the mean score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Composite Score of Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) at Week 7</title>
        <description>MCCB measures functioning across various cognitive domains and is comprised of ten tests that assess seven cognitive domains (speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition). Its measurements are based on timed paper-and-pencil, computerized, and orally-administered tests, as well as spatial tests using geometric cubes. MCCB composite T scores are between 40 and 60 (normal range) and &lt; 40 (below normal range). Higher scores indicate better performance. The Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. If either measurement meant to be used in the mean was missing, then the Baseline value was the non-missing assessment. If both were missing, then Baseline was considered missing and the task was excluded from the analysis. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time post Baseline minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual Cognitive Domain Scores in CSSB at Week 7</title>
        <description>The CSSB is a computerized battery with following domains (score range): Verbal memory (0-75), working memory (0-28), motor speed (0-100), verbal fluency, attention and speed of information processing (0-110) and executive functions with higher score representing better performance. Two Baseline CSSB testing were conducted; the first on the day prior to commencing dosing (Day -1) and the other test pre-dose on Day 1: the average of the two tests was used as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time minus score at Baseline. For each individual task from the CSSB, the Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. A composite score was calculated by averaging all the measures, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. Higher the composite score, better is the performance. Z-score is the measure of standard deviation away from the mean score.</description>

            <description>Par. received oral GSK239512 once daily for a period of 7 weeks (4 weeks titration and 3 weeks at maintenance). Par. started at a daily dose of 10 micrograms (μg) GSK239512 and titrated up weekly through successive dose levels of 20 μg, 40 μg up to a maximum dose of 80 μg according to the titration regimen.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Individual Cognitive Domain Scores in CSSB at Week 7</title>
          <description>The CSSB is a computerized battery with following domains (score range): Verbal memory (0-75), working memory (0-28), motor speed (0-100), verbal fluency, attention and speed of information processing (0-110) and executive functions with higher score representing better performance. Two Baseline CSSB testing were conducted; the first on the day prior to commencing dosing (Day -1) and the other test pre-dose on Day 1: the average of the two tests was used as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time minus score at Baseline. For each individual task from the CSSB, the Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. A composite score was calculated by averaging all the measures, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. Higher the composite score, better is the performance. Z-score is the measure of standard deviation away from the mean score.</description>
          <population>ITT Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed. Par. recruited under protocol amendment 2 were not assessed at Weeks 1, 3, 5 or 6 and hence the number of par. at these visits are lower.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual Cognitive Domain Scores in MCCB at Week 7</title>
        <description>MCCB measures functioning across various cognitive domains and is comprised of ten tests that assess seven cognitive domains (speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition) Its measurements are based on timed paper-and-pencil, computerized, and orally-administered tests, as well as spatial tests using geometric cubes. MCCB composite T scores are between 40 and 60 (normal range) and &lt; 40 (below normal range). Higher scores indicate better performance. The Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. If either measurement meant to be used in the mean was missing, then the Baseline value was the non-missing assessment. If both were missing, then Baseline was considered missing and the task was excluded from the analysis. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time post Baseline minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) at Week 7</title>
        <description>The SANS was a tool used to assess five symptom complexes to obtain clinical ratings of negative symptoms in par. with schizophrenia. Complexes include: affective blunting; alogia (impoverished thinking); avolition/apathy; anhedonia/asociality; and disturbance of attention. Assessment was conducted on six-point scale (0=not at all to 5=severe) for a total scoring range of 0-120. Lower scores represent better performance. The Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. If either measurement meant to be used in the mean was missing, then the Baseline value was the non-missing assessment. If both were missing, then Baseline was considered missing and the task was excluded from the analysis. Change from Baseline was calculated as score at a given time post Baseline minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in University of California and San Diego (UCSD) Performance Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) at Week 7</title>
        <description>The UPSA is a measure of Functional Capacity and assesses skills involved in community tasks. It is composed of five subdomains- comprehension and planning, finance, communication, mobility and house management. When combined, measures functional capacity. The comprehension and planning ranges from 0 to 14, the finance ranges from 0 to 11, the communication ranges from 0 to 12, the mobility ranges from 0 to 9, and the house management ranges from 0 to 4. Then a medication management score of 0 to 37 is added. In total, the Assessment is thus scored on a 0 to 87 scale, with higher scores indicating better performance. The Baseline was calculated as the mean of the second screening assessment and the Day 1 pre-dose assessment. If either was missing, then the Baseline value was the non-missing assessment. If both were missing, then Baseline was considered missing and the task was excluded from the analysis.
