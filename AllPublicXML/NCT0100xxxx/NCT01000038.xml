      Purpose of the study: Falls in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are common and lead to fractures,
      acute hospitalizations and increased rate of institutionalization. Poor balance and gait
      abnormalities, commonly associated with AD, are risk factors for falls. Improving balance and
      gait abnormalities is critical to prevent falls in AD.

      Exercise interventions improve gait and balance in elderly. Walking is the most commonly
      recommended home-based exercise program for elderly by primary care providers. However, it is
      difficult to engage patients with AD in long term exercise programs. Barriers to exercise
      programs include lack of motivation, poor engagement, and external factors such as the cost
      of physical therapy (PT). Use of readily available technology might bridge this gap by
      providing high level of engagement via use of multimedia at an affordable price.

      Wii-Fit is a Nintendo gaming console used for aerobics, strength training, and balance
      activities. This device includes a balance board that senses weight, movement and balance.
      Wii-Fit is a TV based self-directed activity not limited by the constraint of a therapist's
      presence. Virtual trainers talk the user through the activity while tracking progress.
      Furthermore, visual and auditory feedback improves engagement. Some skilled nursing
      facilities have started using the Wii-Fit as an adjunct to PT, and note improvement in
      balance along with social benefits but no systematic studies are done to generalize the
      findings.

      The investigators propose an 8 week prospective randomized study with the treatment group
      receiving the exercise program delivered by Wii-Fit system and the comparison arm receiving a
      walking exercise program.
