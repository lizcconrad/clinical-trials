      The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of HIT (Hybrid Imaging Technology)
      guided biopsies for mapping tumor foci with men undergoing prostatectomy. Using a prostate
      hybrid imaging technology (HIT) which fuses a previously obtained endorectal MR image to
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image to allow identification and biopsy of tumors by MR
      imaging in real time. We hypothesis that HIT guided biopsies will accurately localize the
      foci of prostate cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer

          -  Patients must have elected to undergo radical prostatectomy using an open,
             laparoscopic or robotic approach

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and able to provide written informed
             consent.

          -  No history of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy within 6 months of surgery

          -  Primary tumor must be amenable to surgical removal for curative intent

          -  Patients must have ECOG-performance status 0 or 1 (appendix II)

          -  Patients must have no history of rectal or anal disease.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:

               -  Serum aspartate transaminase (AST; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
                  [SGOT]) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
                  [SGPT])≤2.5x local laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST and ALT ≤5x ULN
                  if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN

               -  Absolute neutrophil count(ANC)≥1,500/microL

               -  Platelets≥lOO,OOO/microL

               -  Hemoglobin≥9.0 g/dL

               -  Serum calcium≤10.2mg/dL (correct for low albumin if necessary; calcium + (normal
                  albumin - serum albumin)x 0.8)

               -  Patients must have serum creatinine&lt;2 mg/dL or serum creatinine clearance
                  (CrCl)&gt;40ml/min(CrCl= Wt(kg)x(140-age)*/72xCr. level,*female x 0.85)

        Inclusion of minorities:

          -  Members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Women and children
             are not eligible since prostate cancer is not diagnosed in these groups.
