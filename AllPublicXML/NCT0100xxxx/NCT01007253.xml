  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have hayfever or allergic rhinitis often complain about eye symptoms associated
      with their nasal symptoms. How people with hayfever develop eye symptoms is not clear. The
      purpose of this study is to better understand the generation of eye symptoms in patients with
      allergic rhinitis. We have previously shown that placing the substance that subjects are
      allergic to in their nose causes both nose and eye symptoms. This can be explain by a
      parasympathetic neurogenic reflex from the nose to the eye. Such a reflex would readily
      explain the tearing and watery eye symptoms, but does not explain the itch. In this study, we
      are going to address one possible explanation for the itch; does an axonal neurogenic reflex
      stimulate mast cells in the eye to release histamine, which then causes the itch? We will do
      this by placing an antihistamine drop in the eye and challenge the nose with allergen. We
      will also attempt to demonstrate that mast activation isn't effected by blocking the
      initiating of the reflex with a nasal steroid, as done in our previous study, and showing
      that the addition of an antihistamine does not add to the reduction of symptoms.

    <textblock>
      We performed a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover
      study in 21 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis studied out of season. Healthy patients,
      between 18 and 50 years of age, came to the Nasal Physiology Laboratory at The University of
      Chicago for screening, where they completed an allergy questionnaire and underwent skin
      puncture testing for confirmation of allergy to grass or ragweed. Female subjects were given
      pregnancy tests. Patients who were eligible then underwent a screening nasal challenge with
      either grass or ragweed allergen depending on their skin test results and history. The study
      was approved by the Institutional Review Board at The University of Chicago and all of the
      patients gave written informed consent before entry.

      After a 2-week washout period, after the screening challenge, 21 subjects who had positive
      screening challenge returned to the Nasal Physiology Laboratory where they were randomized to
      receive 1 week of one of four treatments:

        -  placebo (PL) nasal spray and PL eye drops (PL/PL),

        -  PL nasal spray and olopatadine (OLO) 0.2% ophthalmic solution (PL/OLO),

        -  fluticasone furoate (FF, also known as Veramyst) nasal spray and PL eye drops (FF/PL),
           and

        -  FF nasal spray and olopatadine (OLO) 0.2% ophthalmic solution (FF/OLO).

      Specifically, the PL eye drops used were lubricant eye drops with active ingredients of 0.3%
      glycerin and 1.0% propylene glycol and the PL nasal spray was provided by GlaxoSmithKline.
      Treatment with OLO consisted of 1 drop of 0.2% OLO in each eye daily and treatment of FF
      consisted of 2 puffs in each nostril daily, giving a total of 110 micrograms delivered in
      each nostril. After a week of each of the treatments, the subjects returned to the Nasal
      Physiology Laboratory to undergo a nasal challenge. The subjects then returned the next day
      while still receiving treatment for another nasal challenge to augment the nasal ocular
      reflex. Next, the patients had a 2-week washout period and then switched over to the next
      randomized treatment arm. This sequence was repeated until subjects completed all four arms
      of the trial.

    <measure>Total Eye Symptoms Score Difference</measure>
    <time_frame>50 minutes [duration of 3 nasal challenges and 2 washout periods]</time_frame>
    <description>After treatment, each participant was subjected to a diluent (control) challenge in one eye and was asked to rate 2 eye symptoms (watery and itchy) according to the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The participant was then exposed to 3 doses of an antigen challenge and was asked to similarly rate severity of watery and itchy eye symptoms after each dose. Diluent challenge scores were subtracted from the scores recorded after each dose. This process was repeated in the other eye. The outcome is the total of the score differences (i.e. score after each dose subtracted by diluent challenge score) summed across doses, symptoms (watery and itchy), and eyes (left and right). Thus, each participant's total score is an integer value ranging from -36 to 36.</description>

    <description>After treatment, each participant was subjected to a diluent (control) challenge in one nostril and was asked to rate nasal symptoms (congestion, rhinorrhea, and itchy nose/throat) according to the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The participant was then exposed to 3 doses of an antigen challenge and was asked to similarly rate severity of nasal symptoms after each dose. Diluent challenge scores were subtracted from the scores recorded after each dose. This process was repeated in the other nostril. The outcome is the total number of score differences (i.e. score after each dose subtracted by diluent challenge score) summed across doses, symptoms (congestion, rhinorrhea, and itchy nose/throat), and nostrils (left and right). Thus, each participant's total score is an integer value ranging from -36 to 36.</description>

    <measure>Change in Histamine Level (Across Nasal Challenges)</measure>
    <time_frame>50 minutes [duration of 3 nasal challenges and 2 washout periods]</time_frame>
    <description>Histamines are simple chemical substances produced by immune system cells when reacting to an antigen in response to foreign invaders like germs and bacteria.
Histamine in nasal lavages was measured using a histamine enzyme immunoassay kit market by SPI-BIo, Bertin Pharma (Montigny le Bretonneux, France). The limit of detection of the assay is 0.4 nM, and levels below the detection limit were arbitrarily assigned a value of 0.2 nM. Samples that yielded values above the upper detection limit of the assay were diluted and reassayed.
For each patient, histamine levels recorded after the diluent challenge were subtracted from histamine levels recorded after each of the three nasal challenges. These differences were added across challenges, yielding the total change in histamine level reported in this outcome for each patient.</description>

    <measure>Change in Tryptase Level (Across Nasal Challenges)</measure>
    <time_frame>50 minutes [duration of 3 nasal challenges and 2 washout periods]</time_frame>
    <description>Tryptase is an enzyme that is released, along with histamine and other chemicals, from mast cells when they are activated, often as part of an allergic immune response. Tryptase in nasal lavages was measured using the ImmunoCap tryptase assay, by Phadia (Uppsala, Sweden). The limit of detection of the assay is 1.0 ng/mL, and levels below this value were arbitrarily assigned a value of 0.5 ng/mL.
For each patient, tryptase levels recorded after the diluent challenge were subtracted from tryptase levels recorded after each of the three nasal challenges. These differences were added across challenges, yielding the total change in tryptase level reported in this outcome for each patient.</description>

    <measure>Total Number of Eosinophils</measure>
    <time_frame>50 minutes [duration of 3 nasal challenges and 2 washout periods]</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of eosinophils among white blood cells was determined under light microscopy at 1000x magnification, and the total number of eosinophils in each lavage was then calculated. The specimens that had no eosinophils identified on differential counting despite adequate cells on the smear were assigned a number that corresponded to the lowest number of eosinophils on a slide where the number could be counted. That number was 33 total eosinophils.</description>

        <title>Total Eye Symptoms Score Difference</title>
        <description>After treatment, each participant was subjected to a diluent (control) challenge in one eye and was asked to rate 2 eye symptoms (watery and itchy) according to the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The participant was then exposed to 3 doses of an antigen challenge and was asked to similarly rate severity of watery and itchy eye symptoms after each dose. Diluent challenge scores were subtracted from the scores recorded after each dose. This process was repeated in the other eye. The outcome is the total of the score differences (i.e. score after each dose subtracted by diluent challenge score) summed across doses, symptoms (watery and itchy), and eyes (left and right). Thus, each participant's total score is an integer value ranging from -36 to 36.</description>

        <description>After treatment, each participant was subjected to a diluent (control) challenge in one nostril and was asked to rate nasal symptoms (congestion, rhinorrhea, and itchy nose/throat) according to the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The participant was then exposed to 3 doses of an antigen challenge and was asked to similarly rate severity of nasal symptoms after each dose. Diluent challenge scores were subtracted from the scores recorded after each dose. This process was repeated in the other nostril. The outcome is the total number of score differences (i.e. score after each dose subtracted by diluent challenge score) summed across doses, symptoms (congestion, rhinorrhea, and itchy nose/throat), and nostrils (left and right). Thus, each participant's total score is an integer value ranging from -36 to 36.</description>

        <title>Change in Histamine Level (Across Nasal Challenges)</title>
        <description>Histamines are simple chemical substances produced by immune system cells when reacting to an antigen in response to foreign invaders like germs and bacteria.
Histamine in nasal lavages was measured using a histamine enzyme immunoassay kit market by SPI-BIo, Bertin Pharma (Montigny le Bretonneux, France). The limit of detection of the assay is 0.4 nM, and levels below the detection limit were arbitrarily assigned a value of 0.2 nM. Samples that yielded values above the upper detection limit of the assay were diluted and reassayed.
For each patient, histamine levels recorded after the diluent challenge were subtracted from histamine levels recorded after each of the three nasal challenges. These differences were added across challenges, yielding the total change in histamine level reported in this outcome for each patient.</description>

        <title>Total Number of Eosinophils</title>
        <description>The percentage of eosinophils among white blood cells was determined under light microscopy at 1000x magnification, and the total number of eosinophils in each lavage was then calculated. The specimens that had no eosinophils identified on differential counting despite adequate cells on the smear were assigned a number that corresponded to the lowest number of eosinophils on a slide where the number could be counted. That number was 33 total eosinophils.</description>

          <title>Total Number of Eosinophils</title>
          <description>The percentage of eosinophils among white blood cells was determined under light microscopy at 1000x magnification, and the total number of eosinophils in each lavage was then calculated. The specimens that had no eosinophils identified on differential counting despite adequate cells on the smear were assigned a number that corresponded to the lowest number of eosinophils on a slide where the number could be counted. That number was 33 total eosinophils.</description>
          <population>One subject was removed from the study due to upper respiratory tract infection, reducing the number of evaluable subjects from 21 to 20.</population>
