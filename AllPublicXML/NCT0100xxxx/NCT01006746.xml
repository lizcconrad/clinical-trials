      Describe the mutual influences between trainings realized in implantation centers,
      medico-technical knowledges, technical implementation, perception, fears and appreciation
      felt by the patients during Home Monitoring implementation.

    <textblock>
      500 patients with an indication for ICD (primary and secondary prevention) will be included
      in the registry during a period of 12 months. For the survey, patients must answer two
      questionnaires.

      The first one will assess the knowledges regarding Home-Monitoring which certainly depend on
      the time devoted to patient information during the implantation. This period of training is
      important and has a direct impact on the CardioMessenger use by the patient. Although the
      study is multicenter, the aim is not to evaluate or compare practices of each center for the
      information provided to patients. The objective is to find ways to improve this phase.

      A second questionnaire was designed to observe the perception of Home-monitoring by the
      patient and thus to understand how this new technology is apprehended. This part is important
      because we must take in consideration patient point of view and expectations to improve care
      and offer new products or services.

      A focus on patients' perception and appreciation may give a support to the elaboration of
      training and prevention strategies, the anticipation of the needs, and the improvement of the
      technology. All these improvements may eventually take part in the success of ICD treatment.
