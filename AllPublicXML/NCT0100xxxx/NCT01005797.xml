  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new investigational drug called Panobinostat
      is safe, tolerable and to obtain an initial assessment of efficacy, when given in combination
      with Sorafenib for the treatment of certain types of lung cancer, kidney cancer and soft
      tissue sarcoma.

          4. Part A (dose escalation): Histologically or cytologically documented metastatic renal
             cell carcinoma (RCC) of all histologic types, soft tissue sarcoma (STS) limited to the

             non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Parts B (RCC) and C (NSCLC) and D
             (STS)(expanded cohorts). Patients with RCC must have progressive metastatic disease
             and received at least one multi-kinase inhibitor (e.g., sorafenib/Nexavar or

             (first-line, second-line treatments).

             For patients with metastatic NSCLC, they must have received two standard therapeutic
             regimens (first-line and second-line treatments).

                  between the end of treatment and registration on to the study. When halflives are
                  not available the principle of 2 weeks for once daily medications and 3 weeks for
                  agents given less frequently will be adopted, but discussion with the principal
                  investigator is recommended.

               2. Radiation: Patients may have had prior radiation therapy that has not exceeded
                  25% of bone marrow reserve provided that they have recovered from the acute,
                  toxic effects of radiotherapy prior to registration. A minimum of 7 days must

             treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin may be allowed to participate. For
             patients on warfarin, the INR should be measured prior to initiation of
             sorafenib/LBH589 and monitored at least weekly, or as defined by the local standard of
