  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The traditional risk factors for obesity are inappropriate diet, lack of exercise and genetic
      factors. However, recent observations have involved gut microbiota profiles as having an
      additional influence. In this case, there exists the possibility to modulate this through
      diet. Research has shown that the gut microbiota of both obese humans and mouse models of
      obesity is altered towards less beneficial one compared to lean counterparts. This raises the
      possibility of modulating the gut microbiota as a novel strategy in tackling the epidemic of
      obesity and diabetes sweeping the developed world. In addition, a more direct effect of
      high-fat induced disruption of the intestinal microbiota has also been seen with a murine
      model. Elevated circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a major building block and
      antigen of Gram-negative bacteria, was shown to generate a low grade chronic inflammation,
      termed metabolic endotoxemia, which then onsets insulin resistance. High-fat diets were shown
      to disrupt the Gram-negative intestinal populations of these animals, liberating LPS. The
      effects of prebiotics on the microbiota or metabolic syndrome (combination of disorders that
      increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes) in overweight adults
      have not been investigated thus far. The investigators therefore propose to investigate the
      effect of galactooligosaccharide (GOS) on the faecal microbiota and metabolic syndrome risk
      factors in overweight adults in a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, cross-over
      trial.
