  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Six-years following participation in the Family Bereavement Program (FBP) participants in the
      program as compared to a self-study control group will have lower levels of mental health
      problems, lower one-year prevalence of mental disorder that meets diagnostic criteria, lower
      use of substances, higher levels of competence at achieving developmentally appropriate tasks
      in academic achievement and social competence, and better self-esteem. The effects of the FBP
      will be moderated by baseline levels of mental health problems and gender. Bereaved
      caregivers who participated in the program will also show lower levels of mental health
      problems as compared with controls.

      Program effects will be mediated by theoretical mediators targeted by the program.
