      The purpose of the study is to determine how safe and effective it is for people with
      insomnia to use zolpidem on a nightly basis for one year.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acknowledged drugs of choice for the pharmacological treatment of insomnia are the
      benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (BzRA). Studies show that at therapeutic doses,
      used over the short-term, the abuse liability of BzRAs is relatively low and their efficacy
      outweighs their minimal risks. However, an increasing number of patients use BzRAs nightly
      for longer periods of time than is currently indicated (i.e. 4 weeks) and, minimal data on
      the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of these drugs exist.

      This project, using both prospective and retrospective methods, will address questions about
      the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of the BzRAs. The questions being raised are: What
      are the abuse liability and efficacy of hypnotics currently being used chronically and what
      is the prospective abuse liability and efficacy of hypnotics used chronically? Zolpidem is
      the chosen standard for this project as it is the most frequently prescribed BzRA and also
      arguably the BzRA with the best short-term efficacy and safety profile. The focus of the
      first question is clinical; it is about the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of BzRAs,
      specifically zolpidem, as it is currently being prescribed and about the type of patients who
      receive this drug. The second question addresses the issue of whether a standard BzRA can be
      prescribed efficaciously and safely for the long-term to patients with primary insomnia.

        Primary insomniacs meeting DSM-IV criteria, ages 23-70 yrs. old, were recruited from public
        advisement for a double-blind placebo controlled study. Participants were in good general
        health as determined by a physical exam and laboratory tests. The Structured Clinical
        Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) and the Hamilton Depression Scale were used to exclude
        those with psychiatric disorders, drug, and alcohol dependence. To confirm the absence of
        illicit drugs, participants underwent a urine drug screen. Additionally, participants had a
        screening sleep efficiency of &lt;85% on an 8-hr nocturnal polysomnogram (NPSG) and had no
        primary sleep disorders. Pregnant or lactating females were excluded from study
        participation.
