      To investigate the biosynthesis of PGD2 during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
      (PTCA) procedure.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A) To determine whether biosynthesis of PGD2 is altered in response to vascular injury in
      humans

      B) Patients will be grouped base on their aspirin using status. Three groups of no aspirin
      but an alternative anti-platelet medicine, low dose (81 mg) aspirin, high dose 325 mg aspirin
      will be enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with existing CAD admitted for elective PTCA:

               1. Treated with any dose of aspirin daily for at least 5 days, with special interest
                  in those treated with 81 mg aspirin daily or

               2. Treated with an alternative antiplatelet therapy, such as clopidogrel, due to
                  aspirin hypersensitivity or PMDs preference or

               3. No aspirin therapy at all

          -  Patients presenting to the ER with Acute Coronary Syndrome(ACS)who will have a PTCA

          -  Patients with stable angina or positive stress tests scheduled for a cardiac
             catheterization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of unstable diabetes (hgb A1c&gt;8 or FBS&gt; 200)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP &gt; 180, DBP &gt;100)

          -  History of an acute confounding disease as judged on clinical screen that according to
             the investigator may interfere with interpretation of the study results, or compromise
             the safety of a potential subject.

          -  Patients who have taken NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors other than aspirin, for at least 10
             days prior to PTCA
