  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep vein thrombosis is a common condition seen in the Emergency Department. Standard of care
      for diagnosis of DVT includes a combination of a clinical pre-test probability rule known as
      Well's criteria, D-dimer blood testing, and Radiology department ultrasound.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Emergency Physicians can safely rule out
      deep vein thrombosis using Well's criteria and D-dimer blood testing combined with Emergency
      department bedside ultrasound.
