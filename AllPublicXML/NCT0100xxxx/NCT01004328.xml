  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of drug-induced injury is high in the ambulatory geriatric population,
      especially for elders with complex healthcare needs during high risk transitions to the
      ambulatory setting. In a previous study funded by the National Institute on Aging and the
      Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] (AG 15979), the investigators determined
      that drug-related injuries occur at a rate of more than 50 per 1000-patient years in older
      adults in the ambulatory setting and that 28% are preventable. Independent risk factors for
      adverse drug events among older adults in the ambulatory setting included advanced age,
      multiple comorbid conditions, and the use of medications requiring close monitoring. In this
      project, Using HIT to Improve Transitions of Complex Elderly Patients from SNF to Home (1 R18
      HS017817), the investigators are testing the use of an electronic medical record (EMR)-based
      transitional care intervention for complex elderly patients transitioning from subacute care
      in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) to the ambulatory setting. The growing trend for
      physicians and other healthcare providers to restrict their practices to single settings and
      not follow complex patients as they move between settings leaves older patients discharged
      from subacute care particularly vulnerable. This transition is uniquely challenging because
      of the complex healthcare needs of this population, who often require outpatient primary care
      physicians to coordinate with visiting nurses in order to manage complex medication regimens
      and fluctuating clinical status. To facilitate high-quality transitions from the subacute to
      the ambulatory setting and support interdisciplinary communication, the investigators will
      use the EMR to assure that physicians in the ambulatory setting receive key health
      information and alerts.
