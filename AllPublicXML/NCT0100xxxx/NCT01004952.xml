  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how people make decisions about sun protection.
      This study is important in helping to protect against sun exposure, since it is a main risk
      factor for melanoma. The investigators would like to understand the decisions people make
      about sun protection so that they can improve their ability to help individuals who may be at
      risk for melanoma.

    <description>This study will involve two phases. Guided by EDTM, we will first build models of decision-making about UVR protection (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, hat use, use of protective clothing)using in-home ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs (Phase I). In Phase II, we will test the validity of each composite model. This will be completed using EMA data collection with 60 different melanoma FDRs from Phase I who will report on their sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of hat, and use of UVR protective clothing and decision-making regarding these outcomes via interactive voice response (IVR) system and audio narrative diaries (using a digital voice recorder). We will examine the validity of each model and examine the influence of theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of UVR protection maintenance across time.</description>

    <description>Phase I involves in-home interviews of 25 participants to understand the factors that affect participants' decision-making about UVR protection (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, hat use, use of protective clothing). In Phase II, we plan to recruit a sample of 60 melanoma first degree relatives (FDRs) and use an electronic narrative diary to record their daily behaviors about UVR protection. They will be asked to carry a interactive voice response (IVR) system for 14 days and they should be in the continental United States.</description>

        Patients whose FDRs may be eligible for this study will be identified by a member of the
        patient's treatment team, the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial
        Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) will identify patients who are melanoma patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A first-degree biological relative (a child, sibling or parent) as per self report of
             an MSKCC follow-up surgical patient diagnosed with melanoma as per pathology report or
             clinician's judgment;

          -  English-fluent; the surveys were designed and validated in English and are not
             currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other
             languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures.
             Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the
             surveys.

          -  18 years of age or older;

          -  For Phase I only: FDRs who live within a 50 mile radius of MSKCC to make it feasible
             for Ms. Shuk to be able to arrive at each person's home for the in-home interview
             without the cost being prohibitive;

          -  For Phase I only: Can recall a period when s/he was out in the sun for at least one
             hour on a sunny day this past summer 2009.

          -  For Phase I only: Can recall a separate period when s/he was out in the sun for at
             least one hour on a sunny day this past summer 2009, but s/he was in a different
             location from the period referenced above.

          -  For Phase II only: FDRs who self-report at least 1 consecutive hour in the morning
             (dawn to 12:30pm) and 1 consecutive hour in the afternoon (12:30-5pm) of daily
             (weekend and weekday) outdoor activities on the screening questionnaire

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  First-degree relatives of melanoma patients who report never using UVR protection;

          -  Patient's who provide consent for Phase I will not be eligible for Phase II.

          -  Any first-degree relative of a melanoma patient who already has a first-degree
             relative who consented to the study;

          -  Unable to provide informed consent.
