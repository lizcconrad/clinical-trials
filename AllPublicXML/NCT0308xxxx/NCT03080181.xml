      Background: Pasireotide treatment is strictly associated with glucose metabolism impairment.
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of pasireotide on β -cell and adipose
      function in patients with Cushing's disease (CD).

      Methods: Clinical and hormonal parameters, insulin secretion, evaluated by homostasis model
      assessment (HOMA-β) and by the area under the curve (AUC2h) of C-peptide during a mixed meal
      tolerance test and insulin sensitivity, evaluated by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp,
      were evaluated in 12 patients with active CD before and after 12 months of pasireotide.

      Circulating adipokines were evaluated in patients with CD compared to a matched group of 12
      diabetic patients.
