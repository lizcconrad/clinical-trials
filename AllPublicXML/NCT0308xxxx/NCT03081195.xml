      The objective of this research study is to examine the implementation of and outcomes
      associated with an evidence-based practice (EBP), specifically Multiple Family Group (MFG)
      targeting youth disruptive behavior challenges and success, through a scale up intervention
      study in Uganda, and two pilot studies that will be conducted in Kenya and Ghana
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A longitudinal experimental mixed methods effectiveness-implementation hybrid research design
      will be employed. The study will be conducted across thirty primary schools representing both
      semi-urban and rural communities. We expect to involve 3,000 youth (in primary schools grades
      2 through 7; 7 to 11 years) and their adult caregivers (3,000) in Uganda, 300 youth and their
      caregivers (300) in Ghana, and 300 youth and their caregivers (300) in Kenya.

      Schools will be randomly assigned to 3 study conditions: 1) MFG-delivered by trained family
      peers; 2) MFG-delivered by community health workers; or, 3) Comparison: mental health and
      school support materials (books, uniforms). Data will be collected at baseline, 8 and 16
      weeks, and 6 months follow-up (10 months from baseline).

      More specifically the objectives of this study are:

      Primary objectives

        1. To examine short- and long-term outcomes associated with the MFG. Hypothesis: Children
           in the treatment groups (MFG) will improve significantly more compared to those in the
           treatment (usual care) group.

        2. To examine how systematic variations in the delivery of an evidence-based MFG program
           impacts outcomes for children with behavioral difficulties and their caregivers in each
           country context.

           Hypothesis: Children who participate in MFG with their families will display
           significantly reduced conduct difficulties and increased functioning over time compared
           to those involved in comparison condition. We expect that parent peers - compared to
           community health workers - will evidence significantly more success engaging families to
           attend MFG sessions, thus, children in the MFG-parent peer delivered condition will
           evidence the great improvement relative to the other two study conditions.

           Secondary objectives

        3. To compare the uptake and implementation of MFGs by trained existing family peers and
           community outreach health workers.

           Hypothesis: Given the level of training that community outreach health workers have
           received prior to the study as part of their regular professional training, they will
           evidence higher fidelity initially, yet with training and ongoing supervision, we expect
           these differences to decrease over time.

        4. To examine multi-level (state/government, NGOs, families, schools, communities)
           influences on the uptake, implementation, effectiveness and sustainability of EBPs that
           address serious child disruptive behavioral challenges.

    <description>The MFG is a series of weekly meetings guided by a protocol.Over the course of 16 weeks, groups are held weekly and are facilitated by trained and supervised group leaders (in this case either parent peers or community health outreach workers). Groups can consist of up to 20 families involving adult caregivers and all children over six years of age in the family. The protocols have been designed to provide opportunities during each session to directly apply content to the realities of family life, emergent cultural and values perspectives, as well as tailor messages to age of child. Redundancy for missed appointments and opportunities for reinforcement is built in. We aim for families to attend at least 8 meetings or more (out of 16 sessions in total), as findings suggests this dose is needed to reduce child conduct problems and the majority of families reach this goal.</description>

        - Inclusion criteria for caregiver/child dyads:

          -  Adult caregiver of a child in primary school, grades two through 7, ages 7 to 11 years

          -  Adult caregiver willing to consent and available for research and intervention
             activities

          -  Child between the ages 7 to 11 or in primary school (grades two through seven) who
             meet criteria for ODD or CD as measured by the Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating
             Scale.

          -  Child willing to assent.

               -  Inclusion criteria for parent peers:

          -  Caregivers of children who agree to be trained to provide support to families.

               -  Inclusion criteria for community health workers

          -  Lay paraprofessionals who work within primary care settings.

               -  Inclusion criteria for school directors

          -  Directors who oversee schools where the proposed intervention will have been tested.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Exclusion criteria for caregiver/child dyads:

          -  A significant cognitive impairment of the child or parent that interferes with
             understanding the informed consent process. Cognitive impairment will be assessed as
             part of the informed consent process via observation by the research staff. PI McKay
             will ensure that all research staff are fully trained to detect a significant
             cognitive impairment, including providing training to identify symptoms of cognitive
             disorders (e.g. confusion, difficulty recalling names and identifiable information
             when completing the demographic questionnaire, difficulty with comprehension).
             Additionally, staff will evaluate cognitive impairment through the consenting process,
             and specifically by asking caregivers and children to repeat back their understanding
             of the study, what their participation entails, and the risks and benefits within.
