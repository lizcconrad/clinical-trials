  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase 1/2a study of formulated paclitaxel in subjects with low-grade,
      noninvasive papillary carcinoma (stage Ta) of the bladder.

      Part 1 of the study will enroll 6 subjects (3 per cohort) with low-grade, stage Ta
      transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder who will receive escalating doses of
      paclitaxel formulated as TSD-001 every 2 weeks for 6 treatments until Dose Limiting Toxicity
      (or until the Maximum Deliverable Dose) is observed (Maximum Tolerated Dose established).

      Part 2 of the study will enroll an additional 10 subjects with low-grade, stage Ta
      (multifocal) TCC of the bladder who will receive weekly TSD-001 for 6 weeks at the highest
      nontoxic dose (i.e., MTD) established in part 1 of the study.

    <description>Part 1, Cohort 1: For the first 3 subjects enrolled, the initial dose will be 10 mg in Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI). TSD-001 will be retained in the bladder for 2 hours (1 hour or more will be acceptable, depending on subject's tolerability of the procedure). If Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT) does not develop, intravesical instillation 14 days later will be titrated up according to the schedule (25, 50, 75, 100, 150 mg in SWFI) until DLT (defined as any grade 3 or 4 toxicity or prolonged [greater than 14 days] grade 2 toxicity) is observed.</description>

    <description>Part 1, Cohort 1: For the next 3 subjects enrolled, the initial dose will be 150 mg in SWFI. TSD-001 will be retained in the bladder for 2 hours (1 hour or more will be acceptable, depending on subject's tolerability of the procedure). If DLT does not develop, intravesical instillation 14 days later will be titrated up according to the schedule (225, 300, 375, 450 and 600 mg in SWFI) until DLT (defined as any grade 3 or 4 toxicity or prolonged [greater than 14 days] grade 2 toxicity) is observed.
If no DLT is observed in the first 6 subjects (cohorts 1 and 2) after titration up to 600 mg, then the maximum deliverable dose (MDD), and the maximum tolerable dose (MTD), will be 600 mg, and will be the dose recommended for part 2 of the study.</description>

During part 2, up to 10 additional subjects will receive intravesical instillations of TSD 001 via urethral catheterization of the urinary bladder at the MTD established in part 1 at weekly intervals for 6 consecutive weeks. TSD-001 will be retained in the bladder for 2 hours (1 hour or more will be acceptable, depending on subject's tolerability of the procedure).</description>
