  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women having abortion procedures between 15 weeks 0 days and 23 weeks 6 days gestational age
      on the day of their procedure commonly have dilators placed in their cervix overnight before
      the abortion procedure. The dilators are put in during a pelvic exam in the clinic and after
      women go home they expand slowly overnight to open the cervix before the abortion procedure
      the next day. This can be a painful experience and health care providers often give women
      different kinds of pain medicine to help them.

      The investigators are interested in whether a medicine called gabapentin, which is a
      non-narcotic medicine, could help. Gabapentin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for prevention of seizures and for treating nerve pain and doctors are
      also using it to decrease pain for people having surgical procedures.

      The main goals of our study are to learn about:

        1. Women's pain experience with dilators in their cervix overnight before the abortion
           procedure

        2. How well gabapentin works to decrease women's pain while they have the dilators in their
           cervix

      Women who enroll in the study will get a dose of either gabapentin or placebo (a pill with no
      medicine in it) before their dilators are placed in the clinic. The medication they get
      (gabapentin or placebo) will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the women in
      the study nor the doctors giving them the medication will know which medication they receive
      so the investigators can learn about their pain without being influenced by knowing which
      medication they take. Doctors will be able to find out which medication women got if there is
      an emergency or if it changes their medical care.

      The investigators will communicate with women in real time overnight by text messaging to see
      how much pain they are having in the moment and how much pain medicine they are taking.

      The investigators hypothesize that women who receive gabapentin will have a smaller increase
      in their pain with the dilators than women who receive placebo (a pill with no medicine in
      it).

      The investigators' findings will help doctors understand women's pain experience with
      dilators better and possibly provide a new way of treating pain with gabapentin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have planned a double-blind randomized controlled trial of repeated doses
      of gabapentin compared to placebo for pain management during the time after dilator insertion
      and prior to D&amp;E the subsequent day.

        -  Participants will receive gabapentin 600 mg or placebo prior to dilator insertion

        -  Pain scores will be measured via numeric rating scale (NRS) at baseline and 5 minutes
           after last dilator insertion while the participant is in clinic

        -  Additional pain scores, side effects (specifically dizziness and sedation), and
           additional analgesic use will be obtained by text message while the patient is home at 2
           hours, 4 hours, and 8 hours after time of dilator insertion

        -  Subjects will take a second dose of study drug (either gabapentin 600 mg or placebo,
           concordant with their initial medication) at 8 hours after their first dose

        -  Final pain score, side effect, and analgesic use assessment will occur upon presentation
           to the pre-operative are for D&amp;E the subsequent day

      There will be no change in standard insertion of osmotic dilators (hygroscopic dilators only
      with Lidocaine 20mL cervical anesthesia), or provision of home analgesic medications
      (ibuprofen and acetaminophen with codeine in our practice).

      The investigators hypothesize that women who receive gabapentin will report a smaller
      increase in pain from baseline at 8 hours after dilator placement compared to women receiving
      placebo.
