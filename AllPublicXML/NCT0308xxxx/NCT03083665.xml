    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) compared to
      placebo (PBO) as adjunctive treatment in Asian subjects (&gt;=16 to 80 years of age) with
      partial seizures with or without secondary generalization despite current treatment with 1 or
      2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and to assess the safety and tolerability of BRV in
      subjects &gt;= 16 years to 80 years of age.

          -  Permitted concomitant AED(s) and VNS being stable and at optimal dosage for the
             subject from at least 4 weeks (12 weeks for phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has history or presence of status epilepticus during the year preceding Visit
             1 or during Baseline.
