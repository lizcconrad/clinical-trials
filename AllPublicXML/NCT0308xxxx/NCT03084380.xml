      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-GPC3
      scFv-41BB-CD3ζ-tEGFR chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T (CAR-T) cells in treating
      patients with GPC3-positive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the safety of intravenous administration of the anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells in
           patients with HCC or lung squamous cell carcinoma

        2. To access the safety of anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells in HCC patients through catheter injection

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells in patients with advanced HCC or lung
           squamous cell carcinoma

        2. To monitor the serum cytokine and expression level of tumor markers such as AFP, CEA and
           GPC3

        3. To assess the persistence in peripheral blood and intratumoral infiltration of anti-GPC3
           CAR-T cells
