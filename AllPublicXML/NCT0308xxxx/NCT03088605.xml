    <textblock>
      In subjects with Dry Eye Syndrome:

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety and tolerability of TOP1630
      Ophthalmic Solution to placebo.

      The secondary objectives are to compare the efficacy of TOP1630 Ophthalmic Solution to
      placebo for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.

      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of TOP1630 ophthalmic
      solution in subjects with Dry Eye Syndrome.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized double masked to either TOP1630 or placebo.

      Part 1 (time frame 12 days) comprises assessment of safety, tolerability and ocular comfort.

      Part 2 (time frame 35 days) comprises assessment of safety, tolerability and efficacy
