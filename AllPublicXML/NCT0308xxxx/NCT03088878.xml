  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase 1b/2 study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational
      drug, cirmtuzumab, when given in combination with ibrutinib in patients with B-cell lymphoid
      malignancies. Cirmtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to a protein (called ROR 1)
      that is found on hematologic tumor cells. ROR1 has been shown to play a role in cell
      signaling that cause leukemia cells to grow and survive. ROR1 is rarely found on healthy
      cells.

      This is a Phase 1b/2 study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational
      drug, cirmtuzumab, when given in combination with ibrutinib in patients with B-cell lymphoid
      malignancies. The Phase 1b will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 is a
      dose-finding evaluation of the sequential administration of cirmtuzumab monotherapy followed
      by cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib combination therapy in previously treated chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia /small lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) subjects who
      have not received prior Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy. Up to 48 subjects
      will be enrolled in Part 1 to determine the recommended dosing regimen (RDR). In Part 2, up
      to 18 subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and pharmacology of the
      cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib combination given at the RDR determined in Part 1 of the study. In
      the Phase 2 (Part 3) portion of the study, approximately 90 subjects with MCL will be
      randomized to either Arm 1 (cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib) at the RDR or Arm 2 (ibrutinib alone)
      to evaluate the clinical activity and safety of the two arms.

             protocol-recommended method of contraception from the start of the screening period
             until ≥30 days after the final dose of study therapy. Note: A female subject is
             considered to be of childbearing potential unless she has had a hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy; has medically documented ovarian
             failure (with serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels within the

             chorionic gonadotropin [βHCG]); or is menopausal (age ≥50 years with amenorrhea for ≥6
             months).

          -  For male subjects who can father a child and are having intercourse with females of
             childbearing potential who are not using adequate contraception: willingness to use a
             protocol-recommended method of contraception from the start of study therapy until ≥30
             days after the final dose of study therapy and to refrain from sperm donation from the
             start of study therapy until ≥90 days after administration of the final dose of study
             therapy. Note: A male subject is considered able to father a child unless he has had a
             bilateral vasectomy with documented aspermia or a bilateral orchiectomy.

          -  In the judgment of the investigator, participation in the protocol offers an
             acceptable benefit-to-risk ratio when considering current disease status, medical
             condition, and the potential benefits and risks of alternative treatments for the
             subject's cancer.

          -  Willingness and ability of the subject to comply with scheduled visits, drug
             administration plan, protocol-specified laboratory tests, other study procedures
             (including all bone marrow biopsy/aspirations and radiographic studies), and study
             restrictions.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is aware
             of the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed of the procedures to be
             followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential risks and
             discomforts, potential benefits, and other pertinent aspects of study participation.

             required in subjects with suspected central nervous system malignancy.

          -  For study participants in Part 3: History of another malignancy except for the
             following: adequately treated local basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin;

             study therapy, use of corticosteroids as prophylaxis for infusion reactions will be
             minimized. However, subjects may use systemic, enteric, topical or enteric
             corticosteroids as required for treatment-emergent conditions.

          -  Use of a moderate or strong inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 within 7

             interfere with a subject's ability to provide informed consent, adversely affect the
             subject's ability to cooperate and participate in the study, or compromise the
             interpretation of study results.
