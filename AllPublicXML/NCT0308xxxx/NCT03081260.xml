  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty is a frequent surgery in France. It currently represents 70,000
      interventions per year. The total knee prosthesis is also called tri-compartmental because it
      allows articulation between the femur and the tibia but also between the femur and the
      patella.

      The patella belongs to the extensor system. It articulates with the femoral trochlea in which
      it slides. It has an important biomechanical role on the quadriceps strength in addition to
      allowing flexion-extension movements.

      In the case of resurfacing, the joint face of the patella is cut off; A convex polyethylene
      implant is sealed with cement using studs on the same face.

      In case of non-resurfacing, the surgeon leaves in place the cartilage of the patella which
      will be in direct contact with the femoral prosthetic trochlea.

      Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. For some implants, it is recommended to
      resurface the patella because the implant is not very tolerant with the native patella. Other
      implants have been designed to be better adapted to the preservation of patellar cartilage.

      There is currently no evidence that one method is superior to the other on new generation
      implants known as &quot;patellar friendly&quot;.

      It seems necessary to compare both methods in terms of long-term postsurgery results.

      The analysis of the primary endpoint (International Knee Society score (IKS score)) will be
      based on the assumption that the postsurgery score will be identical in both groups. The t
      test for independent samples will be used to test this hypothesis.

    <description>The resurfacing of the patella is generally done at the end of the surgery, after having ejected the patella. A frontal bone cut is made using a dedicated ancillary to remove the entire cartilage. Orifices are then made in the patella so that the polyethylene implant can be accommodated with studs which will be cemented on the joint face of the ball joint.</description>
