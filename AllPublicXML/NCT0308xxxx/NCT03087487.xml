      The primary objectives of this study are to compare the risk of major bleeding and
      stroke/systemic embolism (SE) events among oral anticoagulant (OAC)-na√Øve non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation (NVAF) patients initiating OAC warfarin or apixaban or dabigatran or rivaroxaban
      treatment.

             claim date during the identification period will be designated as the index date

          2. Patients 18 years old or older as of the index date

          3. At least 1 diagnosis of atrial fibrillation prior to or on index date, identified by
             any medical claim

          4. At least 12 months of baseline period prior to index date with continuous enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of valvular heart disease, transient atrial fibrillation, venous
             thromboembolism during the 12-month baseline period or on the index date

          2. Evidence of pregnancy during the study period

          3. Had a pharmacy claim for warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban
             during the 12-month baseline period
