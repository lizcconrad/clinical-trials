  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease defined by multiple
      episodes of demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) separated by time and space as
      specified in adults not explained by acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Several
      studies have indicated that at least 5% of MS patients are in the pediatric population, but
      no prospective study was performed in Brazil. There are particular characteristics of
      Pediatric MS that differs from the adult population and have been focus of interest in the
      last years. However, we still lack high evidence data, specially concerning treatment, of
      this age group.

      This is an observational non-interventional multicenter study in pediatric MS patients in
      which participating subjects will be characterized by their clinical, MRI and immunological
      features. In this observational study, we will select 8 MS centers in Brazil to recruit at
      least 100 pediatric patients currently followed on each center with idiopathic inflammatory
      CNS disorders over a 2-year study period. We will collect retrospective and prospective
      clinical and MRI data to determine the proportion of patients who fulfill the International
      Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG) criteria for MS,7 especially on those below
      10 years where the use of McDonald 2010 criteria is not recommended routinely. Following the
      inclusion on the study, subjects will be followed for at least 2 years.

      All subjects enrolled in this study will have serum collected to test autoantibodies
      including anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG using cell-based assays with transfected cells.8 Pediatric
      patients with positive testing for these autoantibodies will be analyzed separately.

      Exploratory MRI sub-study In 10 patients recruited at Hospital São Lucas PUCRS, we will
      perform an exploratory substudy with advanced MRI using q-space diffusion protocol on a
      3-Tesla MRI (GE Signa HDx 3.0T, General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and a 8-channel head
      coil to visualize remyelinating brain MS lesions. Normalized leptokurtic diffusion (NLD) data
      will be acquired using diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging. All MRI scans from this
      exploratory study will be performed at the Brain Institute of Rio Grande do Sul (BraIns).
      Only patients with previous brain demyelinating lesions will be included in this exploratory
      sub-study.
