      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, multi-arm phase II trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with pembrolizumab and cetuximab for patients
      with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. There will be four patient cohorts, including a PD-1/PD-L1
      inhibitor-naïve, cetuximab-naïve arm (Cohort 1), a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory,
      cetuximab-naïve arm (Cohort 2), a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory, cetuximab-refractory arm
      (Cohort 3), and a cutaneous HNSCC arm (Cohort 4). A total of 83 patients (33 in Cohort 1, 25
      in Cohort 2, 15 in Cohort 3, and 10 in Cohort 4) will be eligible to enroll. Patients will be
      enrolled at 4 sites: UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive
      Cancer Center, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, and University of
      Washington Siteman Cancer Center.

    <intervention_name>Pembrolizumab, Cetuximab</intervention_name>
    <description>Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®; MK-3475) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2). This blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate tumor regression and ultimately immune rejection.
Cetuximab (Erbitux®) binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of EGF and other ligands, such as transforming growth factor-alpha. Cetuximab can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), with in vitro assays and in vivo animal studies demonstrating that cetuximab inhibits the growth and survival of tumor cells expressing EGFR.</description>
