  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CCTG 603 is an open-label, two-arm, randomized (1:1) clinical demonstration project to
      determine if brief Motivational Interviewing (MI-B) added to a text-message based adherence
      intervention (iTAB) improves adherence to PrEP among transgender persons.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 300 HIV-uninfected transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, defined as
      currently identifying as a gender different from sex assigned at birth, with high-risk
      transmission behavior will be enrolled into this study. Each participant will be followed for
      a maximum of 48 weeks after enrollment. The primary endpoint will be measured at 48 weeks, or
      the last week on study if the participant is discontinued early.

      All participants will start PrEP with TDF / FTC fixed dose combination taken once daily.
      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the iTAB text messaging adherence reminder intervention
      either with or without brief motivational interviewing (MI-b) for suboptimal adherence. All
      participants will receive the iTAB system to provide personalized, automated text messages to
      support and monitor adherence. In the MI-b arm, poor adheres by iTAB reporting will receive
      targeted MI-b via telephone.

      Both groups will receive PrEP in accordance with standardized comprehensive methods of
      prescribing, which includes risk reduction counseling, adherence counseling, and clinical
      assessments with safety monitoring, as well as HIV and STI screening.

    <description>Participants will receive PrEP and standard of care (SOC) including health education, clinical assessments, laboratory safety monitoring, STI and HIV screening, HIV risk reduction counseling, assessment of psychosocial barriers, and adherence counseling. In addition to SOC, participants will receive daily text messages (iTAB) as reminders for medication adherence. Text messages will be setup during the Baseline visit in coordination with the participant's preferences.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the same PrEP, SOC procedures, and iTAB support as that of the Control Arm. Participants in the Intervention Arm will also receive brief motivational interviewing counseling sessions if adherence becomes suboptimal. Adherence will be monitored by responses to the iTAB system; if Intervention Arm participants reply with 3 consecutive negative or non-responses, MI-b counselors will perform 15-minute over-the-phone motivational interviewing counseling sessions with the participant.</description>

    <description>All study participants will receive daily dosing text message reminders.
Participants randomized to the MI-b Intervention and who are persistently non-adherence based on negative or non-responses to iTAB will be sent automated high alert messages notifying the participant to take their study medication and respond to iTAB. Both the study coordinator and the MI counselor will also receive the high alert message. Participants will be contacted by the MI counselor for a phone MI-b session within 72 hours of a high alert message to discuss adherence. Participants who continue to be non-adherent despite receiving these messages will be switched to receive alert messages on a monthly schedule.</description>
