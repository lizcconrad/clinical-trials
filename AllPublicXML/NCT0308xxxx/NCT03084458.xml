  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical device technology for use by patients is gaining popularity. Modern cardiac disease
      management seeks to integrate multiple device technologies and capabilities to optimize
      health outcomes. Fitbit, Inc. manufactures a line of wireless-enabled activity, wearable
      trackers that are used in conjunction with a mobile device. The Fitbit trackers use
      three-dimensional accelerometers to sense and record movement. This technology represents a
      new frontier for patients and their health care providers to understand and track physical
      activity in real time. The primary aim of the current project is to assess whether activity
      feedback using FitBit technology affects implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patient
      activity level as measured by the ICD accelerometer. The investigators will also examine the
      perceived added value of Fitbit technology to an ICD patient user experience.

      Approximately 50 participants will be recruited. Participants in the experimental group (n =
      25) will use the Fitbit device for 12 weeks. The experimental group will receive fitness
      goals (number of steps per day) to increase activity from a baseline value to a minimum of
      7000 steps per day by week 9 of the intervention. Both groups will receive weekly texts
      messages to encourage activity. Feedback about technology satisfaction, cardiac anxiety,
      cardiac self-care, and health care utilization will be elicited from patients at multiple
      time points. Additional information will be gained about patient decision-making as
      participants may elect to continue Fitbit use beyond the study period; this will allow for
      behavioral evidence of the perceived value of adding this technology.

    <measure>Does increased access to information on daily activity level (FitBit) increase device (ICD) coded total activity (step count) over usual care?</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the final study visit, the ICD will be interrogated. Accelerometer data will be captured and used as a precise measure of physical activity, specifically, steps per day.
Analyses will be conducted to determine activity (step count) changes between groups and over time.</description>

    <measure>Does activity level feedback have a greater impact on Quality of Life (QOL) than usual care? Indices of QOL will be multiple questionnaire scores entered together in a single analysis.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires that will be used include: Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire, Duke Activity Status Index, Fitbit Technology Satisfaction, Florida Patient Acceptance Survey, Florida Shock Anxiety Scale, Patient Health Security, Self-Care of Heart Failure Index, and the Short-Form 12 Health Survey. Analyses will be conducted to determine quality of life changes between groups and over time from the baseline, month 1, and month 3 visits.</description>

    <description>Once consented, recruited ICD patients will complete the baseline psychosocial and quality of life measures. At the first and final visit, a 6-minute walk test will be administered. Participants will be sent text messages to encourage physical activity. Participants will be re-assessed with psychosocial and quality of life measures at 30 and 90 days post enrollment. At the final (90 day) visit participants ICD will be interrogated to obtain accelerometer activity data.</description>
