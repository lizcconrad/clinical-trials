  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of ths study is to know the effects of infant massage in the maturation of the baby
      with Down syndrome. Scale Psychomotor Development Early Childhood Brunet-Lézine-Revised will
      be used to measure the maturational development of the baby with Down syndrome .
      Investigators will analyze two groups of intervention, the experimental group, in which
      parents will participate and will apply the knowledge learned in the course of Infant Massage
      and control, which does not receive the Infant Massage course during the study. Babies in
      both groups will be evaluated twice, at the beginning of the intervention (pretest) and end
      it after five weeks (posttest). The study population consists of 32 babies with Down syndrome
      between 4 and 8 months old.

      In this study, the investigators will compare the maturational development of the
      experimental group Down syndrome babies (will receive infant massage in the period between
      the two measurements) with the maturational development of the control group Down syndrome
      babies (will receive infant massage after two measurements). Assess both the development
      partial motor, cognitive, language and social, and also the maturational development global.
      Finally, measure also the ratio of development, both in the pretest as on the posttest. The
      test that will use to measure the development of them babies is the scale of development
      psychomotor of her first childhood Brunet-Lezine-R. The babies of the study may hay between 4
      and 8 months old.

    <description>The first day, investigators will make the initial assessment of the baby through Psychomotor Development Scale of Early Childhood Brunet- Lézine. Participants will keep the sessions early attention and will participate in the course of Infant Massage, which develop for 5 weeks.
Infant Massage course will take place with families and is based on the methodology and program of the International Association of Infant Massage ( IAIM ), created by Vimala McClure. The course will consist of 5 sessions (one per week) approximately 90 minutes. Parents will practice everyday the movements learned during the time of the study.
When the course of Infant Massage finished, Investigators will conduct the final evaluation of the baby, the same way as in the initial evaluation.</description>
