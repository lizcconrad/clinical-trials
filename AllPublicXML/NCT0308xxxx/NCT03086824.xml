    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of subjects
      receiving MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment for painful bone metastases. This
      study will evaluate treatment response and clinically significant adverse events. Other
      relevant data may be documented as well.

      This proposed study will be performed in full compliance with all applicable privacy rules
      and regulations, and their implementations at participating site(s). All subjects planned to
      undergo the MRgFUS procedure at Taipei Medical University Hospital will be offered informed
      consent so they can be included in this Study.

          3. Patients who are suffering from symptoms of bone metastases: Patients who have
             received radiation without adequate relief from metastatic bone pain as determined by
             the patient and treating physician, those for whom their treating physician would not
             prescribe radiation or additional radiation treatments, and those patients who refuse
             additional radiation therapy.

          4. Patient with NRS (0-10 scale) pain score ≥ 4 irrespective of medication.

          5. Targeted bone/tumor interface are ExAblate device accessible and are located in ribs,
             extremities (excluding joints), pelvis, shoulders and in the posterior aspects of the
             following spinal vertebra: Lumbar vertebra (L3-L5), Sacral vertebra (S1-S5).

          6. Patient whose targeted lesion is on bone and the interface between the bone and lesion
             is deeper than 10-mm from the skin.

          7. Targeted (treated) tumor clearly visible by non-contrast MRI, and ExAblate MRgFUS
             device accessible.

          8. Patients on ongoing chemotherapy regimen at the time of eligibility: 1) with same
             chemotherapy regimen (as documented from patient medical dossier, 2) worst pain NRS
             still ≥ 4, and 3) do NOT plan to initiate a new chemotherapy for pain palliation
             should be eligible for the study. Note: Planned multiple courses of chemotherapy are
             not considered New Chemotherapy.

          9. No radiation therapy to targeted (most painful) lesion in the past two weeks.

         10. Bisphosphonate intake should remain stable throughout the study duration. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who either Need surgical stabilization of the affected bony structure or
             Targeted tumor is at an impending fracture site or Surgical stabilization of tumor
             site with metallic hardware.

          2. KPS (Karnofsky performance scale) Score &lt; 60.

          3. Unable to communicate sensations during the ExAblate treatment.

          4. Target (treated) tumor is less then 10-mm from nerve bundles, bowels or bladder.

          5. Patients with acute medical condition (e.g., pneumonia, sepsis) that is expected to
