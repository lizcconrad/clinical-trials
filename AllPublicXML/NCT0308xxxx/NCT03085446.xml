  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a chronic mental health condition characterized by difficulty initiating and
      maintaining sleep with a prevalence of over 50% in Israeli adults ages 65 and above. It is
      associated with increased risks for chronic illnesses (e.g., cardiovascular disease), poor
      mental health (e.g., anxiety and depression), functional limitations, and cognitive decline.
      Available pharmacological and behavioral treatments focusing on reducing nighttime
      hyper-arousal offer limited success, and it appears that there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot;
      treatment for late life insomnia. Mounting evidence suggests that sleep is related to
      metabolic status, however, studies on the associations between sleep and dietary patterns are
      surprisingly scarce.

      The ability of gut microbiota to communicate with the brain is emerging as an exciting
      concept in health and disease and provides the rationale for the present project. Findings
      demonstrate that gut microbiota modulates mental capacities such as brain plasticity and
      cognitive functions in older adults, as well as stress related mental illness. The
      composition of the intestinal microbiota in older people (&gt;65 years) differs from the core
      microbiota and diversity levels of younger adults. With age, gut populations of beneficial
      microbes show a marked decline. As diet has been shown to markedly promote microbiota
      biodiversity, it is hypothesized that diet-induced changes in microbiota may provide a novel
      approach for the treatment of mental health. Although insomnia is strongly linked to mental
      health (e.g., depression and anxiety), as well as cognitive and motor performance, the
      effects of diet-induced microbiota alterations, based on individual microbiota composition,
      on late life insomnia is currently unknown.

      The proposed project will be the first to investigate the associations between gut microbiota
      and sleep, and assess the potential of a six-months personalized, diet-induced microbiota
      alterations intervention (PDM), aimed to improve insomnia in older adults. We will also look
      at cognitive, motor and mental health factors as possible mediators in this relationship.
      Specifically, we will test the associations between microbiota composition and sleep quality,
      both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, i.e., following a PDM intervention; evaluate the
      impact of PDM on changes in cognitive, motor and mental health functions; and identify the
      mediating roles of changes in cognitive, motor and mental functioning on the effects of a PDM
      intervention on sleep quality. Findings are expected to improve the quality of life of older
      adults by enhancing their sleep, functional status, mental health and overall wellbeing.

    <description>Microbiota composition will be characterized from participants' stools samples collected in the homes. For each assessment, the dietitian will provide the participants with clear guidelines for stools collection,and will collect the specimens during her home visit and immediately put in buffer and store at -80ÂºC for later usage. The very low temperature is of significance to avoid variability in the stool bacterial composition and to preserve bacterial DNA in fecal samples. Samples will be shipped frozen at -20Â° to the lab where they will be stored at -80 Â°C. Total microbial DNA will be extracted using the PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio) and then submitted to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sequences will be analyzed using the QIIME and MOTHUR pipelines, and data will be integrated into the mega-database.Assessments will be repeated at 3 study waves (T0-T2)</description>
