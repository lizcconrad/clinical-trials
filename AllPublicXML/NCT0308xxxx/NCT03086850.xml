  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main objective: To assess the effect of the daily physical activity promotion with a
      pedometer during 12 months on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in patients with mild to
      moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      Study patients. Subjects 30-80 years old with diagnosis of mild-moderate OSA (AHI: 5-30 and
      predominance of obstructive events [&gt;80%)].

      Design. Randomized, parallel and open-label clinical trial, controlled with conventional
      treatment.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized (1:1) to control group [treatment and follow-up
      according to conventional clinical practice] or intervention group [in addition to
      conventional treatment and follow-up, the patients will receive a pedometer to measure the
      number of steps walked daily. Based on the cumulative step count for each day and the mean
      value since the last visit, patients will receive a task to increase their steps per day by
      the next appointment according to the next protocol (&lt;6000 steps/day: increase by 3000
      steps/day; 6000 - 10000 steps/day: reach 10000 steps/day; and &gt; 10000 steps/day: maintain or
      increase steps).

      Measurements. At , 12, 24 and 52 weeks of randomization, the following determinations will be
      made: anthropometric characteristics; clinical evaluation (smoking history, sleep symptoms,
      comorbidities, current medication); questionnaires (ESS, FOSQ, SF-12, EuroQoL and iPAZ);
      heart rate and blood pressure; analytical determinations (HbA1c, HOMA index, cholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, homocysteine, NT-proBNP and hsCRP);
      plasmatic biomarkers (8-isoprostane, IL1beta, IL6, IL8 and TNFalpha); and evaluation of daily
      physical activity using an accelerometer.
