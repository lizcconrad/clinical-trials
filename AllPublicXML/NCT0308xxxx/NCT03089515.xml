  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many &quot;Survivors&quot; in the World Trade Center (WTC) clinical program have a clinical syndrome
      characterized by chronic obstruction in small airways and persistence of lower respiratory
      symptoms despite therapy. This study will test the hypothesis that persistent symptoms in WTC
      &quot;Survivors&quot; are associated with abnormal small airways whose dysfunction is amplified during
      exercise and is associated with biologic evidence of inflammation and remodeling. The results
      from this study will have important treatment implications for our WTC population with
      potential applicability to larger populations with either inhalational lung injury and/or
      airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

    <measure>Measure of Lung Function using spirometry after inhalation of a targeted anti-muscarinic agent.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry (meaning the measuring of breath) is the most common of the pulmonary function tests (PFTs), measuring lung function, specifically the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of measure of serum marker IL-6</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Inflammation is caused by extra protein released from the site of inflammation that circulates in the bloodstream. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma viscosity (PV) blood tests are commonly used to detect this increase in protein. In this way they are used as markers of inflammation.</description>
