    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Phase I portion will
      investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of ceritinib and trametinib in ALK
      or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC. The Phase II portion will investigate the clinical efficiency of
      the combination of ceritinib and trametinib in 3 single arm cohorts: ALKi (ALK inhibitor)
      naïve patients; post-crizotinib progressed disease (PD) patients; and PD second line ALK
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV ALK rearranged
      NSCLC.

      The phase I portion is a standard 3+3 dose escalation study starting at dose level 1 and will
      be open to any patient with ALK-rearranged, or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC.

      The phase II portion will consist of 3 single arm cohorts in ALK-rearranged NSCLC:

        -  Cohort A (ALKi Naïve): 20 evaluable patients

        -  Cohort B (Post-crizotinib PD): 21 evaluable patients

        -  Cohort C (PD second line ALK TKI (e.g., alectinib, ceritinib, PF-06463922 or - AP21163):
           10 evaluable patients.

      The aim will be to enroll up to 69 patients. Patients may continue treatment for up to 24
      months from the time of study entry, and will receive 12 months of follow-up following
      completion of the drugs.

                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile. (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
                  ligation at least six weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
                  follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing
                  potential.

                  12. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while
                  taking drug and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male
                  patients for 3 months should not father a child in this period. A condom is
                  required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the
                  drug via seminal fluid.

                  13. Patient has a history of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase or
                  lipase that was due to pancreatic disease.

                  14. Patient has other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including
                  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory
                  abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk
                  associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of
                  study results.

                  16. Patient has had major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or
                  intra-pelvic) within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment or has not
                  recovered from side effects of such procedure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery
                  (VATS) and mediastinoscopy will not be counted as major surgery and patients can
                  receive study treatment ≥ 1 week after these procedures.

                  17. History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been disease-free
                  for 3 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin
                  cancer and/or subjects with indolent (early stage breast cancer or prostate
                  cancer) second malignancies are eligible after discussion with the study
                  principle investigator (PI).

                  18. History of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)

                  19. Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal (LM) disease requiring
                  corticosteroids for symptom management. Asymptomatic brain metastases or LM will
                  be allowed on study.

                  20. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or
                  Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection (subjects with laboratory evidence of cleared
                  HBV and HCV infection will be permitted).
