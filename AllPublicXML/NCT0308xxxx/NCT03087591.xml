    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of APN401 in treating patients with
      pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, or other solid tumors that have spread to other places
      in the body or have come back. APN401 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities and establish the safety of multiple infusions of small
      interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells APN401
      (APN401).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immunologic effects of multiple infusions of APN401. II. To document
      clinical response and survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive siRNA-transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells APN401 intravenously
      (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 29, and 57 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

             pulmonary function tests with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt;= 60% of
             predicted and a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt;= 55%
             (corrected for hemoglobin)

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., congestive heart failure or
             symptoms of coronary artery disease), as determined by medical history and physical
             examination; patients with a history of cardiac disease must have a normal cardiac
             stress test (treadmill, echocardiogram, or myocardial perfusion scan) within the past
             6 months of study entry

          -  Active infections or oral temperature &gt; 38.2 degrees Celsius (C) within 48 hours of

          -  Patients are excluded for any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in
