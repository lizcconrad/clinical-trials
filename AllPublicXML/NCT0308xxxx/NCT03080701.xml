  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to build on the success of the Systems of Support to Increase
      Colorectal Cancer trial (SOS, R01CA121125, Green) and focus on disparity groups who are less
      likely to be current for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We will test whether financial
      incentives increases screening uptake and decreases screening disparities. The investigators
      hypothesize that CRC screening rates will be higher in patients offered mailed fecal kits and
      financial incentives than those offered mailed fecal kits alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study staff will send invitation letters and a questionnaire to 5,000 patients aged 50-75 not
      current for CRC screening, two-thirds who are identified in the electronic data as being from
      a non-White race, ethnicity, or who have Medicaid coverage. Those returning the survey and
      remaining eligible (estimated N = 1150) will be randomized to either (1) Mailed fecal kit
      only, or mailed fecal kit plus one of 2 types of financial incentives for completing testing:
      (2) a guaranteed Monetary incentive or (3) a probabilistic Lottery incentive.

    <description>We will compare among the 3 arms (1) automated mailing; (2) Auto mailing plus $10; (3) Auto mailing plus $50 lottery for completion and the effect of each on CRC screening completion at 6 months (yes/no) within the following subgroups of each arm: 1. White and not Hispanic versus non-White or Hispanic. 2. Medicaid versus non-Medicaid (Medicare, employer-based, private) insurance. 3. History of prior versus no prior completion of CRC screening tests. 4. High school or less versus college or more education level.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The mailing process will be identical to those used in the SOS study. Mailing 1 includes an introductory letter on CRC screening and a pamphlet on CRC testing choices (colonoscopy every 10 years, FIT testing yearly, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years combined with interval FIT testing), and pros and cons of each. The letter will state that they will soon be receiving a FIT kit in the mail, and a number to call if they prefer another option. Mailing 2 includes a brief letter reaffirming the importance of screening, a FIT kit (the one used by Group Health), pictograph instructions, and a postage-paid return envelope. Mailing 3 a reminder letter, is sent to participants not completing the FIT kit after 3 weeks. The intervention for Group 1 includes no incentive.</description>

    <description>Receives the same number of mailings and materials as group 1 with the following modifications. In Mailing 1 the letter will include the intervention notification that they will receive a monetary thank you gift for completing testing (FIT colonoscopy or flex sig within 6 months). Mailing 2 and mailing 3 (reminder letters for those still not returning kits) will include the same information about the monetary thank you gift for CRC screening completion. Mailing 4 will include the money with a thank you letter for those who complete the screening</description>

    <description>Receives the same number of mailings and materials as group 1 with the following modifications. In Mailing 1 the letter will include the intervention notification that they will have a 1 in 10 chance of winning money (FIT, colonoscopy or flex sig within 6 months). Mailing 2 and mailing 3 (reminder letters for those still not returning kits) will include the same information about the 1 in 10 chance of winning the lottery for CRC screening completion. Mailing 4 will include a thank you letter with money for those who complete their screening and win the lottery. Participants who do not win the lottery will receive a thank you letter.</description>
