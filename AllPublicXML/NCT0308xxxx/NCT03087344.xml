  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that will evaluate the utility of measuring liver and spleen stiffness before
      and after a meal by a non invasive ultrasound based technologies called Fibroscan (Transient
      elastography) and acoustic radio-frequency impulse (ARFI) in diagnosing or excluding
      cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease who will be getting a liver biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal study that will evaluate the utility of change in liver
      stiffness (LSM) and spleen stiffness measurements after a test meal in patients whom the
      diagnosis cannot be reliably ruled in or ruled out based on two measurement of LSM by TE per
      standard of care. This includes patients in whom there is discordance between clinical
      impression and LSM and/or LSM are in the grey zone (LSM between 10 and 15 kPa). Liver
      biopsy/HVPG which is performed as standard of care will be used as gold standard.
