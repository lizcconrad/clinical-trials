  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extremely premature infants are at risk of developing a potentially blinding eye disease,
      called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Currently available treatment, consisting of laser
      surgery or injection of drugs into the eye balls, may prevent most but not all cases of
      permanent ROP-mediated blindness. Both types of treatment are associated with significant
      costs and side effects. An orally administered drug commonly used to treat hypertension,
      propranolol, may be effective in halting progression of ROP to severe stages, as suggested by
      preliminary data from two small studies. Propranolol has been used for decades not only in
      adult patients but also in newborn infants with heart diseases. Moreover, it has been
      licensed in 2014 for the use in newborn infants with hemangiomas in the European Union,
      Switzerland and the United States. As severe (threshold) ROP is an overall rare disease, the
      effectiveness of propranolol in combating ROP can only be assessed in a large, multicenter
      randomized controlled trial involving hospitals caring for extremely preterm infants of
      diverse origin.

    <textblock>
      Threshold Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), observed in a fraction of extremely premature
      infants, is characterized by retinal vessel proliferation that threatens vision secondary to
      retinal detachment. Currently available treatments (ablative laser surgery or intravitreal
      anti-VEGF injections) may prevent most but not all cases of permanent ROP-mediated blindness
      and are associated with significant costs and side effects. Orally administered propranolol,
      a commonly used drug to treat hypertension, may be effective in halting progression of ROP to
      severe stages, as suggested by preliminary data from two small studies. Propranolol has been
      used for decades not only in adult patients but also in newborn infants with heart diseases.
      Moreover, it has been licensed in 2014 for the use in newborn infants with hemangiomas in the
      European Union, Switzerland and the United States. This multicenter randomized
      placebo-controlled trial aims to assess whether oral propranolol given to extremely premature
      infants below 28 weeks gestational age reduces the rates of threshold ROP.
