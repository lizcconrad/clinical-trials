    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or else known as Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a rapidly
      progressive fatal neurological disease that strikes in the prime of life, and for which there
      is no treatment. The principal aim of management is to maintain quality of life and reduce
      the symptoms of the disease. This requires a multidisciplinary approach using best practice
      for symptom alleviation, including innovation approaches towards maximising quality of life.
      The purpose of this study is to use existing information drawn from partner countries into a
      system of care that is available to people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at the correct
      time, in the correct format and in a cost effective manner. This will be achieved by
      collecting details of patient and carer experiences across all stages of from diagnosis to
      end of life, including decision making in the terminal stages of the disease. A health
      economic analysis will help to identify the overall costs of disease management, provide
      models of increased efficiency that preserve and maximize quality of life, and begin to
      develop novel health economic measurement tools for terminal neurological illness. The
      completed project will provide a user-friendly best practice programme for amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis that can be modified for management of other related degenerative diseases
      of the nervous system.

      This is a prospective multi-centre observational research project that will be carried out by
      8 European partners in 9 sites: 1 in Ireland (Dublin), 1 in the Netherlands (Utrecht), 2 in
      the United Kingdom (UK) (Sheffield and London), 2 in Italy (Turin and Milan), 2 in Germany
      (Berlin and Munich), and 1 in Belgium (Leuven). In terms of data collection, the study
      consists of 3 substudies and will be organised in 6 interlinked work packages spanning
      clinical, epidemiological and health services research.

      All partners will contribute in participant recruitment and collect comparable data, which
      will be used for fulfilling the deliverables of each work package. Central co-ordination of
      research activities in the 2 UK sites will be undertaken in Sheffield. This protocol concerns
      research activities in relation to the ALS-CarE project involving the 2 UK-based
      participating sites.

      Following ethical and research governance approvals, ALS-CarE officially started on 1st April
      2014 and will run for 3 years. Participant recruitment will commence following ethical and
      research governance approval and will occur for the first 4 months at the Sheffield and
      King's College MND Care Centres. The follow-up period of each participant will take 12 months
      depending on the rate of progression of the illness. Finally, a period of 11 months at the
      end of the project will enable analysis of data, dissemination of findings and report
      writing.

      SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY

      Background:

      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or else known as Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a
      progressive neurodegenerative disease that strikes in the prime of life. There are currently
      no effective disease modifying therapies for ALS and death usually occurs within 3 years of
      symptom onset. Management is palliative and is aimed at maximising quality of life and
      minimising the burden of disease. The complexity and rapidly progressive nature of ALS
      requires a responsive multidisciplinary care system that that is built on reliable disease
      staging and evidence based symptom management.

      Aim:

      To incorporate detailed clinical information drawn from population based sources into a
      responsive care programme.

      Plan of investigation:

      A standardised staging system will be validated, and quality of life and patient experiences
      will be measured and management optimised across disease stages from diagnosis to end of
      life. Health economic analysis will identify key differences in resource utilisation and will
      be useful for pharmaco-economic analyses of new therapeutics.

      Potential impact:

      The completed project will provide a user-friendly best practice framework for ALS that can
      be modified for management of other neurodegenerative diseases.

    <description>Two potential service changes will be identified through examination of the patient journey and through the review of discordance with existing best practice guidelines. Key areas of interest are likely to be focussed around the organisation and delivery of services for gastrostomy, non-invasive ventilation, management of cognitive and behavioural impairment, and the involvement of specialised palliative care teams. The precise methods used will be determined on consideration of the types of intervention and types of data available, but are likely to include case-matching and/or more sophisticated statistical methods such as logistic regression or propensity scoring.</description>
