    <textblock>
      Rise in childhood obesity and poor eating habits and eating problems is apparent over the
      last decades. Parents are at lose what the correct way to tackle these problems may be. This
      study examined whether professional behavioral and nutritional training of first time mothers
      improves feeding relationship and infants eating habits at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From 166 first time mother-infant recruited, 128 completed the trail. Intervention group,
      mother-infant dyads got a month long weekly based training in small workshop groups about
      nutrition, feeding and parenting when infants were 4-6 months old. training was given by a
      highly experience pediatric dietitian and social worker. Thereafter, internet-based support
      continued until infants reached 12 months. The control group received customary support via
      municipal mother-child health clinics. Mealtime interactions were videotaped at home setting
      at 12 months and were evaluated using the Chatoor feeding scale by blinded (to group)
      viewers.

    <intervention_model_description>Intervention group got 4 sequential weekly training meetings, in small workshop groups setting, by a highly experience pediatric dietitian and social worker. The program covered nutritional aspects, as well as feeding and parenting topics. Training took place when infants were 4-6 months old. Thereafter, internet-based support continued until infants reached 12 months. The control group received customary support via municipal mother-child health clinics. Mealtime interactions by videotaped home setting feeding were documented at 12-13 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>the Chatoor observational scale for Mother-Infant interaction during feeding was purchased from the Chatoor Center. The Scale consists of 46 mother and infant behavior modes which are rated throughout the feeding session. Five subscale scores are derived: 1) Dyadic Reciprocity, 2) Dyadic Conflict, 3) Talk and Distraction, 4) Struggle for Control, and 5) Maternal Non-Contingency. The CFS has been demonstrated to discriminate between infants with and without feeding disorders and can be used with infants and toddlers ranging from 1 month to 3 years of age (Chatoor et al, 1997).</description>

    <description>First time mothers, when infants were ages 4-6 months old, took part in a training program in small group setting (10-12 mother-infants). the program continued for a month, with 4 weekly meetings. group coordinators were a highly experienced pediatric dietitian, and a social worker. Training topics addressed were infant healthy nutrition and growth, feeding skills, obesity and emotional feeding prevention, parenting. Thereafter, mothers were encouraged to stay in contact with the trainers, till infants reached age 12 months and data was collected using video taping of mealtime feeding interactions at home setting environment.
