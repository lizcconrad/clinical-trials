  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relative risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in first-degree relatives of
      patients with CRC or advanced adenoma. In the high-risk CCR population defined by a family
      history at the first stage of CRC or advanced adenoma before age 60, total colonoscopy is the
      recommended screening test. In France, the rate of screening colonoscopy in this population
      at high risk of CRC is insufficient, which limits the effectiveness of this targeted
      screening.

      The main reason for this low participation rate is that most patients undergoing RCC or
      advanced adenoma are unaware of the family implications of their diagnosis and therefore
      reluctant to disseminate this information to their patients Related matters. The need for a
      better perception of the personal risk of CRC in first-degree relatives of patients with CRC
      or advanced adenoma, with the expected coronary adherence to increasing screening, requires a
      good understanding of risk through Clear, adapted and comprehensible information that can be
      relayed personally by the case-index.

      The objective of this project is to develop a personalized prevention and screening program
      for the JRC in order to meet the needs of the relatives of the sick. The means of
      intervention that will be implemented respond to the need to better take into account the
      level of CRC risk in a family-based CRC screening and prevention approach adapted to a
      high-risk CRC group characterized by Family history at the first stage of CRC or advanced
      adenoma and, consequently, to improve the information of the subjects concerned by screening
      and prevention of CRC.

      The aim of the case-index education is to induce its intervention with its relatives to
      promote CCR screening. The use of the index case, as a means of providing information to
      relatives, implies an educational and psychological approach, based on evidence, but adapted
      and personalized.

    <description>In the experimental arm of the study (&quot;intervention group&quot;), a screening information and education system will be implemented. The particularities of the index cases likely to require an adaptation of the device will be collected, analyzed and taken into account (level of health literacy, socio-economic status, level of education, professional activity ...). The analysis and intervention frameworks derived from theories on health behaviors will be mobilized (theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behaviors) and applied in order to reinforce the &quot;intention&quot; of the target audience. The analysis and intervention frameworks resulting from the educational sciences will be integrated with a &quot;competence&quot; approach (Aizen, 1991, Denovel, Dufour, Prochaska, 1983, Le Boterf, 2002).</description>
