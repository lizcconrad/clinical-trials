  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to improve our ability to identify which people with
      many moles on their skin are most likely to develop skin melanoma. The investigators hope to
      identify features of moles that are associated with melanoma risk. The investigators hope to
      use this information to customize and tailor melanoma screening to the individual patient
      based on a better estimate of their individual risk.

    <description>Participants at high-risk for melanoma (that is, those having many nevi and morphologically atypical nevi) who either have a history of invasive melanoma (cases) or do not have a history of melanoma (controls) and will perform comprehensive total body imaging of their moles in order to identify phenotypic markers of melanoma risk that aid in melanoma risk stratification. In addition, we will investigate histopathologic and molecular features of moles that are associated with melanoma risk and with melanoma subtypes. The evaluations needed for this study protocol will be primarily performed during routine clinical care.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ≥ 18 years of age

          -  High-risk nevus phenotype (≥ 50 nevi (≥ 2mm in size) and ≥ 1 atypical nevus)

          -  First presented to MSKCC for cutaneous melanoma-related care within the past 12 months

          -  Cases: recent diagnosis (≤ 12 months) of unequivocal invasive cutaneous melanomas
             (AJCC Stages I-IV) confirmed by MSKCC pathology

          -  Cases: completion of surgical treatment of primary melanoma

          -  Ability to sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Controls: Histopathologically borderline melanocytic tumors for which melanoma could
             not be excluded or that were treated as possible melanomas.

          -  Known germline high-penetrance melanoma predisposition mutation (that is, CDKN2A,
             CDK4, and BAP1)

          -  Cases: history of invasive cutaneous melanoma (AJCC Stages I-IV) not confirmed by
             MSKCC pathology

          -  History of acrolentiginous type of cutaneous melanoma or history of mucosal melanoma

          -  Cases and controls: prior administration of systemic medications known to modify nevus
             phenotype, including but not limited to: MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib,
             etc.), BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, etc.), and immunotherapy
             (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, ipilimumab, etc.). Controls: history of Stage
             0-IV melanoma confirmed by MSKCC pathology

          -  History of limb amputation or other condition (e.g., tattoos, burns) per investigator
             discretion that would modify nevus phenotype

          -  Physical inability to undergo total body photography or reflectance confocal
             microscopy imaging (that is, remain relatively still for durations of 3-5 minutes)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to adhesive rings used for reflectance confocal microscopy

          -  Inability to give informed consent

          -  Have skin afflicted with anther skin condition (for example, psoriasis) that would
             affect ability to characterize nevus phenotype (per investigator discretion)

          -  Familial cutaneous melanoma history (families with at least one invasive melanoma and
             two or more other diagnoses of invasive melanoma or pancreatic cancer among first- or
             second-degree relatives on the same side of the family). We will confirm melanoma
             family history via medical record documentation, whenever possible, as recommended by
             previous studies that disproved about half of the reported family histories of
             melanoma among first-degree relatives in case-control studies.
