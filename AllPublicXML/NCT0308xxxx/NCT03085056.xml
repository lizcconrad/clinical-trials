    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of this treatment
      combination of paclitaxel and trametinib. Additionally, this study aims to to find out what
      effects the combination of paclitaxel and trametinib has on the shrinkage and growth of
      anaplastic thyroid cancer.

                  glaucoma or ocular hypertension)

               -  Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic exam that is considered a
                  high risk factor for RVO or CSR such as evidence of new optic disc cupping,
                  evidence of new visual field defects, and intraocular pressure &gt;21 mm Hg

          -  History or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:

             Virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection,
             which will be allowed) HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with trametinib.
             In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Any condition that may impair the ability to absorb oral medications/investigational
             product including: prior surgical procedures affecting absorption including, but not
             limited to major resection of stomach or small bowel; active peptic ulcer disease; and
             malabsorption syndrome

          -  Any major surgery within 21 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to taxanes
             and drugs chemically related to trametinib, or excipients or to dimethyl sulfoxide
             (DMSO)

          -  Current use of a prohibited medication. The following medications or non-drug
             therapies are prohibited:

               -  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted; however, treatment must
                  be initiated prior to the first dose of study therapy. Prophylactic use of
                  bisphosphonates in patients without bone disease is not permitted, except for the
                  treatment of osteoporosis

               -  Because the composition, PK, and metabolism of many herbal supplements are
                  unknown, the concurrent use of all herbal supplements is prohibited during the
                  study (including, but not limited to, St. John's wort, kava, ephedra [ma huang],
                  gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], yohimbe, saw palmetto, or ginseng)
