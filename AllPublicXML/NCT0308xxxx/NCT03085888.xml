      GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) to
      develop blood tests to detect cancer early. The purpose of this study is to train and
      validate an assay to detect invasive breast cancer in patients undergoing mammography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detection of early stage cancer may be possible through analysis of circulating cell-free
      nucleic acids (cfNAs) shed into the blood by tumors. GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing
      (based on broad genomic coverage and deep sequencing) of cfNAs, combined with machine
      learning, to develop blood tests to detect cancer early. The purpose of this prospective,
      multi-center, observational cohort study is to train and validate an assay for the early
      detection of breast cancer. The study will collect blood samples from participants within 28
      days of their screening mammogram. Additional blood samples will also be collected for a
      subset of participants. For participants who receive a cancer diagnosis during the study,
      tissue samples will be collected.

    <description>This is a prospectively enrolling cohort study with a pre-specified molecular analysis plan. A stratified case-cohort design will be employed to select cancer cases and non-cancer subjects who will be assayed. All cases of cancer (breast and non-breast cancer) will be selected. A random subset of the overall study cohort will also be selected.</description>
