      This is a Phase 3, Multicenter, 12-Week, double-blind and 40-Week open label Study to
      Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of X0002 Spray in relief of the signs and symptoms of
      subjects with Osteoarthritis of the Knee.

      Every subject will have a pre-screening interview by phone or other methods to find if the
      subject may meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After a Screening Period, a subject with
      the Kellgren-Lawrence Radiographic Grade 1, 2, and 3 will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio of active: placebo (ie, 2 subjects to active treatment and 1
      subject to placebo) and stratified based on the K-L grade 1, 2, or 3, bilateral or unilateral
      knee OA, gender, BMI (30≤vs.&gt;30), and age (65≤vs.&gt;65). Before the first screening visit,
      there is a pre-Screening Telephone Call or email interview, the Screening Period of at least
      14 days up to 3 weeks will consist of two visits for the assessment of eligibility including
      radiographic evaluation of the target knee joint space, all screening visits and week 2, 4,
      8, 12 visits are show in Study Flow Chart of Double-blind Period, and the open label period
      will be started from the Week 12 visit. All subjects treated with active drug or placebo
      complete the 12-week double-blind study will enter this Open-label study and will be treated
      with active drug, X0002. Subjects will be required to sign the Informed Consent before
      participation in the study.

      Each subject will enter the open label phase and receive X0002 study treatment for 40 weeks
      starting on the Week 12 visit. Qualified site personnel will contact subjects 1 week (Week
      13) after the Week 12 visit to check if there are adverse events (AEs). Subjects will return
      to the site at 22, 32, 42, and 52 weeks after the start of treatment for efficacy and safety
      assessments. The Week 12 visit will be the EOS visit of double-bind treatment period and the
      Week 52 visit will be the EOS visit of the study. On the final day of dose administration of
      Week 12 and Week 52 visits, radiographs and 3D qMRI will be performed to assess changes in
      the target knee joint space and cartilage (morphometry), sub-chondral bone, osteophyte
      volume, 3-D bone shape, bone marrow lesion (BML) size, synovitis, effusion, meniscus
      morphology, cartilage morphology and attrition.

      For subjects with bilateral knee pain, both knees will be treated, but the most symptomatic
      knee (ie, the most painful knee as measured by the WOMAC® 3.1 pain subscale score at
      Screening) will be designated as the target knee for efficacy analyses. For subjects with
      unilateral knee pain, only the symptomatic (target) knee will be treated.

      Subjects taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other analgesics may enroll
      in the trial, but will discontinue any analgesic therapy for the duration of the study,
      starting at least 14 days prior to administration of the first dose of study medication (ie,
      for an analgesic washout period before Day 1). Subjects will be allowed to take rescue
      medication (up to six 325 mg tablets [total of 1950 mg] of acetaminophen per day; provided by
      the Sponsor) for residual knee or other body pain starting at the first screening visit
      during screening and treatment periods except during the 24 hours prior to the screening
      visit 2, Baseline (Day 1), Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 22, Week 32, Week 42, and
      Week 52(EOS).

      Subjects will record the following information in a Daily Diary during the Screening Period:
      the amount of knee pain in the target knee while walking during the preceding 24 hours (using
      a 100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]), the times and number of sprays for each administration
      of study medication (starting on the first screening visit), the times when the subject
      washes his/her knees and/or takes a shower, the number of tablets of rescue medication taken
      that day and the times taken, the reason for taking the rescue medication (eg, target knee
      pain, contralateral knee pain, headache, low back pain), the use of Curél Itch Defense
      Lotion, any other concomitant medications taken that day, and any AEs occurring that day. The
      study treatment may cause dry and/or itchy skin; therefore, Curél Itch Defense Lotion
      (available at any pharmacy) can be applied to treat the affected area and recorded in the
      diary.

      The VAS version of the WOMAC will be used for the Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints.
      Efficacy endpoints will be assessed at Screening visits, Day 1, the Week 2, Week 4, Week 8,
      Week 12, Week 22, Week 32, Week 42, and Week 52(EOS) visits.

      Safety assessments will be performed at each visit and will include assessment of AEs, vital
      signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and oral temperature), clinical laboratories, physical
      examination, skin irritation, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) as indicated in the study flow
      chart.
