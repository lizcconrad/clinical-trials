      This study validate the usefulness of SIMPLICITY score to characterize the immune status of
      the kidney transplant receiver at two points along its course (the one and six months after
      transplantation), by determination in peripheral blood of various parameters related to
      cellular immunity (count subpopulations of CD3+ (cluster of differentiation 3), CD4+ (cluster
      of differentiation 4) and CD8+( cluster of differentiation 8)), humoral immunity
      (immunoglobulins count) and innate (complement).

    <textblock>
      The monitoring of various parameters related to cellular and humoral immunity (lymphocytes,
      immunoglobulins and complement) through a score (SIMPLICITY) (8) would allow the
      identification of renal transplant recipients at high risk for post-transplant infection.
      Prolonged or prolonged use of CMV (Cytomegalovirus) prophylaxis may modify this risk.

      The SIMPLICITY score (Seeking for Immune Status based on Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes,
      Immunoglobulins and Complement Activity) is a practical score based on the monitoring of
      readily available immunological parameters to assess the risk of infection after RT (Renal
      transplant). In order to perform this score, the total lymphocyte counts and peripheral blood
      lymphocyte subpopulations (PBLSs), serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA (Immunoglobulin A)
      and IgM) and serum complement levels (C3 and C4) at baseline were investigated, at one month
      and 6 months after transplantation.

      The validation of this new score would allow to have a weapon that would lead to reduce to
      the maximum the pharmacological immunosuppression and to use strict prophylactic measures in
      these patients.

      The results of the present study may provide insight into clinically and scientifically
      relevant aspects of infection in the recipient of an RT undergoing immunosuppressive therapy:

      From the point of view of assistance, if the hypothesis of the study were confirmed, the
      possibility of elaborating specific strategies of prophylaxis and early treatment
      (antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral), adjusted to the risk of the recipient to present some
      infectious event during its evolution post transplantation according to the SIMPLICITY score.

      Likewise, it could lay the foundations for the design of individualized immunosuppression
      guidelines, in which the risk of infectious complications could be evaluated jointly with
      that of graft rejection. And all this based on simple immunological parameters, of economic
      determination and accessible for most of the centers of our environment, circumstance that
      would favor its immediate application in the usual clinical practice.

      Given that the literature on this line of research is scarce, and the hypothesis we intend to
      demonstrate is novel and conceptually attractive, the results of this study will be able to
      be published in journals with a high impact index in the field of immunology and Management
      of infectious complications in the RT.
