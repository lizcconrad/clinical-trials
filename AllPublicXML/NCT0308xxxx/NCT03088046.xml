  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal evaluation of women who are suspected of having Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
      involves the measurement of basal levels of androgens and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP),
      which are generally used to establish the presence of hyperandrogenemia. In general, these
      levels are obtained during the follicular phase to maintain sampling uniformity and avoid
      spurious increases due to corpus luteum function. However, because most hyperandrogenic
      patients are oligo/amenorrheic, it is frequently necessary to administer a progestogen to
      induce withdrawal bleeding and properly time the blood sampling.

      Several medications have been described to properly induce withdrawal bleeding , with
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) being the most widely use. However, synthetic compounds as
      MPA do not replicate precisely the constellation of biologic activities of the parent hormone
      and results in a temporary, albeit clinically relevant, suppression in ovarian function and
      circulating androgen levels , in addition of several adverse side effects .

      In this study, it is hypothesized that the administration of natural progesterone vaginally,
      which will avoid hepatic first pass, may result in significantly less hormonal suppression.

      The authors test this hypothesis by prospectively determining the effect of vaginal
      micronized progesterone (OMP), administered for the induction of withdrawal bleeding, on the
      circulating androgen and 17-OHP levels in women with PCOS.
