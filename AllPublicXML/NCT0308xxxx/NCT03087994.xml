    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, open, comparative research involving an intervention
      group and two control groups.

      The aims of the study are: 1.To compare levels of depression in female adolescents with
      obesity and a control group of female adolescents with appropriate weight and height. 2. To
      investigate whether a decrease in weight due to a short range intervention program provided
      by dietician for female adolescents with obesity will lead to change in the levels of
      symptoms of depression and cognitive and executive functions in comparison to a control group
      of adolescent girls with obesity, matched in age that does not receive such an intervention
      program.

      60 Female adolescents with obesity will be recruited to the study and will be randomized to 1
      of two groups- 1. intervention group- participants in this group will attend an intervention
      program consisting of 12 meetings with dietician and will attend three study visits at the
      clinic- in the beginning of the study, after three months and at the end of the study after a
      year. 2.Control group- Participants in this group will only come to three study visits at the
      clinic. In the first two visits they will meet with a dietician and will receive nutrition
      guidance and hypo-caloric menu.

      Another 30 girls with appropriate weight will be recruited to second control group- this
      group will come to three study visits at the clinic- in the beginning of the study, after
      three months and at the end of the study after a year. In the first two visits participants
      will receive nutrition guidance by the dietician.

      In the study visits the following procedures will be performed for all study groups: Blood
      tests, completion of psychological and nutritional questionnaires, completion of computerized
      tests and measurements of height, weight, fat mass and circumference of hips.
