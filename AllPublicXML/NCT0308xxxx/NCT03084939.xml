  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, two-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine compared with that of lapatinib +
      capecitabine in Chinese participants with HER2-positive, unresectable locally advanced breast
      cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received prior trastuzumab-based
      therapy. A total of approximately 350 participants will be enrolled in China. The study will
      consist of 2 stages. Stage 1: Eligible participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to
      receive either trastuzumab emtansine or control (lapatinib + capecitabine). Stage 2: After
      Stage 1 is recruited, eligible patients will be enrolled to receive trastuzumab emtansine
      only.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 17 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (v1.1), or death from any cause during the study, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) taking as reference the smallest sum during the study including baseline or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Tumor assessments will be performed with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 29 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as percentage of participants with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) determined on the basis of investigator assessments with the use of RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target lesions; PR: &gt;/= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters; Objective Response Rate (OR) = CR + PR. Tumor assessments will be performed with CT or MRI scans.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 29 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as as the time from the date of initial confirmed PR or CR to the date of disease progression or death within the study. CR: disappearance of all target lesions; PR: &gt;/= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters. Disease progression was defined according to RECIST, v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Tumor assessments will be performed with CT or MRI scans.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 29 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 29 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <description>The patient-reported outcome of clinically significant deterioration in physical well-being, functional well-being, and breast cancer symptoms will be determined by a decrease of &gt;/= 5 points from baseline on the Performance/Functional/Breast (PFB) Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B, Version 4) questionnaire in female participants only.
