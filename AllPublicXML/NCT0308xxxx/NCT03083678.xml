  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase 2, single arm trial patients with locally advanced or metastatic,
      pathologically proven, EGFR expressing chordoma will be treated with afatinib. Two cohorts of
      patients will be included: 20 first line patients and 20 second or further line patients. The
      treatment will be given in 4 week cycles until disease progression. Median PFS according to
      RECIST 1.1 will be evaluated. The objective is to increase the median PFS ≥ 12 months in
      first-line treatment cohort and ≥ 9 months in later-line treatment cohort. Additional
      exploratory research will be performed, consisting of a pharmacokinetic study and
      translational studies on EGFR pathway activation and signalling on blood and tumor samples.
