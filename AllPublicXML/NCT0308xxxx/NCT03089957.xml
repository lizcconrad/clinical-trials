    <textblock>
      Since strategies were applied in intensive care medicine, including low tidal volume
      ventilation, fluid resuscitation, use of antibiotics, restrictive transfusion strategy and
      bundle of ventilator therapy, the incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) has
      been decreased recent years. However, the mortality of severe ARDS is still higher to 45%.
      Few medications did were indicated to be effective in working on development of ARDS.
      Different with other disease, ARDS were difficult to prevent in its later stage like a domino
      effect. The medication interventions are all used after ARDS was developed, including
      ulinastatin. The investigators hypothesized that the key point in failure of medication
      therapy is the delay timing of medication intervention. If given the preventive strategy,
      such as ulinastatin, the incidence or the severity of ARDS might be decreased. Therefore this
      is a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis of the preventive effect of
      ulinastatin in ARDS.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study.

      Ulinastatin is a urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) that inhibits various inflammatory proteases
      has been widely used in China, Japan, and Korea for the treatment of patients with
      inflammatory disorders, postoperative organs protection, shock, and pancreatitis.

      Therefore this is a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis of the preventive
      effect of ulinastatin in ARDS.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study.
