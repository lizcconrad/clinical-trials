      This trial is an investigator initiated study involving the use of the AstraZenica Aerophere
      Inhaler (Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol) to determine the effect on exercise tolerance and dynamic
      hyperinflation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have obstruction to expiratory
      airflow, marked breathlessness, high dyspnea scores, and reduced exercise tolerance relative
      to age and gender matched non-smoking controls (Casaburi, 2009; Casaburi et al., 2014;
      Puente-Maestu et al., 2016). A prominent mechanism for exercise intolerance is thought to be
      dynamic hyperinflation during exercise (an increase in the end-expiratory lung volume) that
      contributes to the sensation of breathlessness, and ultimately results in early cessation of
      exercise. A co-maladaptive mechanism of exercise limitation in COPD is related to wasted or
      excessive ventilation at all work intensities from increased dead space ventilation relative
      to total ventilation (increased VD/VT). This requirement for additional ventilation limits
      exercise capacity and contributes to dynamic hyperinflation and ventilatory limitation
      (O'Donnell et al., 2004).

      Treatment with individual bronchodilators, including short acting beta agonists (SABA), long
      acting beta agonists (LABA), short acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) and long acting
      muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) is effective in partially reversing the expiratory airflow
      obstruction at rest and during exercise resulting in reduced dynamic hyperinflation. Because
      beta-agonists and anticholinergics broncho-dilate synergistically, they are often used in
      combination products (SABA+SAMA or LABA/LAMA). The optimal sustained bronchodilation effect
      in COPD appears to be achieved by fixed dose, long acting combination medications
      (LABA/LAMA). (Bateman et al., 2014; Casaburi, 2009; Casaburi et al., 2014; Cope et al., 2013;
      Huisman et al., 2015). As dynamic hyperinflation appears to also be a limiting factor in
      exercise tolerance, and LABA/LAMA preparations improve airflow during exercise, it appears
      likely that use of a fixed-dose combination bronchodilator, BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ®
      (Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol) will increase exercise tolerance and reduce hyperinflation in
      COPD patients.

      We hypothesize that exercise tolerance in a constant work rate, high intensity
      cardiopulmonary exercise test will be increased with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ®
      (Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol), and that the increase in exercise tolerance will be mediated by
      a combination of:

        1. reduced dynamic hyperinflation, and

        2. decreased dead space ventilation (VD/VT) during exercise.

      Primary objective:

      To determine the magnitude of exercise time improvement (seconds) with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ®
      (Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol) relative to placebo during high intensity, constant work rate
      exercise in COPD patients.

      Secondary objective:

      To determine if the VD/VT can be reliably assessed during constant work rate exercise using
      transcutaneous CO2 measurement (tcpCO2) and, if so, if BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ®
      (Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol) results in a reduction in VD/VT relative to placebo at isotime
      during high intensity constant work rate exercise in COPD patients.

      Tertiary objective:

      To determine if computerized assessment of the spontaneous expiratory flow-volume loop during
      exercise can provide additional information about both dynamic hyperinflation and the effects
      of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ® (Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol) during high intensity, constant work rate
      exercise in COPD patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients must have a clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
             (COPD) and must meet the following criteria:

               1. Stable state of their disease with no exacerbation (antibiotics, oral steroids,
                  ER visit, or hospitalization for COPD) within the previous 4 weeks; and

               2. At visit 1 Spirometric Values must demonstrate a post-bronchodilator FEV1 between
                  35% and 80% of predicted normal and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;70%. [The
                  rationale for the lower limit is to exclude patients unlikely to tolerate
                  withholding of long acting bronchodilators. The rationale for the upper limit is
                  to exclude patients unlikely to be limited in their exercise tolerance by
                  hyperinflation and air trapping.]

          2. Male or female patients, between 40 and 80 years (inclusive) of age.

          3. Patients must be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of more than 10
             pack-years.

          4. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and a
             symptom-limited cardiopulmonary cycle ergometry test.

          5. Patients must be able to inhale medication in an acceptable manner from the metered
             dose inhalers used in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a significant disease other than COPD; a significant disease is defined
             as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may (i) put the patient at
             risk because of participation in the study, (ii) influence the results of the study,
             or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          2. Patients with a documented personal history of childhood asthma, a clinical
             presentation consistent with asthma, and a family history of asthma. For patients with
             allergic rhinitis, atopy, or prior allergy treatment, medical records will be obtained
             to verify that the patient does not have asthma. The final determination on the
             possibility of an overlap condition [Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome, (Postma and Rabe,
             2015)], and thus, appropriateness for entry into the study, will be the principal
             investigator's decision.

          3. Patients with any of the following conditions:

               1. A history of myocardial infarction within 1 year of screening visit.

               2. Unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.

               3. Hospitalized for heart failure within the past year.

               4. Known active tuberculosis.

               5. A malignancy for which patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or
                  chemotherapy within the past 6 months (patients with treated local skin tumors
                  are allowed).

               6. A history of life-threatening COPD exacerbation requiring intubation.

               7. A history of cystic fibrosis.

               8. Clinically significant and active bronchiectasis.

               9. A history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past year.

              10. Any contraindications for exercise testing as outlined below (see
                  contraindications to exercise).

              11. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection in the past
                  year.

          4. Patients being treated with oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e.,
             less than six weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg
             of prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day.

          5. Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than 6 hours per day and in
             the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen therapy
             during clinic visits and exercise testing.

          6. Patients who desaturate to SpO2 &lt;80% on screening incremental exercise testing.

          7. Patients who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior
             to the screening visit or patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation
             program.

          8. Patients who have a limitation of exercise performance as a result of factors other
             than fatigue or exertional dyspnea, such as arthritis in the leg, angina pectoris or
             claudication or morbid obesity.

          9. Patients with a constant power cycle ergometry endurance time less than 4 or greater
             than 8 minutes after work rate adjustment procedures (described below).

         10. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half-lives
             (whichever is greater) prior to screening visit (Visit 1).

         11. Pregnant or nursing women.

         12. Women of childbearing potential who are not using a highly effective method of birth
             control. Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless
             surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or post-menopausal
             for at least two years.

         13. Patients who are currently participating in another interventional study.

         14. Patients who are unable to comply with pulmonary medication restrictions (washout of
             any LABA/LAMA) prior to randomization.
