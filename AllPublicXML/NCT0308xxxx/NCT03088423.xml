  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this work was to describe SBRT different presentations, to study predictive
      factors for tumor responses following treatment, and to compare tumor response assessments
      according to the Response Evaluation Criteria

    <intervention_name>SBRT delivers high dose selective irradiation with millimeter precision to a small volume. The Cyberknife® is a robotic SBRT dedicated device that can deliver 100 to 200 photobeams to the target</intervention_name>
    <description>Seven to ten days before the scheduled CT, 2-4 fiducial markers were implanted percutaneously 2 to 5 cm next to the lesion under sonographic guidance following administration of local anesthesia, thus allowing real-time tracking during treatment. The total dose delivered was 45 Gy on the 80% isodose, in three fractions over 10 days. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the tumor mass that could be discerned by diagnostic imaging. An isotropic margin of 5 mm was added to account for the microscopic extension (clinical target volume, CTV) and another 3 mm margin was added to compensate for uncertainties regarding the position (previsional target volume, PTV)</description>

        -  Inclusion Criteria: the standard criteria for treating HCC patients with SBRT : an
             Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 2, inoperable tumors (e.g. the
             patient being unfit for surgery, or tumor-related contraindications), and a maximum
             tumor diameter of 6 cm. The HCC diagnosis could be histological or based on the
             radiological criteria of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
             (AASLD)
