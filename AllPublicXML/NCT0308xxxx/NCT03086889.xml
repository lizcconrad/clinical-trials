  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a single-blind, randomized controlled trial of 60 patients
      with subacute stroke. Patients will be randomly assigned into a control group and an
      intervention group. The intervention group will participate in immersion VR training for 3
      weeks. The control group will receive for traditional rehabilitation training for 3 weeks.
      Then, the patients will be reevaluated to determine changes in upper extremity function,
      cognitive function, cortical and subcortical activation patterns, and performance of
      activities of daily living after the baseline assessment.
