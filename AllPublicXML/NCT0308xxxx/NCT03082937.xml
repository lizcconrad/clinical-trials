  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to assess the mass balance recovery after a single
      dose of carbon-14 [14C]-A4250 as a capsule and to provide plasma, urine and faecal samples
      for metabolite profiling and structural identification in healthy male subjects.
