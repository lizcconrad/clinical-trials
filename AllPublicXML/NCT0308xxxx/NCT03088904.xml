      The purpose of the study is to investigate and compare the immune responses to influenza
      vaccination in monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins to determine the roles
      of genetics and environment in the response to flu vaccination.

      This is a phase IV study of 120 healthy 12-49 year old adolescents and adult volunteers who
      are given licensed seasonal influenza vaccine. There are no exclusions for gender, ethnicity
      or race. The volunteers will be enrolled into one of 3 groups:

      Group A: Up to 40 healthy monozygotic (MZ) twin volunteers, 12-49 years old, will be given
      inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (IIV4). Each volunteer will complete a total of 3
      visits: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8 and Day 28+ 7 post-immunization. All visits will
      consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring for serious adverse events (SAEs).

      Group B: Up to 40 healthy dizygotic (DZ) twin volunteers, 12-49 years old, will be given
      inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (IIV4). Each volunteer will complete a total of 3
      visits: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8 and Day 28+7 post-immunization. All visits will
      consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring for serious adverse events (SAEs).

      Group C: Up to 40 healthy monozygotic (MZ) twin volunteers, 12-49 years old, will be
      randomized within the twin pair to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent
      (IIV4) or live, attenuated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (LAIV4). Each volunteer will
      complete a total of 3 visits: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8 and Day 28+7
      post-immunization. All visits will consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring
      for serious adverse events (SAEs). This group was discontinued in 2016 due to ACIP
      recommendations against the use of LAIV but may be reopened in 2018 pending LAIV4
      availability.

      Each twin is counted as a single participant. All reporting numbers reflect the number of
      participants, not the number of twin pairs.

    <description>LAIV4 vaccine dosage is 0.2 mL. Vaccine will be administered as an intranasal spray. Each sprayer contains a single dose of FluMist® Quadrivalent; approximately one-half of the contents should be administered into each nostril. 0.1 mL (i.e., half of the dose from a single FluMist sprayer) is administered into each nostril while the recipient is in an upright position. Insert the tip of the sprayer just inside the nose and rapidly depress the plunger until the dose-divider clip stops the plunger. The dose divider clip is removed from the sprayer to administer the second half of the dose (0.1 mL) into the other nostril.</description>
