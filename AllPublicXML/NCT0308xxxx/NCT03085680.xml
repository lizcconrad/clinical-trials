  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This placebo-controlled RCT tests whether dietary supplementation with curcumin maintains or
      improves cognitive and physical function in older adults who are at high risk of functional
      decline due existing (mild) functional impairments and elevated biomarkers of inflammation
      and explore the association between functional changes and changes in biological indicators
      of active inflammation.
