  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate whether it is beneficial in terms of prolongation of
      survival to combine FOLFIRI (standard treatment) with ramucirumab compared to the standard
      treatment of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer after
      failure of one prior line of palliative chemotherapy. This trial aims to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI (investigational arm A) compared to
      paclitaxel plus ramucirumab (control arm B).
