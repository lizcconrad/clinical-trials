      The main objective of this work is to conduct a clinical study for the development and
      application of a vaccine with autologous dendritic cells submitted to electroporation with
      Wilm's tumor 1 (WT1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), as an adjuvant treatment of high-risk
      Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia, aiming to delay the progression of the
      disease or its relapse and increase overall and event-free survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals between the ages of 18 and 70

          -  High-risk myelodysplasia (AREB 1 or AREB 2 subtypes) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia

          -  Minimum interval of 30 days between the last cycle of chemotherapy (when it occurs)
             and start of immunotherapy

          -  Performance status between 0 and 3 on the WHO (World Health Organization)-ECOG
             (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) scale

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance&gt; 30 ml / min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to twice the lower limit of the normal range in the
             institution and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to twice the upper
             limit of normal

          -  Absence of blasts in peripheral blood

          -  Leukocyte count greater than 3000 cells / mm3, hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g / dl and
             platelets greater than 70,000 platelets / mm3, if possible. (If the patient does not
             meet these criteria for apheresis, the possibility of transfusion of blood components
             after leukapheresis will be proposed and the patient should sign a specific term of
             science on the possibility of transfusion)

          -  Normal cardiac evaluation

          -  Negative serologies for hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV

          -  Written informed consent form signed before entering the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Does not meet any of the requirements of the inclusion criteria

          -  Low risk myelodysplasia by IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System) or WPSS (WHO
             adapted Prognostic Scoring System) scores

          -  Individuals with a history of any previous neoplasia, except those with prolonged
             clinical remission (more than 5 years) of non-melanoma skin cancers and cervical
             cancer in situ

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Previous immunotherapy or biological therapy
