  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study represents a crucial and important stage in translating basic research to
      strategies for treating nicotine dependence. The investigation addresses an important public
      health issue by testing an intervention - informed by basic research - that may lead to a
      more effective and efficient treatment for smokers. The expected findings should provide
      initial effect size data for the addition of isradipine to an integrated
      psychosocial/behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation intervention for smokers, and
      thus provide the necessary data for a large-scale follow-up trial.

      The proposed proof-of-concept study will utilize a prospective, experimental research design.
      The investigators will recruit adult daily smokers who will be randomly assigned to either:
      (1) Cue Exposure Treatment with Isradipine (CET+ISR )or (2) CET with placebo (CET+PBO). Two
      90-minute CET sessions will be conducted to expose participants to interoceptive and
      situational cues for tobacco use and craving. In the first session, participants will receive
      a dose of ISR or PBO and begin the CET session after waiting 75 minutes. CET has three
      components: exposure to slides depicting smoking cues (visual exposure), exposure to emotions
      and imagined situations that most reliably triggered an urge to smoke (emotional/imaginal),
      and exposure to a participant's own cigarettes (in vivo). The second session will be
      conducted 24 h after the first in a medication-free state. Clinicians will record craving
      throughout the CET sessions. Participants will return one week after the second CET session
      to complete several questionnaires related to smoking and mood, provide a carbon monoxide
      sample to verify abstinence, and report craving to smoking related cues.
