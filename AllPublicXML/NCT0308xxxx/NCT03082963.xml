  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to test the feasibility of performing real-time
      electrogram morphology recurrence (EMR) mapping in patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation (AF) to locate areas of high electrogram morphology recurrence rate. The
      Investigator believe that the EMR mapping can be integrated into cardiac mapping and used to
      identify potential sites for ablation. Furthermore, this study could help demonstrate the
      efficacy of this technology's ability to terminate or slow AF.

      The Investigator will test this technology on ten subjects undergoing a second ablation
      procedure. The Investigator will map the AF utilizing the EMR to indicate locations of stable
      activity and ablate the area. The Investigator believes that the study could produce acute AF
      termination or AF cycle length slowing. In addition to testing the real-time electrogram
      morphology recurrence mapping, the study would also like to determine the acute effects of
      radiofrequency ablation of areas of high recurrence rates and determine long term freedom
      from AF following ablation of areas of high recurrence rates.
