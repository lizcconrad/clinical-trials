  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, either a single dose of
      Adrecizumab (0.5, 2.0 or 8.0 mg/kg) or placebo will be administrated to 24 healthy male
      volunteers during experimental endotoxemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a natural occurring 52 amino acid peptide which is mainly expressed
      in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. ADM plasma levels are increased in patients with
      sepsis and related with severity of disease. ADM is a key regulator of vasotonus and of
      endothelial integrity in sepsis. Adrecizumab is an antibody against the N-terminus of ADM
      which only partially inhibits the bioactivity of ADM. Several septic animal studies have
      shown that administration of Adrecizumab leads to stabilization of hemodynamics in mice and
      pigs, improved renal function, reduced catecholamine demand, improved fluid balance and
      improved survival. The administration of Adrecizumab to rodents, non-human primates and
      recently humans, has been tolerated very well.

      The experimental human endotoxemia model, in which healthy male volunteers receive a low dose
      of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Escherichia coli, is widely used to study the
      effects of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo and is considered a safe and highly
      reproducible method to activate the innate immune system. Furthermore, previous data has
      shown that experimental human endotoxemia results in increased plasma ADM levels. In this
      study, the investigators wish to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics/-dynamics of Adrecizumab under inflammatory conditions in healthy
      volunteers.
