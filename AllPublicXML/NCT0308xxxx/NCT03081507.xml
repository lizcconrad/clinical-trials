  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have reported Muslims in the US and NYC face numerous language and healthcare access
      barriers. This is a randomized randomized controlled design will be used to test the efficacy
      of a Patient Navigation (PN) intervention to increase participation in breast and/or cervical
      cancer screening among Muslim women age 40 - 75 years living in NYC. Study participants will
      be randomized to an Lay Health Workers (LHW) led small media intervention arm (SM-LHW) or a
      LHW-led patient navigation plus small media intervention arm (PN-LHW). A specific aim of the
      study is to develop, implement and evaluate the efficacy of a two-arm, randomized control
      trial designed to increase receipt of breast and/or cervical cancer screening among Muslim
      women aged 40 -75 years in New York City (NYC).

    <description>Will not receive additional follow-up from the LHW, but will be encouraged during the session to make an appointment with their provider to schedule a mammogram and Pap test, or to consult the MARHABA webpage for information on low-cost and culturally appropriate referral sources of screening. Individuals assigned to this arm who did not attend an educational seminar will be mailed a packet containing a palm card, brochure, and letter encouraging them to speak with their provider about breast and cervical cancer screening and/or going to the MARHABA webpage. LHWs will complete a follow-up survey with participants by phone or in-person at 4 months after baseline</description>

    <description>PNLHW participants will receive three planned contacts with LHWs that focus on navigation for obtaining mammogram and/or Pap testing.The initial contact will be made by phone and will focus on motivating participants to make an appointment with their primary care provider and/or obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN), as well as provide information on low-cost or free care if necessary. The second contact will discuss the process of going to the appointment and the third contact will focus on the process of obtaining and interpreting. The second and third contacts will be either made by phone or in-person, depending on participant needs.</description>
