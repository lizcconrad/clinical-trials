  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, the best results of allogeneic SCT have been obtained when the stem cell donor
      is a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling, however, this is only available for
      approximately 30 percent of patients in need for SCT. Alternative donor sources include
      matched unrelated donor utilizing the donor registry, cord blood transplant and mismatched
      donor transplant. A human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical donor is one who shares, by
      common inheritance, exactly one HLA haplotype with the recipient, and includes the biologic
      parents, biologic children and full or half siblings. There is strong body of evidence
      supporting the use of haplo-SCT in patient who lack a matched sibling or unrelated donor with
      high rates of successful engraftment, effective Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) control and
      favorable outcomes comparative to those seen using other allograft sources, including
      HLA-matched sibling SCT. Furthermore, it provides a cost-efficient donor option in a timely
      manner especially for patients who need to proceed quickly to transplant due to concern of
      disease relapse/progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open label, single-arm, single-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      feasibility of haplo-SCT as an alternative donor source for patients who lack a matched
      sibling/unrelated donor options. The choice of the chemotherapy treatment for transplantation
      will be up to the investigator. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide will serve as the backbone
      of the immunosuppression treatment to prevent GVHD.

      GVHD Prevention Treatment:

      Cyclophosphamide will be administered IV on Day 3 and Day 5 post transplant.

      Tacrolimus will be administered IV until patient can take it by mouth starting on day of
      transplant and continue approximately 100 days post-transplant.

      Mycophenolate mofetil will be administered IV until patient can take it by mouth starting on
      Day 1 post transplant until 28 days.
