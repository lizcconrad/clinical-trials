      The aim of this study is to compare ADR using HD-NBI or HD-WLE during screening and
      surveillance colonoscopies.

      Background:

      Despite recent advances in endoscopic technology adenoma miss rate still is up to 20% and
      contributes to the occurrence of interval cancers. Therefore, improved imaging modalities
      have been introduced to increase adenoma detection rate (ADR) during screening and
      surveillance colonoscopies. Recently, narrow band imaging (NBI; Exera II series, Olympus
      Corporation) was not significantly better than high definition white light colonoscopy (WLC)
      for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas1. However,
      Olympus' current Exera III series is characterized by better illumination of the bowel lumen
      and may be associated with a higher ADR than high definition WLC.

      Methods:

      Investigators performed a prospective evaluation in patients referred to the Department of
      Interdisciplinary Endoscopy at Jena University Hospital for screening or surveillance
      colonoscopy between January and November 2015 in daily clinical practice. Colonoscopy was
      performed by use of HD-WLC or HD-NBI upon withdrawal of the colonoscope (Exera III series,
      Olympus Corporation).
