  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapeutic pancreatic cyst
      ablation using ethanol lavage followed by the infusion of a single agent chemotherapeutic
      agent (paclitaxel) compared with alcohol free, saline lavage followed by infusion of a
      multi-agent chemotherapeutic cocktail (paclitaxel + gemcitabine) for the ablation of
      pancreatic cystic neoplasms using endoscopic ultrasound fine needle infusion (EUS-FNI) for
      agent delivery. The ultimate purpose os a safe and more effective EUS-FNI , method to
      eliminate there pre cancerous cyst and prevent a significant percentage of pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cystic lesions are increasingly encountered and typically discovered incidentally
      on cross-sectional imaging, occurring in approximately 2% of all American adults with a 37%
      prevalence in individuals over 80. Most of theses cyst are mucinous ( neoplastic) in origin
      and represent precursor lesions for pancreatic adenocarcinoma

      Discovering a pancreatic cyst typically presents a treatment dilemma, with options including
      either indefinite radiographic surveillance with MR (magnetic resonance ) or CT imaging or
      surgical resection, both of which have significant limitations. Surveillance carries
      significant economic and possible psychological burdens while waiting for signs of malignancy
      to develop, as well as radiation exposure with computed tomography. On the other hand,
      surgical resection possesses a significant risk of serious adverse events (20%-40%) and
      mortality (1-2%). This clinical dilemma delineates the pressing need to develop effective,
      but more minimally invasive, approaches for the elimination of these premalignant pancreatic
      cysts, and among these, endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle infusion (EUS-FNI) has
      emerged as an innovative and promising approach. Between November 2011 and December 30 2015,
      investigators from interventional endoscopy, surgical oncology, hematology oncology and
      pathology of the Penn State Hershey Medical Center conducted the CHARM clinical trial. This
      was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-center study with an N of 46 patients
      required for 80% power to prove non-inferiority. Final results from CHARM I : Patients
      treated included 23 females and 16 males with the majority of lesions located in the body and
      head of the pancreas. Both the alcohol and alcohol-free groups recorded 47% rates of complete
      ablation at six months which increased to 64% for both groups at the 1 year completion. With
      one patient with complication in alcohol arm (6%) and no complication in free alcohol arm.

      The overall objectives of CHARM II are to verify the significant findings of CHARM I in a
      multi-center trial as requested by national investigators in this field. We hypothesize that
      cyst infusion with a chemotherapeutic cocktail following normal saline lavage will result in
      cyst ablation rates that do not significantly differ from those achieved by a single
      chemotherapeutic infusion following ethanol lavage. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the
      removal of alcohol will decrease adverse event rates associated with pancreatic cyst
      ablation. In order to retest and confirm this hypothesis, we propose a multi-center,
      prospective, randomized double-blind, controlled study to evaluate pancreatic cyst resolution
      rates with or without ethanol lavage. This is an investigator-initiated, prospective,
      randomized, double-blinded, multi-center study evaluating ethanol lavage and chemotherapy for
      the ablation of mucinous and indeterminate pancreatic cysts with malignant potential.
      Patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio:

      Control Group: Cysts will be lavaged for 3 minutes with 98% EtOH (ethanol) and then infused
      with an admixture of 3mg/ml paclitaxel and 19mg/ml gemcitabinel.

      Study Group: Cysts will be lavaged for 3 minutes with normal saline and then infused with an
      admixture of 3mg/ml paclitaxel and 19mg/ml gemcitabine.

      At 3 months post ablation, the patient will undergo a follow-up EUS examination in the same
      manner as the initial EUS exam. During this exam, a complete pancreaticobiliary evaluation
      will be conducted and the diameter of the previously treated cystic tumor measured in the x
      and y dimensions to assess 3 month response. Any cyst still &gt;15mm and amendable to repeat
      ablation will undergo a second EUS-guided chemoablation treatment using the same lavage and
      ablation agent that the patient was randomized to initially. At 12 months after the initial
      ablation, the patient will be seen in the GI clinic and undergo either MRI-MRCP (magnetic
      resonance cholangiopancreatography) or enhanced CT scan for a full pancreaticobiliary
      evaluation and to assess the end-point treatment response.
