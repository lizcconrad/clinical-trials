  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess whether renal impairment could affect fevipiprant
      pharmacokinetics (PK) to the extent that dosage adjustment is appropriate for this patient
      population.

      The study also aims to determine the effect of dialysis on the fevipiprant pharmacokinetic
      profile as the procedure might remove a significant fraction of the drug.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the pharmacokinetic profile of fevipiprant is
      different in patients with renal impariment compared to healthy matched volunteers to an
      extent that would require an adjustment of the dosage. Data from this study will be used to
      guide enrollment criteria in future clinical trials and to support regulatory submission and
      labeling information
