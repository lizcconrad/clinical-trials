  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spreading of transcatheter aortic valve implantation has paradoxically increased the
      spectrum of indications for balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty is
      currently used as destination therapy for patients excluded from transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation, as bridge to transcatheter aortic valve implantation or to surgical aortic
      valve replacement, or as a stratification tool for selected high-risk patients who cannot be
      immediate candidates for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Moreover, it has been
      recently showed that transcatheter aortic valve implantation without balloon aortic
      valvuloplasty is encumbered by an increased risk of cerebral embolization. However, balloon
      aortic valvuloplasty has a complication rate comparable to transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation, mainly related to access site or temporary pacemaker implantation. Thus, a
      transradial mini-invasive approach with rapid pacing through the 0,035 inch left ventricular
      support wire could be extremely appealing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis with indication to aortic balloon
      valvuloplasty will be enrolled. An ad hoc informed consent for the procedure will be obtained
      from all patients.

      This is a prospective observational study. The Investigators will include patients where
      aortic ballloon valvuloplasty is attempted by radial access and without temporary pacemaker
      implantation. The aim is to register and monitor the effectiveness and safety of this
      approach. Details regarding management of radial access and pacing with 0.035 wire can be
      found in the references reported below. The primary endpoint will be the 30-day occurence of
      minor and major vascular complications according VARC 2 classification. The safety endpoint
      will be the absence of intra- or periprocedural major complications in transradial balloon
      aortic valvuloplasty, namely balloon entrapment or compartment syndrome requiring surgical
      intervention.

      The feasibility endpoint will be a procedural success rate â‰¥90%. The efficacy endpoint will
      be a reduction of the mean invasive gradient &gt;30%. At baseline, Handgrip strength test will
      be performed and angiography of the instrumented arm will be performed at the beginning and
      at the end of the procedure. All patients will be prospectively followed-up for at least 30
      days and all adverse events will be recorded. All patients will be assessed also for frailty
      according the clinical frailty scale (CFS). During the 30-day follow-up visit two independent
      blinded operators will evaluate radial artery patency by ultrasonography and perform handgrip
      strength test in in both arms in all patients.
