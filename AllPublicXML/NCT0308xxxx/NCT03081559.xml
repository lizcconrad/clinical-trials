  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are
      disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to
      engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others
      to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART
      adherence, lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines, and report fewer
      positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result,
      TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco;
      in Los Angeles, TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk
      group. In formative work, the investigators have identified culturally-specific and
      modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH, including prioritization of
      transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment,
      avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences, misinformation
      about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones, intensified HIV stigma, low
      levels of social support, and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health
      consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk
      factors, including substance abuse, high numbers of sex partners, engagement in sex work, and
      high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges
      to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment, and that the public health consequences for
      poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these
      barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related
      disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable
      and marginalized population. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial
      of a theory-driven, population-specific, piloted intervention to improve engagement in care
      for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care
      Empowerment, the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex
      barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. The investigators have developed and
      piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated
      risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV.
