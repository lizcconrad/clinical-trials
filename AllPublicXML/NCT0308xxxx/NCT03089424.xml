  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a non-pharmacological method commonly used in treatment
      of musculoskeletal disorders. However, there are few high-quality scientific evidence to
      support the effectiveness of this therapy in the treatment of patients with chronic low back
      pain, at short, medium and long term. The present research project aims to evaluate the
      effects of PBMT in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with voluntary patients with
      chronic non-specific low back pain.One hundred and forty-eight patients will be randomly
      allocated to two treatment groups: Placebo or PBMT for 4 weeks (3 times per week, total of 12
      sessions of 27 minutes each). The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of
      treatment (4 weeks) and at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomization. The data will be collected
      by a blinded assessor. The statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principles
      and the between-group differences will be calculated by using mixed linear models.

      The outcomes of interest are pain intensity, disability, function and global perceived
      effect.

    <masking_description>The mode of intervention (active or placebo photobiomodulation) will be coded by an independent researcher. The randomization schedule will contain only codes (not the actual intervention). The output from the laser device is exactly the same from either the active or the placebo interventions. These features will guarantee that participants, therapists and outcomes assessor will be blinded to the treatment arms.</masking_description>

Nine sites will be irradiated at patient's lumbar region: 3 central sites, using the SE25 (without any dose, 0 J); and 6 sites in the same direction, but laterally (both sides, 3 at a side), using the LS50 (without any dose, 0 J). Patients will be treated during 12 sessions over a period of four weeks (three sessions/week). At each treatment session, patients will receive a total dose of 0 J. At the end of the 12 treatment sessions, patients will receive a total dose of 0 J.</description>

Patients will be treated during 12 sessions over a period of four weeks (three sessions/week). At each treatment session, patients will receive a total dose of 220.05 J.
