  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a
      combined therapeutic yoga and resistance exercise intervention for individuals with lung
      cancer and their caregivers. The investigators aim is to help reduce the fear of exercise by
      tailoring the program to meet the specific needs of the survivor with lung cancer. The
      investigators want to see whether individuals with lung cancer and their caregivers are
      interested in participating in this type of program, and if they are able to attend the
      intervention sessions and complete the program. The investigators also plan to study the
      preliminary effects of therapeutic yoga and resistance exercise on fitness outcomes for both
      individuals with lung cancer and their caregivers.

    <textblock>
      To determine the feasibility of a combined therapeutic yoga and resistance exercise
      intervention for lung cancer survivors and their caregivers. A single group before and after
      intervention study design will be used for this pilot feasibility trial. Brochures and
      information about the study will be distributed at the Cross Cancer Institute, and interested
      individuals will be screened for eligibility. A convenient sampling technique will be used to
      recruit individuals with lung cancer and their caregiver. Participants deemed eligible to
      take part in the study will provide written informed consent to participate in the study and
      will undergo baseline testing. The intervention will be carried out over a period of 8 weeks.
      The feasibility outcomes will include eligibility rate, completion rate, adherence rate and
      adverse events. Dyspnea will be the primary self-reported outcome to be measured for
      individuals with lung cancer. The secondary outcomes will include fatigue, shoulder range of
      motion, chest expansion, and muscular strength. The outcome measures for the caregivers will
      include quality of life (QoL) and muscular strength.

    <description>The individuals with lung cancer and their caregivers will participate in a combined intervention of yoga and resistance exercise for 8-week, two times/week. The dyad will attend a one-hour resistance exercise intervention at the start of the week and a one-hour yoga class with a break of one day between both interventions. The resistance exercise training will involve one-on-one personal exercise session, while the yoga intervention will be offered in a class setting. The participants will be allowed to make up for any missed resistance exercise session based on the available time. Pamphlets will be given demonstrating breathing exercises, meditation, postures, and core resistance exercises to facilitate programming.</description>
