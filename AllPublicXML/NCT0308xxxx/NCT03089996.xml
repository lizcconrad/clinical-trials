  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the techniques of piezocision and alveolar corticotomies in
      accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. It will consist of a split-mouth study in patients
      who require the extraction of the first premolars to correct malocclusion. The canine will be
      retracted using these surgical techniques, as well as without any intervention, being this
      the control side. In addition, will be evaluated the inflammatory biomarkers present in the
      gingival crevicular sulcus during the dental movement, as well as data related to pain and
      discomfort.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the expression of the inflammatory biomarkers present in the gingival crevicular sulcus of the canines to be retracted. At T0, immediately before retraction, and 15 in 15 days.</description>

    <description>The first maxillary premolars will be extracted with orthodontic purpose. After 3 months of extraction, the orthodontic alignment and dental leveling will be obtained and a 0.016x0.022 stainless steel wire will be placed, as well as orthodontic mini-implants (Morelli®, Sorocaba, SP, Brazil). The retraction of the canines will begin using closed nickel-titanium spring (120g). The piezocision surgery will be performed only in one side of the mouth. Three vertical piezo-incisions will be performed near the edentulous region and mesially to the canine root, in the vestibular alveolar cortical bone with the Ultrasonic instrument (BS1 insert Piezotome ™, Satelec Group Acteon Merignac, France) in depth of 3 mm. The intraoral digital scans will be performed with 7 and 14 days after the start of retraction, and then 14 in 14 days to a maximum period of 6 months. The patients will be advised to take analgesics (paracetamol or dipyrone) only if necessary.</description>

    <description>The first maxillary premolars will be extracted with orthodontic purpose. Fixed orthodontic appliance will be bonded (0.022x0.025 slot with MBT prescription in incisors and Standart in the other teeth) with a power arm welded in the bracks upper canines brackets. After 3 months of extraction, the alignment and dental leveling will be obtained and a 0.016x0.022 stainless steel wire will be placed, as well as orthodontic mini-implants (Morelli®, Sorocaba, SP, Brazil) between the roots of the second premolars and molars. At that time an intra-oral digital scan will be performed. The retraction of the canines will begin using closed nickel-titanium spring (120g of force) from the power arm to the mini-implant. No surgery will be done at this side. The intraoral digital scans will be performed with 7 and 14 days after the start of retraction, and then 14 in 14 days to a maximum period of 6 months.</description>
