    <textblock>
      The study will determine whether community-based caring contact via a mobile app connection
      with or without volunteer support in addition to treatment as usual (psychiatric and
      psychosocial treatments) has an effect on suicidal ideation and treatment compliance among
      post-discharge self-harm young adults.

      The proposed study will determine whether community-based caring contact via a mobile app
      connection with or without volunteer support in addition to treatment as usual (TAU;
      psychiatric and psychosocial treatments) is effective in reducing suicidal ideation,
      enhancing treatment compliance, reducing thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness
      and hopelessness among post-discharge self-harm young adults, and if personalized contact by
      volunteers has additional effects reducing suicidal ideation among post-discharge self-harm
      individuals.

      108 participants aged 18-39 with an index self-harm episode will be recruited from the
      Accident &amp; Emergency Department (AED) of 4 local public hospitals, and randomized into the
      TAU, mobile app group with, and without volunteer support. Each participant will complete a
      questionnaire at the 4 measurement time points at baseline, during the 6-month observation (3
      and 6 months) and at post-intervention (9 months from baseline). The primary outcomes include
      Suicidal ideation, hopelessness, thwarted belongingness &amp; perceived burdensomeness, treatment
      (TAU) compliance, and suicidality.
