      A Randomized, Open Label Phase 3 Study of Irinotecan Liposome Injection (ONIVYDE速) versus
      Topotecan in Patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Progressed on or after
      Platinum-based First-Line Therapy

      The study will be conducted in two parts:

        1. Dose determination of irinotecan liposome injection

        2. A randomized, efficacy study of irinotecan liposome injection versus topotecan

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be conducted in two parts:

      Part 1: Open-label dose finding study of irinotecan liposome injection. Approximately 24-36
      patients will be enrolled.

      Part 1 Primary Objectives:

        -  Describe the safety and tolerability of irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy
           administered every 2 weeks

        -  Determine the irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy dose (85 mg/m2 or 70 mg/m2
           administered every 2 weeks) for Part 2 of this study

      Part 2: A randomized, efficacy study of irinotecan liposome injection versus IV topotecan.

      Approximately 450 patients will be enrolled in part 2.

      Part 2 objectives: Detailed in the Primary &amp; Secondary outcome measure sections.
