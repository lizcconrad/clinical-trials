  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the bioavailability of a generic product of metoprolol
      with that of a reference product when administered to healthy volunteers under fasting
      conditions. The test product is BF-Metoprolol Tablets 100mg manufactured by Bright Future
      Pharmaceuticals Factory O/B Bright Future Pharmaceutical Laboratories Limited and the
      reference product is Betaloc Tablet 100mg. The plasma kinetic data of metoprolol obtained
      from two formulations will be used to access the interchangeability of the products.

      The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence cross over with a
      washout period of one to two weeks. Subject will be randomly assigned to two groups
      corresponding to two dosing sequences. Each subject will undergo two study (treatment)
      sessions, during which a single oral dose of 100mg metoprolol from either test or reference
      formulations will be administered. The estimated duration of subject's participation will be
      about 29-36 days (i.e. 3 weeks for screening and medication restraint, 1 day each for study
      (treatment) sessions I and II, 1 - 2 weeks as washout period. Venous blood samples will be
      collected at pre-dose (0h), and up to 24h post dose. The plasma concentrations of metoprolol
      will be determined by a validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze
      the plasma concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as
      Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. ANOVA will be calculated on logarithmically
      transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. The two one sided tests will be used to calculate
      the 90% confidence intervals for the mean difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax and to
      assess the bioequivalence of the two products
