      The risk of emergence of a post natal depression is based on an interaction between a
      maternal psychic vulnerability and a chronic environmental context of stress. The PND appears
      as a relevant model for studying the mechanisms of chronic stress and vulnerability to
      psychological pathologies.

      The prevalence of postnatal depression is high in civilian settings (20%). In mechanistic
      terms, the risk of emergence of a post natal depression is based on an interaction between a
      maternal psychic vulnerability and a chronic environmental context of stress. The post natal
      depression appears as a relevant model for studying the mechanisms of chronic stress and
      vulnerability to psychological pathologies.

        -  On the one hand, the repetition of stressors during pregnancy corresponds to a natural
           chronic stress model of several months and thus allows to study the biological cost of
           responses to repeated stresses, and the adaptive mechanisms leading to From functional
           drift to psychic dysfunction.

        -  On the other hand, isolated vulnerability factors characterize a mirroring psychological
           profile of a Mindfulness type of functioning. Mindfulness or full consciousness has been
           described as a state of consciousness which results from intentionally, at the present
           moment, without judging the experience that unfolds moment by moment. This psychological
           resource has been associated with resilient or even resilient psychic functioning.

      This study aim to follow a cohort of pregnant women from the first trimester of pregnancies
      to 2 months after the delivery to determine the predictive psychobiological factors of the
      emergence of postnatal depression
