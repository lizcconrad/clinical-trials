  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is still a major public health problem. Active transportation i.e.
      walking or cycling for transport can contribute to greater total physical activity. The
      specific aim of this study is to evaluate if a 12-week mobile phone application can increase
      time spent in active transportation (cycling or walking) and in moderate-to-vigorous physical
      activity in Swedish adults aged 20-65 years.
