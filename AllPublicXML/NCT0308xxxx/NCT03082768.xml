      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate [18F]MNI-968 (aka PF-06730110) as a D1
      receptor targeted radiopharmaceutical.

        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MNI-968 in brain using positron
           emission tomography (PET) in healthy volunteers.

        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MNI-968 in the healthy volunteers and to perform
           invasive as well as non-invasive modeling to assess [18F]MNI-968 binding to D1 receptor.

        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MNI-968

        -  Evaluation of [18F]MNI-968 PET reliability (test/retest) of several outcome measures

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are males or females &gt; 18 years of age and &lt; 50 years of age;

          -  Are in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital
             signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Are able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study, and understand and sign the written informed consent.

          -  Female subjects must be documented by medical records or physician's note to be either
             surgically sterile (by means of hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal
             ligation) or post-menopausal for at least 1 year or, if they are of child-bearing
             potential, they must commit to use a barrier contraception method for the duration of
             the study.

          -  Male subjects and their partners of childbearing potential must commit to the use of
             two methods of contraception, one of which is a barrier method for the male subjects
             for the study duration.

          -  Male subjects must not donate sperm for the study duration.

          -  Provide informed consent for study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any prescription drugs, herbal supplements, within four (4) weeks prior to
             initial dosing, and/or over-the-counter (OTC) medication, dietary supplements
             (vitamins included) within two (2) weeks prior to initial dosing. If needed (i.e. an
             incidental and limited need), acetaminophen is acceptable, but must be documented as a
             concomitant medication / significant non-drug therapy.

          -  Subject has received an investigational therapeutic drug or device within 30 days of
             screening

          -  Prior participation in other research protocols or clinical care in the last year in
             addition to the radiation exposure expected from participation in this clinical study,
             such that radiation exposure exceeds the effective dose of 50 mSv, which would be
             above the acceptable annual limit established by the US Federal Guidelines

          -  Have a history of blood donation in excess of 500 mL of blood within 30 days prior to
             screening.

          -  Have a history or presence of any significant cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,
             renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or neurological disorders which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, are capable of altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination
             of drugs or posing a health risk to participate in the study.

          -  Have clinically significant findings on laboratory evaluations.

          -  Have clinically significant findings on ECG evaluation based on cardiology review.

          -  History of immunodeficiency disease, including a positive HIV test result.

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C antibody test result.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to screening, or evidence
             of such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening.

          -  History of tobacco product use within 3 months prior to screening, to be verified by
             urine cotinine screening.

          -  Positive pregnancy test result using serum beta-HCG, if female.

          -  Women who are lactating and breastfeeding.

          -  Implants such as implanted cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators, insulin pumps,
             cochlear implants, metallic ocular foreign body, implanted neural stimulators, CNS
             aneurysm clips and other medical implants that have not been certified for MRI, or
             history of claustrophobia in MRI.
