  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of various doses and durations of linezolid
      plus bedaquiline and pretomanid after 26 weeks of treatment in participants with either
      pulmonary XDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, or treatment intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase 3, multi-center, partially-blinded, randomized clinical trial in four parallel
      treatment groups. Bedaquiline and pretomanid treatment will not be blinded. Linezolid
      treatment dose and duration will be double-blinded.

      Participants will have a screening period of up to 9 days and will be randomized to receive
      one of the 4 active treatment arms. Participants will be randomized to one of the four
      regimens in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, using an interactive web response system (IWRS) which will
      utilize a dynamic randomization system using minimization with a random element to allocate
      participants evenly across the arms by HIV status and type of TB.

      Each participant will receive 26 weeks of treatment. If participant's week 16 sample remains
      culture positive, Investigator may consider extending current treatment to 39 weeks, in
      consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor

      Participants will be followed for 78 weeks after end of treatment.

             delamanid prior to first dose of IMP.

         19. Participants with an existing TB diagnosis (a diagnosis made &gt; 4 weeks prior to
             screening) and HIV co-infection, must have been on an ART for at least 4 weeks prior
             to screening.

         20. Participants with newly diagnosed tuberculosis and HIV may be enrolled provided that

             2 weeks of study medication.

         21. HIV infected participants: the following antiretroviral therapies should not be used:
             zidovudine, stavudine, didanosine. The antiretroviral therapy (ART) booster cobicistat
             should not be used. Please reference restrictions Section 5.3.3 Antiretroviral
             Therapy, for guidance on ART treatment during the treatment period.

             Diagnostic and Laboratory Abnormalities

         22. Participants with any of the following toxicities at Screening (labs may be repeated
             during screening period) as defined by the enhanced Division of Microbiology and
             Infectious Disease (DMID) adult toxicity table (November 2007):

               1. Viral load &gt;1000 IU/ml (Unless newly diagnosed HIV and not yet on ART who
                  otherwise qualify for participation);

               2. CD4+ count &lt; 100 cells/µL (HIV positive participants);

               3. Serum potassium less than the lower limit of normal for the laboratory;

               4. Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL;

               5. Platelets &lt;100,000/mm3;

               6. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1500/ mm3;

               7. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)

                    -  Grade 3 or greater (&gt; 3.0 x ULN) to be excluded;

                    -  Results between 1.5 x ULN and 3 x ULN must be discussed with and approved by
                       the Sponsor Medical Monitor

               8. Alanine aminotransferase

                    -  Grade 3 or greater (&gt; 3.0 x ULN) to be excluded;

                    -  Results between 1.5 x ULN and 3 x ULN must be discussed with and approved by
                       the Sponsor medical monitor;

               9. Total bilirubin

                    -  greater than 1.5 x ULN to be excluded;

                    -  1-1.5 x ULN must be discussed with and approved by the Sponsor Medical
                       Monitor

              10. Direct bilirubin

                  • Greater than ULN to be excluded

              11. Serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal

              12. Albumin &lt;3.0 mg/dl

        All inclusion and no exclusion criteria must be met. If no single variable/value is outside
        of the ranges of acceptability, but when multiple values are close to the limits and/or
        whenever the Investigator has reason to suspect that there might be a health problem (other
        than TB), enrolment should only be considered after discussing the case with the sponsor
        medical monitor.
