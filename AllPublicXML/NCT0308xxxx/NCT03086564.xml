  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of anti-tumor treatment is not satisfying in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HBV-HCC) for reasons that HBV-HCC carries highly heterogeneous antigens to facilitate cancer
      cells escaping from immune surveillance and constructs an immunosuppressive microenvironment.
      Correspondingly, dendritic cells activated by HBV antigen peptides and HepG2 cell protein
      lysate can efficiently present T cells with antigens of HCC to sensitize their antitumor
      properties meanwhile cyclophosphamide(CY) can effectively improve the microenvironment of
      immunity. Therefore, we put forward a new scientific therapy called &quot;Activated
      Dendritic-cells Combined Cyclophosphamide&quot; (ADCC) combining with TACE for patients with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma to prolong their survival time.

      Patients who have good compliance complying with the inclusion criteria will be enrolled into
      our research. The 70 patients will be randomly assigned to experimental group and control
      group with the ratio of 1:1, one group (control group) will go on receiving the TACE
      treatment solely; another group (experimental group) after enrollment will receive TACE in
      the first course.Then 10ml blood is taken for activated dendritic cells culture.CY treatment
      will be performed on patients in reasonable dose two days before the second TACE.The day when
      the second TACE performed, these patients will receive activated-dendritic cells
      simultaneously. 31 days after the first TACE therapy, all patients are determined if they
      should continue an additional course by monitoring their blood parameters, tumor indicators
      and imaging examinations. Additionally, we are setting up a treatment course containing 31
      days and going to change one course into 93 days after the third course.

    <description>The first course :
Patients in the first day of a clinical course will be performed TACE solely and keep 40ml blood sample as baseline sample for scientific research;in the 17th day, 10ml blood will be taken to culture activated dendritic cells;in 29th day, cyclophosphamide(CY) 250mg/m2 is used through an intravenous drip;in 31th day,patients are going to be performed TACE,1-2*10^8 activated dendritic cells are dripped through peripheral vein, 40ml blood sample will be taken for clinical research, simultaneously.
The 31th day in the first course is the same as the first day of the second course, then we come to next therapy course.
31 days are a course of treatment, health conditions of patients who participate in will be monitored closely in the process. After previous 3-courses followed-up period, one course will be changed into 93 days.</description>

    <description>Every course:
In the first day,patients are performed TACE solely and taken 40ml blood as baseline sample for scientific research;in the 29th day,patients are needed to reach hospital to check related indicators. In the 31th day, patients are performed TACE again.
The 31th day is the same as the first day in the second course.
31 days are a course of treatment, health conditions of patients who participate in will be monitored closely in the process. After previous 3-courses followed-up period, one course will be changed into 93 days.</description>
