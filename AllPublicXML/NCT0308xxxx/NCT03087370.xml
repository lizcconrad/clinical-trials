  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This natural history study is a prospective and retrospective, observational study of WHIM
      patients. WHIM syndrome is a rare, genetic, primary immunodeficiency disorder (a disorder in
      which the body's immune system does not function properly). WHIM is an acronym for some of
      the symptoms of the disorder - Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia (low levels of certain
      antibodies), Infections and Myelokathexis (too many white blood cells in the bone
      marrow).This study includes 10-year retrospective (Retrospective Phase) and up to 5-year
      prospective (Prospective Phase) components.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the rarity of patients with WHIM syndrome, this study is being conducted to better
      understand the clinical course of untreated patients with WHIM syndrome.

      The goals of this Natural History Study are to define both the frequency and diversity of
      WHIM syndrome by specific genetic mutation, as well as to understand the clinical course and
      phenotype of untreated WHIM patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a confirmed clinical diagnosis of WHIM syndrome.

          2. Has signed the current approved informed consent form; patients under 18 years of age
             will sign an approved informed assent form and must also have a signed parental
             consent.

          3. Be willing and able to comply with the study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has, within 6 months prior to Day 1, received a CXCR4 antagonist.

          2. Currently participating in an investigational study for treatment of WHIM.

          3. Has any other medical or personal condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the patient, or may preclude
             the patient's successful completion of the clinical study.
