    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open label, interventional study evaluating adoptive
      cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) infusion (LN-145)
      followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion preparative regimen for the
      treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing
      process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with recurrent
      and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The cell transfer therapy
      used in this study involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative
      regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen
      of IL-2.

             chemotherapy, biologic/targeted agents and immunologic agents must be discontinued at
             least 28 days prior to lymphodepletion

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

             according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03; (see Appendix
             Section 16.4), except for alopecia or vitiligo prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients with documented Grade 2 or greater diarrhea or colitis as a result of
             previous immunotherapy within six months from screening.

          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide,
             fludarabine, IL-2., or aminoglycosides.

          -  Patients with active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major
             medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system.

          -  Patients with symptomatic and/or untreated brain metastases.

          -  Have any form of primary immunodeficiency, such as severe combined immunodeficiency
             disease or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  Patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45%.

          -  Patients who have a FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) of less than or
             equal to 60 % of normal or walk a distance less than 80% predicted in a 6-min walk
             test or demonstrate evidence of hypoxia during that test.
