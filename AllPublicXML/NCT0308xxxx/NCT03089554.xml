  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a substudy (Part 2) of a larger two-part clinical trial including both observational
      and therapeutic (interventional) cohorts to assess the progression free survival ratio of
      patients treated with a targeted therapy based on genomic analysis results and recommendation
      by the Markey Cancer Center Molecular Tumor Board (MCC MTB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-arm trial in patients with refractory metastatic cancer will compare
      the Progression Free Survival (PFS) using a treatment regimen selected by the MCC MTB with
      the PFS (time to tumor progression) for the most recent regimen on which the patient had
      experienced progression (i.e., using patients as their own control).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically suspected or histologically confirmed solid or hematological
             malignancy who have undergone or will undergo genetic testing of their tumor

          -  Patients must have failed first-line therapy for their disease (refractory) or have no
             options for curative therapies.

          -  Patients must have either measurable or non-measurable disease.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤3.

          -  Patients with brain metastasis must have had treatment of their brain metastasis
             completed at least 1 day prior to enrollment and be on stable dose of steroids or off
             steroids at the time of enrollment.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             targeted therapy, in the opinion of the treating physician.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study.

          -  HIV positive patients with CD4 counts below 500 OR who are not on a stable dose of
             antiretroviral therapy (for at least 1 month prior to registration) are ineligible.
