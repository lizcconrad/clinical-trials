      The purpose of this study is to assess the early longitudinal metabolic effects including
      insulin sensitivity in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children compared to HIV-unexposed
      uninfected (HUU) children; as well as to determine differences in the effects of neonatal
      zidovudine (AZT) vs. nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis on early longitudinal changes in insulin
      sensitivity in the first 3 years of life.

      This study will consist of a nested randomized component of HIV-infected (HIV+) and
      -uninfected (HIV-) pregnant woman/child dyads in Botswana which will take place in Gaborone,
      Botswana at Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership's (BHPs) clinical research
      facilities. A total of 300 HIV+ pregnant woman/fetus dyads on cART and 150 HIV- pregnant
      woman/fetus dyads will be evaluated for insulin sensitivity and followed through the child's
      3rd birthday. Amongst HEU infants, participants will be randomized at birth 1:1 with 150 to
      receive neonatal AZT prophylaxis and 150 to receive neonatal NVP prophylaxis. Targeted
      metabolomics will be used to assess the role intermediary metabolites in insulin resistance
      and directly assess mitochondrial function using Seahorse XF96e technology. At the time of
      study enrollment, all women must be willing to exclusively breastfeed for the infant's first
      6 months of life. If in utero and neonatal HIV/ARV exposures are found to be associated with
      derangements in intermediary metabolism such that HEU infants are at increased risk for
      insulin resistance by 3 years of age, this would impact screening and prevention strategies
      for diabetes in this vulnerable population and argue for further research to identify
      prenatal and neonatal ARV regimens with superior PMTCT efficacy but minimal adverse metabolic
      consequences.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women between 16-36 weeks GA are eligible for
             study enrollment.

          -  Women must be 18 years of older and able to provide informed consent for themselves
             and their infant to participate in the study

          -  Participants must be Botswana citizens

          -  Women must have evidence of HIV-infected status, either documentation of an
             HIV-positive test or documentation of HIV treatment, or being will to undergo a HIV
             testing counseling and rapid diagnostic test to confirm their HIV status at time of
             enrollment if no documentation of HIV-positive status can be provided.

          -  HIV-uninfected women must be willing to undergo HIV pre-test counseling, rapid HIV
             testing and post-test counseling, referred to as HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC)
             during pregnancy.

          -  Women must be willing to remain in study area with their infant and attend scheduled
             study visits as described above until the child's 3rd birthday

          -  For HIV-infected women, they must be on TDF/3TC or FTC/EFV or TDF/3TC or
             FTC/Dolutegravir at time of study enrollment or willing to initiate this treatment and
             continue throughout the period of breastfeeding, if not for their lifetime.

          -  All women must be willing to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life.

             the study antenatally deliver twins or triplets, the mother will be placed off study
             and will not count toward the accrual goal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing maternal diabetes mellitus

          -  HIV+ pregnant woman with &lt;4 weeks of cART prior to delivery or HIV RNA level &gt;400
             copies/mL at delivery

          -  Infants cannot have any congenital anomalies or other life threatening illnesses at
             birth that would be likely to preclude their survival to 12 months of age.

          -  Infants testing positive for HIV infection
