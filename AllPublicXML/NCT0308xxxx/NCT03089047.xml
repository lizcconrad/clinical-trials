  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the physiologic benefits of rejuvenated RBCs (rejRBCs) to standards RBCs (PRBCs),
      the investigator will emulate critical conditions by safely maximizing stress on the
      cardiovascular system, in an elective, feasible volunteer study. VO2max will be measured in
      an anemic, post-donation, pre-transfusion state, and also after transfusing 18-day-old,
      autologous blood randomized to standard storage or standard storage with rejuvenation. The
      investigator hypothesizes that transfusion of standard PRBCs is less effective at increasing
      oxygen delivery (measured by VO2max) compared with transfusion of rejRBCs

      VISIT A (Day 0 - Screening) Written informed consent will be obtained from subjects who
      respond to an IRB-approved advertisement/flyer and fulfill eligibility requirements. The
      following video will help explain the study: vimeo.com/167291799. Individuals who respond to
      an IRB approved advertisement/flyer (uploaded to eIRB) will be given information about the
      study and asked to read an IRB approved consent form. An investigator or designee will obtain
      written informed consent from each individual participating in this study, after adequate
      explanation of the methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study. The investigator
      or designee will also explain to the subjects that they are completely free to refuse to
      enter the study and free to withdraw from it at any time. A copy of the signed consent form
      will be given to the subject.

      After subjects have provided written informed consent, they will be asked to answer several
      questions in 2 written questionnaires (uploaded to eIRB) in order to confirm that they are
      eligible to donate blood. These questions are similar to those routinely asked to people
      prior to a blood donation. These are focused upon keeping the risks of blood donation to the
      lowest possible level.

      VISIT B (Day 2 - Blood donation) Rex Blood Services (RBS), Raleigh, NC, is registered and
      licensed by the US FDA and accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) to
      manufacture RBCs and other blood products. Two units of blood will be withdrawn from each
      subject according to standards for double, AS-3, apheresis units, and will be marked for
      autologous donation, and purchased by Duke Transfusion Services, as arranged with the medical
      director of RBS (Tim Carter, MD). RBC handling and storage will meet FDA and AABB standards;
      units will be stored with Duke Transfusion Services c/o Dr. Poisson.

      VISIT C (Day 16 - &quot;Anemic&quot; VO2 max) Three minutes of resting baseline measures will be
      recorded before the start of exercise. The subject will then begin to pedal the cycle
      ergometer at a cadence of 75 rpm. Resistance will be manually set according to a
      standardized, progressive protocol. A rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be obtained at
      the end of each exercise stage. Vital signs will be recorded every 3 minutes, and ECG
      monitoring will be continuous. Exercise will be terminated when the subject reaches
      volitional fatigue. VO2max will be reported as the highest oxygen consumption averaged over
      two 30-second periods, which typically occurs in the last stage of the progressive maximal
      exercise test. Maximum heart rate will be the heart rate at or near VO2max. To minimize
      variability in VO2max testing procedures, the same 2 facilitators (an engineer/technician and
      a research nurse/coach) will be present at every test.

      VISIT D (Day 18 after &quot;Anemic&quot; VO2max - Transfusion (Tx) and &quot;post-Tx&quot; VO2max) Duke
      Transfusion Services will randomize each subject to receive 2 units of standard PRBCs or
      rejRBCs over 120 minutes using a standard infusion pump. All units will be washed to equalize
      the transfusion volumes; rejuvenation includes a mandatory washing step. Vital signs will be
      monitored and recorded every 15 minutes. After a 2-hour rest and a light snack, the exercise
      test will be repeated.

      Laboratory testing: The p50 will be measured in one of the blood units transfused and in the
      subject before the exercise test. Radial arterial access will be obtained for serial cardiac
      output monitoring (LiDCO Pulse Contour Analysis, LiDCO Products, London, UK), arterial blood
      gas analysis and lactate measurement before and after transfusion, and after exercise
      testing.

      Subjects will have blood collected for a hemoglobin level. After this visit, subjects'
      participation in the study is complete.

    <description>Rejuvenation refers to the process of adding a mix of solutes (Rejuvesol®, Citra Labs, Braintree, MA; consists of sodium pyruvate, inosine, adenine, mono- and dibasic sodium phosphate) to older, stored (i.e., 2-3 DPG-depleted) blood to immediately restore 2,3-DPG and ATP levels in the stored red blood cells15. Rejuvenation was originally developed to prolong the storage life of rare-phenotype RBC units. It is FDA-approved for use in RBC units stored in CPD, CPDA-1, and AS-1. The major contraindication for the use of Rejuvesol® is in RBC units stored for fewer than 6 days due to high baseline 2,3-DPG and ATP levels. Rejuvenated units must be washed prior to administration to remove residual Rejuvesol that is not approved for iv administration in such concentrations.</description>

             excluded (screen failure). Based on our previous experience, we anticipate that up to
             25% of the subjects will fall into this category; therefore, 10 subjects will be
             screened to obtain 6-8 participants who go on to donate their blood.
