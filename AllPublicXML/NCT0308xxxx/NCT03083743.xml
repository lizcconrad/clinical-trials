        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 18 to 75 years old

          2. Pathologically diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage Ⅳ) with measurable
             lesions (diameter of tumor lesions displayed on CT scan ≥ 10 mm; short diameter of
             lymph node lesions on CT scan ≥ 15 mm; and no radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation or
             other local treatment has been given to such measurable lesions)

          3. Patients with negative EGFR or ALK gene-sensitive mutations or unknown status and with
             treatment failure or recurrence after previously undergoing the treatment with two
             chemotherapy regimens (at least one platinum-containing two-drug regimen included)

          4. Patients with positive EGFR-TKI or ALK-TKI gene-sensitive mutations and with treatment
             failure or recurrence after previously undergoing one platinum-containing chemotherapy
             regimen may be included. Note that treatment given in neo-adjuvant therapy phase is
             not considered a part of the treatment regimen; however, if recurrence occurred within
             6 months after the end of adjuvant therapy, the adjuvant therapy is considered a part
             of the treatment regimen, and if not within such 6 months, the adjuvant therapy is not
             considered a part of the treatment regimen.

             The term &quot;treatment failure&quot; is defined as: (1) progression presents in the course of
             treatment or after the last treatment with evidence of definitive imaging or clinical
             progression; (2) patients withdrawn from standard treatment due to inability to
             tolerate adverse events of grade IV and above hematological toxicity, of grade II and
             above non-hematological toxicity or of grade II and above major organ damage, such as
             heart, liver and kidney according to NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0.

          5. ECOG status 0-1

          6. Expected survival ≥ 3 months

          7. Patients recovered from damages caused by other treatment given to them (≤ grade 1
             according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0); the interval of nitrosourea or mitomycin given
             was ≥ 6 weeks; the interval of other cytotoxic drugs, Avastin, radiotherapy or surgery
             was ≥ 4 weeks; and the interval of EGFR TKI molecular targeted drugs was ≥ 2 weeks

          8. Major organs function normally, e.g. the following criteria are met (1) Blood routine
             tests shall comply with the criteria as follows (no transfusion of blood or blood
             products within 14 days, no correction with G-CSF and other hematopoietic stimulating
             factors):

               1. Hemoglobin（HB） ≥ 90 g/L

               2. Absolute neutrophil count（ANC） ≥ 1.5 × 10（9）/L

               3. Platelets（PLT ）≥ 80 × 10（9）/L

                  (2) Biochemical test shall comply with the criteria as follows:
