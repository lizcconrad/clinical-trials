      Up to 30 evaluable participants with known or suspected breast cancer (BIRADS 5 by imaging)
      will undergo FTT PET/CT imaging before primary surgery or neoadjuvant therapy. Patients
      undergoing neoadjuvant therapy may choose to have a second FTT PET/CT scan after the start of
      therapy (1 days to 3 weeks). FTT PET/CT uptake will be correlated with pathology measures and
      treatment response, in subjects undergoing neoadjuvant therapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Known or suspected (BIRADS 5 on imaging) primary breast cancer

          -  At least one breast lesion one breast lesion that is 1 cm or greater in size by
             standard imaging (e.g. mammography, ultrasound or breast MRI). Only one type of
             imaging is required to show a lesion of 1 cm or greater in order for the patient to be
             eligible to participate in this study. Patients that have a prior diagnosis of primary
             breast cancer in the opposite breast can be included.

          -  Willing to allow use orcollection of pathology tissue for the purposes of research
             from either clinical biopsy or surgical procedure (if adequate tissue is available) or
             research only biopsy

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be
             willing to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          -  Any current medical condition, illness, or disorder as assessed by medical record
             review and/or self-reported that is considered by a physician investigator to be a
             condition that could compromise participant safety or successful participation in the
