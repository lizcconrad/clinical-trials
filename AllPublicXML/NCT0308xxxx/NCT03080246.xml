      The purpose of this study is to look at the effect of strength training in preventing overuse
      injuries in female runners

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will compare the effects of 9-months of strength training to a
      control group on: (1) injury rates in female runners during the 9 month intervention period,
      and for 9 months after completing the intervention, and (2) on the potential mechanisms of
      injury including strength, joint and tissue loading, and psychosocial factors.

    <description>This group will begin coming to the Clinical Research Center (near the undergraduate campus of Wake Forest University) for exercise classes 3 days per week for about an hour each day. The class will consist of a 10-minute warm-up, a 20-minute strength training period, 15-minutes of neuromuscular (balance/coordination) training, and a 15-minute cool down. These regular exercise classes at Wake Forest will go on for 9 months, followed by another 9 months of follow-up via email and 2 group meetings at Fleet Feet (at months 12 and 15).</description>

    <description>This group will be observed as they follow their usual run-training routine over the course of 18 months. Emails will be sent biweekly for 18 months to update the research team on injury/training status. The group will attend 5 group meetings at Fleet Feet (at months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 15). After the 18 months, they will be offered a free 6-week strength training program at the Clinical Research Center.</description>
