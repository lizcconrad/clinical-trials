  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare 2 different types of magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). Researchers will compare diffusion-weighted imaging (a method to
      show how water moves in a certain area) with standard-of-care imaging to learn which method
      is better to check the status of prostate cancer.

      This is an investigational study. The whole-body MRI scan in this study is performed using an
      FDA-approved and commercially available method. Having whole- body MRI with your
      standard-of-care MRI of the pelvis at the same time is investigational.

      Up to 86 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      If you agree, you will have a whole body MRI along with your standard-of-care MRI of the
      pelvis.

      Adding the whole-body MRI imaging to your pelvic MRI will add about 20-30 minutes to the
      current standard-of-care MRI procedure. The total amount of time for the MRIs will be 60-70
      minutes.

      You will also have your standard-of-care bone scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan of
      your abdomen and pelvis. Researchers will compare the results of these procedures to your
      whole-body MRI.

      Length of Study Participation:

      All of the scans described above will be scheduled and completed within 90 days of signing
      this consent or before beginning any treatment. If you cannot complete the scans within 90
      days or before beginning treatment, you will not be able to continue to take part in the
      study. Your active study participation will be over when the bone scan, CT scan, and whole
      body MRI scans are complete at initial visit.
