  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletes, especially in endurance sports, are at increased risk of oxidative stress and
      inflammation-related diseases and injuries. The production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen
      species (RONS) and inflammatory markers increase during exercise and especially during
      altitude training. Antioxidant supplementation is commonly used among athletes in the belief
      that it prevents oxidative stress and oxidative damage. A transient increase of RONS is
      however necessary to activate signaling cascades initiating training adaptation. Antioxidant
      supplementation has been shown to inhibit the exercise effects in several independent
      studies, possibly by interfering/reducing the signal cascades initiated by RONS. However, it
      is unknown whether a high intake of antioxidant rich foods can affect the amount of RONS,
      inflammation markers and/or training adaptation. The investigators want to examine whether an
      increased intake of natural antioxidants in the form of antioxidant-rich foods fruits,
      vegetables and berries, in line with the official Norwegian dietary advice can affect
      antioxidant status, immune function and training adaptation associated with altitude training
      in Norwegian elite athletes.
