      Cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) is an auxiliary antitumor treatment. The investigators
      aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy combined with CIK in the treatment of
      postoperative colorectal cancer patients. And to provide useful reference for the clinical
      application of CIK in colorectal cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, advances in combination chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer
      have led to significant improvement in progression-free and overall survival.
      Cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) is an auxiliary antitumor treatment. Research has
      demonstrated the median overall survival (OS) in patients received CIK combined with
      chemotherapy (5-Fluorouridine, leucovorin and oxaliplatin [FOLFOX4] plan) was significantly
      increased compared with that in patients received chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, there was
      a trend toward superior progression-free survival time (PFS) in patients received CIK
      combined with chemotherapy compared with that in patients received chemotherapy alone. The
      investigators aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy (FOLFOX4) combined with
      CIK in the treatment of postoperative colorectal cancer patients. And to provide useful
      reference for the clinical application of CIK in colorectal cancer patients.

    <description>Cytokine-induced killer cells + FOLFOX4 intervention:
Day 1: Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² IV infusion in 500 mL 5% dextrose in water (D5W); Day 2-6: leucovorin 200mg/m² IV infusion in D5W both given over 2 hours at the same time in separate bags; Day 2-6: 5-FU 500 mg/m² IV bolus given continuously over 4-6 hours.The treatment is given for 4-6 cycles, every 3 weeks.
Collected cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) cells were suspended with 100ml saline (containing 5ml 20% human serum albumin) and given continuously over 2 hours/ day for 3 days.</description>
