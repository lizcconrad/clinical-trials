      RATIONALE: Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy using luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH)
      agonists and/or anti-androgens has already demonstrated to downstage primary prostate cancer
      in patients treated by radical prostatectomy without a survival benefit. There is no evidence
      yet of a survival impact of LHRH antagonist (LHRHa) +/- new-generation anti-androgens in this
      setting. Thus novel studies are needed to assess this treatment combination.

      PURPOSE: To assess the difference in treatment antitumor effect between arms by measuring
      pathological tumor volume with minimal residual disease (MRD) following radical prostatectomy
      + pelvic lymph-node dissection (RP + PLND) for intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer
      patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To assess the difference in antitumor effect between the treatment arms by
      measuring MRD following radical prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: To measure differences between study arms in

        -  Proportions of post neoadjuvant prostate specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 0.3 ng/ml as a
           predictor of prostate cancer mortality

        -  T down-staging, complete pathological response, PSA kinetics, Testosterone kinetics,
           operation time, blood loss, grade of surgical difficulty

        -  New generation hybrid imaging 68Ga PSMA (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen) PET/MR
           (Positron emission tomography/Magnetic Resonance) derived parameters

        -  Early biochemical recurrence as prognostic factor of prostate cancer mortality

        -  Transcriptome and genome

        -  Tissue microarrays (TMA) protein expression (DNA repair, resistance etc.) by
           immunohistochemistry

        -  Perioperative safety and tolerability

        -  Quality of life, erection recovery, continence through validated preoperative and
           postoperative questionnaires pre and postop (IEEF5, ICIQ, EORTC QLQ-C30)

      OUTLINE: interventional, single center, phase II, randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled trial.
