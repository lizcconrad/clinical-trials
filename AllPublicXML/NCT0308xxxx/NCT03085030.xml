  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of antioxidants on IVF outcome in infertile
      patients undergoing IVF who are expected to produce low number of eggs compared to a control
      group. The investigators assumed that the conception rate is higher in those patients taking
      some antioxidants supplementation. The patients will be given antioxidant drug one month
      before starting IVF trial once daily by mouth. Uniform protocol of stimulation will be done
      during the cycle by a type of short protocols known as the antagonist protocol. Egg retrieval
      will be done under anesthesia. pregnancy test will be done 2 weeks after embryo transfer. The
      investigators will also assess the number and quality of eggs on the day of egg pick up. In
      addition, the researchers will assess the number of first and second grade embryos that are
      put on the day of embryo transfer.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the value of antioxidant intake on the pregnancy
      rate in IVF/ICSI (invitro-fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection) cycles in poor
      responders. when the participants fulfill the eligibility criteria, informed consent will be
      taken. Block randomization will be done and the patients are allocated to one of two groups.
      The first group will take the antioxidant tablet daily orally for one month before the
      IVF/ICSI cycle. the other group will take placebo following the same regimen as the study
      group. Antagonist protocol will be done for all participants. Ovum pick up will be done under
      general anesthesia when one or more oocytes reaches 17 mm. The researchers will do embryo
      transfer on day 2 or 3 after ovum pickup. pregnancy test will be in blood after 2 weeks of
      embryo transfer.
