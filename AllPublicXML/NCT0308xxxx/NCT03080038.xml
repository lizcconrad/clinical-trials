  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the SQUEEZE Trial is to determine which fluid resuscitation strategy results
      in the best outcomes for children treated for suspected or confirmed septic shock. In this
      study, eligible children will be randomized to either the 'Usual Care Arm' or the 'Fluid
      Sparing Arm'. Children will receive treatment according to current ACCM Septic Shock
      Resuscitation Guidelines, with the assigned resuscitation strategy used to guide
      administration of further fluid boluses as well as the timing of initiation and escalation of
      vasoactive medications to achieve ACCM recommended hemodynamic targets.

    <description>Decisions regarding the IV/IO administration of isotonic fluid boluses and/or the initiation and escalation of vasoactive medication infusions are left to the discretion of the treating physician and medical team. We ask that vasoactive medications not be initiated until at least 60 mL/kg (3 litres for children ≥ 50 kg) of isotonic fluid bolus therapy has been administered.

    <description>Tier 1: Initiate IV/IO vasoactive medication infusion support immediately. Further IV/IO isotonic fluid bolus therapy [crystalloid (0.9% Normal Saline or Ringers Lactate) or colloid (5% Albumin)] should be avoided; small volume isotonic fluid boluses [5-10 mL/kg (250-500 mL for participants ≥ 50 kg)] may be provided if required due to A. Clinically unacceptable delay in ability to initiate vasoactive medication infusion(s) and/or 2. Documented intravascular hypovolemia.
Tier 2: Vasoactive medication(s) should be preferentially titrated/escalated to achieve recommended ACCM hemodynamic goals. Further IV/IO isotonic fluid bolus therapy [crystalloid (0.9% Normal Saline or Ringers Lactate) or colloid (5% Albumin)] should be avoided; small volume isotonic fluid boluses [5-10 mL/kg (250-500 mL for participants ≥ 50 kg)] may be provided if required due to A. Documented intravascular hypovolemia.
Intervention end: Patient is free from vasoactive medication support and shock is reversed.</description>
