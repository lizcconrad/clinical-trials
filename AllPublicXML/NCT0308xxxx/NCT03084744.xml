  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of schema therapy versus active monitoring for women with chronic
      depression receiving psychiatric care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, assessor-blind, single center, superiority trial will be conducted.
      Participants will be referred to clinical psychologists in a private counseling office
      (Senzoku Stress Coping Support Office, in Japan). Eligible participants will be women with
      chronic depression receiving psychiatric care. Participants will receive schema therapy or
      active monitoring during 2 years. Primary outcome will be treatment response. A total sample
      size of 64 (32 in each group) would be required to provide 80% power at a 2-sided
      significance level of 5% to detect a risk difference of 35% (response rate: 55% for schema
      therapy vs. 20% for active monitoring), assuming a dropout rate of 10%.
