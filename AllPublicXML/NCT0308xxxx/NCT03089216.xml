  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and dental sensitivity associated
      with Combined Bleaching Technique (in-office + at-home) varying in-office bleaching
      application under two different time protocols, and dentifrice containing arginine 8% and
      carbonate calcium use. One hundred eight participants who meet the study inclusion criteria
      will be selected. The desensitizing agent used will be a dentifrice containing 8% arginine
      and calcium carbonate. In each evaluation will be determined: tooth sensitivity and color.
      The data collected will be submitted to the factorial statistical analysis for evaluation of
      color and chi-square test for tooth sensitivity (α = 5%).

      This study will be conducted under the CONSORT recommendations. After approval by the Ethics
      Committee for Research duly registered, the trial will be conducted in the clinic of dental
      school at the Federal University of Goias located in Goiania. One hundred eight participants
      108 volunteers will be selected on the criteria that qualify inclusion and exclusion from the
      study will be reported all volunteers were examined not qualify under the criteria for
      inclusion as part of the initial according to CONSORT recommendations .

      After signing the signed an informed consent form all volunteer participants will receive a
      dental prophylaxis with pumice and water in a rubber cups for the removal of extrinsic stains
      two weeks before the beginning of tooth whitening.
