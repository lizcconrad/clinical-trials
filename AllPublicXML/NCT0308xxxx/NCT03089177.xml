  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previous studies show that community gardening is associated with reduction
      of key health behaviors for cancer prevention in diverse populations. Community gardeners eat
      more fruits and vegetables per day, are more physically active, and are more likely to avoid
      age-associated increase in body mass index (BMI). The effect is partially explained by the
      finding that gardeners are more socially involved, and feel more social support than
      non-gardeners.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether community
      gardening improves cancer-preventive behaviors among a multi-ethnic, low-income adult
      population and elucidate the pathways that shape cancer-preventive behaviors. A randomized
      controlled trial is needed to demonstrate that the observed behavioral differences are due to
      the effect of gardening as an intervention rather than self-selection by gardeners.

    <description>The investigators will recruit prospective adult gardeners who have not been gardening for the past two years and who are listed on Denver Urban Gardens (DUG) wait lists. Individuals randomized to the garden intervention will receive a standardized garden resource package, which includes the following:
A garden plot in a Denver Urban Garden
Seeds and plant starts
Introductory gardening workshop
Social events including garden-specific events and garden mentoring.
The Wait List Control group will remain on the community gardening wait lists and will not receive these resources.
Duration of the intervention is 1 year.</description>
