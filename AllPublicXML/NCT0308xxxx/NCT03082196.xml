      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of Advantage Anti-Caries Varnish.
      Single-center, double-blind, controlled Phase 2 study with parallel groups of children.
      Subjects will be stratified by early childhood education center and then randomized to
      receive either test varnish or control varnish topically to the teeth. Treatment will be
      administered quarterly for up to 24 months. The primary outcome is surface-level primary
      molar caries increment (d2mfs) at 24- months post baseline.

      Objectives:

      Primary

      - To determine if Advantage Anti-Caries Varnish (test varnish) is superior to a control
      varnish containing only fluoride in the prevention of new caries lesions.

      Secondary

        -  To establish that the response of child participants to the test varnish was not
           inferior to the control varnish

    <masking_description>All study personnel except for designated personnel in the data center will be blinded to the participant treatment assignment. In order to maintain blinding, the caries scoring examinations will precede the application of test varnishes at baseline. The staff member applying these varnishes will not perform the caries scoring exams in order to eliminate examiner bias and ensure blinding to treatment assignment. Test drug and comparator are packaged identically.</masking_description>
