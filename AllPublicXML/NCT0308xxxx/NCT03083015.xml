  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the efficiency of pulp revascularization and MTA apexification in the
      treatment of patients with necrotic immature anterior teeth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the participants with 66 anterior necrotic immature teeth were randomly assigned into two
      equal groups with 33 teeth per each, according to regeneration and MTA apexification. At the
      first visit, all teeth were accessed and irrigated with NaOCl then a TAP was applied as
      intra-appointment intracanal medication. At the second visit, after removal of the medication
      with the irrigation, bleeding was initiated into the canal and isolated by the MTA in the
      orifice in the regeneration group. While in the Apexification group, the MTA was packed
      apically and all teeth were finally restored with resin composite restorations. The patients
      were recalled after 1, 3, 6, and 9 months for clinical and radiographic follow up.

    <intervention_model_description>participants are allocated at random to receive one of two interventions according to the research plan. In RCT the outcomes are measured, so it is considered a quantitative study . This trial conforms to the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)statement.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>For the allocation concealment mechanism, each of 66 papers (each paper was eight folded) numbered from 1 to 66 were, individually packed, in opaque envelopes. Each participant picked an envelope at the beginning of the second visit. The number in the envelope determined which procedure was to be performed for the patient. The partner was to decide the procedure for the operator according to that number.</masking_description>
