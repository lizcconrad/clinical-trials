  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to determine the effects of negative-calorie diet supplemented with
      exercise, on weight loss and lipid profile, and to compare its efficiency with low-calorie
      diet with exercise among elderly adult men with abnormal weight gain.

      Background and Aim: Negative-calorie diet is among the popular dieting guides for weight
      loss; however, there is still little knowledge about this method. The present study aimed to
      determine the effects of negative-calorie diet supplemented with exercise, on weight loss and
      lipid profile, and to compare its efficiency with low-calorie diet with exercise among
      elderly adult men with abnormal weight gain.

      Materials and Methods: Participants included sedentary men (age 45-75 years) with overweight
      or obesity (n=37). They were randomly divided into 2 groups including negative calorie diet
      with exercise, and low-calorie diet with exercise. Of all 37 participants, 30 persons
      completed the treatment. The weight assessment parameters including change in weight and body
      composition, blood sample tests were performed pre- and three month post-intervention.
