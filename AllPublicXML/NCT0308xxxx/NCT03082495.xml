  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate if aerobic exercise during and after neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) can improve outcomes for rectal cancer patients.

      Rectal cancer patients will be randomly assigned to aerobic exercise or usual care. Patients
      in the aerobic exercise group will be asked to complete 3 supervised high-intensity aerobic
      interval training (HIT) session/week during NACRT and ≥ 150 minutes/week of unsupervised
      aerobic exercise after NACRT.

      Primary hypothesis: aerobic exercise during and after NACRT, compare to usual care, will
      result in significantly better cardiorespiratory fitness.
