  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of pilot study application is to build on the investigators' previous work that
      established the prospective association between stress and infertility. Specifically, the
      investigators hope to collect the preliminary data necessary to make them competitive to
      submit a R01 application to NIH for funding of a full-scale randomized controlled trial of an
      internet-based stress management program to examine its efficacy in decreasing stress and
      increasing pregnancy rates among women who have tried to get pregnant for 6-12 months without
      success. The program called Stress Free Now (SFN) was developed at the Cleveland Clinic and
      has been shown to be effective in lowering stress in a variety of populations. The program
      introduces concepts of mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy to assist individuals in
      managing their stress levels. The intervention includes Internet-based interaction, daily
      emails and recommended relaxation practice of at least four days per week. Using targeted
      Facebook Ads and other recruitment modalities, the investigators will randomize 40 women ages
      18-34 who have been trying to conceive for 6-12 months without success. The PI has been
      enrolling women in a similar study using this mechanism and has found it to be an efficient
      and cost-effective method of identifying potentially eligible individuals. Women will be
      randomized to SFN or a wait list control condition and will be followed for up to three
      months post-randomization with weekly journals as they try to conceive. The primary outcome
      of this randomized controlled trial is stress level, as measured by salivary alpha-amylase,
      while the secondary outcome will be pregnancy rate at the end of the three-month follow-up
      period.
