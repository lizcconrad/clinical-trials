  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is to evaluate coronary perfusion as well as heart muscle
      function. This examination takes place in two stages, one imaging at rest and one after a
      cardiac stress caused. This stress can be triggered as a first-line stress test. A
      pharmacological stress is proposed when stress test is not possible or contraindicated,
      Several drugs have a marketing authorization in this indication (adenosine, dipyridamole,
      regadenoson, dobutamine).

      Among them, the regadenoson is the most recent molecule. Marketed in France since 2013, it
      would allow a reduction of undesirable effects compared to other agents, especially
      adenosine. It is simple and quick to use thanks to a single dose administration. However, its
      cost is nearly 30 times higher than dipyridamole. In the investigational center, dipyridamole
      is currently the first-line pharmacological stress agent, whereas regadenoson is reserved for
      a limited number of doses, the indication of which must be justified (asthmatic patient or
      with severe COPD). Few studies in the literature specifically compare these two
      pharmacological agents (examination time, cost, tolerance) and the opinion on the use of
      regadenoson in the service is limited.
