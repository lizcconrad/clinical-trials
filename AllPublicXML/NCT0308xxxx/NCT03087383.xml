  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In neurosurgical anesthesia, propofol based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is frequently
      used due to brain relaxation and less effect on electrophysiologic monitoring. Response to
      propofol can vary between individuals and be associated with clinical factors including age
      and weight, and genetic polymorphism. Because the importance of rapid recovery in
      neurosurgery with long operation time is emphasized recently, the choice and dose adjustment
      of anesthetics should be determined according to clinical and genetic factors. Recently,
      researches about genetic variations have been performed with single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP). The aim of this study is to find SNPs associated with propofol recovery and response
      through genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Korean adult population undergoing propofol
      based TIVA for clipping of unruptured cerebral aneurysm.

    <measure>Time of eye opening after stopping propofol infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one hour</time_frame>
    <description>When operation is finished, investigator will stop the intravenous infusion of propofol. Investigators will measure the time from when propofol infusion is stopped until eye opening and extubation, respectively. The measurement will be established within about one hour from end of surgery.</description>

    <description>In adult patients undergoing propofol based TIVA for clipping of unruptured cerebral aneurysm, investigator will collect data regarding recovery after stopping propofol infusion (time for eye opening and extubation), propofol requirement during anesthesia maintenance, and propofol effect site concentration to achieve bispectral index 40 during anesthesia induction, without doing any interventions. Data collection will be established with just observing and recording values displayed in screens of monitoring devices, and reviewing patient charts.</description>
