  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OCT is now an established way to measure the thickness of the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer
      (RNFL) in the retina of the eye. The thickness of the RNFL is always a reflection of the
      number of the RNFs in any particular area of the retina. Each single RNF runs a long course
      starting from the cell body which is the retinal ganglion cell in the retina and ends in the
      thalamus of the brain where it relays visual information to other nerve cell in the thalamus.
      Along this long course RNFs are in close anatomical relationship with the pituitary gland
      crossing just above this gland about midway along their course. Hence enlargement of this
      gland can interfere with the RNFs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inferior chiasmal syndrome is known to be caused by pituitary gland enlightenment because
      the pituitary gland lies just below the optic chiasma. The visual RNFs are organized in a
      very specific way along their long course from the retina to the Lateral Geniculate Body
      (LGB) in the thalamus. Pituitary enlargement would compromise particular RNFs. It is well
      known and established that pituitary enlargement, if not properly treated in time, would
      possibly cause bitemporal hemianopia due to interference with the crossing RNFs of the nasal
      half of each retina. In this study pituitary enlargement was suspected by OCT findings while
      the patient still had perfect peripheral visual field in each eye.

    <measure>Thinning of the retinal nerve fibers (RNF) that are nearest to the pituitary gland, measured in micro-millimeters in OCT, were the first indication of possible enlargement of this gland.</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of one year.</time_frame>
    <description>Pituitary gland enlargement if not treated in time can have devastating effects on vision. Early diagnosis and treatment of this problem can not be over stressed. This study describes thinning of particular RNF in each eye that led to the suspicion of pituitary enlargement and was an early sign of the inferior chiasmal syndrome. Imaging studies were used to validate the suspected result.</description>
