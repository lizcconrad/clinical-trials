  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing health burden in Sweden and Europe arising from the interrelated sequelae
      of metabolic disorders comprising impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), obesity and T2DM. Obesity
      and inactivity are the main drivers of IGT and T2DM and are responsible for up to 8% of
      health costs and 13% of deaths in Europe, with the risk of co-morbidities rising in parallel
      with increasing body weight. IGT and T2DM are the paradigm of inactivity-related disorders:
      the majority of people who have IGT or T2DM are overweight and inactive, with up to 80% being
      obese. A recent meta-analysis of 42 studies concluded that sedentary time was independently
      associated with a greater risk of T2D, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease incidence
      and mortality, and cancer incidence and mortality (breast, colon, colorectal, endometrial and
      epithelial ovarian cancers) (Ann Intern Med. 2015;162:123-32). A recent systematic review of
      trials published up to April 2014 identified 16 separate studies and concluded that there is
      considerable evidence of the positive effects of breaking up prolonged sitting time with
      light-intensity ambulatory physical activity and standing on postprandial metabolic
      parameters, including glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels (Med Sci Sports Exerc.
      2015:47:2053-61). However, to date, all of the published experimental trials describing the
      beneficial effects of breaking up sitting time on metabolic risk markers have been restricted
      to acute exposure periods (1-5 days). We will perform a RCT intervention study, which
      examines the efficacy (clinically relevant responses) and practical implementation of
      low-impact training in sedentary obese individuals during the day.
