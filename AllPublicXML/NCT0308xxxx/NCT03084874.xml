  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD are more inactive and more sedentary than subjects of the same age and
      patients with other chronic diseases. This inactivity and sedentary behavior is accentuated
      after hospitalizations due to a COPD exacerbation, and it increases the risk for future
      hospitalizations and mortality. Therefore, there is a need for intervention to promote
      physical activity and to reduce sedentary behavior after these events. The present study aims
      to evaluate the efficacy of a coaching program to promote physical activity and reduce
      sedentary behavior in patients with COPD who have suffered a hospitalization due to a COPD
      exacerbation. Sixty-six COPD patients admitted to the hospital will be recruited during 18
      months. Physical activity, sedentary behaviors, as well as other clinical and functional
      parameters will be evaluated after hospital discharge. Patients will be then randomized to an
      intervention and control group (1:1). The intervention group will receive an individualized
      coaching program. During a motivational interview an experienced physiotherapist will asses
      participant's usual exercise habits, possible barriers and facilitators, self-efficacy and
      motivation to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time. Based on these data (and
      baseline physical activity/sedentary information) an individualized, progressive program with
      specific goals setting and self-monitoring will be established (patients will be active
      participants and decision makers in this process). The control group will receive the usual
      care during follow-up. Physical activity, sedentary behaviors, as well as the clinical and
      functional variables will be evaluated again at 12 weeks in both patients' groups.
