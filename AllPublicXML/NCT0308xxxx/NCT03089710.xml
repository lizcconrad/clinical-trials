      Perioperative fluid management is crucial for patients' outcome. Muller et al developed a
      &quot;Mini-fluid challenge method &quot; to predict fluid responsiveness and the efficacy. The
      investigators design the study to investigate the effectiveness of mini-fluid challenge test
      in prone position surgery.

      Perioperative fluid management is crucial for patients' outcome. Series of studies have
      indicated that adequate fluid management optimizes the cardiac out put, improves tissue
      perfusion, thus decrease the risk of postoperative morbidity. Muller et al developed a
      &quot;Mini-fluid challenge method &quot; to predict fluid responsiveness and the efficacy. To the best
      of our knowledge, the efficacy of the test was not discussed in the perioperative care in
      prone position surgery. The investigators design the study to investigate the effectiveness
      of mini-fluid challenge test in prone position surgery.

    <description>Fluid challenge test will be presented after induction of anesthesia at a steady state. Fluid challenge test includes 2 components: 100 ml colloid infusion in 1 min followed by 400 ml colloid infusion in 14 mins. Hemodynamic parameter after 1 minute of the end of the 1st and 2nd colloid infusion bolus will be collected.
Applied colloid: hydroxyethyl starch</description>
