  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between serum progesterone level on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin
      administration and outcome of in vitro fertilization /intracytoplasmic sperm injection and
      embryo transfer has been controversial for several decades. some studies presented data
      against the negative effect of premature luteinization and reported that elevated serum
      progesterone had no adverse effect on pregnancy rates in fresh embryo-transfer cycles within
      different ovarian responses.However,most studies have evaluated the association between serum
      progesterone level and clinical outcome in fresh in vitro fertilization /intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection cycles, and advocated that serum progesterone elevation on the day of human
      chorionic gonadotropin administration may adversely affect clinical outcome by jeopardizing
      endometrial receptivity.

      In addition, the underlying mechanism through which premature luteinization influences
      clinical outcomes is elusive. some proposed that premature luteinization cause impairment of
      the endometrial receptivity, which may indicate a change in the implantation window, is more
      likely to be affected than the oocyte.whereas some documented that the compromised quality of
      oocytes might also be a cause.

      The cut off point of premature luteinization is not well established till now. Premature
      luteinization has been variously defined based on serum P levels, with thresholds of 0.9-1.5
      ng/mL being used.

      Previous studies have shown that metformin inhibits the first steps of steroidogenesis dose
      dependently reducing granulosa cells progesterone output .Moreover other authors have
      recently reported that low dose metformin could improve in vitro fertilization outcome in non
      poly-cystic ovarian syndrome repeaters.So,considering the safety of this drug before
      pregnancy, metformin can be given to consenting patients from first ultrasound monitoring
      until ovulation triggering.
