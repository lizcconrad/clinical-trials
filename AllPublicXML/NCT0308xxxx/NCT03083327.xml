  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental prophylactic early parenteral nutrition will be commenced 1 day prior to
      conditioning chemoradiotherapy in patients who are not already malnourished. Supplemental
      parenteral nutrition continues throughout conditioning chemoradiotherapy and stem cell
      transplant.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A standard parenteral nutrition solution will be used. The parenteral nutrition solution will
      be given once daily, and infused intravenously. The standard parenteral nutrition solution
      will contain approximately 40 grams of amino acids/L, 40 g lipids/L and 100g dextrose/L).
      Nutritional targets will be measured using indirect Calorimetry where available, or
      calculated via the Harris Benedict or Schofield equations. The dose of parenteral nutrition
      administered will be determined by the treating dietitian, treating physician or treating
      research team. The parenteral nutrition dose given will be individualised considering the
      patients clinical condition and body weight. The dose of supplemental parenteral nutrition
      will be dependent on the total calories also received from oral and/or enteral nutrition
      intake.

      Supplemental parenteral nutrition will be discontinued when a patient is well enough to be
      discharged from hospital or when the patients attending clinician determines a central line
      is no longer needed for standard care. There is no maximum duration of supplemental
      parenteral nutrition..

      Adherence to the study intervention will be monitored via medical chart reviews during site
      monitoring visits, and data queries on individual patient case report form documentation.

    <description>The control group in this study is pragmatic standard nutrition care. Currently after a bone marrow transplant in Australia, patients are normally fed orally for as long as possible. If oral intake fails to provide sufficient calories for a period of two to three days, enteral or parenteral nutrition may be provided.</description>
