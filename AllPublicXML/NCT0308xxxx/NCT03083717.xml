      Application of Nanotechnology and Chemical Sensors for Diagnosis of Decompensated Heart
      Failure by Respiratory Samples.

      Breath testing, which links specific volatile molecular biomarkers in exhaled breath to
      medical conditions, is becoming increasingly popular as a non-invasive and potentially
      inexpensive diagnostic method for various diseases. NA-NOSE performs odor detection from
      exhaled breath, thus producing a distinct fingerprint for each mixture of analytes.

      Several studies have been published, stating the advantages of these sensors, leading to
      promising outcomes in several fields.

      The NA-NOSE breath test would be fast (examination and results would be obtained within 5-10
      min), inexpensive, eventually portable (smaller than desktop computer), non-invasive and free
      of any side effects.

    <time_frame>Each participant's breath sample will be analysed within one week of collection.</time_frame>
    <description>Exhaled breath samples will be collected from each volunteer for characterization and identification using two different methods. The first method uses gas chromatography linked to mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the various breath volatile organic compunds (VOC's) in each group studied (compensated heart failure, decompensated heart failure and healthy subjects). The second method deploys cross-reactive nanoarrays in combination with pattern recognition methods (NaNose Technology).</description>
