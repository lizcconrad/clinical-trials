  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease characterized by
      airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully reversible. Patients with acute
      exacerbation of COPD must be hospitalized, as for further increase in airway resistance,
      pulmonary alveolar excessive expansion, diaphragm fatigue and neural respiratory drive. In
      recent years, Pulmonary rehabilitation is recognized as a core component in the comprehensive
      management of COPD, EDP as a means of rehabilitation can alleviate diaphragmatic fatigue,
      improve ventilation function, reduce the neural respiratory drive in patients with COPD
      during hospitalization, but still lack of evidence based medicine. Surface EMGdi can
      accurately evaluate neural respiratory drive, its detection is non-invasive, simple and
      safety .Therefore,Neural respiratory drive by surface EMGdi can be used as an important index
      for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of AECOPD patients during hospitalization.

      In the present study, about 40 patients with COPD will be recruited as research subjects .And
      the investigators aim to explore the effect of EDP on diaphragmatic function and neural
      respiratory drive in patient with AECOPD.Contrast analysis will be conducted to evaluate the
      effects of EDP on patients with AECOPD, which may provide a reasonable basis for the clinical
      application of EDP to AECOPD patients.

      Patients with AECOPD will participate in a rehabilitation program for one week. Participants
      in the proposed study will be randomly divided into two intervention groups:controlgroup and
      EDP therapy group. Before using EDP,the investigators will measure the relevant parameters of
      lung volume , diaphragm electromyogram, diaphragm activity and other basline index. Then EDP
      will be applied to investigate the effects of EDP on the above mentioned respiratory
      mechanics parameters.
