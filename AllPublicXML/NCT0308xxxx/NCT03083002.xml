    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study is to determine transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics features of
      liver cirrhotic tissue in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to find a
      correlation with the risk of developing HCC and survival.

      Patients will be enrolled after hepatic ultrasonography control and they will be submitted to
      hepatic vein pressure gradient and liver biopsy.

      The study have four research lines:

      Task # 1: transcriptomic characterization of liver tissue. During hepatic vein pressure
      gradient , liver tissue will be extracted with transjugular catheter equipped with a biopsy
      device. Tissue will be used to extract microRNA to define molecular signature.

      Task # 2: Proteomic characterization of liver tissue. Protein expression changes will be
      analyze with MALDI-TOF

      Task # 3: Metabolomic features on serum of patient with cirrhosis. Metabolomics is defined as
      the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric response of living systems to
      pathophysiological stimulus or genetic modification. Principal objective of this activity
      will be identify metabolites deregulated with metabolomic approach and clarify any new
      pathways involved in the evolution of cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The metabolomic analysis will be performed on sera collected in patients with cirrhosis at
      baseline.

      Task # 4: Transcriptomic characteristics of newly diagnosed HCC. New diagnosis of
      hepatocellular carcinoma will undergo an eco-assisted liver biopsy. A tissue sample will be
      dedicated to the extraction of 'RNA. Patients will then undergo elective treatment according
      to international guidelines. The course of the disease and the results of therapeutic
      interventions will be recorded and correlated with the molecular data. Molecular signature
      will be obtain.

    <description>RNA sample will be collected from patients and used to obtained transcriptomic profile through microarray and microRNA. Patients will be submitted to hepatic vein pressure gradient and combined right heart catheterization. During this standard procedure liver tissue will be taken and treated for extraction of RNA.
In order to obtain microarray RNA extracted will be analyzed with single color hybridization of human RNA on Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo whereas, the extraction of microRNA will be made starting from RNA extracted with mirVana miRNA Isolation kit.</description>

    <time_frame>DECEMBER 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis will be conducted on sera collected during the screening. These samples will be examined using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in order to obtain the identification of main components and their mass than, the informations will be analyzed by MarkerLynxTM software</description>

    <measure>Transcriptomics characteristics of newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma: the purpose is to verify if we can predict the survival of patients considering the molecular features of HCC at first diagnosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>DECEMBER 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with new diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma will be subjected to liver biopsy. A part of biopsy will be used to extract RNA and we will try to identify molecular signature through qRT / PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and using a set of 12 up- regulated and 10 down - regulated genes previously identified.</description>

        Patients with liver cirrhosis will be selected. After obtaining informed consent they will
        be submitted to hepatic biopsy,blood sample, HVPG with combined right heart catheterization
        and every 6 months to ultrasound.

        Patients will be followed for 24 months thereafter or until the diagnosis of HCC, whichever
        comes first. In case of onset of HCC, will be performed a eco-guided biopsy.
