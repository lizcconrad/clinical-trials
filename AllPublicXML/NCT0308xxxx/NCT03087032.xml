  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present 24-week, prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel group trial
      is carried to investigate and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adding Liraglutide vs
      insulin Glargine to prandial insulin in type 2 diabetes patients treated with premixed
      Insulin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with insulin. Patients with
      diabetes receiving intensive insulin therapy with various combinations of basal and prandial
      insulin can be caught in a vicious but common cycle, whereby insulin requirements increase
      over time, and this in turn contributes to weight gain and hypoglycemia and further increases
      in insulin dosing. At this stage, clinicians observe a practical limit to the efficacy of
      insulin titration alone on glucose-lowering and often add or continue metformin to reduce
      insulin resistance. Injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as
      liraglutide, are a relatively new addition to our treatment armamentarium. These drugs
      improve glucose control and insulin sensitivity and contribute to weight loss. Treatment with
      basal insulin plus GLP-1RAs is well-established in diabetes guidelines and may be as
      effective as adding prandial insulin therapy. When GLP-1 RAs are started, a preemptive
      reduction in insulin dosage by 25% to 30% in patients with HbA1c &lt; 9% may reduce the risk for
      hypoglycemia. In patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated with high doses of premix
      insulin, Is basal-prandial insulin therapy the option treatment algorithm? Such an
      intensification strategy carries risk of increased hypoglycaemia and weight gain, both of
      which are associated with worse long-term outcomes. What is the effect of adding liraglutide
      on HbA1c levels? There have been no randomized, controlled trials of the use of a GLP-1 RAs
      in conjunction with prandial insulin, and such use is not incorporated in the new American
      Diabetes Association recommendations. To investigate and evaluate the effectiveness and
      safety of adding Liraglutide vs insulin Glargine to prandial insulin in type 2 diabetes
      patients treated with premixed Insulin. The present 24-week, prospective, open-label,
      randomized, multicenter, parallel group trial will be preformed.
