  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to; (1) estimate the change in disease -related cognitive
      decline over 1 year on a battery of cognitive tests administered to participants with
      early-stage symptomatic Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD) phenotypic
      variant; (2) identify the cognitive test or brief battery of cognitive tests which are the
      most sensitive to detect bvFTD progression; (3) determine the optimal schedule of
      administration of cognitive tests to detect bvFTD progression; (4) evaluate the relationship
      between cognitive tests and measures of behavior, function, caregiver's burden, quality of
      life (QOL); and (5) obtain blood samples for genetic and exploratory biomarkers correlations.

    <measure>Change from Day 1 of QOL in Quality of Life in NeuroQOL</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQL) assessment for adults with a neurological disorder, which measures 3 areas: physical health, mental health, and social health. All NeuroQOL items have 5 response options (1 = not at all to 5 = very much). Higher scores represent more impairment or worse health. Participants with bvFTD will complete the following sections of the NeuroQOL: Cognitive Function SF, Emotional and Behavioral Dyscontrol SF and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities SF. Caregivers will complete the following sections of the NeuroQOL: Satisfaction with Social Roles SF and Activities and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities SF.</description>

    <description>A self-reported generic HRQL assessment with 2 parts, the first containing 5 tick boxes (no problems, some problems, moderate problems, severe problems, cannot do) to select the most appropriate statement on each of its 5 domains (mobility, self care, usual activities, anxiety/ depression, and pain), and the second with a visual analogue scale ranging from &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; to &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot;. This version with 5 response levels is called the EQ-5D-5L.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of caregiver-reported (proxy) QOL in participants with dementia which assesses 2 domains: activity and affect. Activity is a 15-item questionnaire rated on opportunity (no/yes), frequency (none/few/often), and enjoyment (yes/no), with 5 items for outdoors activities and 10 items for home activities. Affect is a 6-item questionnaire, with 3 items for positive affects and 3 items for negative affects, referring to the previous 2 weeks, and scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = several [3+] times per day).</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria for Participants with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
        (bvFTD):

          -  Must speak and understand oral and written English.

          -  Must have probable bvFTD.

          -  Must have a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5-1 and a Mini Mental
             State Examination (MMSE) score ≥20 to reflect early stages of disease.

          -  Must have 1 informant/caregiver who, in the Investigator's judgment, has frequent and
             sufficient contact with the participant as to be able to provide accurate information
             about the participant's behaviors as well as cognitive and functional abilities.

          -  Must be ambulatory or able to walk with assistance and not be institutionalized.

        Key Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Participants:

          -  Must speak and understand oral and written English.

          -  Must be in good general health determined by Investigator.

        Key Exclusion Criteria for Participants with bvFTD:

          -  Concomitant motor neuron disease with limb or bulbar weakness which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, may affect performance over the course of the study. Participants
             with bvFTD with motor neuron disease are otherwise allowed to participate.

          -  Known presence of a structural brain lesion that could reasonably explain symptoms.

          -  Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and/or known presence of an Alzheimer's disease
             causing mutation in PSEN1, PSEN2 or APP; or neuropathological evidence for Alzheimer's
             disease as a cause of syndrome.

          -  History of other acute or chronic neurological or psychiatric conditions that are
             unrelated and may confound a diagnosis of bvFTD and that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may affect cognition, behavior, or ability to complete the study.

          -  History of severe alcohol or substance abuse.

          -  History of disorders that could confound a diagnosis of bvFTD.

          -  Use of allowed chronic medications at doses that have not been stable for at least 4
             weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Current use of psychoactive medication that will interfere with accurate assessment of
             cognition (as assessed by the Investigator)

        Key Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Participants:

          -  History of alcohol or substance abuse.

          -  Current use of psychoactive medication that will interfere with accurate assessment of
             cognition (as assessed by the Investigator).
