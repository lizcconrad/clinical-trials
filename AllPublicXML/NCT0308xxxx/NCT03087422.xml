      The investigators developed an app (called ChemotherApp) for Android that automatically sends
      text messages with homecare orientation to cancer patients in intervention group. The main
      features of this app are: to register information such as name, number of cellphone, gender,
      and chemotherapy schedule of the patient. Other feature is to register the orientation that
      will be sent to patients by text messages. Daily, the app send a registered orientation to
      each patient.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Chemotherapy Side Effects - QLQ-C30 EORTC questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 month</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the side effects, the QLQ-C30 EORTC questionnaire is going to be used. This questionnaire aims to identify if the patient had nausea and vomit, diarrhea, pain, fever, constipation, diarrhea, gas, among other symptoms. It will be investigated if patients who will receive the text message will have less side effects than patients who will not receive text messages. The questionnaire will be applied to each patient in the study at the beginning of the second,third and fourth cycles of chemotherapy.</description>

    <measure>Change from Anxiety and Depression - HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 month</time_frame>
    <description>To measure anxiety and depression, the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) questionnaire is going to be used. It will be investigated if patients who will receive the text message will have less score of depression and anxiety than patients who will not receive text messages. The HADS questionnaire is going to be applied to each patient on the first day of treatment and at the beginning of the fourth cycle of chemotherapy.</description>

    <measure>Change from ECOG (The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) scale - performance status - well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 month</time_frame>
    <description>ECOG (The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) scale will be used to evaluate the performance status,to measure the well-being. It will be investigated if patients who will receive the text message will have better performance status than patients who will not receive text messages. A performance status will be evaluated at the beginning of treatment and at the beginning of the second cycle of chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>The patients in this group will receive daily a text message (SMS) with some orientation about Homecare as an attempt to minimize the side effects of chemotherapy.
The text messages are based on oncology guidelines.The text messages contain information about water intake, emotional support, hygiene, immunity, nutrition, and physical activity. In addition, text messages about prevention and management of symptoms were also developed: nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, gas, changes in the skin and taste.
Also, the patients allocated in this group will receive the standard care.</description>
