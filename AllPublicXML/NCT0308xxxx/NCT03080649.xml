  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the excavation time, patients´ experiences, pulpal
      reactions and survival of fillings when carious tissue was removed with Er:YAG laser compared
      to rotary bur. A prospective, single-blind, randomized and controlled investigation was
      performed. Patients with at least two primary caries lesions radiographically assessed as the
      same size were recruited. In each patient one cavity was excavated with rotary bur and one
      with Er:YAG laser technique. The time requested for excavation and local anaesthesia were
      measured. The prevalence of postoperative symptoms, pulpal vitality and the quality of
      fillings will be investigated during two years after the excavation occasion.

      The study is a prospective, single-blind, randomized and controlled investigation. Patients
      between 15-40 years with at least two primary caries lesions radiographically assessed as the
      same size were recruited. In each patient one cavity was excavated with rotary bur and one
      with Er:YAG laser technique after a randomized allocation of the lesions to one of the
      intervention methods. The time requested for excavation to hard/firm dentin and local
      anaesthesia were measured. Directly after each treatment a questionnaire focusing on the
      experiences of the current treatment and if the laser method will be chosen in the future was
      answered. Postoperative pain was measured with a questionnaire one week after the treatment.
      Six, 12 and 24 months after the fillings were made an evaluation of pulpal status and the
      quality of the fillings will be performed.
