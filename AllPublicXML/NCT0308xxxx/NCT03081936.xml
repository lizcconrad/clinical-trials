    <textblock>
      This pilot study primarily aimed to compare effects of breast feeding, A1 versus A2®cow milk
      based formula on alimentation and gastrointestinal digestion. The impact of the study
      products on fecal myeloperoxidase (MPO), short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), secretory
      immunoglobulin A (sIgA) concentration, gastrointestinal tolerance, defecating habit and
      infant growth were also evaluated.
