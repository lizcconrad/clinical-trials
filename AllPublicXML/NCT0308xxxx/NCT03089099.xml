  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As prostate cancer progresses into castration-resistant stage from initial hormone-sensitive
      status, the biological behavior of tumor cells that dissociated from primary lesions changed.
      Considered a &quot;liquid biopsy,&quot; these circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can show how a patient's
      cancer responded to treatments. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      sequentially analyzing the expression of molecular markers in high volume circulating tumor
      cells in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients can predict the therapeutic
      effects and outcomes of these patients.
