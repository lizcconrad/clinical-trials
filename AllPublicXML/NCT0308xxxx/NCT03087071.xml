      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if panitumumab alone or in combination
      with trametinib can help to control advanced colorectal cancer. The safety of these drugs
      will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to 1 of 3 groups based on the results of the genetic testing done at screening.

        -  If participant is in Group 1 or 3, participant will receive panitumumab alone.

        -  If participant is in Group 2, participant will receive will receive panitumumab and
           trametinib.

      If participant is in Group 1 or 3 and the disease appears to get worse, participant may be
      able to cross-over to group 2 and begin to receive the panitumumab and trametinib combination
      therapy.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 14 days.

      Participant will receive panitumumab by vein over about 60-90 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.
      After the first dose, participant will be checked for side effects for about 60 minutes after
      the dose. If no intolerable side effects occur, participant's next dose will last about 30
      minutes and participant will be checked for side effects for 30 minutes afterward.

      If participant is in Group 2, participant will take trametinib by mouth 1 time every day.

      Participant should take the trametinib tablets in the morning at about the same time each
      day, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Participant should swallow the capsules
      with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. Participant should swallow each capsule whole (without
      chewing), one right after the other.

      At the end of each study cycle or if participant stops taking the study drug, participant
      should return any unused trametinib capsules to the study nurse.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue receiving the study drug(s) for as long as the doctor thinks it is
      in participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to receive the study
      drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is
      unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an eye exam.

        -  Participant will have a physical exam (Cycles 1-4, and every even-numbered cycle after
           that)

        -  Participant will have an EKG (Cycles 1-4, and every even-numbered cycle after that).

        -  Participant will have either an ECHO or MUGA scan (Cycles 2, 4, and 10, and then every 6
           cycles after that)

      On Day 10 of Cycle 2, if the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an eye exam.

      On Day 10 of Cycle 4 and every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 8, 12, 16, and so on):

        -  Participant will have a CT of participant's chest and CT/MRI of participant's abdomen
           and pelvis.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an eye exam.

      End of Treatment Visit:

      Within 28-35 days after participant's last dose of study drug, participant will have an
      end-of-treatment visit. The following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  Participant will have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan.

        -  Participant will have a CT scan of participant's chest and a CT scan or MRI of
           participant's abdomen and pelvis.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an eye exam.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months after the end of treatment visit, a member of the study staff will contact
      participant to ask how participant is doing. This contact will take place either during a
      regularly scheduled clinic visit or by phone. Each phone call should last about 10 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Panitumumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of colorectal cancer. Trametinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of melanoma. The combination of these drugs is considered investigational in
      the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.The study doctor can explain how the study drugs
      are designed to work.

      Up to 84 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
