  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restoration of anterior teeth using conservative approach allows clinicians to provide
      porcelain laminate veneers with excellent esthetics without extensive tooth structure
      removal. laminate veneers need the use of etch-able ceramics like glass ceramics (E.max) and
      hybrid ceramics (Lava Ultimate). The aim of this study is to compare both e.max and lava
      ultimate veneers clinically.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of E-max CAD well documented in the literatures as successful restoration modality
      which has superior optical and mechanical properties. The introduction of hybrid ceramic
      materials combined the advantages of both glass ceramics and composite resin. Resin
      nano-ceramic is a mixture of a resin composite matrix and nano-ceramic fillers of
      approximately 80% by weight. The main advantages of this material over the glass ceramics are
      the stress absorbing action or stress distribution by having modulus of elasticity near to
      the tooth dentin and can be individualized intra-orally or extra-orally, either before or
      after definitive cementation.

      Yet there are no studies for clinical evaluation of both mentioned laminate veneers
      restorations. This study is conducted to compare between both materials clinically according
      to modified USPHS criteria in terms of marginal adaptation, fracture, debonding, marginal
      discoloration and patient satisfaction.
