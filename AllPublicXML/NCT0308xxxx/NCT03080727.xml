  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The functional assessment of the hip joint is complex and challenging. Reproducible measures
      are necessary to identify changes in the structures and functionality of the hip joint over
      time and to evaluate the outcomes of treatments. A systematic evaluation process is critical
      to evidence-based practice. However, there are few studies investigating the reproducibility
      of these measures such as muscle strength, range of motion (ROM) and hip functionality in
      healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty subjects were randomized in two different days: (1) First evaluation of muscle
      strength, range of motion and single-leg squat performed by the evaluator 1; (2) Repeat the
      first evaluation with 3 different evaluators
