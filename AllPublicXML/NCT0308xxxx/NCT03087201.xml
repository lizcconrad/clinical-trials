  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, phase
      IIIb trial.

      Patients (≥18 years) with chronic tic disorders and Tourette syndrome will be recruited.

      The objective of the trial is to demonstrate that treatment with the cannabis extract
      nabiximols is superior to placebo in reducing tics and comorbidities in patients with
      Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders.
