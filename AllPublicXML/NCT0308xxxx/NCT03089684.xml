    <textblock>
      This NHANES analysis compares self-reported dietary folate with serum and red blood cell
      folate status in U.S. adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Public health concerns of both low and high folate status exist in the U.S.
      Recent publications have questioned the utility of self-reported dietary intake data in
      research and monitoring.

      Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to examine the relationship between self-reported
      folate intakes and folate status biomarkers, and to evaluate their usefulness for several
      types of applications.

      Design: Usual dietary intakes of folate were examined using the National Cancer Institute
      (NCI) method to adjust 2, 24-hour dietary recalls (including dietary supplements) for
      within-person variation and compared these intakes with serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate
      among 4,878 non-pregnant, non-lactating participants â‰¥19y in NHANES 2011-2012, a nationally
      representative, cross-sectional survey, with respect to consistency across prevalence
      estimates and rank order comparisons.
