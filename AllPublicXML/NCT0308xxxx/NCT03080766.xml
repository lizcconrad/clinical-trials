  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of diseases with distinct
      clinicopathologic features sharing in common an abnormal increase in myeloblasts in blood and
      bone marrow (BM). In about 5-10% patients, the myeloblasts exhibit chromosomal abnormalities
      (complex and/or monosomal karyotype, CK/MK*) that are associated with refractoriness to
      conventional chemotherapy and an extremely bad prognosis.

      Standard induction chemotherapy for AML comprises daunorubicin and cytarabine, the &quot;7+3&quot;
      regimen. However, treatment is largely ineffective for CK/MK AML with a temporary clearance
      of blasts achieved in only 30-40% cases and the cumulative toxicities resulting from repeated
      courses of chemotherapy have significantly increased the morbidity and mortality risks in
      subsequent allogeneic BMT. Therefore, standard treatment is unsatisfactory and there is an
      unmet clinical need for more effective and less toxic induction regimen.

      Both previous and recent studies showed that 10 day course of decitabine (20 mg/m2/day)
      induced remission in 70-100% patients with CK/MK AML, particularly those with TP53 mutations.
      In this study, patients with CK/MK AML will be treated with decitabine to induce remission.
      Bone marrow examination will be performed after each course until complete clearance of
      blasts or disease progression. Patients achieving CR/CRi (see below) will continue to receive
      4 more courses, after which patients eligible for BMT and for whom donors are available will
      receive curative BMT. We reckon that the time it takes for 4 courses of decitabine will
      suffice for transplantation workup in HK. . Patients ineligible for BMT will continue to
      receive decitabine until leukemia progression. The response rate, leukemia free survival
      (LFS), overall survival (OS) and percentage of patients who can be bridged to BMT will be
      compared with historical 7+3 regimen control.

      This is an open-label interventional study to study the use of decitabine as induction
      therapy for acute myeloid leukemia with complex and/or monosomal karyotype.

      Subjects will receive decitabine for every 28 days, until disease progression or a bone
      marrow transplantation is carried out, in the schedule as below:

      Cycle 1:

      Receive decitabine for 10 days

      Cycle 2 and Cycle 3:

      Based on the result of bone marrow examination, subjects may receive decitabine for 5 days or
      10 days

      Cycle 4 until disease progression:

      Rdecitabine for 5 days. Subjects may also resume a 10 day treatment after cycle 6 if their
      physician judged as appropriate.

      The drug will then be administrated intravenously.

      Blood will be drawn every 7 days and bone marrow extraction would be done on Day 28 (+/-
      3days) from the day 1 of each cycle of treatment for examination.

    <description>Decitabine is a white to almost white powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. It is supplied as a lyophilized preparation in a clear colorless 20ml glass vial containing 50 mg decitabine.
The concentrate should be aseptically reconstituted with 10 ml of water for injections. After reconstitution, the concentrate must be diluted within 15 minutes using cooled infusion fluids and completely administered to patients within 5 hours.
The drug will then be administrated intravenously.
Dosage 20 mg/m2
