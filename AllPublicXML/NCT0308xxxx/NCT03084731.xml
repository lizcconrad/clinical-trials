    <textblock>
      Burden: According to Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2014, prevalence of stunting in
      under-five children is 36%. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is prevalent in about 3% of them.
      In absolute numbers, about 450,000 children suffer from SAM while several million children
      suffer from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).

      Knowledge gap: Investigators have already demonstrated that children with SAM have immature
      gut microbiota that is partially corrected with treatment. Through our earlier studies
      conducted in Bangladesh,investigators now also have idea about beneficial microbiota and food
      ingredients that support proliferation of these beneficial microbiota. Which composite food
      is better for children with SAM and MAM is not known.

      Hypothesis (if any): The central hypothesis of our ongoing Breast Milk, Gut Microbiome and
      Immunity (BMMI) initiative proof of concept phase is that healthy growth in infancy and early
      childhood requires normal functional maturation of the gut microbiota. Related hypotheses are
      that (i) persistent defects in the development of this microbial 'organ' are causally related
      to stunting as well as the metabolic, immunologic and cognitive manifestations of
      undernutrition; and (ii) new approaches for durable repair of this microbiota immaturity
      including Microbiota-Directed Complementary Foods (MDCF) will provide a way to improve
      clinical outcomes.

      Objectives:

        1. Test 5 MDCF prototypes and nominate a lead MDCF formulation that has the greatest effect
           in promoting the representation of a broad range of age-discriminatory taxa and that has
           acceptable organoleptic properties. This nominated lead will be advanced to a fully
           powered clinical POC study in children with post-SAM MAM in 2018.

        2. Determine whether once daily administration is as effective as twice daily
           administration of the lead MDCF in repairing microbiota immaturity.

        3. Assess the durability of repair of immaturity by the lead MDCF by including a 4 week
           post-intervention phase in the final pre-POC study design.

        4. Determine what effect enteropathogen burden (determined by PCR-based analysis of fecal
           samples) has on responses of age-discriminatory taxa to MDCFs, and reciprocally, the
           effect of MDCFs on enteropathogen burden.

      Methods:

      Investigators will conduct 3 Pre-POC studies in 12-18 month old children with MAM
      (Weight-for-Length Z-score, WLZ: between &lt;-2 to -3) and stunting (Length-for-Age Z-score,
      LAZ: between &lt;-2 to -3) over the course of approximately two years. The investigators will
      use a stratified randomization procedure based on age (i.e.2 levels: 12-15 months and &gt;15-18
      months) to prevent imbalance between the treatment arms. This study will be undertaken at
      Mirpur area of Dhaka city. The investigators will design and produce 5 MDCF prototypes at the
      icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory in sufficient quantities for clinical studies (3 MDCF
      prototypes for study 1 and 2 MDCF prototypes for study 2). These formulations will be matched
      in energy density and micronutrient content of ready-to-use supplementary foods (RUSFs) used
      for MAM in Bangladesh and other countries, and will meet all other requirements for a
      complementary/supplementary food for 12-18 month old children with MAM and stunting.

    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct 3 Pre-POC studies among 12-18 month old children with MAM (WLZ &lt;-2
      to -3) and stunting (LAZ &lt;-2 to -3) over the course of approximately two years.

      Study design: Randomized controlled intervention trial.

      Study site: This study will be conducted at Bauniabadh, Mirpur in Dhaka city, which is a
      peri-urban slum area.

      Study participants: The study participants will be 12-18 months old children of either sex
      with MAM (WLZ: &lt;-2 to -3) and stunting (LAZ: &lt;-2 to -3).

      Initial screening and enrolment: Children will be screened and enrolled by household survey
      in section 11 of Mirpur by Field Research Assistants (FRAs) following pre-specified inclusion
      criteria. Fulfilling the enrolment criteria and upon receiving the consent for study
      participation from the parents or legal guardians, the children with the respective
      mother/caregiver will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the four arms according to
      computer-generated random numbers using permuted blocks of varied lengths of four and twelve
      for study 1. Similarly, children and mother/caregiver will be enrolled and randomly assigned
      to one of the three arms according to computer-generated random numbers using permuted blocks
      of block lengths of three and nine for study 2 and 3 respectively. The code of assigned type
      of MDCFs will be kept in closed opaque envelopes until assigned to an enrolled child.

      Feeding sessions: The children and mothers/caregivers will be requested to come to the
      nutrition centre established in the community at Mirpur preferably between 9 to 11 am and 3-5
      pm on day 1. The mothers will be requested not to give/allow any food and breast milk in the
      preceding 2 hours of observed meal time on the day of observed feeding. On the same day at
      the nutrition centre, the child will be offered 25 grams (in two meals preferably between
      9-11 am and 3-5 pm) of MDCFs as decided by random allocation. During the feeding time, the
      mothers will be asked to spoon feed the respective pre-weighed diets to their children until
      s/he refuses to eat further, as described below. After a two-minute pause, the same diet will
      be offered a second time until s/he refuses again. After a second two-minute pause, the diet
      will be offered a third time until refused again. After this third refusal, the feeding
      episode will be considered as 'terminated'.7 The duration of the feeding (excluding the
      intervening 'rest periods') will be recorded by stopwatch, and the total duration of the
      feeding will be noted. If the child demands more after finishing all the food, she/he will be
      offered the amount that was offered at the beginning. This feeding episode will last for
      maximum 60 minutes. Measured volumes of plain water will also be given and the amount of
      water taken during this 60 minutes meal period will be measured. The feeding episode will
      take place under the direct supervision of trained study personnel. Children will be
      considered as refusing further intake if they move their head away from the food, cry, clamp
      the mouth or clinch the teeth, or become agitated, spit out the food or refuse to swallow.8
      The amount of MDCF actually ingested will be calculated by subtracting the left over from the
      offered amount. Pre-weighed napkins will be provided; any food that is regurgitated, vomited
      or spilled will be swabbed, weighed and subtracted from the amount offered.

      Acceptability will be categorized as 'accepted eagerly' if they ate food readily, did not
      make any fuss, spit out, vomit or cry during the observed meal. Children will be categorized
      as 'accepted but not eagerly' if they ate the offered food but either made fuss, spit out,
      vomited or cried during the observed meal. The third category will be children who will not
      consume the offered food at all.9

      The amount of consumed food (g), energy (kcal) and category of acceptability will be
      analyzed. The enrolled children will be monitored by daily home visits by trained Field Field
      Research Assistants for any possible side effects/adverse events (e.g. rash, urticaria due to
      food allergy or any significant changes in clinical status) for a week. If any side
      effects/adverse events are observed then they will be treated according to the standard
      management provided at Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b. Perception and assessment of organoleptic
      characteristics of the assigned MDCFs by the respective mother/caregiver will also be
      assessed by using the 7-point Hedonic scale. Higher value, that is 7, will be ranked as 'like
      extremely' and lowest value 1 will be ranked as 'dislike extremely'.10

      At the beginning of the study, information will be sought on the demographic characteristics
      (families' wealth, standard of housing, family structure and parental characteristics etc.),
      and trained FRAs will record the children's nude weight using a digital scale with 2 g
      precision (Seca, model 728, Germany), length (using infantometer, Seca, model 416, Germany),
      and mid upper-arm circumference to the nearest mm (using a non-stretch insertion tape).
      Anthropometrics will be done according to the standard procedures and all measurements will
      be taken thrice and the middle one will be recorded. All interventions in each study will be
      administered to children at the Mirpur health clinic. Mothers/primary caregivers will be be
      advised to maintain their child's current dietary and breastfeeding practices.

      Pre-POC Studies 1 and 2 will each be 8 weeks in duration and have 4 and 3 arms respectively,
      with 12-15 children enrolled per arm with a minimum of 10 children per arm completing the
      study. There will be a 2 week run-in period to define pre-treatment MAZ, and additionally,
      enteropathogen burden will be assessed by PCR-based measurement of a broad range of
      gastrointestinal pathogens in the same fecal specimens used to calculate MAZ scores (these
      will not be used as screening tools for subsequent treatment). Children will be randomly
      assigned to one of the three arms. Efforts will be made to balance arms with respect to
      gender and stratify the randomization on age (e.g. 2 levels; 12-15 months and &gt;15-18 months).
      The treatment phase will be for 4-weeks, during which time each test product will be
      administered at the test center twice daily, separated by at least 6 hours. There will be a
      2-week post intervention phase in which 2 additional fecal samples samples will be collected
      (at the end of weeks 7 and 8) to assess changes in the microbiota that occur after cessation
      of treatment.

      Pre-POC Study 3 will have 3 arms. It will test the lead MDCF identified in study 2 and
      benchmark its efficacy at repairing microbiota immaturity compared to the current RUSF
      standard of care over a 4 week intervention period. We will examine the impact of 1x vs 2x
      per day dosing of the lead MDCF on efficacy in this study and also include a 4-week
      post-intervention period (with fecal sampling at the end of weeks 7, 8, 9 and 10) to assess
      the durability of changes in microbiota maturity after cessation of intervention and return
      to home diet.

      Fecal sample collection Weekly fecal samples (1-2g) will be collected within 30 minutes of
      production (at home and transported back to the icddr,b) using the N2 dry shipper specimen
      collection SOP used in the recent study of local RUTFs for the treatment of SAM (see Appendix
      A). Specimens will be stored at -80◦C before being sent to the Gordon Lab at the end of each
      study for rapid analysis of microbiota maturity (measured before, during and after cessation
      of treatment with each MDCF prototype) and PCR-based assessment of enteropathogen burden in
      fecal samples (measured before and after MDCF treatment). The relative abundance of each of
      the bacterial strains that were specifically targeted by the next generation MDCF will be
      determined through analysis of the 16S rRNA datasets (performed in the Gordon Lab and funded
      by the primary BMMI Project POC Phase grant)

      Proposed Pre-POC Studies

      Study 1: Test 3 prototype MDCFs and the current rice-lentil RUSF standard of care for MAM to
      establish the effect size of each on MAZ repair in a 4 week 2x /day intervention, with a 2
      week post-intervention phase to assess durability of MDCF-induced changes in the microbiota:

      Arm 1 - Current RUSF used for MAM, administered 2x /day for 4 weeks Arm 2 - Prototype MDCF1,
      administered 2x /day for 4 weeks Arm 3 - Prototype MDCF2, administered 2x /day for 4 weeks
      Arm 4 - Prototype MDCF3, administered 2x /day for 4 weeks

      Arm 1 - Rice-lentil based RUSF (rationale: reference standard of care for MAM; not designed
      based on knowledge of its effects on the gut microbiota or microbiota immaturity).

      Arm 2 - MDCF prototype with four complementary food ingredients plus powdered milk
      (rationale: lead with evidence from preclinical gnotobiotic models of repair of microbiota
      immaturity and positive effects on growth).

      Arm 3 - MDCF prototype with four complementary food ingredients without powdered milk
      (rationale: determine whether withdrawal of milk impacts the effects of the four
      complementary food ingredient combinations on the microbiota and host biomarkers).

      Arm 4 - MDCF prototype with two complementary food ingredients (chickpea and soy flour)
      without powdered milk (rationale: compare the efficacy of this formulation to that of the
      MDCF formulation containing four complementary food ingredients which is administered to
      group 3).

      Fecal sample collection:

      Fecal samples will be collected from each child at enrollment, 1 week after enrollment, at
      randomization (2 weeks) and weekly during the intervention and post-intervention phases.

      -Assuming 15 study participants / arm and 4 arms, a total of 540 fecal specimens will be
      collected in Study1.

      Blood sample collection:

      2 mL of blood samples each will be collected from every child prior to intervention and just
      after the intervention is complete.

      -Assuming 15 study participants /arms, a total of 120 blood samples will be collected in
      Study1.

      Study 2: Select most efficacious MDCF from study 1 and compare with 2 additional MDCF
      prototypes using the same design used in study 1:

      Arm 1 - 'Winner' from study 2 administered 2x /day for 4 weeks Arm 2 - Prototype MDCF4
      administered 2x /day for 4 weeks Arm 3 - Prototype MDCF5 administered 2x /day for 4 weeks

      Fecal sample collection:

      Fecal samples will be collected from each child at enrollment, 1 week after enrollment, at
      randomization (2 weeks) and weekly during the intervention and post-intervention phases.

      -Assuming 15 study participants / arm and 3 arms, a total of 405 fecal specimens will be
      collected in Study 2.

      Blood sample collection:

      2 mL of blood samples each will be collected from every child prior to intervention and just
      after the intervention is complete.

      - 15 study participants /arms, a total of 90 blood samples will be collected in Study 2.

      Study 3:

      Select lead MDCF from studies 1, 2 and conduct final 'bake-off' vs current RUSF and also
      examine the impact of 1x vs 2x per day administration with a 4 week post-intervention period
      to provide additional information on the durability of MDCF-sponsored changes in the
      microbiota:

      Arm 1 - Current RUSF used for MAM 2x /day for 4 weeks followed by a 4 week
      post-interventional phase Arm 2 - Lead MDCF identified in study 2, 2x /day for 4 weeks
      followed by a 4 week post-interventional phase Arm 3 - Lead MDCF identified in study 2, 1x
      /day for 4 weeks followed by a 4 week post-interventional phase

      Fecal sample collection:

      Feces would be collected weekly from each study participant during the course of the 8-week
      study including the 2 weeks prior to treatment, the four weeks during treatment and the two
      weeks following cessation of treatment (11 samples/ child).

      -Assuming 15 study participants / arm and 3 arms, a total of 495 fecal specimens will be
      collected in Study 3.

      Assuming a 8-week study duration (studies 1 and 2) and 8 weeks for shipping of fecal
      specimens to Washington University, extraction of DNA, PCR amplification of the V4 region of
      the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, sequencing of these amplicons and data analysis, each study
      cycle from completion of enrollment to completion of data analysis is anticipated to be 16
      weeks. With this cycle time, we anticipate being able to evaluate candidate MDCFs by the end
      of June 2017 and complete all 5 by the end of April 2018, at which point a lead MDCF will be
      nominated for the POC study.

      Information gathered will be used to select human fecal samples for transplantation into
      germ-free animals; these animals, who will be fed the diets of their human microbiota donors,
      will be used to further characterize the mechanisms that link MDCF prototypes, the gut
      microbiota, and host physiology/metabolism.

      Targeted Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and Gas
      Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) will be used to profile analytes of specific
      interest in plasma and/or fecal samples including bile acids and short chain fatty acids
      (SCFAs); markers of mitochondrial function (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate, acylcarnitines/acylCoAs,
      TCA cycle intermediates); amino acids in fecal samples [branch chain amino acids, tryptophan
      and tryptophan metabolites related to growth and inflammatory status, including those
      produced by bacterial tryptophan metabolism (e.g. indole acetic acid derivatives)].

      Blood sample collection:

      2 mL of blood samples each will be collected from every child prior to intervention and just
      after the intervention is complete.15 study participants / arm and 3 arms, a total of 90
      blood samples will be collected in Study 3.

      In order to construct a library of gut microbiota of healthy growing children of the same
      community, one spot fecal sample (1-2 gm) and spot blood sample (2 mL) will be collected from
      30 children each who would be aged 12-18 months of either sex, having WLZ and LAZ : &gt;-1. This
      will be done only after obtaining consent from the study participants.

      Through our initial lab work as well as earlier studies done on gnotobiotic animals in
      Washington University Centre for Genome Science has led us to suggest that a combination of
      food ingredients (chickpea, soy flour, peanut and green banana) with or without milk powder
      will be worth studying with respect to the diet's impact on stimulating proliferation of
      growth-discriminatory microbiota as well as cost and sustainability.

      Study participants will be asked to come to the designated feeding center daily for
      nutritional therapy to avoid the issue of food sharing. They will be provided with a phone
      number to reach the clinic staff, and a member of the staff may visit a family's household
      for directly observed nutritional therapy with prior arrangement if needed.

      Five day food frequency questionnaires will be completed at enrollment, prior to
      randomization and weekly during the entire study period.

      Preparation of different MDCFs:

      Preparation of complementary foods for Pre-POC clinical studies:

      Based on compatible combinations of complementary food ingredients identified in the
      preclinical studies described above, investigators will design and produce 5 MDCF prototypes
      at the icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory in sufficient quantities for clinical studies (3
      MDCF prototypes for Study 1, 2 MDCF prototypes for Study 2 and the qualified MDCF from Study
      2 for Study 3). These formulations will be matched in energy density and micronutrient
      content with ready-to-use supplementary foods (RUSFs) used for MAM in Bangladesh and other
      countries, and will meet all other local requirements for a complementary/supplementary food
      for 12-18 month old children with MAM and stunting. The icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory
      will also produce the current rice-lentil RUSF standard of care used for treatment of these
      children for use in studies 1 and 3.

      Development of the product

        1. Identification of food ingredients: Locally available food ingredients including those
           identified in the preclinical diet oscillation studies (e.g. chickpeas, soy flour,
           peanuts, raw banana, soybean oil, sugar and with and without milk powder) will be used
           to manufacture prototype MDCFs.

           MDCFs will be fortified with a premix of vitamins and minerals to meet the micronutrient
           requirements for supplementary foods in Bangladesh (see below).

        2. Experiments on recipe development: The theoretical formulation of MDCF components shall
           be made based on linear programming to identify the combinations of ingredients that
           would result in the most nutritious recipes. The energy density of MDCF is targeted at
           ~5 kcal/g, and caloric distribution is targeted to be 45-50 percent from fat and 8-12
           percent from protein. Based on expert opinion and consensus within the research team,
           micronutrient content shall be set to cover 70 percent of the requirements of Non SAM
           children aged 12-18 months. Experiments for developing recipes and preparation of
           samples will be done at icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory following a standardized
           production procedure to control the quality of MDCF from each production batch and
           ensure that no unexpected contamination and nutrient loss occur during processing. All
           the ingredients will be cleaned and sorted. Potential recipes shall be produced in small
           batches after (cooking/ steaming/ roasting as appropriate for each of the ingredients)
           and by mixing all ingredients in an electric blender. When necessary, consistency of the
           recipes shall be adjusted by varying the amount of dry ingredients and soybean oil.
           Furthermore, the combination of minerals and vitamins shall be adjusted if there is any
           unpleasant taste for addition of high dose(s) of micronutrients. A small amount (1
           percent) of soy lecithin shall be added to the recipe in order to improve the
           consistency and prevent oil separation.

        3. Assessment of organoleptic properties of the recipes: The new recipes will be assessed
           for appearance, flavor, consistency of the diets and overall degree of liking by using
           the 7-point Hedonic scale. Higher value, that is 7, will be ranked as 'like extremely'
           and lowest value of 1 will be ranked as 'dislike most'.

        4. Study of food safety and shelf life issues: Investigators will evaluate the stability of
           the product including microbiological quality to obtain key information needed for
           setting up initial 'best before' date and assess the stability of vitamin and mineral
           content and potential for oxidation. Standard microbiologic tests (total viable count,
           yeasts, moulds, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococci, Listeria
           monocytogenes, Cronobacter sakazaki) will be performed at the icddr,b Food Safety
           Laboratory.

        5. Finalization of 5 prototype MDCFs for the pre-POC clinical trials: Based on all of the
           above mentioned criteria, our team of researchers will select 5 MDCFs for acceptability
           trials. investigators will also estimate the cost/kg of the ingredients of the candidate
           MDCFs.

      Training of field staff Training will be provided to all field team members on different
      procedures regarding collection of stool samples. The training will be facilitated by core
      group of trainers as well as investigators of the study.

      Anthropometry:

      The age of the child will be verified against documentation (birth certificate or
      immunization card, if available) or caregiver's report of the child's birth date. Length will
      be measured by a infantometer sensitive to 0.1 cm (SECA, model no. 4161721009, Hamburg,
      Germany). Body weight will be measured by a balance sensitive to 2 g (SECA 7281321009,
      Hamburg, Germany). Length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ) and Weight-for-Age (WAZ)
      Z-scores will be calculated calculated following the Multicentre Growth Reference Study
      (MGRS) WHO growth standards 11. Edema will be examined by pressing the upper side of both
      feet for 3 seconds. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) will be measured using TALC MUAC tape
      (UK). Standardization of the measuring equipments: Regular standardization of the baby
      weighing scale, and the length/length board with a known weight and length will be done.

      Analyses of plasma and fecal samples

      Plasma samples collected this exploratory pre-POC study will be sent to Jeffrey Gordon's lab
      located in the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology at Washington University in St.
      Louis. Advanced mass spectroscopic- and immunoassay-based methods will be used to obtain new
      knowledge about the role of gut microbiota immaturity and the effects of attempting acute
      repair of this immaturity with lead microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes
      on biomarkers and mediators of healthy growth.

      This initial test of the effects of MDCFs on microbiota immaturity and host responses to
      dietary intervention will provide key datasets that will enable a power calculation for our
      planned proof of concept study in a larger population. In the current exploratory pre-POC
      each child in each group of 12-15 study participants will serve as his/her own control.
      Additional comparisons will be made within and across the four treatment groups (i.e., those
      consuming reference RUSF standard, and one of three different MDCF formulations).

      Feces would be collected weekly from each study participant during the course of the 8-week
      study including the 2 weeks prior to treatment, the four weeks during treatment and the two
      weeks following cessation of treatment. In addition, a 2 mL sample of blood would be obtained
      just prior to initiating the 4 week MDCF intervention and just as the 4-week long
      intervention is completed.

      Targeted Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and Gas
      Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) will be used to profile analytes of specific
      interest in plasma and/or fecal samples including bile acids and short chain fatty acids
      (SCFAs); markers of mitochondrial function (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate, acylcarnitines/acylCoAs,
      TCA cycle intermediates); amino acids in serum plus fecal samples [branch chain amino acids,
      tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites related to growth and inflammatory status, including
      those produced by bacterial tryptophan metabolism (e.g. indole acetic acid derivatives)].

      In addition, key mediators/biomarkers of linear growth (e.g., growth hormone and IGF-1),
      energy utilization (insulin, leptin), and bone biology [IL-6, osteoprotegerin, the C-terminal
      peptide of type I collagen (CTX, a marker of osteoclast activity/bone resorption), and the
      amino-terminal propeptide of Type 1 procollagen (P1NP, a marker of osteoblast activity/bone
      formation)], and systemic inflammation (CRP, AGP) will be quantified using established
      ELISA/Luminex assays.

      Information gathered will be used to select human fecal samples for transplantation into
      germ-free animals; these animals, who will be fed the diets of their human microbiota donors,
      will be used to further characterize the mechanisms that link MDCF prototypes, the gut
      microbiota, and host physiology/metabolism. In addition, these plasma and fecal biomarkers
      will be used to determine the features of our preclinical models are best correlated with
      responses in children; this knowledge will help inform the design of next generation MDCF
      prototypes with superior efficacy on growth outcomes.

      Sample size calculation:

      The primary outcome of this study will be the change in of Microbiota-for-Age Z (ΔMAZ) score
      after 4 weeks of intervention.. Our previous work5 showed that the mean MAZ of 18-month-old
      children with MAM was -1.60+0.36 (SEM) while for age-matched healthy children, the mean MAZ
      was -0.52+0.22, with a difference between means of 1.08+0.41. Using R's power.t.test function
      for a paired t-test (i.e. pairing samples from a child before and after intervention), with
      and assumed SD of 1 and a one-sided hypothesis, 15 children in each arm will enable us to
      capture an improvement in MAZ of &gt;0.7 with 80% power and a significance threshold of 0.05.
      Investigators therefore anticipate being sufficiently powered to confidently detect a change
      in MAZ of the magnitude that distinguished the microbiota of healthy children from that in
      children with MAM in our prior study

      Data analysis :

      Data analysis will be done with the same approach used for calculating microbiota maturity
      and the application of these tools in a prior RUTF intervention study treating children with
      SAM at icddr,b5.

      The primary outcome measure in each study is the mean treatment-induced change in MAZ score
      from baseline for each arm in the study. Differences (95% CI) between the means of treatment
      arms will be assessed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD or similar post hoc test
      (when appropriate). The MDCF prototype with the greatest mean effect size the in these
      pre-POC studies, and acceptable organoleptic properties will be selected for the follow-on
      POC clinical trial to examine clinical outcomes in children with post-SAM MAM.
