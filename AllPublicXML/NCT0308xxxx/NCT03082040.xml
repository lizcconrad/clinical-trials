  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, triple-blinded and randomized controlled trial examining the effects
      of a home-based breathing training assisted with biofeedback on menopausal symptoms and
      autonomic functions among community menopausal women. We also examines whether the changes in
      autonomic functions would be mediators between slow breathing and menopausal symptoms. This
      study will include menopausal women, aged from 45 to 64, who experienced menopausal symptoms.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 80) or a
      waiting-list control group (n = 80). The intervention group will undergo the home-based
      breathing training 20 minutes twice daily and participants in the control condition will
      participate the same breathing training after a four-week waiting list period. The primary
      outcome measures are menopausal symptoms measured by symptom diaries of menopausal symptoms
      and the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS). Secondary outcome measures are autonomic functions
      expressed by blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV).
      Measurements will be taken at baseline, week 4, and week 8.
