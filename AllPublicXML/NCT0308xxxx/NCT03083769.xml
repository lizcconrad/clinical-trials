    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether functional genetic variants can affect
      tacrolimus dose corrected trough levels and associate with the side effects in Chinese renal
      transplantation and liver transplantation.

      Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressive drug widely used in solid organ transplantation
      to prevent rejection. It is characterized by a narrow therapeutic range and large inter- and
      intra- individual variability in its pharmacokinetics. Many factors are associated with the
      variability. Of these factors, genetic factor play an important role. Full understanding of
      this mechanism is important for the personalized use of tacrolimus and reducing the risk of
      side effects.The CYP3A5*3 (A6986G) resulting in a splicing defect and the absence of protein
      activity, was identified as a functional variant (Kuehl P.2001). The CYP3A4*1G was also
      reported as a functional variant (Richards-Waugh LL. 2014). In addition, other functional
      variants will also be identified and analyzed in our project.

      Our project has two parts:first, retrospective study, 1000 renal patients from two centers
      (two cohort, each from one center) using tacrolimus as immunosuppressive drug were recruited.
      In the two cohort, functional genetic variants that can affect the dose corrected tacrolimus
      trough levels will be identified. Second, prospective study, in this part, there are two
      cohorts, renal transplantation cohort and liver transplantation cohort. For renal
      transplantation cohort, all the patients will be stratified to different groups according to
      the different genotypes. The side effects (acute rejection, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity)
      will be observed. For liver transplantation cohort, all the patients will be stratified to
      different groups according to the different donors' genotypes and the side effects (acute
      rejection, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity) will also be observed. During the study period,
      all the therapeutic procedures of the patients are as usual.

      This will be the largest cohort of this kind of study in Chinese population. The findings
      will be useful for the patients to improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the side
      effects.
