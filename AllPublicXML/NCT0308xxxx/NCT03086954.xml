  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open, single-arm,multicenter 2 phase clinical study will treat the patient who have CD19
      positive lymphoma with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically
      modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)that will bind to tumour cells modified
      to express the CD19 protein on the cell surface. The study will determine if these modified T
      cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells .The trial will also study the
      safety of treatment for CAR-T, how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body and the impact
      on this treatment for survival.

    <textblock>
      This is an open, single-arm,multicenter 2 phase clinical study to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) in the treatment of CD19
      positive lymphoma. The study will be conducted using a phaseⅠ/Ⅱdesign the study will have the
      following sequential phases: part A (screening, leukapheresis, cell product preparation and
      cytoreductive chemotherapy) and part B (treatment and follow-up). The follow-up period for
      each participant is approximately 35 months after the final CAR-T infusion. The total
      duration of the study are expected to be approximately 3 years. A total of 24 patients may be
      enrolled over a period of 3 years.
