    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test clinical strategies that pediatric providers may use to
      prevent misuse and diversion of stimulants by their adolescent patients with ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the increase in diversion (selling, sharing, loaning, or trading) of
      prescription stimulant medications by adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD). In the absence of any standardized, empirically evaluated clinical
      strategies or interventions to prevent or decrease stimulant diversion, this project will
      test the effect of a brief provider-led intervention for stimulant diversion prevention among
      adolescents being prescribed stimulant medication in pediatric care. The investigators
      hypothesize that adolescents treated in pediatric practices randomized to the intervention
      will report decreased diversion, increased perceived risk of harm, and decreased intentions
      to divert compared to adolescents treated in pediatric practices randomized to
      treatment-as-usual. Secondary analyses will examine the effect of the intervention on
      additional contributing variables (e.g., patient, parent, and provider attitude and behavior
      change).
