  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, observer-blinded, investigative trial is to determine if the
      use of electrical stimulation, compared to the traditional loss of resistance technique
      alone, improves the success rate of epidural catheter placement at an academic teaching
      institution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a thoracic epidural catheter placement at the level appropriate for
      their surgery and will be randomized to either have the epidural placed with a loss of
      resistance technique alone or loss of resistance technique with confirmation by nerve
      stimulation. In the traditional loss of resistance technique group, the epidural catheter
      will be placed after achieving loss of resistance to air. In the electrical stimulation
      group, following the location of the epidural space with a loss of resistance technique
      (using air), nerve stimulation will be utilized to elicit a myotomal contraction of the
      abdominal or thoracic wall. Nerve stimulation will be started at a pulse width of 0.3 ms and
      a frequency of 1 Hz and a current of 0.2mA.

    <description>will be determined by the detection of a loss of sensation to cold (ice) in at least two contiguous dermatomal levels, 15 minutes after administration of a test dose of lidocaine through the epidural catheter. If a loss of cold sensation is found, then the epidural placement will be classified as successful. If no loss of cold sensation is found, then the epidural placement will be classified as unsuccessful.</description>
