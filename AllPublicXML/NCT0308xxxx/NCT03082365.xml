  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients with chronic kidney disease suffer from many oral problems affecting the quality
      of life. The aim of our study is to assess their oral health to provide the proper management
      and increase their awareness

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be held in the Nephrology units at the Kasr Al-Ainy Cairo university hospital.

      The data collected through the questionnaire will be obtained through an interview between
      the investigator and the patient. Clinical examination will be performed for both oral (soft
      tissue) and dental (hard) tissue. For patients undergoing dialysis, examination will be
      performed before dialysis therapy Selection bias: will be minimized by enrolling the
      participants in the study in a consecutive order of the entering the clinic.

      Non-respondent bias: will be minimized by explaining to the participants the aim of the study
      and their importance and role in the study.

      Incomplete records: will be excluded from statistical analysis with reporting the cause of
      not completing the record.

      Using a precision of 5, a design effect set at 1 with 90% CI (confidence interval), a total
      sample size of 250 pre-dialysis patients and 200 end stage renal disease patients will be
      sufficient. The sample size was calculated by Epi info software.The sample will be divided
      between two researchers; each researcher will have 50% of the whole sample to collect
