      This research study is studying immunotherapy in combination with radiation therapy as a
      possible treatment for head &amp; neck cancer that has worsened or spread to another organ or
      part of your body.

      The immunotherapy involved in this study is: MK-3475 (pembrolizumab or KEYTRUDA).

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational treatment to learn whether the treatment works in
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the treatment is being studied.

      MK-3475 is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in
      the body in response to a foreign substance (particles not typically found in the body such
      as bacteria or viruses). Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection.
      Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients. MK-3475 is
      designed to restore the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target cancer
      cells.

      The FDA recently granted approval to MK-3475 as a treatment for patients with recurrent or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study is testing whether using
      radiation in combination with MK-3475 will make this drug work better in participants that
      might otherwise be unlikely to benefit from this drug because they have not responded to
      either this same drug given without radiation or another similar drug.

             metastatic disease considered incurable by local therapies. Patients without
             pathologic or cytologic evidence of metastatic disease should have unequivocal
             evidence of metastasis from physical examination or radiologic evaluation.

          -  Patients must have evidence of radiologic or clinical disease progression during
             previous treatment with systemic PD-1 directed therapy, or have stable disease on
             prior PD-1 therapy (at least 6 doses) and/or have been deemed not to derive clinical
             benefit from PD-1 directed treatment.

          -  Patients must have least 3 measurable non-CNS based lesions that have not previously
             been irradiated. Palliative radiation must be potentially indicated for at least one

          -  Patients must agree to undergo a research biopsy, if tumor is accessible, at baseline
             (mandatory) and at the end of cycle 2 of pembrolizumab (optional). .

          -  Prior systemic therapy: Patients must be at least 2 weeks from prior chemotherapy,
             biological agents, immunotherapy or any investigational drug product, with adequate
             recovery of toxicity. For investigational agents, the minimum time from prior therapy
             is 5 half-lives if this is longer than 2 weeks in duration.

          -  Prior radiation therapy: Patients must be at least 2 weeks from prior radiation

                  upper limit of normal unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, as long
                  as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.

               -  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal
                  unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, as long as PT or PTT is within

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic disease impinging on the spinal cord or threatening spinal cord
             compression.

          -  Surgical fixation of bone lesion to be irradiated is required and indicated to provide
             mechanical stability.

          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control
             symptoms. Participants with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they
             have completed treatment at least 2 weeks prior to trial therapy initiation, are
             neurologically stable, and have recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy or
             surgery. Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued
             without the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the initiating
             protocol therapy. Treatment for brain metastases may include surgery, whole brain
             radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating
             physician.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to pembrolizumab or previous toxicity attributed to pembrolizumab or other
             PD-1 directed therapy that led to drug discontinuation.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality, including a marked
             Baseline prolonged QT/QTc ([QT interval/corrected QT interval], e.g., a repeated
             demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;500 ms).

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because immunotherapy has the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             immunotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this
             protocol.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances: if they have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are
             deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; or if
             diagnosed and treated for cervical cancer in situ or basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin.

          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for interaction between immunotherapy and these medications.

          -  Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of
             interstitial lung disease or active, non infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Active, suspected or prior documented autoimmune disease that has required systemic
             treatment in the last 2 years with immune modifying agents (e.g. replacement therapy
             such as thyroxine, insulin or physiologic corticosteroids is not an exclusion
             criteria).

          -  The subject is known to be positive for HepBsAg, or HCV RNA.

          -  Lack of availability for follow up assessments.

          -  The investigator's belief that the subject is medically unfit to receive pembrolizumab
             and or unsuitable for any other reason.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy
