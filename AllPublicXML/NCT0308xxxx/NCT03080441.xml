      This is a research study to test the application of FDA-approved, non-invasive device (NICaS)
      that measure the performance of your heart during HD treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) events, reported to occur in 15% to 50% of
      hemodialysis (HD) treatments, is still high despite major technical advances in HD
      technology. By definition, excessive reduction in intravascular volume by ultrafiltration and
      limited vascular refilling from tissues into the vascular space is the cause of IDH. Chronic
      HD patients exhibit a high prevalence of peripheral vascular and cardiac abnormalities.
      Specifically, hemodynamic instability during HD can occur due to insufficient reduction in
      venous unstressed volume, poor diastolic filling under reduced atrial pressures associated
      with diastolic dysfunction, altered cardiac contractility, and impaired vascular reactivity.
      An IDH event can lead to myocardial cerebral and other organ ischemia. Long- and short-term
      adverse outcomes have been associated with IDH, a common HD complication and significant
      cause of morbidity.

      Recent pilot studies suggest that in IDH-prone subjects, measurements of hemodynamic
      variables during HD can be used to categorize the hemodynamic response into three subgroups:
      cardiac power index (CPI) reduction with stable total peripheral resistance (TPR), TPR
      reduction with stable CPI, and reduction in TPR and CPI groups. It is hypothesized that
      targeted intervention for each subgroup can reduce IDH.
