  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 2 Study to evaluate SHR-1210(anti-PD-1
      antibody) as second-line therapy in in adult Chinese patients with advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer who failed or progressed to prior first-line systemic treatment.

      Enrolled subjects will be assigned to 4 cohorts on the basis of PD-L1 expression in tumor
      cells(&lt;1%, ≥1%-25%, ≥25%-50%, ≥50%) all will be treated with the standard SHR-1210 dose
      (200mg) , Q2W, until documented progressive disease (PD) occurs. Subjects will return to the
      clinic once every two weeks. Radiographic disease assessments will be performed every 6
      weeks.

      The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with SHR-1210 improves Objective Response Rate
      when compare with standard of care (SOC), no matter how much PD-L1 expression in tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In similar clinical trials, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies produce durable responses in
      approximately 20% of unselected patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Developing
      reliable, validated biomarkers that identify patients with an increased probability of
      response to these antibodies remains a challenge.

      Because the PD-1 pathway may be a key mechanism of immune escape in a subgroup of patients
      with non-small-cell lung cancer, PD-L1 expression in tumor or inflammatory cells is a
      candidate biomarker. However, PD-L1 expression has not been formally validated as a biomarker
      in contemporaneously collected tumor tissue.

      Additionally the purpose of the study is to assess the correlation between the expression of
      PD-L1 in the tumor and the response to treatment with SHR-1210 in non-small cell lung cancer.
