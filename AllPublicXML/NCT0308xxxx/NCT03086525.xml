  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain is highly prevalent, disabling, and with high socio-economic costs, with
      many negative effects on quality of life. It affects the ability to perform work, social,
      recreational and domestic tasks, changing the mood and concentration of this population.
      Despite the worldwide prevalence and socioeconomic burden of this condition, a clear
      understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis remains elusive.

      Aims:

      (i) to analyze the possible level of association between fear of pain, fear of movement,
      self-efficacy, and pain acceptance on pain-disability at the start of the study and
      prospectively evaluate its role as a risk factor; (ii) to evaluate the possible role as a
      prognostic factor of fear of pain, fear of movement, self-efficacy and pain acceptance in
      those who develop musculoskeletal pain at follow-up; (iii) explore the possible mediating
      power of fear of movement and self-efficacy in the relationship between pain-disability; (iv)
      investigate what percentage of the variance accounts for beliefs (fear of pain, fear of
      movement, self-efficacy, and acceptance of pain) in predicting the onset and / or maintenance
      of musculoskeletal pain.

      The present study will be a prospective observational study of 4 years that will be carried
      out between September 2017 and September 2020 at the University of Malaga. Several
      questionnaires assessing different beliefs associated with pain will be administered to
      participants. The results will be evaluated at baseline (t1) and in 4 follow-ups (at 12 (t2),
      24 (t3), 36 (t4) and 48 (t5) months. It will be implemented and reported in line with the
      SPIRIT statement and the STROBE guidance.

      Participants A consecutive sample of healthy male and female students, students of the
      University of Málaga, will be recruited. Research assistants trained by the principal
      investigator will be in charge of carrying out the recruitment and evaluating the
      participants for their eligibility. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be
      invited to participate in this study, and then evaluated at baseline and at 12, 24, 36 and 48
      months of follow-up. The inclusion criteria are as follows: (i) men / women over 18 years;
      (ii) students of the University of Málaga belonging to one of the disciplines previously
      mentioned. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (i) participants currently experiencing
      musculoskeletal pain; (ii) participants currently taking medication; (iii) previous histories
      of musculoskeletal surgery; (Iv) inability to provide written informed consent and / or
      complete questionnaires.
