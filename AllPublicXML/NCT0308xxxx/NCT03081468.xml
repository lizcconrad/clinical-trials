  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In current, clinical ophthalmology, a range of specialised testing allows comprehensive
      evaluation of ocular health. These tests have typically evolved over many years to ensure
      their clinical validity. For example, the assessment of visual acuity has traditionally been
      measured with Snellen letter charts from a distance of six metres (20 feet), leading to the
      phrase &quot;20/20 vision&quot;. Despite this, the limitations of Snellen testing are well established
      and more sophisticated testing is now available (e.g., logMAR testing using ETDRS (Early
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts). Many other diagnostic tests have undergone
      similar cycles of refinement, often over extended time periods. Therefore, it should be
      incumbent on any new device to undergo detailed evaluation of its validity (how its
      measurements agree with other testing) and its repeatability (the variability when a further
      measurement is obtained in short time period, by the same operator and under the same
      conditions).

      Binocular OCT extends the application of OCT devices beyond that of simple, cross- sectional
      imaging to a diverse array of diagnostic tests. The binocular design also removes the need
      for additional personnel to perform testing (i.e., the device can be self-operated in an
      automated manner), and allows for novel testing to be performed that is not possible with
      monocular imaging. In particular, binocular OCT devices have the potential to perform
      automated, quantitative pupillary measurements - an entirely novel application for this
      imaging modality.

      This study will assess the validity and repeatability of pupil measurements using binocular
      OCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binocular OCT has the potential to allow for objective, quantitative measurement of pupillary
      reflexes, that can be performed in a fast, safe, and automated manner. Importantly, binocular
      OCT pupillometry can be performed alongside binocular retinal OCT imaging in a single testing
      session, in an automated manner (imaging of the retina using OCT is the commonest ophthalmic
      imaging procedure worldwide - in 2011, it is estimated that more than 20 million retinal OCT
      images were obtained, more than the sum of all other ophthalmic imaging procedures combined).

      Assessment of pupillary reflexes is an essential component of a comprehensive ocular
      examination. In patients with visual loss, for example, detection of an RAPD often indicates
      the presence of serious ophthalmic diseases, such as optic neuropathies or severe retinal
      disease. As such, RAPD testing is essential as a screening test in the assessment of patients
      with less serious conditions such as cataract.

      RAPD testing is commonly performed using the swinging flashlight method (SFM). A positive SFM
      test suggests the presence of asymmetric damage involving the afferent limb of the pupillary
      light reflex pathway. The SFM is a qualitative test, and relies upon visualising no pupillary
      constriction or immediate or delayed pupillary dilation; if either of these responses is
      observed, an RAPD is believed to be present. The SFM requires a trained examiner and many
      potential sources of error may confound the results, including anisocoria, off-axis pupil
      illumination, and unequal retinal bleaching. Pupil abnormalities may be subtle and easily
      missed using the SFM.

      Automated pupilometers allow examiners to precisely and objectively quantify the pupillary
      response to light by measuring parameters such as minimum and maximum pupil diameter, the
      amplitude of constriction, latency of constriction, velocity of constriction, and duration of
      maximum constriction. Dedicated pupillometry devices are commercially available and have been
      shown to be highly sensitive and specific for RAPD detection e.g. RAPDx; Konan Medical USA,
      Inc., Irvine, CA. These devices are also capable of detecting the presence of more subtle
      RAPD, typically not found using the SFM, in diseases such as glaucoma.

      Unfortunately, automated pupilometers such as the Konan RAPDx system are not widely used in
      clinical practice. This is largely because they are expensive devices, limited to a single
      purpose. A binocular OCT system that could perform both automated pupillometry and retinal
      OCT imaging would thus have great clinical utility.
