  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BIOLUMA is a multicentric non-randomised phase II trial in patients with non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Cohort 1) and patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)
      (Cohort 2) after failure of platinum-based first-line therapy. NSCLC patients are treated
      with nivolumab until disease progression and subsequently receive a combination therapy of
      nivolumab and ipilimumab. SCLC patients receive four cycles of nivolumab in combination with
      ipilimumab and subsequent nivolumab monotherapy. Primary endpoint for both cohorts is overall
      response rate of combination therapy.

      Within the diagnostic part tumor biopsies will be analysed. Tumor tissue will be obtained
      before initiation of therapy and after progression on nivolumab monotherapy before addition
      of ipilimumab in Cohort 1 and after completion of the four nivolumab/ipilimumab combination
      cycles before continuation of nivolumab monotherapy in Cohort 2, respectively. Flow cytometry
      of blood samples and microbiome analysis of deep rectal swaps are performed prior to therapy
      as well as during course of treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>The treatment period is subdivided in Treatment Part A and B which differ between the two cohorts:
Cohort 1 (non-squamous NSCLC):
During Treatment Part A nivolumab 240 mg IV q2w as monotherapy is administered. At time of disease progression another re-biopsy is mandatory before initiation of combination therapy (Treatment Part B). Within Treatment Part B, nivolumab is given in a dose of 3 mg/kg q2w together with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV q6w.
2. Cohort 2 (SCLC): Within Treatment Part A, nivolumab 1 mg/kg q3w together with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg q3w for a total of four doses is administered. After the four combined doses have been administered, another re-biopsy is mandatory before initiation of Treatment Part B. In Treatment Part B, nivolumab 240 mg q2w monotherapy is administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</intervention_model_description>
