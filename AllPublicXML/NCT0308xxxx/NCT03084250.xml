      The CHB subjects who are cirrhosis, will be randomized to two groups.

      The subjects who go into group A will be treated by nucleotide analogue (NA) combination with
      peginterferon alfa-2a,180μg/week for 48 weeks.

      The subjects who go into group B will be treated by nucleotide analogue (NA) only for 48

             unsuitable for the study;

         18. History of thyroid disease poorly controlled on prescribed medications;

         19. Evidence of severe retinopathy or clinically relevant ophthalmologic disorder;

         20. History of other severe disease or evidence of other severe disease or any other
             illness or conditions that the investigator believe that patients are not suitable to
             join in the study;

         21. Patients included in another trial or having been given investigational drugs within
             12 weeks prior to screening;
