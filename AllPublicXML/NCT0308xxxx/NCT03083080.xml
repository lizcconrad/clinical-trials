  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, video-assisted thoracic surgery is performed under general anesthesia with
      double-lumen endotracheal tube. However, the complications associated with this large tube as
      well as inhalation anesthetics are frequently reported. Therefore, currently there is a trend
      toward non-intubated anesthesia methods for video-assisted thoracic surgery, which includes
      thoracic epidural block, peripheral nerve block, local anesthesia, local combined with
      peripheral nerve block, etc. Thoracic epidural block demands a high technique, but still
      risks catastrophic neurological complications in case of accidental dural puncture. Local
      anesthesia, perhaps more straightforward, however may need supplemental analgesia during
      incision, which will inevitably interrupt surgery and negatively affect the patients. This
      study aims to apply ultrasound guidance during local anesthetic injection for local
      anesthesia-based video assisted thoracic surgery, which helps inject the local anesthetic
      into the key intercostal nerve plane to provide more specific and precise blockade, thus
      avoiding the chance of blind injection. At the same time, ultrasound guidance has the
      potential to reduce the risk of systemic toxicity, prolong the duration of analgesia
      postoperatively, and facilitates postoperative recovery.
