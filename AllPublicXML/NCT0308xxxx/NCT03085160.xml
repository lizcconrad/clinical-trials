  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests there is a connection between mood and weight. People who feel stressed or
      depressed are more likely to be overweight than people who don't have these feelings. Some
      individuals turn to food to cope, which can lead to gaining too much weight over time.
      Adolescence is an important time to understand these connections. Patterns of handling stress
      learned during adolescence set the stage for stress management in adulthood. This study is a
      randomized controlled pilot study with 60 adolescents who are at-risk for future, chronic
      obesity. The investigators will test if taking part in a 6-week group program to lower stress
      and improve mood will be helpful to teens at-risk.
