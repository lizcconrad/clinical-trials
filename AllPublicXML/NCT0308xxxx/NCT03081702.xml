  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study to find the highest dose of hydroxychloroquine that can be given
      safely with itraconazole in patients with advanced platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian
      cancer. The study will also determine the safety, tolerability, and initially determine
      whether the combination is useful in the treatment of patients with advanced
      platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years or older.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer.

          -  Platinum-resistant or refractory disease defined as a radiological or clinical
             progression less than six months after having finished platinum-based chemotherapy.

          -  ECOG performance status equal to or less than 1.

          -  Have clinically or radiographically documented measurable disease.

          -  All systemic therapy must have been completed 4 weeks or greater prior to enrollment
             with radiologic evidence of radiological disease progression.

          -  Life expectancy should be more than 3 months.

          -  Receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are
             ineligible.

          -  Acceptable laboratory requirements within 7 days prior to enrollment

          -  Treated and asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible. Patients that received
             palliative radiation (for brain metastases) are eligible if they have been
             asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks with use of maintenance steroid therapy, and last
             received radiation at least 4 weeks prior to start of therapy.

          -  Have the ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have not recovered (grade 1 or less) from adverse events related to previous
             treatments are excluded with the exception of alopecia and lymphopenia. Peripheral
             sensory neuropathy must be at grade 2 or less.

          -  Have any other prior malignancy from which the patient has been disease free for less
             than 3 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous
             cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of any site or any
             other cancer.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to itraconazole or hydroxychloroquine.

          -  Known G6PD deficiency due to the risk of hemolytic anemia with the use of
             hydroxychloroquine.

          -  Known retinopathy due to the risk of worsening retinopathy with hydroxychloroquine.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Chronic Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections should be excluded because of potential
             effects on hepatic function and/ or drug interactions.

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Already have a clinical indication for treatment with itraconazole (e.g. chronic
             candidiasis or other fungal infection) or hydroxychloroquine (e.g. lupus).
