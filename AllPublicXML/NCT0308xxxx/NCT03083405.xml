      Sleep apnea is a common and serious health problem in the Polish population. According to
      epidemiological data problem concerns about 7% of the adult population. The most common sleep
      disorder is obstructive sleep apnea (OBS). The consequence of episodes of airway obstruction
      and sleep fragmentation is an inefficient, lack of rest sleep, pathological daytime
      sleepiness, falling asleep involuntarily, awakening with feelings of shortness of breath or
      throttling. The direct consequences of sleep apnea are hypoxia, awakening, increased heart
      rate and increased blood pressure. Frequent complications of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      are hypertension, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension
      and heart failure. An additional problem in patients with sleep apnea is an increased
      incidence of bruxism. It is one of the most common oral parafunctions. Bruxism is a common
      problem; reports of prevalence range from 8-31% in the general population. The most common
      symptoms of bruxism include: hypersensitive teeth, tooth wear, damage to dental restorations
      (e.g. crowns and fillings), damage to periodontal and oral mucosa, masticatory muscle pain
      and headaches. The etiology of bruxism is multifactorial and not fully understood. It can be
      caused by local and general factors. The main general factors may be stress, emotional
      disturbances and mental, neurological, hormonal disorders (eg. Hyperthyroidism),
      gastrointestinal disease, allergies, medications, smoking, sleep disorders and snoring.
      Arousals during the apnea episodes are considered to be a major cause of sleep bruxism. The
      relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and sleep bruxism is still not clearly defined.
      Further research is needed to help explain the relationship between these two phenomena,
      which will enable further therapy in patients with coexisting OSA and sleep bruxism (SB).

      1. Introduction Sleep apnea is a common and serious health problem in the Polish
           population. According to epidemiological data problem concerns about 7% of the adult
           population. The most common sleep disorder is obstructive sleep apnea (OBS). The
           essences of OBS are episodes of airway obstruction repeated many times during sleep. As
           a result the oxygen level in blood decreases. The result of increased muscle tension of
           upper respiratory tract and throat vibrations is a very loud snoring restoring breath.
           Episodes of apnea with arousals cause sleep fragmentation, shortage of deep sleep and
           rapid eye movement (REM). Such episodes occur repeatedly, several, or even dozens of
           times per hour of sleep. The consequence of episodes of airway obstruction and sleep
           fragmentation is an inefficient, lack of rest sleep, pathological daytime sleepiness,
           falling asleep involuntarily, awakening with feelings of shortness of breath or
           throttling. Fragmentation of sleep and repeated episodes of hypoxia result in
           deterioration of quality of life, chronic fatigue and an increased risk of communication
           accidents.

           The direct consequences of sleep apnea are hypoxia, awakening, increased heart rate and
           increased blood pressure. Frequent complications of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are
           hypertension, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, pulmonary
           hypertension and heart failure. If left untreated, OSA contributes to the development of
           vascular endothelial dysfunction and increases the risk of premature death, especially
           in men under age of 50.

           An additional problem in patients with sleep apnea is an increased incidence of bruxism.

           Bruxism is excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching. It is an oral parafunctional
           activity with the background of increased activity of masticatory muscles. It is one of
           the most common oral parafunctions. Bruxism is a common problem; reports of prevalence
           range from 8-31% in the general population. The most common symptoms of bruxism include:
           hypersensitive teeth, tooth wear, damage to dental restorations (e.g. crowns and
           fillings), damage to periodontal and oral mucosa, masticatory muscle pain and headaches.
           Symptoms of bruxism may go unnoticed for a long time, which implies that patients often
           don't know about their disorder. There are two different types of bruxism: Sleep Bruxism
           (SB) and Awake Bruxism (AB). Type SB consists of involuntary, episodic and rhythmic
           activity of masticatory muscles (Rhythmic Masticatory Muscle Activity / RMMA).

           The etiology of bruxism is multifactorial and not fully understood. It can be caused by
           local and general factors. The main general factors may be stress, emotional
           disturbances and mental, neurological, hormonal disorders (eg. Hyperthyroidism),
           gastrointestinal disease, allergies, medications, smoking, sleep disorders and snoring.
           Arousals during the apnea episodes are considered to be a major cause of sleep bruxism.

           The relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and sleep bruxism is still not clearly
           defined. Further research is needed to help explain the relationship between these two
           phenomena, which will enable further therapy in patients with coexisting OSA and SB.

        2. Aim The aim of the study is evaluation of the quality of sleep, endothelial function,
           cardiovascular risk, thyroid function, a function of masticatory muscles and
           psycho-emotional status of patients with bruxism.

        3. Methods The project will take place in the Sleep Laboratory at the Department of
           Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases and Hypertension Medical University in Wroclaw.
           About 100 patients referred to the Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational
           Diseases and Hypertension and Clinical Oncology for suspected sleep apnea and bruxism
           will be included. Dentists will be co-workers.

      Patients from the Clinic of Prosthodontics operating at the Department of Prosthodontics,
      Medical University in Wroclaw and other dental institutions diagnosed using Diagnostic
      Criteria for temporomandibular Disorders (DC / TMD) and Criteria of American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine International Classification of Diseases ICD -10-CM evaluating bruxism will be
      directed to full polysomnography (PSG) with video recording.

      Polysomnograms will be evaluated in a 30-second contributions, according to standard sleep
      criteria. PSG results will contain data on the latency of sleep, total sleep time (TST),
      sleep efficiency (%) and an evaluation of phases N1, N2, N3 and REM. Pathological respiratory
      events will be evaluated in accordance with the standards of the American Academy of Sleep.
      Apnea is defined as the absence of airflow through the respiratory tract by more than 10
      seconds. The shallowness of breathing is defined as a decrease in respiratory amplitude by
      more than 30% for more than 10 seconds, with subsequent desaturation of more than 3% or
      subsequent awakening.

      Then, to evaluate the function of vascular endothelium in patients expansion of the brachial
      artery using ultrasonography Aloka Prosound Alpha 6, using the guidelines of the
      international working group studying reactivity of the brachial artery will be explored.
      Ultrasound of the heart, Electrocardiography Holter and Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      (ABPM) will be performed in each patient. In addition, researchers will execute surveys:
      Epworth Scale, Athens Scale, STOP-Bang Scale, Berlin questionnaire, the severity level of
      fatigue / tiredness scale, a questionnaire assessing quality of life, the scale of perceived
      stress - questionnaire PSS 10 and questionnaires Oral Behavior Checklist (OBC) and Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality index (PSQI). Headache episodes will be assessed using Headache Impact Test - 6
      (HIT-6) and HUNT questionnaires.

      Each patient will be performed clinical tests of blood to determine levels of FT3, FT4 and
      TSH in order to evaluate the relationship between RMMA and thyroid disease. At the same time
      the relationship between bruxism, psycho-emotional state and sleep quality will be evaluated
      through questionnaires PSS10, OBC and PSQI.

      Masticatory muscle activity during the study will be assessed on the basis of the record
      coming from electromyography electrodes placed on the beard and symmetrically around the
      masseter muscle attachments. The results will then be analyzed for the incidence RMMA
      directly related to episodes of bruxism and their relation to episodes of sleep apnea,
      changes in blood pressure and heart rate to determine the prevalence of cause-effect
      relationships.
