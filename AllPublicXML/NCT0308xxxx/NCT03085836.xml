    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. TAK-438 is being tested in healthy
      participants in order to evaluate the PK of single and multiple oral dose.

      The study will enroll approximately 36 healthy participants. Participants will be assigned to
      to one of the three treatment groups:

        -  TAK-438 10 mg tablet QD

        -  TAK-438 20 mg tablet QD

        -  TAK-438 20 mg tablet BID All participants will be asked to take TAK-438 tablet at the
           same time on Day 1 and Days 3-9.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 18 days. Participants will remain confined to the clinic from Day 1 up to Day 11 and
      will be followed-up by telephone or visit on Day 18.
