      The objective of this study is the evaluation of system accuracy based on EN ISO 15197:2015
      (ISO 15197:2013), clause 6.3 in which accuracy requirements and applicable test procedures
      for blood glucose monitoring systems intended for self-monitoring of blood glucose by
      patients are stipulated. ISO 15197:20132 was harmonized with the regulations of the European
      Union as EN ISO 15197:2015. This harmonization had no impact on the requirements and
      procedu¬res in ISO 15197:2013; changes were made to the foreword and an informative annex. In
      this study, system accuracy evaluation will be performed for OneTouch® Verio Flex (LifeScan
      Europe) on behalf of LifeScan Scotland Limited (customer) with three different reagent system
      lots.

    <description>Based on EN ISO 15197:2015 (ISO 15197:2013) (E), the BGMS shall meet both of the following criteria:
Criterion A: 95 % of the measured glucose values shall fall within either ± 15 mg/dl (0.83 mmol/l) of the average comparison measurement result at glucose concentrations &lt; 100 mg/dl (5.55 mmol/l) or within ± 15 % at glucose concentrations ≥ 100 mg/dl (5.55 mmol/l).
Each lot shall pass acceptability criterion A. Criterion B: 99 % of individual glucose measured values shall fall within zones A and B of the Consensus Error Grid (CEG) for type 1 diabetes.</description>

    <description>Measurement procedure
Subjects will be asked to wash and dry their hands before the measurements.
The measurement procedure for each reagent system lot of a BGMS will be as follows:
Study personnel will collect a capillary blood sample from the subject's fingertip by skin puncture.
Duplicate measurements on the sample will be consecutively performed with 2 test meters using reagent system units from the same vial / package.
Capillary blood for measurements with all 3 test strip lots and for both comparison measurements will be taken from the same finger puncture.
The sample will be applied to the reagent system units following specifications in the manufacturer's labelling.</description>
