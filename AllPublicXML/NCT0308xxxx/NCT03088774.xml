      This project studies the effects of involving patients in the development of a
      web-application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The point-prevalence of low back pain (LBP) has been estimated to 9.4 % and LBP is in many
      countries the most frequent reason to consult a general practitioner. However, general
      practitioners are under pressure with increasing workloads. The increasing number of patients
      and the typical 10-15 minutes of available time for each patient are challenging the
      provision of sufficient information and advice. According to international guidelines
      information and advice are recommended for every patient with LBP, therefore, new methods to
      support general practitioners (GPs) are very much needed. Online technologies give new
      opportunities to extend the treatment. Furthermore, involving patients with LBP in the
      development of online information material may produce more user friendly content and design
      and thereby increasing patients' acceptance and usage. Thus, optimizing clinical outcome.
      This project will study patients' satisfaction and clinical outcomes of a web-application for
      patients with LBP consulted in general practice compared to best existing technology (the
      Patient Handbook).

    <masking_description>The allocation sequence will be delivered by the statistician group at Aalborg University Hospital and delivered to a IT consultant at ProData (Viby, J, Denmark) and integrated in the web-application. The researchers conducting the analysis will be blinded. During the project, data will be stored on a server placed at Aalborg University. Another member of the author Group will prepare a data set with a dummy variable for allocation without free text information from patients and make this data set available for the assessors to analyse. Patients will be aware of their allocation. General practitioners will only be aware of the allocation if the patient chooses to tell it to the general practitioner.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The question: 'how likely is it that you would recommend this web-application to a friend or colleague?' will be applied to measure satisfaction. The patients will be asked to choose between 11 boxes displayed on a horizontal line (10-0 Points, higher score indicating more satisfaction). The scales will be labelled to the left at 10 (extremely likely) and at the right side as 0 (not at all likely). It is only possible to tick off one box, if the patient change decision while filling in the online questionnaire, another box can be ticked off and the first choice will automatically delete. Responses of 10-9 are grouped as 'satisfied' of the web-application and patients replying 8-0 will be grouped as 'not satisfied'. The proportion of patients being satisfied after 12 weeks is the primary analysis. The proportion of patients being satisfied after 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks will be carried out as secondary analyses.</description>

    <description>A analysis comparing the intervention group with the control group from a healthcare perspective. Including primary care costs such as public paid costs for GP contacts, physiotherapy services, and chiropractic services. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) will be applied as measure of effect based on EQ-5D-5L. We will not include costs for developing and maintaining the new technology or other protocol driven costs. Based on the relative short time-horizon costs and effects will not be discounted.</description>

    <measure>Specific satisfaction</measure>

    <description>For further exploration of reasons for the primary outcome we include a question regarding the general satisfaction with the web-application (10-0) and detailed questions/items regarding satisfaction with design (very, some, little, none), satisfaction with customisation (very, some, little, none ), satisfaction with usability (very, some, little, none ), satisfaction with readability (very, some, little, none), and satisfaction with credibility (very, some, little, none). It is only possible to tick off one box to each item, if the patient change decision while filling in the online questionnaire, another box can be ticked off and the first choice will automatically delete. Furthermore, these items will be validated against the primary outcome.</description>
