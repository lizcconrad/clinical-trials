  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes patients affected by advanced and resectable rectal adenocarcinoma. It
      provides an induction chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI regimen plus Bevacizumab followed by
      Chemoradiotherapy plus Bevacizumab. Surgery with total mesorectal incision must be performed
      within 7-9 weeks after this last treatment. The protocol will be evaluate the disease free
      survival at two years. Translational analyses will be performed to show the presence of VEGF
      polymorphism, CD133 surface markers on colorectal CSCs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis obtained by a
             biopsy technique which leaves the major portion of the tumor intact.

          -  Locally advanced, resectable disease defined by the presence of at least one of the
             following features: tumour extending to within 1 mm of or beyond the mesorectal fascia
             (ie, circumferential radial margin threatened or involved); lower third (≤ 6 cm from
             the anal verge) cT3 tumours; tumour extending 5 mm or more into perirectal fat; T4
             tumour (ie, invading surrounding structures or peritoneum); clinical stage III disease
             (T1-4, N1-2), with the definition of a clinically positive lymph node being any node ≥
             1.0 cm;

          -  Distal border of the tumor must be located &lt; 12 cm from the anal verge.

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease by CT scan of the chest and abdomen and total body
             PET-CT scan.

          -  No other rectal cancers (i.e., sarcoma, lymphoma, carcinoid, squamous cell carcinoma,
             or cloacogenic carcinoma) or synchronous colon cancer.

          -  No clear indication of involvement of the pelvic side walls by imaging.

          -  Age between 18 and 75 years.

          -  ECOG Performance status &lt; 2 if age &lt; 70 years and = 0 if age 71-75 years.

          -  Previous pelvic radiation therapy.

          -  Hepatic disease that would preclude study treatment or follow-up; uncontrolled
             coagulopathy; history of viral hepatitis or other chronic liver disease.

             who are symptomatic).

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Fertile patients must use effective contraception (i.e
             double-barrier contraceptive measures, oral contraception or avoidance of intercourse
             during the study and for 30 days after surgery).

          -  Patients with prior malignancies (with the exception of rectal cancer), including
             invasive colon cancer, are eligible provided they have been disease-free for ≥ 5 years
             and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence.

          -  Other malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of effectively treated
             squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, melanoma in situ, carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, or carcinoma in situ of the colon or rectum.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to fluorouracil, oxaliplatin or irinotecan or to Chinese
             hamster ovary cell proteins.
