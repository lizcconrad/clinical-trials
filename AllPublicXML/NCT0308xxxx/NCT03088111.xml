  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This field study is a post-marketing requirement from the FDA to evaluate the clinical
      benefit (course of illness and survival), safety and pharmacokinetics of obiltoxaximab
      administered to patients as part of their medical care for treatment or prophylaxis of
      inhalational anthrax infection following exposure to Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis). The
      protocol can be implemented for any individual who receives obiltoxaximab for a suspected,
      probable, or confirmed case of inhalational anthrax due to B. anthracis in the United States,
      including sporadic cases, small incidents and/or a mass event. In case of a small anthrax
      incident, to the extent possible, the information will be collected prospectively at
      prespecified time points, except where it would interfere with management of the subject's
      illness. However, because of the logistical complexities that would likely accompany a mass
      anthrax event, most data in this study are anticipated to be collected retrospectively. Both
      retrospective and prospective data collection are allowed to maximize information collection.
      This study will collect data on the use of obiltoxaximab in anthrax infected or exposed
      subjects and the data collected will inform the understanding of the clinical benefit and
      safety of obiltoxaximab.

    <description>This is an open label, 24-week, single arm field study that will be implemented for subjects who receive FDA-approved obiltoxaximab as part of their medical treatment for inhalational anthrax infection in the United States. Adult subjects will be administered a single, intravenous (IV) dose of 16 mg/kg obiltoxaximab given as part of their medical care. Children will receive a weight-adjusted dose.
The primary purpose of the study is to collect data from subjects who have been treated with obiltoxaximab as part of their medical care for inhalational anthrax and to collect additional blood samples for measurement of obiltoxaximab concentrations and presence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA).</description>

    <intervention_name>Collection of samples</intervention_name>
    <description>To the extent possible, blood samples will be collected from all subjects prior to infusion and at specified time points post-infusion to determine serum obiltoxaximab concentrations and ATA titers. Scavenged blood samples can be utilized, if acceptable, to maximize sample analyses for pharmacokinetic and other investigational parameters. Data on other relevant laboratory testing will only be collected and evaluated if available in the subject's record (eg, protective antigen (PA), anti-PA, anti-lethal factor (LF), anti-edema factor, IgG antibodies, anthrax lethal toxin neutralizing activity, presence of anthrax LF, incidence and duration of B. anthracis bacteremia, and demonstration of B. anthracis antigens in tissues).</description>
