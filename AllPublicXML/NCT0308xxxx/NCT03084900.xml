      Investigators propose to study an intervention that will provide patient-centered, automated
      decision support to diabetes providers with the goals of improving adherence to medical
      recommendations (both patients and providers), improving self-management, and ultimately
      improving health outcomes.

      Investigators propose to study an intervention that will provide patient-centered, automated
      decision support to diabetes providers with the goals of improving adherence to medical
      recommendations (both patients and providers), improving self-management, and ultimately
      improving health outcomes. Computer decision support systems (CDSS) have scientifically
      demonstrated advantages for improving care, and the potential to revolutionize diabetes care
      because they allow for increased reactive and proactive contact with the health care team,
      real-time adherence support, and intensification of treatment. In this study,investigators
      will implement the ADA recommended standards of care using a CDSS developed by the research
      group - the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system.9 One of the
      greatest strengths of the CHICA system is its ability to implement evidence-based
      recommendations from authoritative sources, in this case the ADA, in a format that integrates
      easily into routine care. A second strength of the CHICA system is its ability to screen for
      patient-centered concerns, including barriers to optimal care such as literacy, socioeconomic
      issues (i.e., food insecurity, housing insecurity, etc.), and mental health issues (i.e.,
      depression). The provider is alerted, and safety mechanisms are set in motion (i.e., referral
      to mental health provider, etc.) to address identified issues. In order to ensure that we
      design the most effective CDSS intervention possible, the study team, in collaboration with
      the Patient Engagement Core (PEC) of the Indiana Clinical and Translational Science
      Institute, will partner with adolescents, parents, and other stakeholders in a way that
      exceeds standard expectations for the engagement of these parties in research. Investigators
      have experience working directly with patients to elucidate patient-centered outcomes,
      identify determinants of adherence, and to co-design interventions that are inherently more
      patient-centered.10-14 By combining a patient-centered design approach along with CDSS
      investigators will be able to individually tailor recommendations to meet the real needs of
      patients, taking into account the adolescent patient's perspective and input. This truly
      innovative approach will offer improved technology-based support systems for diabetes
      management along with attention to patient-centered goals using co-designed interventions for
      diabetes self-management.

    <description>Patient-Centered Decision Support to Improve Diabetes Mgmt. Investigators will use a computerized decision support system to aid clinicians to provide standard of care management while introducing patient-centered guidelines and outcomes measures. The intervention is the use of an electronic decision support tool. The decision support tool consists of a series of questions answered by the patients that will then allow the health care provider to address specific needs during the visit.</description>
