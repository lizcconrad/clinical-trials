      The aim of the study is to quantitate Central Nervous System (CNS) autoantibody development
      in human blood using ELISA after human brain injury, spinal cord injury, and intra-axial
      brain surgeries.

      Study Objectives:

      We aim to:

        1. Quantitate CNS autoantibody development in human blood using ELISA after human brain
           injury, spinal cord injury, and intra-axial brain surgeries. We also aim to characterize
           the temporal course of this response.

        2. Characterize how CNS autoantibody levels correlate with specific injury patterns as well
           as radiographic and clinical measures of injury severity.

        3. Determine how intercurrent infection and a history of prior CNS insult affects the
           temporal course and magnitude of autoantibody production.
