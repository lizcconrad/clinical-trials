  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The risk of ureteric injury at the time of pelvic reconstructive surgery can be
      as high as 3% and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has stated that
      intraoperative cystoscopy should be done after all such procedures. Intravenous indigo
      carmine was routinely given during surgery to colour the urine bright blue and allow for
      assessment of ureteric integrity. In 2014, indigo carmine was no longer available worldwide
      and since then, surgeons have been searching for suitable alternatives. Vitamin B is a water
      soluble vitamin that colours the urine bright yellow and can be given immediately before
      surgery to help with ureteric visualization. Alternatively, 5% dextrose in water (D5W) can be
      used as the instillation fluid during cystoscopy to allow for urine jet visualization due to
      the difference in fluid viscosity. Both agents have been shown to be better than instillation
      with normal saline and are affordable and accessible in Canada.

      Objective: To identify which agent is superior for intraoperative ureteric visualization at
      the time of cystoscopy by determining the difference in detection rate of both ureteric jets
      using either preoperative oral vitamin B or intraoperative cystoscopic distension with D5W.

      Methods: This study will be a three-site (Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences
      Centre, St. Michael's Hospital), double-blinded, randomized control trial whereby female
      patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery will be randomized to receive either
      preoperative vitamin B or intraoperative D5W cystoscopic instillation fluid. Parameters
      measured during surgery will include whether both ureteric jets were seen, time to
      visualization of both ureters, colour of jets, and surgeon satisfaction. Patients will also
      be seen at one week after surgery to assess for urinary tract infection. Sample size
      calculation based on previous studies demonstrated a need for 125 patients per study arm.

      Anticipated Clinical Significance: The findings of this study will be relevant to all
      surgeons performing intraoperative cystoscopy where ureteric visualization is required. The
      investigators believe the outcome of this study will help make cystoscopy shorter and more
      efficient for surgeons who often feel the pressure of time constraints within the operating
      room setting. In turn, decreasing the time of cystoscopy may reduce operating times which
      will benefit both the patient and hospital.

      Study design This study will be a double blinded, randomized control trial (RCT) to compare
      detection rates of one and both ureteric jets at the time of intraoperative cystoscopy using
      either vitamin B or D5W. This will be a multicentre study with patients being recruited from
      Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and St. Michael's Hospital.

      RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT Female patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery where
      cystoscopic ureteric visualization is required will be recruited from Mount Sinai Hospital at
      their surgical consult in the clinic/ambulatory setting. At that time, one of the study
      investigators (not the operating physician for that particular patient) will describe the
      study to the patient and give her the study consent form if she is interested in
      participating (Appendix 1). For any patients recruited or considering the study, they will be
      asked to stop all vitamin supplements one week before surgery. If the patient cannot decide
      on the day of the surgical consult, they can go home with an unsigned consent form to review
      the study and on the day of surgery they will once again be asked if they would like to
      participate in the study by a study investigator (not involved with the patient's surgery).
      Once the patient has read and voluntarily signed the consent form, the same study
      investigator will open a sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope that will provide a
      study identification number for the patient and randomize the patient to either receiving a
      preoperative dose of vitamin B or intraoperative cystoscopic distension with D5W. The patient
      and operating surgeons will bot be made aware of the group the patient was allocated to.

      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION There is only one study in the literature that has commented on
      ureteric visualization after vitamin B ingestion. In this study, they report a 72% detection
      rate. If we consider a 15% difference in detection rate to be clinically significant, then
      with a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05, the minimum number of patients required per group
      would be 113. We anticipate a 10% drop out rate after consent due to intraoperative issues.
      Therefore, we will recruit 125 patients per study arm.

      METHOD

      Upon recruitment to the study, the study investigator that did the consent will then complete
      the Initial Information Form where the following information will be collected from the
      patient (this information is also already available in the clinical record):

        -  Age

        -  Parity

        -  BMI

        -  Smoking status

        -  Diabetic status

        -  Menopausal status

        -  Immunocompromised status

        -  Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification (POP-Q) stage

        -  Preoperative use of vaginal estrogen

        -  History of recurrent UTI

      Patient packages will be created and assigned a patient number. For those randomized to the
      vitamin B group, the package will consist of a pill of vitamin B2 (containing 100mg of
      riboflavin) that is inside an opaque gelatin capsule that is matched to a litre bag of normal
      saline that is wrapped in an opaque covering. For those randomized to the D5W group, the
      package will consist of a pill that is an empty opaque gelatin capsule that is matched to a
      litre bag of D5W that is wrapped in an opaque covering. These packages will be couple with
      the patient according to her randomization group in the preoperative area.

      In the preoperative area, all patients will be given the pill in their package by mouth 60 to
      120 minutes before the start of surgery. The covered bag will then accompany the patient to
      the operating room and will be set up as the instillation fluid for cystoscopy. This way, the
      patient and operating team will be blinded to what agent was used for ureteric visualization.
      Cystoscopy will be done using a standard diagnostic 70 degree cystoscope.

      In the preoperative area and in the operating room, the following data will be collected by a
      study investigator that is not part of the operating team:

        -  Time pill was given

        -  Time cystoscopy was started

        -  Time surgeon started to look for ureteric jets

        -  Time first ureter was visualized

        -  Time second ureter was visualized

        -  Colour of jet (clear, pale yellow, or bright yellow)

        -  If cystoscopy is repeated to look at ureters, above measures are captured again

        -  If fluorescein (0.25mL by iv injection) is used as a rescue agent, reason why, time it
           was given, and time jets were seen are recorded (in order to allow for an adequate time
           to determine whether the study agent has worked, fluorescein cannot be used any earlier
           than 10 minutes from the start of cystoscopy)

        -  Surgeon satisfaction of ureteric visualization during that specific case is rated on a
           Likert scale from 1 to 5

        -  Primary surgeon's guess at the agent that was used to visualize ureters

      Between post-operative days 3 and 10, the patient will present to clinic and information on
      length and type of catheter use, as well as antibiotic use after surgery will be recorded
      (APPENDIX 4). Patients will also give a catheter urine specimen to be sent for culture and
      sensitivity.

      DATA ANALYSIS Baseline characteristics and follow-up measures will be summarized using
      descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, and range for continuous variables, count and
      percent for categorical variables).

      Continuous variables will be summarized using means and standard deviations, and will be
      compared between groups using Student's t-tests. Categorical variables will be summarized
      using counts and percents, and compared between groups using Chi-squared tests. A P-value
      ≤0.05 will be considered significant for all statistical analyses performed.
