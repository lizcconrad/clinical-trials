  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study addresses the potential utility of providing an accessible self-help
      intervention for patients in a medical setting with an estimated diagnosis of MDD.
      Specifically, the study will explore whether a) such an intervention can be effectively
      implemented in a primary care setting and b) patients originally seeking medical attention
      for an orthopedic problem will be willing to seek psychological treatment and, c) improvement
      in depression symptoms will lead to improvement in upper and lower extremity functioning.

  <detailed_description>

      The present project will be an open-label trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability
      of a self-help intervention among a sample of orthopedic patients. In addition to monitoring
      the effectiveness of the Deprexis program on depressive symptoms, the proposed project will
      assess whether a reduction in depressive symptoms will be associated with improvement on
      patient reported orthopedic impairment. The investigators will enroll 50 adults and the
      participants will be given the opportunity to participate in 8 weeks of the web-based online
      Deprexis program.
