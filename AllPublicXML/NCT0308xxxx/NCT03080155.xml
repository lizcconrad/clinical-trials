      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of MIRA in classifying women with
      dense breast tissue for supplemental breast MRI. To assess the effectiveness of MIRA for
      correctly classifying women with breast cancer and to evaluate the safety of the device.

      In women above 30 years old who are undergoing MRI or are scheduled for image-guided needle
      biopsy due to lesions detected by other imaging modalities.

        undergo routine breast cancer screening (MRI and/or mammography) OR Women who are between
        30 to 79 years of age and scheduled for image-guided needle biopsy as a result of findings
        obtained during standard of care imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasound and/or MRI)
