  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigate the short term effect of Maitland in comparison to Mulligan
      mobilization with sub-acute and chronic non specific neck pain to improve neck pain, pain
      pressure threshold, rang of motion, joint position sense, disability, and to evaluate the
      interaction with psychological factors.

      Study design: experimental study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      44 patients with sub-acute or chronic neck pain will be randomized into Maitland group: 22
      patients receive central postro anterior or unilateral postero anterior. Mulligan group: 22
      patients receive sustain natural apophyseal glides. The treatment will be 2 times /week for
      three weeks. Measurement will be taken pre intervention and after three weeks for neck pain,
      pain pressure threshold, range of motion, joint position sense, and disability using a
      numeric pain rating scale, pain pressure threshold test, cervical range of motion device, and
      neck disability index, depression, anxiety, fear avoidance believe and pain catestrophizing
      respectively.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>pain pressure threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured with an electronic algometer (Somedic AB, Farsta, Sweden) with a circular probe of 1 cm2. The PPT will be measured over the following site: (1) area of maximum tenderness over the cervical spine as identify by palpation, (2) tibialis anterior muscle (upper one-third of the muscle belly) bilateral. Tibialis anterior sites will be as remote lower limb sites to investigate any widespread changes in sensitivity. The pressure will be applied perpendicular over the identified sites at a rate of 40 KPa/s until the individual verbally states that the pressure is starting to change to a pain sensation. Then, the pressure will be stopped. The test will be repeated three times for each site within 30 second between measurements. An average of three measurements will be calculated</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>: numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) will be used to evaluate the intensity of pain perceived by patient. Pain is rated on 11 point scale from (0) no pain to (10) sever pain. The patients will be asked to point out the number that describes their pain level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cervical range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>it will be measured by cervical range of motion (CROM) device. It consists of three gravitational inclinometers system for flexion, extension and lateral flexion, and magnetic inclinometer for rotation.</description>

    <measure>joint position sense</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>neck disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questioner is used to report disability results from neck pain and it is a self-report based outcome. In addition, it contains ten sections with total score of 50 points</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>State trait anxiety inventory questionnaire (STAI-Y):</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Beck depression inventory questionnaire (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>it contains 21 items; each item has four self evaluation statements in a time frame of two weeks, and scores from 0 to 3. The total score for 21 items range from 0 to 63</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Fear avoidance believe questionnaire (FABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>this questionnaire can assess the fear avoidance believe about the pain. It consists of 16 items. First five questions are related to fear avoidance of physical activities (FABQ- PA). Then the eleven questions are related to avoidance of work (FABQ-W). The score for each question is ranged from 0 (strong disagreement) to 6 (strong agreement). The total score is ranged from 0 to 66. Higher score is represented high level of fear avoidance believe</description>
