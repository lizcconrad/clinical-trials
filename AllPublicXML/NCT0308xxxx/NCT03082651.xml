  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the effect of alternating footwear model and workout-type
      on the occurrence of running-related pain. To achieve this goal participants will be randomly
      assigned into one of four different groups who will perform: 1) the same workout throughout a
      week in the same running shoe model, 2) alternating workout-types throughout the week in the
      same shoe model, 3) the same workout throughout a week in alternating shoe models, and 4)
      alternating workouts in alternating shoes. Participants will be characterized based on body
      alignment, strength, injury and training history. Pain and injury status will be monitored.

    <description>Group 1 - Runners will be assigned identical training sessions over a 7-day period and will perform these runs in two pairs of the same assigned neutral-cushioned running shoe (Nike Pegasus). The weekly training volume will increase on a weekly basis in order to progressively increase training load in preparation for the half-marathon event.</description>

    <description>Group 2 - Runners will perform a variation of workouts, consisting of interval/speed work, tempo runs, and long-slow distance runs throughout each 7-day period. As with Group 1, weekly training volume will increase on a weekly basis. Runners in Group 2 will perform these runs in two pairs of the same assigned neutral-cushioned running shoe (Nike Pegasus).</description>

    <description>Group 3 - Runners will be assigned identical training sessions over a 7-day period but will alternate use of two different models of running shoes across successive workouts (Nike Pegasus and Nike Zoom Streak). The Zoom Streak has 10mm less midsole material, a less supportive heel counter and more flexible forefoot providing a more responsive feel to the runner.</description>
