  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who have a high risk of metastatic prostate cancer (cancer that
      has spread outside of the prostate) who are going to have radical prostatectomy. The
      Anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC or Fluciclovine) positron
      emission tomography (PET) scan is a new imaging approach that has promising results in
      showing progression of cancer. The goal of this study is to determine if FACBC PET imaging
      will detect metastatic disease in patients with high risk prostate cancer who have negative
      conventional cross-sectional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), as well as bone scan and/or sodium fluoride PET. FACBC PET imaging
      may help detect metastatic prostate cancer in patients with newly diagnosed high risk primary
      prostate cancer and potentially improve staging of the cancer. Additionally, the researchers
      will compare the FACBC uptake in the prostate with uptake of FACBC detected in metastasis.
      They will also analyze and compare the prostate tissue, serum and urine parameters that are
      linked to higher rates of FACBC positivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50-80% of patients who are considered high-risk after being treated with
      definitive radical prostatectomy experience recurrent disease, often because of undetected
      extra-prostatic metastatic disease prior to treatment. There is increasing evidence that
      performing radical prostatectomy in patients with high-risk disease or locally advanced
      disease is feasible and has potential benefits in terms of local control, overall survival,
      and quality of life. Thus, improved imaging approaches for early detection of occult
      metastatic prostate cancer at the time of presentation could inform a directed treatment
      approach that would significantly improve patient outcomes, including use of extended
      lymphadenectomy as well as postoperative radiation therapy planning.

      Amino acid transport is up-regulated in prostate and other cancers.
      Anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC) is a synthetic amino acid
      analog positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer that has demonstrated promising results
      in the staging and restaging of prostate carcinoma, with high positive predictive value (PPV)
      in the identification of extraprostatic malignancy. Most of the prior studies of FACBC were
      in post-primary treatment recurrence, and this proposed trial will be the first comprehensive
      study to evaluate FACBC PET in detecting occult metastatic disease at initial diagnosis in
      patients with negative or equivocal conventional imaging, with the objective of developing a
      more effective primary treatment plan.

      The goal of this study is to determine if FACBC PET will detect significant occult metastatic
      disease in patients with high risk primary prostate carcinoma who have negative or equivocal
      conventional imaging such as CT and/or MRI and bone scan. Participants will have a single
      scan prior to surgery for this study. Participants will be followed, through medical record
      reviews, for 10 years but no additional procedures related to this study will be performed.

    <description>Participants will fast for 4 hours to normalize their neutral amino acid levels. One hour prior to the scan, participants will drink up to 450ml of standard oral contrast. Participants will lie on the scanning bed while the bed moves through the PET/CT scanner for the CT portion of the exam. After completion of the CT scan, approximately 10 units of FACBC will be injected for the PET scan portion of the exam. The bed will move through the scanner again and the PET portion of the exam will take 30 minutes. The entire visit will take about two hours.
Standard of care procedures include conventional imaging (CT and/or MRI; bone scan and/or NaF PET per institutional standards) and radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection.</description>
