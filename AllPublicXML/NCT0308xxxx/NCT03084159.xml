  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use an adapted education worksheet to support patient-centered chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) communication, shared decision making, and patient engagement and will test its
      impact on intermediate patient modifiable characteristics in a primary care practice with
      patients who have pre-dialysis CKD.

      The study team will enroll up to 50 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from a primary
      care clinic to start. Patients will receive the intervention, which consists of the
      physicians using the education worksheet during appointments with patients, and patients and
      providers will complete surveys about its use and to measure impact on knowledge and other
      areas related to patient outcomes.

      Once initial user testing is complete, the study team plans to submit an amendment to expand
      on this trial and incorporate comparison sites. This will be submitted and receive IRB
      approval prior to participant involvement.

      The study hypothesis is that patients who receive the intervention will have greater
      knowledge about their CKD diagnosis, higher satisfaction with provider communication, and
      higher scores related to managing CKD to keep themselves healthy compared to control
      populations.

    <measure>Level of objective understanding of CKD as measured by the Kidney Knowledge Survey (KiKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Length of doctor's appointment, e.g., 1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This will measure objective kidney disease knowledge, based on a score of 0-100, where 0 means poor level of kidney knowledge, and 100 means good level of kidney knowledge. The KiKS was developed by Dr. Wright.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of perceived understanding of CKD as measured by the Perceived Kidney Knowledge Survey (PiKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Length of doctor's appointment, e.g., 1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This will measure subjective kidney knowledge. Score range is 1-4, where 1 is low level of perceived kidney knowledge, and 4 is high level of perceived kidney knowledge. The PiKS was developed by Dr. Wright.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of positive perception of patient-provider communication as measured by the Patient Communication Assessment Tool (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Length of doctor's appointment, e.g., 1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This assesses the quality of physician to patient and physician's staff to patient communication. Score range is 1-5, where 1 means negative perception of communication and 5 means positive perception of communication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of mental anxiety/stress related to condition as measured by the adapted NDBCSS scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Length of doctor's appointment, e.g., 1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The 19-item NDBCSS (Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Stress Scale) is adapted to form the 21-item scale in the patient survey to measure stress associated with CKD. The score range is 1-4, where 1 means high level of stress associated with CKD and 4 means low level of stress associated with CKD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of energy/fatigue and emotional well-being as measured by the SF-36 mental health component</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 mental health component is a 9-item scale that measures energy/fatigue and emotional well-being in the past 4 weeks.Score range is 0-100, where 0 means poor emotional well-being and low energy and 100 means good emotional well-being and high energy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Level of positive assessment of care as measured by the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 11-item scale evaluating patient assessment of the quality of care that patients received in the past 6 months. Score range is 1-5, where 1 means poor assessment of quality of care and 5 means good assessment of quality of care.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Participatory design and intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in this arm will receive the intervention of using an education worksheet during their appointment with their provider. They will be asked to complete post intervention surveys. Providers and staff at this site have been involved in the design of the intervention process, to make it streamlined and efficient for application in practice.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Intervention Only</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A future arm will include patients at another site that will also receive the intervention of using an education worksheet during their appointment and fill out post intervention surveys. Providers/staff have not been involved in the initial design of the intervention process but will use it as part of the intervention delivery.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Usual Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>A third site will include usual care, which does not include the intervention. Participants will be given post visit surveys similar to those in the two other study / intervention arms. This site will serve as a usual care comparison.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Education worksheet</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients who screen positive for CKD and give written informed consent to be a part of the study will have their chart flagged for the medical assistant and provider to give the education worksheet intervention. The education worksheet has been developed to be used as an electronic tool within the Electronic Medical Record. The provider will review it with the patient during the visit. A paper copy will print out for the patient at the end of the visit.</description>
