  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until now, no prospective clinical trial for duodenal stump leakage after laparoscopic or
      open gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients has been conducted.

      We already introduced a technique of laparoscopic reinforcement suture (LARS) on staple-line
      of duodenal stump using barbed suture for prevention of duodenal stump leakage. Therefore, a
      prospective phase II study was designed for safety of this technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the results of recent prospective randomized controlled clinical trials, laparoscopic
      gastrectomy has been accepted by one of standard treatments for early gastric cancer in
      Korea, Japan and China.

      However, duodenal stump leakage remains one of the fetal complications after gastrectomy
      until now. The incidence of duodenal stump leakage is reportedly between 1.6% to 5% in
      Billroth II or Roux en Y reconstruction after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. According to a
      recent multicenter study, the laparoscopic approach increased the risk of duodenal stump
      leakage development comparing to open approach.

      Until now, no prospective clinical trial for duodenal stump leakage after laparoscopic or
      open gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients has been conducted. I already introduced a
      technique of laparoscopic reinforcement suture (LARS) on staple-line of duodenal stump using
      barbed suture for prevention of duodenal stump leakage. Therefore, a prospective phase II
      study was designed for safety of this technique.

    <description>After cutting of duodenal stump of about 2 cm length using linear stapler, laparoscopic reinforcement suture commenced from upper to lower part on staple-line of duodenal stump. Continuous suture with invagination was performed using a barbed suture. In case of patient with short duodenal stump because of chronic ulcer or ectopic pancreas at duodenal bulb, 2 or 3 interrupted sutures without invagination of duodenal stump was conducted using barbed sutures.</description>
