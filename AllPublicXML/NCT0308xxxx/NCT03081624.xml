  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beginning school is an important milestone for children. Children's readiness for school
      involves cognitive, physical, and emotional development. While the majority of children born
      preterm are able to transition from preschool to kindergarten with little difficulty, some
      children experience challenges during this time. Factors that negatively influence children's
      success in kindergarten include their age, socioeconomic status, neurological status and
      their ability to interpret sensory information from their environment.

      This study was planned to explain the relationship between the primary school readiness and
      the neurological status of preterm born children.

      A convenience of preterm and term preschoolers recruiting from Gazi University, Faculty of
      Health Science, Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. Each group contains 30
      children. First, sociodemographic information and histories of children are obtaining. Ages
      and contact information of the parents are recording. Prenatal and natal risk factors of the
      mothers are querying. Gestational ages and height, weight, and head circumferences of babies
      at birth are recording. Number of pregnancies, live births and abortions, type of delivery,
      multiple pregnancies for mothers as well as consanguinity between parents are asking. Marmara
      Primary School Readiness Scale is using to evaluate mental-language development,
      socio-emotional development, physical development, self-care skills,math skills, science
      skills, voice exercises, line exercises and labyrinths. Sensory profile caregiver
      questionnaire screen for the senses (sensory processing), adjustment (modulation), behavioral
      and emotional responses. The Touwen examination (neurological examination) is using to
      evaluate posture in various positions, muscle tone, dyskinesias, range of motion, reflexes,
      sensory function and cranial nerve function as well as developmental items, i.e. the items
      dealing with coordination, fine manipulative abilities and associated movements. All
      examination wiil be finished in the same day.
