  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Target enrollment is 1000 prospectively enrolled subjects with an initial negative biopsy
      scheduled for repeat biopsy.

      Subjects must have had their negative index prostate biopsy procedure within 30 months of
      being scheduled for their repeat biopsy.

      All enrolled subjects will have all core tissues from the initial negative biopsy blinded and
      tested with the assay.

      All subjects will have serum and plasma samples obtained prior to DRE, and a urine sample
      collected immediately following DRE but in advance of the repeat biopsy; samples will be
      blinded and sent to MDxHealth for evaluation.

    <description>The primary objectives of this prospective, multi-center study are twofold:
Validate use of the ConfirmMDx for Prostate Cancer to predict the outcome of a repeat biopsy in men with a previous negative prostate biopsy using tissue.
Validate use of the SelectMDx for Prostate Cancer to predict the outcome of a repeat biopsy in men with a previous negative prostate biopsy using urine.</description>

    <measure>Comparison between clinical and pathological outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Subset analyses conducted in appropriate groups, such as patients with available data from radical prostatectomy, and correlate this data with the ConfirmMDx and SelectMDx results.
Evaluate rate of cancer detection on repeat biopsy and associated complications.
Evaluate the findings of MRI fusion biopsy with standard 12 core TRUS guided biopsy (if available).</description>

    <description>ConfirmMDx is a molecular diagnostic assay which utilizes DNA isolated from biopsy tissues to determine if aberrant DNA methylation is occurring in three genes: GSTP1, RASSF1 and APC. ConfirmMDx is currently available to clinicians for use in cancer-negative extended-core biopsies to determine if occult cancer is present in the prostate.</description>

    <description>SelectMDx for Prostate Cancer is a reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay performed on post-DRE, first-void urine specimens from patients with clinical risk factors for prostate cancer, who are being considered for biopsy. The test measures the mRNA levels of the DLX1 and HOXC6 biomarkers, using KLK3 as internal reference gene, to aid in patient selection for prostate biopsy.</description>

        ConfirmMDx assay will be utilized to blindly test the needle biopsy cores of the index
        negative prostate biopsy (all cores) of men about to undergo repeat prostate biopsy. It is
        postulated that the test may aid in improved patient risk stratification for repeat biopsy,
        discriminating patients with no cancer/low grade prostate cancer (GS6) who are at
        sufficiently low risk to avoid repeat biopsy, while also identifying patients at increased
        risk for clinical significant disease (â‰¥ GS7) who may benefit from early intervention.

        In this current study, SelectMDx will be used to blindly test urine samples obtained
        preceding a repeat prostate biopsy to validate the test's ability to predict risk for
        high-grade disease. The intent is to demonstrate the test's ability to non-invasively
        stratify those patients at risk for aggressive disease, who require a repeat prostate
        biopsy, versus those at sufficiently low risk who may avoid unnecessary repeat biopsy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males, aged 40 years to 85, who underwent a previous cancer-negative prostate biopsy
             within 30 months of being scheduled for a repeat biopsy.

          -  The initial TRUS guided negative prostate biopsy must have collected a minimum of 10
             tissue cores and sections from all prostate biopsy cores collected by the physician
             must be submitted to MDxHealth in order to allow for full comprehensive
             testing/evaluation of all the sections of the patient's prostate prior to the
             scheduled repeat biopsy.

          -  Minimum tissue volume criteria of 20 microns of prostate biopsy core tissue is
             available (40 microns preferable).

          -  Previous biopsy histology may include the presence of high-grade prostatic
             intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), glandular
             inflammation, atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) or atypical cells.

          -  Tissue was extracted using standard TRUS guided biopsy core extraction (and not
             transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

          -  Pre-DRE serum sample, pre-DRE plasma sample, and Post-DRE urine sample to be collected
             in advance of the repeat biopsy. Samples can be collected within three months of the
             scheduled repeat biopsy, up until the day of, but prior to, the procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who has undergone previously testing by ConfirmMDx from the same biopsy

          -  Patients with prior diagnosis of prostate cancer in any previous biopsy.

          -  Patients with a limited life expectancy and generally not considered for a repeat
             Tissue extracted using transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedures

          -  Patients with a history of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma)
