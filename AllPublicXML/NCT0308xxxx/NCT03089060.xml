  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amputation injuries of the fingertip are common in all ages. For decades it is known that
      conservatively treated fingertips can regenerate skin and soft tissues to form a functionally
      and cosmetically excellent new fingertip. Unfortunately, little is known about the mechanisms
      controlling this ability that, in humans, is confined to the fingertips. Even less is known
      about the bacteria that regularly colonize these wounds without noticeable negative impact on
      regeneration and healing. Medical evidence on fingertip regeneration in humans is largely
      limited to retrospective studies and case reports. This study will be the first randomized
      controlled trial on the conservative treatment of fingertip amputations in children and
      adults.

      When managed without surgery, self-adhesive polyurethane film dressings are commonly used to
      establish a wet chamber around the injury. This provides the best conditions for tissue
      regeneration inhibiting the formation of scar tissue at the same time. Unfortunately these
      dressings do not offer mechanical protection, they do not stick to wet skin and leak
      malodorous wound fluid. The investigators therefore developed a silicone finger cap that
      deals with these problems offering a mechanically protected, wet chamber around the injury
      for optimal regeneration conditions. This finger cap also offers a puncturable reservoir for
      excess wound fluid, which by this route can be routinely analyzed for diagnostic and research
      purposes.

      This randomized controlled trial will for the first time test acceptance, safety and efficacy
      of this novel medical device in comparison with conventional self-adhesive film dressings
      while gathering information on the clinical course and outcome of conservatively treated
      fingertip amputation injuries.

      Based on sample size calculations for primary outcome, 22 patients older than 2 years will be
      enrolled within 24 hours after having suffered an injury distal to the distal interphalangeal
      joint comprising all layers of the skin with a substance defect that cannot be primarily
      adapted without further shortening of the finger or plastic surgery. Participants are
      randomly assigned to start their treatment for the first two weeks either with a conventional
      film dressing or with the novel silicone finger cap. They will be changed to the other
      modality for another two weeks before the patient or the guardian can decide, if they would
      want the film dressing or the finger cap for the rest of the treatment.
