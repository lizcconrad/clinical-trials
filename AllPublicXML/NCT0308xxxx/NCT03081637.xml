  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very high.
      Having a predictive marker of early recurrence (ER) would be desirable to personalize the
      follow-up and possibly develop new targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to test the
      expression of Filamin A (FLNA) in a cohort of patients operated for HCC.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A consecutive cohort of resected HCC patients will be analyzed. Several different prognostic
      factors, including FLNA expression, will be tested against the risk of ER. FLNA expression
      will be analyzed with immunohistochemistry in the intra-tumoral and extra-tumoral tissue
      compartments using a dedicated tissue microarray.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria were represented by the histological positivity for HCC with
             complete clinical, surgical, pathological, and follow-up data.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients preoperatively treated with chemotherapy or trans-arterial therapy were
             excluded.

          -  Similarly, patients operated for recurrent HCC or with non-radical surgery or with
             missing data were excluded.
