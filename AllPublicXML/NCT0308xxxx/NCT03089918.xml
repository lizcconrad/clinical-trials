  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the total body biodistribution and radiation
      dosimetry of 11C-JNJ-63779586 by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in healthy young adult
      males (Part A); to estimate and compare the uptake, distribution, and clearance of
      11C-JNJ-63779586 in the brain by PET between mild Alzheimer Disease (AD) participants
      (males/females) and age- and gender-matched control participants (Part B), corrected for
      regional cerebral blood flow differences; and to model the tissue specific kinetics of
      11C-JNJ-63779586 in human brain with the appropriate input function (IF) (Part B).

    <measure>Effective Radiation Dose Following Injection of 11C-JNJ-63779586 (Part A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Whole body and organ specific dosimetry for the tracer will be estimated using specific software for calculation of the absorbed radiation dose. Afterwards, dosimetry will be compared with other carbon-11 labeled radiotracers. According to these results, the same or lower dose might be used for Part B, to prevent high radiation doses to certain organs.</description>

    <measure>Total and Regional Brain Compartmental Kinetics for Volume of Distribution of 11C-JNJ-63779586 (Part B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Regional brain uptake will be determined using a Volume of interest (VOI) based analysis. Differences in regional brain uptake between Alzheimer Disease (AD) and control participants will be determined using statistical parametric mapping. Regional uptake of 11C‑JNJ‑63779586 into brain (K1) will be assessed and compared between participants with AD and control participants, corrected for regional blood flow.</description>
