      The purpose of this research study is to help determine whether practicing resisting the urge
      to smoke changes brain function or behavior among smokers.

      The study is comprised of two parts: a pilot to test procedures to be used in the study,
      followed by the study. The pilot phase of this study will enroll 30 participants. The main
      study will enroll 80 after the pilot phase is completed. The pilot phase includes all of the
      same procedures as the main study.
