  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Chongqing intracerebral hemorrhage study is a multi-center, prospective, observational
      study led by professor Qi Li from Chongqing Medical University. Professor Peng Xie will be
      the senior consultant for the study. The Chongqing intracerebral hemorrhage study will focus
      on the epidemiology, natural history, pathogenesis, laboratory, radiological aspects,
      clinical outcomes and the effects of treatment in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

      The clinical, laboratory, imaging, genetic and outcome data of patients diagnosed with acute
      intracerebral hemorrhage will be prospectively collected. The prognosis of patients with
      intracerebral hemorrhage will be assessed by using several outcome measure scales at
      different time points.

      The Chongqing intracerebral hemorrhage study will try to address several key issues in ICH.
      The baseline clinical data including demographic, disease severity scores, prior drug history
      and relevant medical history, premorbid mRS scores will be prospectively recorded. The
      admission and follow-up imaging data of all registered patients will be saved as Dicom format
      for future use and review. The functional outcomes will be assessed and recorded by
      experienced neurologists.
