  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether dietary inorganic nitrate (in beetroot juice) is able to
      reduce overall thickening of the heart (left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH) and stiffness of
      the arteries when given to patients with persistently raised blood pressure (hypertension).
      Half the patients will receive the beetroot juice containing inorganic nitrate and half will
      receive beetroot juice from which the inorganic nitrate has been removed. The volunteers will
      take the juice every day for 4 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In hypertension persistent raised blood pressure (BP) is associated with endothelial
      dysfunction, arterial stiffness and left ventricular (LV) remodeling that are key phenomena
      associated with the pathogenesis and complications of hypertension.

      One of the main substances that the healthy endothelium produces that is responsible for
      maintaining the patency of blood vessels is nitric oxide (NO). In hypertension, one of the
      key pathogenic effects is the dysfunction of the endothelium characterized by a decrease in
      ability to generate nitric oxide (NO). Previous studies have shown that dietary inorganic
      nitrate supplementation lowers blood pressure (Kapil et al. 2015), however, whether this
      approach might also improve endothelial function and LV remodeling is unknown. The effects of
      inorganic nitrate are due to its conversion in the body to inorganic nitrite and thereafter
      to NO.

      This study will assess the effects of dietary inorganic nitrate on LVH using cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging (NITRATE-LVH arm). In addition, the effects of dietary inorganic nitrate on
      central aortic blood pressure, arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity and endothelial
      function using flow mediated dilatation will be evaluated (NITRATE-CBP arm).
