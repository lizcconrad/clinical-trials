  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out which doses of talimogene laherparepvec (T-Vec) can
      be given safely to participants with pancreatic cancer that is either too big to be taken out
      by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. The study will also see if T-Vec can
      cause tumor shrinkage or prevent its growth.

      The primary objective is to determine the rate of dose limiting toxicity at tested doses of
      talimogene laherparepvec administered endoscopically to pancreatic tumors, and to identify a
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      Secondary exploratory efficacy endpoints include change in longest diameter in the injected
      lesion(s), overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and modified immune-related response
      criteria (mirRC as defined in section 11), progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS) at 6, 12, and 24 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an area of great unmet need. PDA accounts for 90%
      of pancreatic tumors in 2016. The standard of care for pancreas cancer is cytotoxic
      chemotherapy, but this is not particularly effective with best response rates reported of
      20-30% and no significant long-term 5-year survival for patients who are not surgical
      candidates. Talimogene laherparepvec (previously known as OncoVEXGM-CSF) is an intratumorally
      delivered oncolytic immunotherapy comprised of an immune-enhanced herpes simplex virus type-1
      (HSV-1) that selectively replicates in solid tumors. Talimogene laherparepvec was the first
      oncolytic viral therapy to be approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of cancer, specifically melanoma. There is the potential that talimogene
      laherparepvec could exert a systemic effect mitigating the potential of PDA to metastasize.

      This is a phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety of talimogene laherparepvec in
      PDA. To find out which doses are safe, all participants enrolled in this study will receive
      up to 4 injections of T-Vec. At least two doses will be evaluated in this study, depending on
      how many side effects are seen at each dose. Participants will not be able to pick the dose,
      as this will be determined based on the study experience with participants enrolled
      previously.
