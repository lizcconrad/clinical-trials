  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of parent based intervention on the language
      of 2 to 3 year old children from socially disadvantaged populations with a clinical diagnosis
      of primary language delay.

      This project is original in proposing to evaluate the effectiveness of a parent-based
      intervention for a clinical population of 2 to 3 year olds with a diagnosis of primary
      language delay in areas of social disadvantage. It is original in developing an interagency,
      integrated model of delivery in line with the health and social care agenda (NHS 5 Year
      Forward Plan). It is also original in examining the effect of parent attitudes on child
      outcomes.

    <description>The planned primary outcome measure for the proposed RCT is a quantitative measure of child language using a standardised assessment measure, The Pre-School Language Scales 5 UK (PLS 5 UK) (Zimmerman et al, 2014). This will provide a sound measure of reliability and validity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria (to diagnose primary language delay):

          -  The child is 24-36 months old

          -  The child has little or no expressive language (a vocabulary of 40 or less single
             words)

          -  The child has no known aetiologyÍ¾ the language delay is not secondary to sensory,
             structural, neurological or cognitive impairments

          -  The family have been assessed as having low socioeconomic status The study will use
             the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) as a basis to determining a measure of
             deprivation. The IMD combines information from seven domains (income, employment,
             education, health, crime, housing and living environment) to produce an overall
             measure and it ranks how deprived areas are relative to others. This will be used to
             determine which areas and Children's Centres will be involved in the proposed RCT.
             However, as this is a geographical ranking, the RCT will include further refinement of
             eligibility of social disadvantage via assessment of individual measures of income
             deprivation, employment deprivation and education attainment. This information on
             employment and parent education levels will be collected via the case history taken at
             the initial assessment, as this is standard practice in a profile of risk for child
             language delay. The additional information on income will be taken at the first
             research assessment, as this does not form part of standard practice

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The child's expressive language consists of a vocabulary of more than 40 single words

          -  The child's language delay is secondary to sensory, structural, neurological or
             cognitive impairments

          -  English is not the first language for the family.

          -  Where English is not the first language, children would be excluded. Adjustments to
             the protocol and delivery of intervention would be required where English is an
             additional language (EAL) and there is a need to test the intervention first on an
             English-speaking population. If effective, a longer term programme plan would be to
             amend the programme and evaluate the effectiveness with EAL children.
