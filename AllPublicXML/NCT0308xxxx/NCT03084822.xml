  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the importance of healthy lifestyle practices to cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      prevention and the utility of church-based interventions in African-American adults, the
      investigators developed a theory-informed, strategically-planned, health and wellness
      intervention with Rochester, Minnesota (MN) and Twin Cities area (Minneapolis, St. Paul, MN)
      churches with predominately African-American congregations. The objective of the study was to
      partner with churches to implement a multi-component, health education program through the
      use of core educational sessions delivered through a digital-application accessible on demand
      via interactive access on computer tablets and the Internet. The overarching goal was to
      increase the awareness and critical importance of healthy lifestyles for CVD prevention and
      provide support for behavior change.
