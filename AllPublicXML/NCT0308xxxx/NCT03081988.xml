      1. Retrospective review of old patients

             -  Analysis of prediction factors for concomitant chemo-radiotherapy in locally
                advanced and advanced esophageal cancer from 2005 to 2015

        2. Prospective case-control study: RNA sequencing &amp; miRNA microarray

             -  naive esophageal cancer patients who have a plan to receive concomitant
                chemo-radiotherapy

                  -  acquirement of tissue, blood, clinical information

                  -  isolation of RNA, DNA, serum database of clinical &amp; demographic information

           ***Analysis of mRNA sequencing / miRNA sequencing**** first analysis of RNA sequencing:
           bioinformatician second analysis of RNA sequencing: principle investigator

        3. Experimental set for qPCR (esophageal tissue) study group
