  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe, effective, and tolerable dose of PRX302 for
      the treatment of low to intermediate risk prostate cancer.

    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, open label, phase IIb study, evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy
      of a targeted intraprostatic focal administration in development. The study will treat
      approximately 40 men who meet the eligibility criteria, and give written consent. Safety and
      tolerability will be assessed post-treatment over 26 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed by
      biopsy and imaging (mpMRI) at 24 weeks.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 10 years.

          -  Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 15ng/mL.

          -  A histologically proven, clinically significant lesion visible on mpMRI (magnetic
             resonance imaging) that is accessible to PRX302 transperineal injection.

          -  Radiological stage T1-T2 N0 Mx/M0 disease.

          -  Targeted prostate biopsy within 6 months prior to dosing, with a clinically
             significant lesion correlating with an mpMRI visible lesion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous radiation therapy to the pelvis.

          -  Androgen suppression or anti-androgen therapy within the 12 months prior to dosing,
             for prostate cancer.

          -  Use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitor within the 3 months prior to dosing.

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease or nodal disease outside the prostate on bone scan or
             cross-sectional imaging.

          -  Inability to tolerate transrectal ultrasound (TRUS).

          -  Known allergy to latex or gadolinium (Gd).

          -  Prior rectal surgery preventing insertion of the TRUS probe.

          -  Any previous ablative procedures performed on the prostate, e.g., electroporation,
             radiofrequency ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryosurgery,
             photochemical, thermal or microwave therapy to treat cancer of the prostate.

          -  Unable to have pelvic MRI scanning (severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac
             pacemaker, metallic implant, etc., likely to contribute significant artifact to
             images).
