  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous phase II trial entitled Treatment of Follicular non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma with High
      Dose Therapy and Stem Cell Support Followed by Consolidative Immunotherapy with Rituximab and
      Alpha Interferon was conducted at the Odette Cancer Centre between 2005 and 2012. The primary
      objectives of this previous trial was to assess progression free survival and overall
      survival. Of the 36 patients in this trial, approximately 18 remain in remission. In this new
      follow up trial, follow up data will prospectively be collected on patients who provide
      informed consent to do so.

        Twelve patients with low grade follicular lymphoma who consented to long term follow-up and
        were previously treated with high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant with
        rituximab and alpha interferon as part of the phase II trial Treatment of Follicular
        Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma with High Dose Therapy and Stem Cell Support Followed by
