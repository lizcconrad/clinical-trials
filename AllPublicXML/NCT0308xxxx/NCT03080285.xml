  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate efficacy of over-glasses patch treatment for amblyopic
      children using visual function improvement and Amblyopia Treatment Index (ATI) changes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized multi-center controlled clinical trial, children younger than 7 years with
      moderate amblyopia (visual acuity in the range of 20/40 to 20/100) would be included to
      receive treatment with either a conventional patch or an over-glasses patch. The patients
      will be prescribed 2 hours of patching per day for the sound eye. Best-corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA) and stereopsis will be investigated and ATI questionnaires be collected from
      parents at 5 weeks and 17 weeks after the initiation of treatment.

    <measure>Changes in visual acuity (logMAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>changes in best- corrected visual acuity between before treatment and after 17 weeks.
Visual acuity is assessed using the Snellen chart. logMAR visual acuity ranges 0.0 to 3.0. logMAR visual acuity of 0.0 corresponds to 20/20. Lower scores represents better functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>amblyopia treatment index</measure>
    <time_frame>17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A modified version of ATI was provided to the parent(s) of all the enrolled minor patients as part of their follow-up visit with their child. The test consisted of 20 items, translated to Korean by one English language specialist and three ophthalmologists. The score from each question contributed to a sub-scale of the adverse effect (question numbers 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 16), compliance (question numbers 1, 5, 6a, 10 and 12), and social stigma (question numbers 11, 14 and 18). The questionnaires were scored on a 5-point Likert scale system, and the parent-provided questionnaire used a strength of agreement scale with responses of &quot;strongly agree&quot; (5), &quot;agree&quot; (4), &quot;neither agree nor disagree&quot; (3), &quot;disagree&quot; (2), &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (1), and &quot;not applicable.&quot; In the test, the majority of items were negative statements, and therefore, a higher score indicated a higher negative impact or a higher burden. Reverse scoring was applied to the few items that were positive statements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the best corrected visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>best corrected visual acuity (logMAR) at 17 weeks Visual acuity is assessed using the Snellen chart. logMAR visual acuity ranges 0.0 to 3.0. logMAR visual acuity of 0.0 corresponds to 20/20. Lower scores represents better functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of binocularity</measure>
    <time_frame>17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A binocularity index was determined with the use of the Worth 4 Dot test at near and the Titmus stereo test with a scale ranging from 0 to 4 with the following characteristics: 0, indicating complete suppression; 1, a moderate central suppression scotoma with peripheral fusion at near only indicated by fusion on the Worth 4 Dot test at near; 2, a small suppression scotoma and peripheral fusion indicated by fusion of the Titmus stereo fly; 3, moderate stereoacuity (100-400 arc seconds) on the stereo test animals (1 to 3 animals) and/or on the stereo test circles (1 to 5 circles); and 4, good stereoacuity (&lt;80 arc seconds ) on the stereo test circles (6 to 9 circles).</description>

Conventional patch is occlusion treatment sticker (Opticlude Eye Patch, 3M, Maplewood, MN, USA) with an adhesive material attached to the skin and serves to cover the eyes.</description>

Over-glasses patch (Tomato Eye Patch, Tomato Inc., Busan, South Korea) is made of fabric and covers the glasses, hence serves to cover the eyes.</description>
