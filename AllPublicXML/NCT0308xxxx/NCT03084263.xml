      The objective of this study is to compare the functional outcomes of patients with ankle
      fractures treated by Arthroscopic assisted Open Reduction Internal Fixation (AORIF) versus
      Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF).

      Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial evaluating patients with ankle fractures undergoing
      AORIF versus ORIF

      Participants will be randomized into 2 different surgical groups, one group receiving only
      ORIF and the other group receiving AORIF.

      As standard of care patients will follow up in the office at approximately 3 weeks, 6 weeks
      and 12 weeks post operatively. Patients will be immobilized in a splint and will be
      non-weight bearing until their 3 week post-op visit. At the 3 week post-op visit, the patient
      will be fitted in a boot, be instructed to begin self-directed ROM and to continue non-weight
      bearing. At the 6 week post-op visit, the patient will begin weight bearing in the boot.

      In office study visit will occur at these same times. At each visit weight bearing status,
      return to sports, pain level, AOFAS and FAAM will be assessed. One additional study visit
      will be conducted over the phone or by mail at approximately one year post operatively and
      will consist of the FAAM.
