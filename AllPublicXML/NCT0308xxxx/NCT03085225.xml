    <description>Trabectedin will be administered intraveinously, on day 1 of each cycle, every three weeks, as appropriate for assigned dose level.

    <description>Dose Escalation : 3 doses of trabectedin given in combination with durvalumab (fixed dose) will be investigated.
A treatment cycle consists of 3 weeks. Treatment may continue until disease progression or study discontinuation (withdrawal of consent, intercurrent illness, unacceptable adverse event or any other changes unacceptable for further treatment, etc.).
Expansion cohorts: Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) has been defined, the expansion cohorts will be opened. All patients will be treated at the MTD of Trabectedin (as defined in the dose escalation part of the trial) given in association with Durvalumab with the same schedule as in the dose escalation part of the trial.</description>
