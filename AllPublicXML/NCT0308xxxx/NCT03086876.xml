  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 1-2% of the population have a Learning disability (LD). This is a lifelong condition
      characterised by an IQ less than 70, general developmental delay and limitations in day to
      day activities. Children and adults with LD are some of the most under-served groups in
      society, with well documented health disparities and at four times the risk of developing a
      mental disorder. Reports indicate that challenging behaviour, e.g. temper tantrums,
      aggression or self injury, occurs in as many as 40,000 young people under 18 years living in
      England. There is a significant evidence from research in the general population that
      parenting groups which support parents in developing skills to manage such behaviours in
      their child can be helpful. These programmes, if offered to parents early on, may reduce and
      even prevent serious emotional problems and possible criminality from developing in the child
      later in life. Cost benefits are associated with improved health and social outcomes in the
      young person. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on
      behaviour that challenges reviewed all the available evidence and found very few thoroughly
      researched programmes specifically developed for children and young people with LD and
      challenging behaviour. NICE, therefore, recommended that further research should be
      undertaken to address the lack of evidence based interventions to reduce challenging
      behaviour in the population of young people with LD.

      In this study, we propose to evaluate a programme called level 4 Stepping Stones Triple P
      (SSTP) delivered by trained practitioners to groups of parents of young children aged 30-59
      months with moderate to severe LD . The programme lasts for 9 weeks and has shown positive
      results in small trials outside the UK, indicating that it is a potentially helpful. However,
      it needs to be tested within the UK health system before recommendations can be made to roll
      it out. Level 4 SSTP helps parents understand and manage their child's behaviour and parents
      may benefit from peer support in a group setting. We shall recruit 258 parents who will be
      allocated to one of two groups by chance: one will receive SSTP and treatment as usual and
      the other treatment as usual, a list of resources and the Contact a Family guide to
      challenging behaviour. Treatment as usual includes support and advice by GPs or child
      development teams. We shall use parental reports and observations of child behaviour to
      examine whether SSTP reduces challenging behaviour at four (short term) and 12 (long term)
      months after randomisation. We shall also ask other carergivers' about the child's behaviour,
      the child's and the parent's health related quality of life, difficulties with care, parent
      stress, service use and how the parent has found the intervention using both questionnaires
      and face to face interviews.

      We shall interview the service managers and the therapists about their experience of hosting
      and delivering the intervention. We shall recruit parents to the Parent Advisory Group to
      advise about various aspects of the study, e.g. materials, interview topic guides,
      dissemination. We are a group of researchers and clinicians with expertise in LD, child
      health and early intervention who have conducted several large trials with this population.

      Our trial will last 48 months and will follow all statutory research governance requirements
      to ensure that it is high quality, safe and ethical.

    <description>Trained practitioners will deliver Level 4 SSTP to parents in 6 weekly group sessions and will also provide 3 telephone of face to face contacts to each participant but they will not be involved in routine care for participants in either arm. Each therapist responsible for delivering SSTP will be trained in the Group Stepping Stones Training and Accreditation programme which includes three training days and a further half day accreditation workshop after 6 weeks. The group sessions not only educate but actively train the parents in skills and the individual consultations aim to facilitate independent problem solving. The learning objectives focus on maintaining behavioural change, using skills within a group learning environment, learning from peers in the group and sharing difficulties or achievements, providing support, considering if more intensive work is required, referring further if needed, talking about risk and protective factors operating within families.</description>

    <description>TAU will be available to participants in both arms of the trial. It may include a range of services such as:
1. Health visitor services; 2. Primary care engagement and advice; 3. Potentially some version of early intervention maybe provided by either community paediatric services or Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, although our understanding is that very little is available for children of this age. 4. Parenting advice and support sessions by carers groups or other third sector organisations.
Parents allocated to TAU will receive a list of national and local resources and the Contact a Family guide to challenging behavior with tips and advice on social and health care supports.</description>
