      This is a observational validation study. The Stroke Clinical Decision Support Tool (
      InstaDx) , an information technology application will be adapted and developed in accordance
      to evidence based clinical practice guidelines ( Level IA). Neurology Residents will be using
      the InstaDx CDST to improve their diagnostic accuracy and the findings will be validated
      against the review of a stroke subject expert. The study hypothesis is that Clinical Decision
      Support Tool used by neurology residents will have an agreement of &gt;0.77 when compared to
      Stroke Expert (gold standard) in diagnosing type of ischemic stroke.

      Overall Objective: To adapt, develop and validate the clinical decision support tool, an
      information technology application to assist acute stroke diagnosis for use among neurology
      graduate trainees compared to stroke expert (gold standard).

      Specific Aims:

      1. To validate the adapted clinical decision support tool, an information technology
      application to assist acute ischemic stroke diagnosis for use among neurology residents
      compared to stroke expert (Gold standard) in the adult population presenting at a tertiary
      care hospital in Pakistan.

      The study will be conducted in Emergency department and the Neurology ward at Aga Khan
      University Hospital. The data collector will enroll the patients meeting the eligibility
      criteria and providing informed consent. Neurology residents will use the Clinical Decision
      Support Tool application to assist in acute stroke diagnosis. In the second part, the Stroke
      Expert will independently assess all diagnosis. The purpose of this would be to validate the
      Clinical Decision Support Tool application to assist in acute stroke diagnosis.
