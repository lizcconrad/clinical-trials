    <textblock>
      LiveWell is a study evaluating the use of smartphones to better understand and improve the
      treatment of bipolar disorder. Our goal is to increase access to psychosocial interventions
      and improve their effectiveness in reducing symptoms and preventing mood episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single blind, randomized controlled trial (N = 200, 2:3 ratio of usual care vs usual care
      and intervention) will be conducted in clinical practices around Chicago and Minneapolis.
      Eligible participants are adult bipolar 1 disorder patients not experiencing a current mood
      episode with a history of at least one acute episode in the last two years who are in
      treatment with a psychiatrist.

      The primary clinical outcome will be time to relapse, and the secondary outcomes will be
      percent time symptomatic, symptom severity, and quality of life.

      Participation in the study lasts for 12 months. Participants are asked to carry a smartphone
      with them whenever they leave home and wear a wristwatch for measuring activity all day every
      day. Participants are also asked to complete a series of telephone assessments and may be
      asked to complete daily check-ins on a smartphone and work with a health coach.

      Participants will need to attend two in-person clinic visits at 680 N Lake Shore Drive,
      Chicago IL 60611 Suite 1520 or at 3311 E Old Shakopee Rd, Bloomington, MN 55425.
