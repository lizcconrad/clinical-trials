  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and
      effect of PBI-4050 at doses ranging from 400 mg to 1200 mg on relevant biomarkers in subjects
      with inadequately-controlled T2DMS on stable background antidiabetic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study will be performed by 15 sites in Canada. The total duration of study
      participation for each subject is approximately 20 weeks and comprises 6 study visits

      A total of approximately 268 subjects will be enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to
      one of the following 4 treatment groups:

        -  PBI-4050 400 mg

        -  PBI-4050 800 mg

        -  PBI-4050 1200 mg

        -  Placebo

      All subjects will receive the assigned study drug for 12 weeks.
