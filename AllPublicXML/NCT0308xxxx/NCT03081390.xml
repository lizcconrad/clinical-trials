  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to test the effects of a high-fat, high-carbohydrate mixed
      meal on candidate modulators of cardiovascular disease risk (inflammation, vascular
      reactivity, sympathetic nervous system tone, and response to pain) in young adult women with
      migraine compared with healthy young women. This is study enrolling both cases (women with
      migraine) and controls (women without migraine), with equal numbers of normal weight and
      obese women in each group. Participants will undergo a telephone screening and a single day
      in-person study visit.

    <description>Skin conductance will be monitored continuously with 2 electrodes placed on the plantar surface of the foot. To induce pain, we will use the cold pressor test. Participants submerge one hand in a bath with iced water (2-4ºC) for 2 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored every minute starting 5 minutes before the cold pressor test and for 10 minutes after the participant withdraws the hand from the bath. This testing will be performed at baseline and post-meal.</description>
