  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been proved that concurrent radiotherapy (RT) and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) for
      leptomeningeal metastases (LM) from solid tumors with adverse prognostic factors showed great
      effectiveness and safety. Cytarabine(Ara-C) is another agent which is commonly used for
      intrathecal chemotherapy. The purpose of the study is to observe the effectiveness and safety
      of concurrent RT and intrathecal chemotherapy for LM from solid tumors. In addition, the
      effectiveness of these two types of agents (MTX and Ara-C) in the concurrent
      chemo-radiotherapy will be compared in this study. This is a randomized controlled, parallel
      group, and phase II clinical trial. The object of this study is newly diagnosis patients with
      leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors, who will accept the treatment of involved-field
      RT combined with concurrent intrathecal-MTX or intrathecal-Ara-C, respectively. Major
      endpoint is clinical response rate. Secondary endpoints are time to progression,severe
      adverse events and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients were randomly divided into two groups, who will accept the treatment of
      involved-field RT combined with concurrent intrathecal-MTX or intrathecal-Ara-C,
      respectively. Concomitant regimen consisted of intrathecal chemotherapy (via lumbar puncture,
      MTX 15 mg, plus dexamethasone 5 mg, or Ara-C 50mg, plus dexamethasone 5 mg, once per week, 4
      weeks in total) and RT. RT consisted of fractionated, conformal radiation given at a daily
      dose of 2 Gy. The planning volume consisted of sites of symptomatic disease, bulky disease
      observed on MRI, including the whole brain and basis cranii received 40 Gy in 20 fractions
      and/or segment of spinal canal received 40-50 Gy. In the investigator's previous study,
      criteria of evaluation for clinical response that has been established was based on
      improvement of neurologic symptoms/signs and changes of karnofsky performance status(KPS).
      The criteria were proved as effective method for the evaluation of prognosis. The method was
      used to assess the clinical response in this study.

    <description>In the previous study, investigators established the criteria of evaluation for clinical response based on improvement of neurologic symptoms/signs and changes of KPS. The clinical response was evaluated by at least two experienced neuro-oncologists. The evaluation consists of 5 layers, including complete response (CR), obvious response (OR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). Clinical response was defined as continuous presence of CR, OR or PR within an interval of at least 1 week. Stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) were defined as ineffective.</description>
