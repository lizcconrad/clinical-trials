  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients eligible for this study have a type of blood cancer called T-cell leukemia or
      lymphoma (lymph gland cancer).

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No one way seems perfect for
      fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease,
      antibodies and T cells, hoping that they will work together. Antibodies are types of proteins
      that protect the body from bacterial and other diseases. T cells, also called T lymphocytes,
      are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells.
      Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown
      promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the
      tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in
      the laboratory and then given them back to the person. The antibody used in this study is
      called anti-CD5. It first came from mice that have developed immunity to human leukemia. This
      antibody sticks to T-cell leukemia or lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of
      these cells called CD5. CD5 antibodies have been used to treat people with T-cell leukemia
      and lymphoma. For this study, anti-CD5 has been changed so that instead of floating free in
      the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way
      it is called a chimeric receptor.

      In the laboratory, the investigators have also found that T cells work better if proteins
      that stimulate T cells are also added, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the
      cells grow better and last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of
      killing the leukemia or lymphoma cells.

      In this study investigators are going to attach the CD5 chimeric receptor with CD28 added to
      it to the patient's T cells. The investigators will then test how long the cells last. These
      CD5 chimeric receptor T cells with CD28 are investigational products not approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To make the T cells the investigators will take the patient's blood and stimulate it with
      growth factors to make the T cells grow. To get the CD5 antibody and CD28 to attach to the
      surface of the T cell, investigators insert the antibody gene into the T cell. This is done
      with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study and will carry the
      antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps investigators find the T cells in the
      patient's blood after they are injected. Because the patient will have received cells with a
      new gene in them the patient will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any
      long term side effects of gene transfer.

      When the patient is enrolled on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD5 chimeric
      receptor-T cells. Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to
      proliferate (grow) and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are
      too many other T cells in circulation . Because of that, the patient will receive two
      chemotherapy medications prior to receiving the CD5 chimeric receptor-T cells.

      One medication is called cyclophosphamide and the other fludarabine. The patient will receive
      3 daily doses of each drug, ending at least one day before the patient receives the chimeric
      receptor-T cells. These drugs will decrease the numbers of the patient's own T cells before
      the CD5 chimeric receptor T cells are infused and also will help decrease the number of other
      cells that may interfere with the chimeric receptor-T cells working well. Although we do not
      expect any effect on the patient's tumor with the doses that the patient will receive, these
      drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat leukemia or lymphoma.

      The patient will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV at the assigned
      dose. The injection will take from 1 to 10 minutes. Before the patient receives the
      injection, they may be given a dose of Benadryl and Tylenol. The treatment will be given by
      the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children 's Hospital or Houston Methodist
      Hospital.

      The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for up to 3 hours, and the
      patient will have to remain locally for at least 3 weeks after the infusion. If the patient
      experiences any side effects, they may have to be hospitalized for evaluation and management.

      If after a 6-8 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient has achieved a complete
      response (measured by bone marrow or radiology scans), the patient's primary oncology doctors
      may decide the patient should proceed to bone marrow transplant, at which time the patient
      will be removed from the treatment portion of the study.

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:

      Physical exam and History; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function;
      Pregnancy test for female patients who are of child bearing potential; Measurements of the
      patient's tumor by scans and/or bone marrow studies

      The patient will also receive standard medical tests during treatment and after:

      Physical exams and History; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function;
      Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans and/or bone marrow studies 6-8 weeks after the
      infusion and then per standard of care.

      To learn more about the way the CD5 chimeric receptor-T cells are working and how long they
      last in the body, extra blood will be drawn. The total amount on any day is about 10
      teaspoons (50 mL) or no more than 3 mL per 2.2 pounds body weight in children. This volume is
      considered safe but may be decreased if the patient is anemic. This blood may be drawn from a
      central line if the patient has one. Blood will be taken before the chemotherapy drugs,
      several hours after the T cell infusion, at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks (optional), 4 weeks, 6
      weeks and 8 weeks (optional) after the infusion, at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, at 1 year,
      every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years. We will also test blood to
      check for signs of viral infection at the following time points: within 1 to 2 weeks prior to
      chemotherapy drugs, prior to T cell infusion, then at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 for all
      patients, and months 3, 6, 9, 12 for patients who do not proceed to bone marrow transplant.
      The total blood drawn during participation in this study will not exceed 280 teaspoons.
