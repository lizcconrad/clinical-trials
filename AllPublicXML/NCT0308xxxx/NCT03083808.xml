    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II study of continuation immunotherapy with pembrolizumab
      following initial benefit (CR, PR, or SD ≥ 3 months) with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Patients who have been treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and experienced a PFS of ≥3
      months will be enrolled within 6 weeks of last dose of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. On Day 1 of
      each 3-week cycle, subjects will first receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg IV every
      three weeks in combination with chemotherapy. Partner chemotherapy will be either gemcitabine
      1000mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every three weeks, docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV D1 every three weeks, or
      pemetrexed 500mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 weeks (pemetrexed for non-squamous histologies only).
      Subjects will continue to receive this combination until progression or intolerable toxicity.

      Administration Sequence: First Sequence

      - Pembrolizumab 200mg IV on Day 1 (cycle = 21 days)

      Administration Sequence: Second Sequence

        -  Gemcitabine 1000mg/m^2 IV on Days 1,8 (cycle = 21 days)

        -  Docetaxel 75mg/^2 IV on Days 1,8 (cycle = 21 days)

        -  Pemetrexed 500mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 (cycle -= 21 days)

             study drugs. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
             pregnancy test will be required.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use two methods of contraception or
             abstain from heterosexual activity from the point of registration through 120 days
