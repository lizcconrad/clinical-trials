  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need/benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy could be negligible for a certain category of
      patient with newly diagnosed unilateral non metastatic breast cancer. Physicians are
      sometimes divided between the administration of adjuvant treatment and no administration when
      the risk of distant relapse at 10 years is around 10% with uncertainty and a theoretical
      benefit of chemotherapy is less than 5% at 10 years according to guidelines in use in the
      center.

      Several genomic tests have been developed this last decade. These tests use a sample of
      breast cancer tissue to analyze the activity of a group of genes. Knowing whether certain
      genes are present or absent, overly active or not active enough, can help physicians predict
      the risk of recurrence.

      In addition to standard pathological characteristics, a genomic test could be helpful in
      making treatment decisions, such as whether or not chemotherapy should be part of the
      treatment plan. First generation prognostic tests are currently widely used worldwide to
      guide decision making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy (OncotypeDX™ Mammaprint®). Prognostic
      tests have reached a level of evidence 1A, with the results of the prospective randomized
      trial &quot;Mindact&quot;. In the &quot;Mindact&quot; trial, among women with early-stage breast cancer who were
      at high clinical risk and low genomic risk for recurrence, the receipt of no chemotherapy on
      the basis of the 70-gene signature led to a 5-year rate of survival without distant
      metastasis that was 1.5 percentage points lower than the rate with chemotherapy. Given these
      findings, approximately 46% of women with breast cancer who are at high clinical risk might
      not require chemotherapy. The health-economic value of such signatures in the general
      population of patients with localized breast cancer appears very low at current costs.

      Meanwhile, next generation prognostic signatures have been developed that have integrated
      clinical parameters and suggest high added value beyond all standard and traditional
      characteristics including tumor burden, grade, Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone
      Receptor (PR), Her2, age and also standard assessment of proliferation.

      In this study, the clinical utility of genomic tests (Endopredict®, Prosigna®, OncotypeDX®,
      Mammaprint® assay) defined as impact on chemotherapy decision in the adjuvant setting in
      patients with ER-positive, Her2-negative early breast cancer with uncertainty on the
      indication of chemotherapy using standard assessments will be compared.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be identified prior to surgery based on biopsy results. During the post-operative multidisciplinary decision-making meeting, a first therapeutic decision to prescribe or not an adjuvant chemotherapy will be taken according to usual clinical and histopathological markers and official guidelines in use in the center. After the patient has signed the inform consent form, the surgical sample will be sent by the investigator site to a selected genomic platform according to the randomization result.</intervention_model_description>
