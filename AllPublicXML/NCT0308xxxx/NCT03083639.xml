      The drug being tested in this study is called esomeprazole. Esomeprazole is being tested in
      healthy participants in order to evaluate the bioequivalence between a single oral dose of
      esomeprazole tablet and capsule. The study will enroll 52 participants. Participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment sequences:

        -  Esomeprazole 40 mg capsule + Esomeprazole 40 mg tablet

        -  Esomeprazole 40 mg tablet + Esomeprazole 40 mg capsule

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule or tablet on Day 1 of each Intervention
      Period based on the treatment sequence to which the participant has been assigned.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration to
      participate in this study is 36 days. Participants will visit the clinic on Day -1 and
      remained confined until Day 1 of Intervention Period 1 and 2. A washout period of minimum 6
      days will be maintained between the dose in each Intervention Period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is a healthy adult male or female participant.

          2. Is aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and first study
             medication dose.

          3. Weighs at least 50 kilogram (kg) and has a body mass index (BMI) from 18.5 to 30
             kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive at Screening and Day -1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other
             abnormality, which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or
             potentially confound the study results. It is the responsibility of the investigator
             to assess the clinical significance; however, consultation with the Takeda Medical
             Monitor may be warranted.

          2. Has a history of significant gastro intestinal (GI) disorders manifested with
             persistent, chronic or intermittent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or has a current or
             recent (within 6 months) GI disease that would influence the absorption of drugs
             (example, a history of malabsorption, severe esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease
             or erosive esophagitis), or any gastrointestinal-related surgical intervention..

          3. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of esomeprazole
             capsules or tablets or compounds with the same mechanism of action (dexlansoprazole,
             lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole), or related compounds.
