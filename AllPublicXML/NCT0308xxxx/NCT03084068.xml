    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. MRI confirmed diagnosis of a full thickness supraspinatus tendon tear necessitating
             surgical intervention (rotator cuff repair)

          2. Subject is male or female age 18 or older

          3. Subject is willing and able to provide informed consent and participate in all
             procedures and follow-up evaluations necessary to complete the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet ANY of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Shoulder pain primarily attributed to any of the following:

               1. Ligament rupture due to use of fluoroquinolones

               2. Capsular tear

               3. Fracture of the humeral head

               4. Inflammation of the joint or surrounding tissue (i.e. osteoarthritis, bursitis)

               5. Neuropathic, radiating pain from conditions resulting in damage or inflammation
                  of the nerve

               6. Previous history of autoimmune connective tissue disorders (i.e. rheumatoid
                  arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus)

          2. Known history of poor compliance with medical treatments

          3. Subject has bilateral supraspinatus tendon tear

          4. Subject has signs and symptoms of an active infection of the shoulder joint

          5. Retraction of the supraspinatus tendon exceeding 1.5 cm in length

          6. Subject has additional injuries requiring further surgical intervention to the
             ipsilateral arm

          7. Subject has had previous surgery in the target arm within the past 6 months prior to
             treatment or plans to have surgery other than Rotator Cuff Repair in the target arm
             within 180 days of treatment

          8. Subjects currently receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy

          9. Subjects has used an investigational drug, device or biologic within 12 weeks prior to
             treatment

         10. Subjects who are pregnant at enrollment or are planning to become pregnant within 180
             days of treatment

         11. Subject has any significant medical condition(s) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would interfere with protocol evaluation and participation

         12. Allergy or known sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin sulfate
             and/or streptomycin sulfate

         13. Workers' compensation patients
