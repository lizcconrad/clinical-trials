  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a monthly social support group
      along with a weekly peer-to-peer meeting in improving perceived level of social support,
      diabetes distress, and A1c profiles in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus, compared with
      standard care offered at British Columbia Diabetes (BC Diabetes).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded comparative group clinical trial of 48
      participants receiving social interaction in addition to standard diabetes care or standard
      diabetes care alone. All participants will have a baseline and 6 month follow-up visit where
      assessment of their A1C, diabetes distress, and social support will be performed.

      Participants randomized to the social interaction cohort will meet on a monthly basis for a
      two hour group session designed to build social connections. In addition, participants will
      be paired with another study participant in this group, and will be asked to meet on a
      monthly basis for a minimum of 45 minutes. All participants in the social support cohort will
      continue to receive best standard diabetes management.

      Participants in the control group will be treated with standard diabetes care. At the end of
      the 6-month study, they will have the opportunity to engage in the same social interventions
      offered to the social interaction group.

    <description>Participants randomized to the social interaction cohort will be split into two groups of 12. Each group of 12 will meet together once a month for a two-hour support group. Each participant will be allowed five minutes to &quot;check-in&quot; with the support group. During the 5 minute period the participant is encouraged to share their innermost thoughts and feelings in the knowledge that this information will not be shared outside the group.
Participants will additionally be paired with another study participant in the same cohort and will be asked to meet outside group sessions once a week for a minimum of 45 minutes. The pairing process will take place by study investigators and will be sensitive to gender, age, and neighbourhood of residence. Participants who find that their paired partner is not suitable may ask the facilitators to help find a more suitable match.
These participants will continue to receive BC Diabetes standard care.</description>
