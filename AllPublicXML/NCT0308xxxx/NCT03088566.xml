  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early identification of potential risk factors for the onset of diabetic foot ulcers are
      recommended. However, in a Swedish context, there has been no standardised routines to be
      used in the foot screening procedure. In this study a new standardised routine, the D-Foot,
      will be tested at the Department of Prosthetics and Orthotics. The usability of the web
      program will be tested.

      The primary research questions are&quot;how do patients with diabetes perceive the foot
      screening?&quot; and &quot;do the perception differ in the group that was foot screened by the use of
      the D-Foot compared to the group that was foot screened with conventional methods?&quot;
