  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic lesions are the leading causes of admission to the emergency center (39%), isolated
      non-surgical lower limbs trauma are in the foreground. Two recent meta-analyzes suggest the
      value of Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) which would reduce symptomatic Thromboembolism
      Events (TE) in patients with lower limb trauma. However, many recent studies conclude to the
      need of stratifying the TE risk according to the patient and the nature of his trauma to
      obtain an individualized therapeutic decision.

      The retrospectively established L-TRIP (cast) score allows stratification of the risk without
      taking into account the type of trauma. The TIP score (Trauma, Immobilization and Patient)
      was established by consensus of international experts via the Delphi method.

      We suggest that the application of the TIP score to rationalize indications of
      thromboprophylaxis in patients with isolated non-surgical trauma of a lower limb should
      reduce the rate of anticoagulation prescription without increasing the risk of symptomatic
      thromboembolic complications with a direct benefit for patients and medico-economic for the
      society.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients admitted to the Emergency Departments for a nonsurgical isolated lower limb
      trauma necessitating rigid or semi-rigid immobilization, will be assessed for possible
      participation.

      After the physicians had obtained the no-opposition of the patient, they will fill a
      questionnaire. This questionnaire includes the treatment chosen by the physician, the type of
      trauma, the type of immobilization chosen, and the patient's thromboembolic risk factors in
      order to calculate the TIP and L-TRIP (cast) scores retrospectively.

      Phone follow-up will occur within 3 months to gather clinical event data (any signs of VTE,
      any bleeding events).

    <description>Compare two rate (percent) of prescription: obtained with standard practice and with the foreseeable TIP score calculated retrospectively.
Score TIP is calculated retrospectively based on datas of the patients included. A threshold value is established by an expert consensus. A score is positive if it is higher than the threshold value, and negative if it is lower or equal to the threshold value. We consider that patients with a negative score would not have been treated by a prophylactic anticoagulation if the TIP score was applied.</description>

Fatal bleed ing, and/or
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra- articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or
Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g.L (1.24 mmol.L) 1 or more, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells.
The cumulative incidence of non-major clinically relevant bleeding. The cumulative incidence of minor bleeding.</description>
