  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Infliximab versus Cyclophosphamide in
      Subjects with Idiopathic Refractory Scleritis.

      The term scleritis describes a chronic inflammation that involves the outermost cost and
      skeleton of the eye. Scleritis is classified anatomically as either anterior or posterior
      based on the principal location of the inflammation. Thirty to forty percent of scleritis
      cases are associated with systemic autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Infectious causes including herpes virus and varicella
      zoster account for 5 to 10% of patients. The remaining 50% of cases are classified as
      idiopathic.

      CIRIS, is the first prospective randomized, head to head study, comparing infliximab to
      cyclophosphamide in refractory idiopathic scleritis. There is no firm evidence or randomized
      controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in severe and refractory
      idiopathic scleritis. If left untreated or insufficiently treated, scleritis can progress to
      peripheral ulcerative keratitis, uveitis and glaucoma. Visual loss occurs in approximately
      10% of patients with anterior scleritis and in up to 75% of patients with posterior
      scleritis. The incidence of burden in ocular inflammation (uveitis and scleritis) has been
      dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of
      whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious
      scleritis. Contrasting with other immunosuppressors, cyclophosphamide and infliximab act
      rapidly and are highly effective in steroid's sparing.

      Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in idiopathic refractory
      scleritis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or
      dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written, informed consent prior to the performance of any study specific
             procedures

          2. Male or female, age ≥ 18 at Screening

          3. Weight 40 - 120 kg (88.2 - 264 lbs) at Screening

          4. Diagnosis of idiopathic scleritis in at least one eye. Scleritis is classified
             anatomically as either anterior or posterior based on the principal location of the
             inflammation. Clinically anterior scleritis can be divided into diffuse, nodular or
             necrotizing types and posterior scleritis into diffuse or nodular types (Watson and
             hayreh, 1976)).

          5. Active disease: Currently uncontrolled scleritis disease. Uncontrolled scleritis
             disease is defined as (at least) a 2 in scleral inflammation, according to the grading
             system defined Sene-sclera inflammation 0 to 4 gradations (Sen et al, 2011): these
             findings will be documented by drawings, photography or both for a central review.

          6. Refractory disease: At screening, subjects must be receiving oral corticosteroids (&gt;10
             mg/day prednisone equivalent and &lt;80mg/day) and at least one other immunosuppressive
             (azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetyl, cyclosporine, leflunomide) ; or
             being intolerant to such immunosuppressive therapies.

          7. Topical corticosteroids and/or NSAIDs are permitted provided the dose regimen has been
             stable for 2 weeks prior to Screening and remain stable throughout the study. Topical
             treatment for cycloplegia is permitted.

          8. Chest X-ray results (postero-anterior and lateral) within 12 weeks prior to
             randomization visit with no evidence of active Tuberculosis, active infection, or
             malignancy

          9. For female subjects of child-bearing age, a negative serum pregnancy test

         10. For subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to use contraceptive measures
             adequate to prevent the subject or the subject's partner from becoming pregnant during
             the study. Adequate contraceptive measures include hormonal methods used for two or
             more cycles prior to Screening (e.g., oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch,
             or contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge, diaphragm
             used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly, or condom used in conjunction
             with contraceptive foam or jelly), intrauterine methods (IUD), sterilization (e.g.,
             tubal ligation or a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner), and
             abstinence.

         11. A negative QuantiFERON®-Tuberculosis (TB) test result or in the event that their
             QuantiFERON®-TB test result at screening is positive all subjects must agree to
             complete an INH treatment course of at least 6 months

         12. Affiliated to National French social security system

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Infectious scleritis, or scleritis related to systemic diseases (i.e granulomatosis
             with polyangiitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, relapsing chondritis….)
