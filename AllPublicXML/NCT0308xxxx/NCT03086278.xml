    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects aged ≥18 and ≤40 years of age at the time of first
             dosing.

          2. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0-25.0 kg/m² inclusive.

          3. Satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically significant or relevant
             abnormalities as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs,
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluation (haematology, biochemistry,
             coagulation, and urinalysis) that is reasonably likely to interfere with the subject's
             participation in or ability to complete the study as assessed by the Investigator.

          4. Ability to provide written, personally signed, and dated informed consent to
             participate in the study, in accordance with the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
             Guideline E6 (1996) and applicable regulations, before completing any study-related
             procedures.

          5. An understanding, ability, and willingness to fully comply with study procedures and
             restrictions.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or recurrent disease (e.g., cardiovascular, haematological, neurological,
             endocrine, renal, liver, GI or other conditions) that could affect the action,
             absorption, or disposition of AST-008, or could affect clinical assessments or
             clinical laboratory evaluations.

          2. Any history of cancer.

          3. Any history (including significant and confirmed family history) of autoimmune or
             antibody-mediated diseases including but not limited to: systemic lupus erythematosus,
             rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis, or thrombocytopenia.

          4. Has had an acute illness within two weeks prior to screening.

          5. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness that may require
             treatment or make the subject unlikely to fully comply with the requirements of the
             study or complete the study, or any condition that presents undue risk from the
             investigational product or study procedures.

          6. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study may influence
             the result of the study, or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          7. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          8. Subjects with abnormal findings of inguinal, axillary, or cervical lymph nodes at
             screening or Day -1.

          9. A positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody screen, hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody screen.

         10. Titres above reference ranges (according to local laboratory) for autoimmune
             antibodies: rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil
             cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).
