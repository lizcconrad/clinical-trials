  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium may result in many adverse complications. At present little is known
      about postoperative delirium in patients after crniotomy because they may manifest similar
      symptoms to definitely delirium for some structural brain disease. Objective of this study is
      to find out incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium in patients after elective
      craniotomy and also the relationship of postoperative delirium with clinical outcome.

      The study is a prospective single-center cohort study. Consecutive adult patients admitted to
      the ICU after elective craniotomy is enrolled. Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) is
      used to assess level of consciousness of patients; if conditions met &quot;RASSâ‰¥-3&quot;, the Confusion
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit will proceed to evaluate delirium signs in
      patients. Delirium is assessed every 12-hour shift within 3 days during the patient's ICU
      stay and ended when discharged from ICU or dead, time started at 9am and 9pm. On the third
      day after operation when most patients have been transferred to general ward, delirium was
      assessed only at 9am for follow-up studies. Patients is divided into two groups via
      assessment of CAM-ICU: delirium groups and non-delirium groups. Factors potentially related
      to postoperative delirium are collected and categorized as preoperative, intraoperative and
      postoperative in chronological order. Univariate analyses between delirium groups and
      non-delirium groups is performed. The stepwise backward logistic regression is carried out to
      identify the independent predictors of delirium. Patients will be followed up until hospital
      discharge, death or 90 days after the enrollment. Clinical outcome such as days on the
      mechanical ventilator, endotracheal extubation time, need for re-intubation and tracheotomy,
      unexpected reoperation within 72 h after surgery, length of stay in the ICU , hospital costs
      and mortality will be registered.
