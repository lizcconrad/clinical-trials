    <textblock>
      This multicenter trial will be a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, 2 parallel
      groups study. The subjects will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups (placebo
      or nutrition product). The duration of the intervention is 4 years.

      The total sample size at baseline is 2080 subjects, consisting of non-demented adults with
      subjective memory concerns aged 70+ years.
