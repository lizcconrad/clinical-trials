    <textblock>
      This study will take advantage of the open source framework of ResearchKit developed by Apple
      to bring research directly to participants. Using the ResearchKit platform makes it easier to
      enroll large numbers of participants and carry out real-world health research to answer
      questions important to a broad population.

      -  Eligibility determined, Individuals enrolled and consented to join study

        -  Short Intake Survey (demographic and baseline health information collected)

        -  Health History Survey (two days after participant enrolls in the study)

        -  Survey questions about current health and medical history will be sent to participants
           weekly. If participants had a prenatal visit during the week, a few additional questions
           will be asked.

        -  Twins / Multiples survey will begin appearing when a participant indicates they are
           having more than one baby

        -  Participants can submit home measurements of, weight and blood pressure as frequently as
           they want through HealthKit.

        -  Pregnancy outcome variables. (Miscarriage, stillbirth, birth of healthy baby, or
           pregnancy ended) will also be asked weekly.

        -  If the baby is born, questions about labor and delivery, as well as weight, size and
           birth date of the baby will be asked. A reminder to fill out the outcome survey will be
           given 4 weeks after a user's due date.
