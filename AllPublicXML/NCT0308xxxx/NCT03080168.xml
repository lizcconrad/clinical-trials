  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research project looking at whether measuring movements or responses to certain
      questions can help predict suicidal thoughts or actions.

      This project has two parts: The first part will occur while the participant is receiving
      hospitalized at the Bedford VA Hospital. It involves wearing a watch-like device on his/her
      wrist and answering questions or doing tasks to measure mood and other mental health
      symptoms, and suicidal thoughts.

      In the second phase, the investigators will call the participant around 12 months after s/he
      has left the hospital. The investigators will discuss how s/he is doing and if s/he has had
      suicidal thoughts or made suicidal acts.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of Veterans will be conducted to determine if the
      previously-identified specific actigraphy-based measurements highly associated with suicidal
      ideation in non-Veterans will predict suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and/or
      rehospitalization in Veterans.

      METHODS: An analysis of Veterans admitted to the Bedford, Massachusetts VAMC acute psychiatry
      unit will be conducted. The primary analysis will focus upon Veterans with current suicidal
      ideation or recent suicidal behavior (SI/SB) who do not have a primary psychotic disorder,
      Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's disease, and who are not undergoing alcohol detoxification. A
      separate analysis will be conducted of patients undergoing alcohol detoxification, half with
      SI/SB and half without SI/SB. Participants will wear a small, unobtrusive, wristwatch-like
      actigraph on their nondominant wrist, and complete self-rated and clinician-rated assessments
      of suicidal ideation, as well as self-rated assessments of the severity of other psychiatric
      symptoms. A Resiliency Index (RI) will be calculated using nonlinear dynamic analysis of the
      amplitude of movements over time frames from 6 minutes - 2 hours. These time frames are the
      periods for which a clear structure to the movement data is evident, with patients with
      suicidal ideation showing less variation in amplitude than patients without suicidal
      ideation. If medications given for alcohol detoxification are determined to not interfere
      with the RI, then a secondary analysis will examine the entire sample of Veterans. One Aim
      will focus upon determining whether the original Resiliency Index or alternative movement
      data indices, such as one based on the change in the movement data over the hospitalization,
      predicts the presence and severity of suicidal ideation among Veteran inpatients. This aim
      will also examine the sensitivity and specificity of the RI for detecting the presence of any
      suicidal ideation, and of substantial suicidal ideation. (In non-Veterans, the RI showed a
      sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 100% for detecting any suicidal ideation, and 86% and
      88%, respectively, for detecting substantial ideation). In addition, the investigators may
      determine whether the RI predicts subsequent suicidal behavior or rehospitalization over
      different time periods within the original 12 month followup period, alone or combined with
      data about symptom severity, past history, and the present hospitalization.

    <measure>POST DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP (COMPOSITE): CSSRS Suicidal Behaviors (self-report), Rehospitalization with Suicidal Ideation (self-report), combined with chart data re Suicidal Behavior and Rehospitalization with Suicidal Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months since discharge from index hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will call clients and administer the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale to determine occurrence of all suicidal behavior (actual, interrupted, aborted, and preparatory), ask them to also self-report rehospitalization with suicidal ideation (SI), and use VA chart data as another source of information about suicidal behavior and rehospitalization. The data will then be reconciled and combined into a measure of Suicidal Behavior or rehospitalization with suicidal ideation over the 12 months since discharge.</description>

    <time_frame>Duration of Inpatient Stay (Daily Measures, up to 365 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rank the Severity and Duration of their suicidal thinking on 0-10 scales each day, This outcome will look at the distribution of the interaction between the scores (e.g., multiplicative/multiplication of scores) and determine whether that simple interaction/combination will be used, log or otherwise transformed, and/or more weighting given to duration than severity, etc. This determination will be made on the spread of this data, not any information about how it correlates with actigraphy or other data gathered. This is being designated a secondary outcome simply because how the measure will be determined is not yet specified, but it is expected that this composite measure will likely have a stronger association with actigraphy and other RFs (risk factors)/predictors than simply the severity of suicidal ideation, one of the co-primary outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Maximum severity of suicidal ideation in 12 months post-discharge (self-report, 0-10 scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>We have created our own 0-10 scale of the highest intensity of suicidal thinking a participant experienced in the 12 months post-discharge. This will be used for some of the secondary analyses of outcomes 12 months after discharge. While it is not validated, it has the advantage that, as opposed to any Yes/No events (rehospitalization, experiencing of a certain severity of suicidal thinking), that every study participant will have a value on this particular scale.</description>
