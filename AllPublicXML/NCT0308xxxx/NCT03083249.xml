  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common viral genital tract infection. The majority of
      women and men who are sexually active will be exposed to a strain or strains of the virus.
      While there are hundreds of viral strains, high risk strains are associated cervical and oral
      cancers. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), between 2008 and 2012 there were
      38,793 deaths attributed to HPV related cancers. Vaccinations were created in an attempt to
      prevent infection from the most common high risks strains of HPV. Gardasil/HPV-9 was created
      to help prevent HPV related cancers and warts. The HPV-9 vaccine includes protection from 7
      strains of HPV associated with 74% of HPV related cancers. While Gardasil was approved and
      released in 2006, many men and women have not been vaccinated. A national immunization survey
      in 2011 of teens 13-17 years old noted that only 60% of girls and 40% of boys have received
      at least one vaccination in the series. While complete vaccination series is recommended, a
      recent study found that a single dose of Gardasil when compared to placebo created a higher
      level of serum antibodies in uninfected females.

      All patients seen at a single clinic will be offered participation in the anonymous survey.
      The survey will ask a series of questions regarding basic demographics, sexual history,
      smoking status, and Gardasil vaccine knowledge. The survey will serve as evidence of the
      vaccine utility by highlighting patient risk factors for HPV and patient knowledge about the
      vaccine series.
