      Background.

      Although a healthy urinary system is a vital aspect in every woman's life, bladder management
      is an aspect of maternity care, which is, or perceived as, being poorly managed by health
      care professionals. Furthermore, although the relationship between childbirth and bladder
      dysfunction is an incontestable fact very well documented in the medical literature, women's
      experiences of bladder care have not been recognized by the evidence, and therefore, no
      research has been developed to address this topic. This fact implies a limited level of
      awareness and degree of implication from women in this matter.

      Research question.

      What are women's experiences, perceptions and knowledge of bladder care during the
      antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum period?

      Aim.

      To explore women's experiences of bladder care during the antepartum, intrapartum and
      postpartum period.

      Design.

      Exploratory, descriptive research study.

      Population.

      Women who have given birth to a singleton, live, term baby between two weeks and six months
      prior the study, and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Methods.

      In-depth semi-structured interviews.

      Sample.

      A purposive sample of eight to sixteen women, with a heterogeneous representation of the
      different modes of birth, will be sought.

      Recruitment.

      Postnatal midwives will act as gatekeepers identifying potential participants and providing
      information packs. Other recruitment resources will include posters and a study website,
      which will be advertised at local maternity groups.

      Data collection.

      Semi-structure interviews to gain a deep understanding of women's experiences of maternity
      bladder care. Interviews will last between thirty minutes to a couple of hours and they will
      be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim.

      Data Analysis.

      Framework analysis assisted by memoing technique.

      Ethical considerations.

      Ethical approval from the Sponsor and the Health Research Authority will be sought.
