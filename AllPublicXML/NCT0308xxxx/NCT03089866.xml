  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to allow the anesthesiologist to make a more informed decision
      about the anesthetic requirement of a person prior to starting anesthesia. The preliminary
      data collected in this study will support a larger investigation aimed at gaining a better
      understanding of anesthetic susceptibility in general and in the elderly population which
      appears to be at greater risk for Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD)

      POCD is a short-term decline in cognitive function (especially in memory and executive
      functions) that may last from a few days to a few weeks after surgery. In rare cases, this
      disorder may persist for several months after major surgery. POCD is distinct from emergence
      delirium. It occurs most commonly in older patients and those with pre-existing cognitive
      impairment. POCD is common in adult patients of all ages at hospital discharge after major
      non-cardiac surgery, but only the elderly (aged 60 years or older) are at significant risk
      for long-term cognitive problems. The body's inflammatory response to surgery likely plays an
      important role, at least in elderly patients. Investigators also postulate that a relative
      'anesthetic overdose' may be a significant risk factor. Hence, being able to make a better
      judgment on the dose needed for an individual is extremely important.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system (CNS) function is affected by sedation and anesthesia. This is evident
      from the desired clinical effects of sedative and anesthetic drugs. Recent evidence suggests
      that disruption CNS function may be prolonged and result in unwanted cognitive effects in
      predisposed individuals. Investigators know that there is a considerable pharmacokinetic
      (onset, distribution and elimination) and pharmacokinetic variability of neurotropic drugs
      even with in persons within a certain age and weight group. What the investigators do not
      know, is how to predict or quantify an individual's susceptibility to sedation and anesthesia
      and, more importantly, the potential cognitive susceptibility of an individual's brain to
      these drugs.

      Auditory functional imaging is a well validated task. It can be applied as a short (5 minute)
      test. Investigators know (preliminary data) that the size of the brain activation area
      changes after sedation. Investigators now postulate that this change reflects a disruption of
      neuronal integration in the brain and that this change may be an objective measure of the
      cognitive effects of sedation for an individual.

      As supportive data for an R-01 grant application the investigators propose to enroll 20
      elderly subjects by public advertisement and quantify the effects of sedation with midazolam
      on auditory activation (auditory fMRI) and cognitive performance (mini Mental State exam and
      complex reaction time).
