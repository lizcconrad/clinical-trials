  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot safety and efficacy trial for adults who are active on the heart
      or lung transplantation lists and are eligible to receive an organ from an increased risk
      donor who has evidence of active or prior hepatitis C infection (HCV).

    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study transplanting thoracic organs from Hepatitis C positive
      donors into HCV uninfected recipients at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Heart and lung
      transplant participants will be stratified into two different study arms depending on whether
      the donor of the thoracic organ was HCV nucleic acid amplifications technology (NAT) positive
      or negative. In the NAT positive arm, the recipients will receive a course of direct acting
      antivirals (DAA) to begin on the day of transplant, or at the earliest time point
      post-transplant. If the donor was HCV antibody (Ab) positive and NAT negative, the recipients
      will receive close monitoring with serial HCV viral loads (VL) and will only begin treatment
      with DAA if they develop HCV viremia.
