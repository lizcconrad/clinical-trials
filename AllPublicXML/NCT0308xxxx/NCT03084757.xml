  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapy based on tumor molecular profiling
      versus conventional chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer using each patient as its
      own control. This study is a study involving patients with advanced cancer. All types of
      solid tumors will be allowed in the study.
