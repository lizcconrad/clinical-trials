  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention
      designed to reduce psychological distress among African Americans during treatment for
      cancer. This knowledge will inform a larger test of an intervention tailored to decrease the
      psychological distress experienced among African Americans diagnosed with late-stage cancers.
      Study participants will take part in 4 data collection sessions and also asked to view and
      provide feedback on audio- or video recorded vignettes of African Americans use of hymns to
      reduce psychological distress during the diagnosis and treatment for cancer. Participants
      will also be asked to complete interviews at the 4 time periods which will include
      open-ended, semi-structured interviews, and structured interview questions. This study
      addresses the need to understand the ways in which narrated messages of hope through hymns
      and African American religious song in particular, reduce psychological distress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans have a strong cultural history of relying on hymns to overcome oppression
      and mental suffering encountered in their lived experience. This study will evaluate the
      feasibility and acceptability of an intervention using hymns in reducing psychological
      distress among African Americans during treatment for cancer. Study participants will take
      part in 4 data collection sessions and also asked to view and provide feedback on audio- or
      video recorded vignettes of African Americans use of hymns to reduce psychological distress
      during the diagnosis and treatment for cancer. The findings from this preliminary study will
      contribute to the body of research about incorporating spirituality in cancer care to
      achieving optimal patient outcomes.

      This feasibility study uses a randomized control design and qualitative methods to: 1)
      determine feasibility and acceptability, and 2) estimate effect sizes for outcomes of
      psychological distress, spiritual well-being, patient-physician communication, supportive
      family relationships, and quality of life. African American patients with late stage cancer
      and their FCGs will be randomized to receive the Overcoming Psychological Distress through
      Hymns Intervention or usual care for 3 weeks. At the end of the intervention period, the
      usual care study arm usual will receive the 3 week intervention. Participants will have 4
      study visits where they will complete questionnaires and take part in open-ended,
      semi-structured interviews and structured interviews. Questions asked will focus on
      demographic characteristics of the sample such as age, education, whether residence is urban
      or rural, religious affiliation, marital status, proximity to family, type cancer, date of
      diagnosis, date of treatment. Structured interview questions will include measures of
      psychological distress, spiritual well-being, relationship well-being, patient-physician
      communication, and quality of life. Open ended interviews will focus on usefulness and
      satisfaction with the video and audio recordings. Open ended interviews will be
      audio-recorded. Participants will be in the study for 12 weeks to complete all follow up
      visits.

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological distress for patients and family caregivers (FCGs) will be measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a 14-item self-report screening scale for anxiety and depressive states, with 7 items assessing anxiety and 7 items assessing depression. Respondents indicate the degree of anxiety or depression they are feeling on a scale of 0 to 3. Score totals for each subscale range from 0 to 21, where a score of 0-7 = &quot;normal&quot;, 8-10 = &quot;borderline abnormal&quot; and 11-21 = &quot;abnormal&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Physician communication for patients and FCGs is measured with the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey: Short Form (IPC-18). The IPC-18 is an 18-item questionnaire that assesses seven different aspects of physician interactions: lack of clarity, elicited concerns/responded, explained results, worked together, compassionate/respectful, discriminated due to race/ethnicity, disrespectful office staff. Sub-scale scores have a range from 1-5, and they vary in terms of interpretation (high score equals worse processes for &quot;lack of clarity&quot;, &quot;discriminated due to race/ethnicity&quot;, and &quot;disrespectful staff&quot; while a high score indicates better process for the other four sub-scales).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Relationship well-being for patients and FCGs is measured with the Supportive Family Relationships (Mutuality) Scale. The Mutuality scale measures the degree to which the caregiver-care receiver relationship is characterized by love, shared values, shared pleasurable activities, and reciprocity. The adapted scale for patients has 12-items with a 5-point (0-4) response format (total score ranges from 0 to 48). The scale for caregivers has 15 items (total score ranges from 0 to 60). Higher scores are indicative of engagement in positive supportive relationships with family and friends</description>

    <description>Spiritual well-being is measured with the 12-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being questionnaire (FACIT-SP-12) which assesses a sense of meaning, peace, and comfort and strength derived from faith. The FACIT-SP-12 has a 5-point Likert-type scale format. Total scores range from 0 to 48 with higher scores indicating higher levels of spiritual well-being.</description>

    <measure>Change in Short Form-12 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-12) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-12 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-12) (version 2) is a measure of general physical and mental health. The SF-12 consists of 12 items with a Likert-type response format that measures quality of life with a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Subscales associated with the PCS include physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. Subscales associated with the MCS include vitality (energy and fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The total score for each subscale ranges from 0 to 100 and low values represent a poor health state while high values represent a good health state.</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of participants viewing a selection of video recorded vignettes during 3 weekly sessions. There will be 5 vignettes included in each session with each vignette edited to a real time of 3-4 minutes (each session is 30 minutes). Since the intervention is designed to be self-administered, there will be a video recorded introduction and instructions for use narrated by the PI. The vignettes are of actual African American cancer survivors narrating stories of ways in which hymns can be used to overcome their anxieties and depressed moods through the use of a hymn. The hymns included represent exemplars from the 5 themes prevalent in the PI's previous research</description>
