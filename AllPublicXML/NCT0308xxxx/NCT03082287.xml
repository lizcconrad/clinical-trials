    <textblock>
      The ALPCO Calprotectin ELISA is an in vitro diagnostic test intended to quantitatively
      measure concentrations of fecal calprotectin in human stool samples. Calprotectin is a
      protein biomarker of mucosal inflammation. Measurement of calprotectin can aid in the
      diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), specifically Crohn's Disease (CD) and
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC), as well as aid in the differentiation of IBD from Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome (IBS) when used in conjunction with other diagnostic testing and the total clinical
      picture. This study will estimate the predictive values of a negative (NPV) and positive
      (PPV) test by utilizing the assay outcomes of the ALPCO Calprotectin ELISA.

             disorder, confirmed by medical history and physical examination at enrollment.

          -  May have undergone colonoscopy with negative findings within the past 1 month or may
             have no recent colonoscopy, but scheduled for routine screening colonoscopy.
