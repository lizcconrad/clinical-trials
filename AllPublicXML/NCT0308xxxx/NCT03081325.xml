  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent miscarriage(RM) and recurrent implantation failure (RIF) are clinical challenge for
      clinicians and patients who are desperate for a healthy child.The specific etiology contains
      chromosomal abnormalities, reproductive anatomical abnormalities, endocrine disorders,
      reproductive system infections, autoimmune and environmental factors. However there are still
      50% to 60% RM and RIF which don't have a clear cause,mainly associated with alloimmune
      factors.Among various treatments,lymphocytes active immunotherapy is the most common
      treatment method, and its clinical efficacy is widely recognized although its action
      mechanism is not clear so far.

      The main mechanism of active immunotherapy includes upregulating Th2-type cytokines,
      downregulating Th1-type cytokines, making Th1 / Th2 shift to Th2, inducing maternal serum
      IL-6 and sIL6R, PIBF, EGF; inducing the expression of Fas / Fasl on lymphocyte surface;
      increasing the proportion of CD8 + cells, Th2-type cells and CD + CD25 + Treg cells,
      decreasing the activity of CD56 + CD16 + NK cell and so on.The purpose of this study is to
      observe the treatment effects of active immunotherapy on uRM and RIF patients. What's more,we
      will used flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods to characterize
      Th1、Th2 and Treg cell populations after immunotherapy,ecpecting to find out the exact
      molecule mechanism of immunotherapy with paternal or third party lymphocytes.

    <description>Donor (husband or third party) lymphocytes were prepared by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation; the cells were washed with sterile saline and resuspended in 1 ml at a concentration of 20-40 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were given to the female partner by 4-6 intradermal injected. In this study, the lymphocyte immunization therapies were performed every 3 weeks for 3 times. After that we test Th1/Th2/Treg, if they become normal, the patients can prepare for pregnancy.</description>

    <description>Peripheral venous blood (PBMCs) was drawn from the husbands of uRM and RIF patients and then the PBMCs were resuspended and administered intradermally to uRM and RIF patients 3 times at 3-week intervals. Once conceived, the uRM and RIF patients undergo 2 rounds of treatment at 8-week intervals.</description>
