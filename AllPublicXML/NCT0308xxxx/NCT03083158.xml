  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection and cancer is a major cause of death and morbidity, and may be preventable through
      vaccination. It is not fully understood at the molecular level why some people respond better
      than others to vaccines until now the technology to assess this has not been available. This
      has impaired vaccine development. The overall goal of the Human Vaccines Project is to
      understand the 'rules' of how vaccines work. In this demonstration project the investigators
      will vaccinate healthy adults with hepatitis B vaccine to start to understand better how it
      works, ultimately helping with rational vaccine design in the future.

          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the study, or may
             influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability to participate in the
             study.

          -  Temporary exclusion if acute symptomatic illness in the 7 days prior to planned first
             vaccine dose - vaccination will be delayed, but participant can remain in the study.
