  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 120 patients with pathologically confirmed Locally advanced cervical carcinoma
      were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, with 60 patients in each
      group. One group was treated with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar and the
      other group was treated with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy. The short term efficacy and the
      toxic of these treatments were evaluated. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year overall survival and
      progression-free survival of patients were analyzed. The investigators data may provide an
      alternative option for the treatment of Locally advanced cervical carcinoma with high
      efficacy and low toxicity.

      This study was a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial. A set of unified
      standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria, exclusion
      criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. Nine medical centers
      participated in this study and 120 patients with pathologically confirmed Locally advanced
      cervical carcinoma were enrolled. These patients were randomly divided into two groups:
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar group ( IMRT 45-50Gy, DDP 40mg/m2, per
      week for 5cycles, Endostar: 7.5mg/m2 d1-10, repeat every 15 days, for 4 cycles) and
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ( IMRT 45-50Gy, DDP 40mg/m2, per week, for 5cycles). After
      treatment, follow-up was performed every 3 months. The treatment toxicity, local control
      rate, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival, progression-free survival were
      observed and assessed.
