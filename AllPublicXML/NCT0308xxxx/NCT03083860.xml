    <description>BrainMARC Ltd. has demonstrated in recent years the ability to extract effective attention markers from averaged ERP waves sampled with a single EEG channel (two electrodes). In addition, BrainMARC has developed a template matching method to extract the attention-related markers at the single-trial level. An index (termed Brain Engagement Index - BEI) can then be generated from a 1-minute, single-channel sample.</description>
