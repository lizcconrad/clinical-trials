  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to determine whether caffeine therapy is associated with decreases
      bone mineral content using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Secondary objectives were to
      determine whether caffeine therapy is associated with increased incidence of nephrocalcinosis
      or bone fracture.

    <description>Whole Body Scanner, Pencil beam, regions: antro-posterior Spine, Lateral, Hip, Forearm/ Hand, Ortho Femur Speed: Up To 76mm Per Sec., Scan Times (min): antro-posterior Spine-2, Lateral-12, Hip-4, Forearm-1, Femur-4 Pentium II Computer System, Windows O/S, Lunar Software 15&quot; Hi-Resolution Monitor, Auto Centering Laser Guide, Data Analysis: Auto Analysis Software, Smart Scan, Auto Position. Weight and length were measured and recorded. During the scan an infant was placed on the scanning table with the head at the marked start line, assuring that the position was the same for all subjects. The study was carried out with the infants sleeping without sedation. The infants were placed supine and were restrained with a cotton blanket. To induce sleep, infants were fed a few minutes prior to the study. When image quality was poor due to movement of the infant or to other causes the measurement at that time point was not included for analysis.</description>
