  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this double blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial, 160 subjects scheduled for breast
      surgery involving the axilla will be administered a multimodal pain regimen including
      acetaminophen, dexamethasone, celecoxib, and gabapentin. 80 subjects will also receive a
      Pectoral Nerve blocks I and II (PECS I and II block) preoperatively.

    <measure>Change in persistent postoperative pain compared with multimodal analgesia as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>BPI scores will be compared between groups by Mann Whitney U and adjusted for known confounders and baseline pain by rank ANCOVA regression.
Administered baseline, 2 weeks post-op, 6 months post-op, and 12 months post-op
Modified BPI baseline: 10 questions regarding current pain felt, medications taken for pain, pain relief, and how pain has affected daily living
Follow-up BPI: 12 questions regarding current pain felt, medications taken for pain, pain relief, and how pain has affected daily living</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative quality of life as measured by the Veterans RAND12 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the 1 year VR12 score from baseline results will be compared between study groups by Mann Whitney U and adjusted for known confounders using ANCOVA regression analysis.
The 12 items in the questionnaire correspond to eight principal physical and mental health domains including general health perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical and emotional problems; bodily pain; energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health.. The 12 items are summarized into two scores, a &quot;Physical Health Summary Measure and a &quot;Mental Health Summary Measure.</description>

    <description>PECS I &amp; II block will be administered preoperatively
For unilateral surgeries, PECS I block will be performed bupivacaine. The PECS II block will be performed with the same solution. If there is a contralateral surgery (simple mastectomy) a PECS II block will also be performed on the other side.
To ensure blind integrity, study drug syringes will be marked only &quot;study drug&quot; and subject number
Perioperative analgesic will be standardized. Gabapentin 300mg, celecoxib 200mg and acetaminophen 1000mg will be administered to all patients following arrival to the preoperative area. All patients will receive premedication of 1-2 mg midazolam IV (age &lt; 65) and 50-100 μg fentanyl IV prior to the block placement or entry to the operating room at the discretion of the regional team or operating room anesthesiologist</description>

To ensure blind integrity, study drug syringes will be marked only &quot;study drug&quot; and subject number.
Perioperative analgesic regimen will be standardized for research subjects. Gabapentin 300mg, celecoxib 200mg and acetaminophen 1000mg will be administered to all patients following arrival to the preoperative holding area. On the day of surgery all patients will receive premedication of 1-2 mg midazolam IV (age &lt; 65) and 50-100 μg fentanyl IV prior to the block placement or entry to the operating room at the discretion of the regional team or operating room anesthesiologist.</description>
