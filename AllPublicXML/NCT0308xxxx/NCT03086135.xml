        3 kHz) in the good ear OR subject who is indicated for an AC CROS but—for some
        reason—cannot or will not use an AC CROS (Air Conduction-Contralateral Routing of Signal).

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Previous experience from amplified sound though a non-surgical solution. (For example

             headband/ softband)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes as judged by the investigator.

          -  Condition that could jeopardise osseointegration and/or wound healing (e.g.
             osteoporosis, psoriasis, long-term systemic use of corticosteroids) or condition that
             may have an impact on the outcome of the investigation as judged by the investigator.

          -  Insufficient bone quality and quantity for implantation of a BI300 Implant.

          -  Subject that has received radiotherapy in the area of implantation, or is planned for
             such radiotherapy during the study period

          -  Use of ototoxic drugs that could be harmful to the hearing, as judged by the
             investigator

          -  Unable to follow investigational procedures, e.g. to complete quality of life scales.

          -  Participation in another clinical investigation with pharmaceutical and/or device.
