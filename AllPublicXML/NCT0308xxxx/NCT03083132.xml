  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait is a late stage complication of Parkinson's disease in which patients note
      that their feet feel stuck or glued to the ground. This can lead to imbalance and falls and
      the secondary complications that can result from falls such as fractures and
      hospitalizations. While levodopa can help freezing of gait in some patients, it does not help
      in all, and the dose needed to treat freezing may be limited by side effects of the
      medications. Currently there are no treatments targeted towards freezing of gait and the goal
      of this research is to see if Modafinil could be one such drug to help freezing of gait in
      Parkinson's disease.

      20 subjects aged 18 or older with idiopathic Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait will
      be asked to enroll in the study from the patient population in the movement disorders clinic
      at UAMS. Subjects will be assigned randomly 1:1 to an early start and delayed start arm of
      the study. In the early start arm subjects will receive 24 weeks of 50 mg oral daily
      Modafinil while subjects in the delayed start arm will receive 12 weeks of placebo followed
      by 12 weeks of 50 mg oral daily Modafinil. Assessments will be performed prior to initiation
      of medication at the screening visit, as well as at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 18 weeks and 24 weeks
      of the treatment phase, in addition to 2 weeks after discontinuation of medications. The
      assessments will include questionnaires to determine the frequency and severity of freezing
      of gait, level of mood, anxiety and apathy and quality of life, physical examination and
      tests of cognitive function. Objective assessment of patients walking will be conducted using
      a pressure sensor impregnated mat at each visit.
