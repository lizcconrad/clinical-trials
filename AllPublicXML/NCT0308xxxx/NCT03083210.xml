  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical data from uncontrolled retrospective or prospective studies have initially
      demonstrated antiproliferative effects of lanreotide in limited number of patients lanreotide
      Autogel® has recently been approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of GEP-NET
      patients, this is based on the results of CLARINET study, the largest prospective trial to
      evaluate the antiproliferative effects of lanreotide Autogel® in subjects with nonfunctional
      GEP-NETs. The study enrolled 204 subjects (101 subjects were randomized to lanreotide
      Autogel® group and 103 subjects were randomized to placebo group, came from 14 countries)
      with well or moderately differentiated non-functioning GEP-NETs, including pancreatic and
      gastrointestinal tumors, and defined as having less than 10% of proliferation marker Ki67.
      The study had shown that treatment with lanreotide Autogel® significantly prolonged
      progression-free survival in subjects with GEP-NETs compared to treatment with placebo in the
      primary analysis (median progression-free survival, not reached vs. 18.0 months, P&lt; 0.001 by
      the stratified log-rank test; hazard ratio for progression or death with lanreotide vs.
      placebo, 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.30 to 0.73) [5].

      The indication of GEP-NETs granted for lanreotide Autogel® in the USA is for the treatment of
      patients with unresectable, well or moderately differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) to improve progression-free survival;
      and in the European Union (EU) is for treatment of grade 1 and a subset of grade 2 (Ki67
      index up to 10%) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of midgut, pancreatic or
      unknown origin where hindgut sites of origin have been excluded, in adult patients with
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. The addition of an indication for the
      treatment of patients with GEP-NETs has been approved by more than 15 other authorities
      including in Canada, Australia and some Asian countries, etc.
