  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients often have associated systemic hypertension due to
      volume retention, as one of the mechanisms, therefore the use of diuretics is widespread in
      this population. One of the major complications of CKD is mineral and bone metabolism
      disorder (CKD-MBD), which include changes in the levels of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D
      deficiency, increased circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23) and parathyroid
      hormone (PTH). These alterations are responsible for fractures, cardiovascular disease and
      mortality among patients with CKD. According to diuretic mechanism of action, sometimes
      increasing serum calcium (in the case of furosemide), sometimes decreasing it (in the case of
      thiazide), it is expected that the serum calcium may be altered, even within the range of
      normality, with consequent impact on the levels of PTH. Although most studies have shown that
      the use of thiazide diuretics decreases the risk of fractures, some showed the opposite.
      Similarly, although most studies have shown increased risk of fracture in association to loop
      diuretics use, some have failed in demonstrated this outcome. Only one study, a cohort study
      in a population of CKD, showed that furosemide was directly related to increased calciuria
      and PTH levels and the use of thiazide, in turn, showed completely opposite effect. However,
      certain issues are still not completely solved, for example, the interference of renal
      function itself on calciuria. It is possible that calciuria is not a so simple explanation
      that justifies the PTH levels changes, as no correlation was seen between calciuria and PTH
      levels. Better understanding of the exact relationship between the use of diuretics and the
      impact on CKD-MBD may be an alternative intervention, easily accessible and relatively
      inexpensive. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of diuretic, specifically
      hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide, on bone architecture and mineral metabolism.

      This is a prospective randomized study to test the effects of thiazide and furosemide in bone
      parameters, which will be assessed by peripheral micro-tomography at baseline and 12 months
      later. The role of calciuria in these possible changes will be tested.
