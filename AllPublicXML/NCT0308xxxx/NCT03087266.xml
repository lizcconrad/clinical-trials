  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-eight periodontitis- and diabetes-affected subjects will be randomly allocated to non
      surgical periodontal treatment with either Full-Mouth Approach (FM-SRP) or Quadrant approach
      (Q-SRP).

      Patients will be seen one day and three months (study completion) after treatment. The 24
      hours appointment will be occurring after the entire completion of the FM-SRP or the first
      quadrant of the Q-SRP. In the latter group other sessions of treatment will be performed
      within the following 3 weeks.

      At baseline, 24 hours and three months, anthropometric, inflammatory and endothelial
      parameters will be collected. Periodontal parameters will be checked at baseline and at three
      months.

      Main outcome of the study is the level of C-reactive protein 24 hours after treatment.
