  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The task of caring for an individual with Alzheimer's disease is often carried out by elderly
      caregivers who, due to their motor and psychosocial alterations due to the aging process, may
      also be exposed to the development of the frailty syndrome. Therefore, it is necessary to
      promote the engagement and adherence of these caregivers in physical activities. In this
      sense, circle dances have received attention, either as a modality of physical activity or
      therapy, and, although little studied, seem to be an appropriate type of intervention for the
      elderly caregivers. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of circle dances
      on cognitive, psychological, physical and frailty-related variables in elderly caregivers of
      Alzheimer's patients. It is expected that the practice of circle dances will be able to
      reduce stress levels and depressive symptoms of elderly caregivers; Reduce and / or maintain
      the perception of care overload and improve some functional components such as: mobility;
      balance; muscle strength of legs; walking speed; fatigue and level of physical activity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brazilian Version of the Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Battery tests that evaluate the static balance; the speed of gait and lower limb muscle strength. Each test ranges from zero to four points, and the total score is obtained by summing the score of each test, ranging from zero to 12 points. The result can receive the following graduation: 0 to 3 points: incapacity or very poor performance; 4 to 6 points: low performance; 7 to 9 points: moderate performance; 10 to 12 points: good performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Test that evaluates the basic functional mobility through the time spent by the elderly to get up from a chair with arms, walk 3 meters and return to the chair, as well as the number of steps required to perform the activity. The shorter the time to perform the task, the better the mobility index. Thus, if the individual takes up to 20 seconds to complete the task, it is considered independent in the basic activities of daily living, and if it takes more than 30 seconds, it has an increased risk of falls and functional dependence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frailty Phenotype</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The test battery proposed by Fried et al. (2001) than by evaluating unintentional weight loss; exhaustion; Decrease in manual grip strength and walking speed and low level of physical activity, the elderly can be classified as fragile, if they score in 3 or more criteria; Pre-fragile, score in 1 or 2 criteria or as non-fragile, if they do not score.</description>

    <measure>Addenbrooke Cognitive Exam - Revised Version</measure>

    <description>Portuguese version of the Instrument that evaluates the global cognitive function through individual tests of orientation and attention (18 points), memory (26 points), verbal fluency (14 points), language (26 points) and spatial visibility skills (16 points) . The overall score ranges from 0 to 100 points.</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>An instrument validated in Brazil that evaluates the presence of depressive symptoms in the elderly through a scale composed of 15 negative / affirmative questions, with a cut mark equal to five points.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Burden Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>An instrument translated into Portuguese and validated to evaluate the physical, psychological and social impact of the task of caring for a patient with mental illness. The scale is composed of 22 questions, whose scores can range from 0 to 88 points. Score below 21 points is classified as no overload; Of 21 and 40 points indicate moderate overload; Between 41 to 60, moderate to severe overload and ≥ 61 points, severe overload.</description>
