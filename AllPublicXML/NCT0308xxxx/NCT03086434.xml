  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate an after-school substance abuse prevention intervention, compared
      to a standard substance abuse education program, targeting 6th grade AI youth in three AI
      communities: Ojibwe/Chippewa in Minnesota, Choctaw in Oklahoma, and Lumbee in North Carolina.

      A community-based participatory research approach will be used to culturally and
      technologically adapt the intervention. A two-condition controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy of the intervention to increase AI youth Native self-reliance while decreasing AI
      youth substance use involvement. An adult training program second level intervention study
      will also be implemented to train tribal personnel from the three regional tribes on how to
      implement the intervention as a tribal program beyond the study period.

      Effectiveness will be determined by a small partial cross-over randomized trial comparing the
      intervention to a wait-list control condition. Process evaluations will focus on the future
      adoption and implementation of the intervention, and recommendations for sustainable
      adaptations.

      The proposed study will consist of a 5-year plan: Year 1 has been completed and consisted of
      strengthening and extending community partnerships in each community and collecting data that
      will inform the cultural adaptation and tailoring of the intervention; Years 2, 3, and 4 will
      entail implementation by using a two-condition controlled study in which the culturally
      competent intervention is compared to standard care; and Year 5 will consist of final data
      collection, analysis of results, dissemination of results to local communities, and
      finalization of a sustainability plan for each Tribe.

      Participants in the proposed study will consist of 540 male and female American Indian 6th
      grade students who represent at least three different Tribes - Choctaw, Ojibwe/ Chippewa, and
      Lumbee, in three different regions of the U.S. Participants will also include 70 tribal
      personnel (adults 18 and over) who be trained to implement the intervention in Years 3 &amp; 4 of
      the project. Finally, 15-20 stakeholders and community partnership members will be
      interviewed at various stages of this project.
