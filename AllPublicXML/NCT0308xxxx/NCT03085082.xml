  <brief_summary>

      the study is searching if there is a relationship between the blood groups and RH and the
      skeletal malocclusion using the skeletal class I as a control group

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on the patients seeking medical care in the orthodontic
      department Cairo University, for six months all patients with class II and class III
      malocclusion will be recruited based on Wits appraisal measured from the cephalometric X-ray
      taken routinely during orthodontic examination. Then a group of class I arch length
      discrepancy patients will be used as control. A blood sample will be withdrawn and taken to
      the Cairo university laboratory to analyze the blood group and RH .a statistical analysis
      will be performed to detect a relationship between skeletal malocclusion and the blood groups
      as compared to the control

    <description>If skeletal malocclusion subjects were found to have a high percentage of a certain blood type or RH when compared to the control group it will be reported that there is a relationship between blood group and skeletal malocclusion. If percentages of blood groups are approximately the same in the malocclusion subjects and the control then the investigator will report that there is no relationship between blood groups and skeletal malocclusion</description>
