    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm Phase I study to establish the safety and feasibility of
      intravenously administered lentivirally transduced dual PSMA-specific/ TGFβ-resistant CAR
      modified autologous T cells (CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells) in patients with metastatic castrate
      resistant prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentivirally transduced
      PSMA-TGFβRDN autologous CAR T cells administered with and without cyclophosphamide in a 3+3
      dose escalation design. Cohort 1 subjects (N=3 or 6) will receive a single dose of 1-3 x
      107/m2 lentivirally transduced CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells on day 0 without any conditioning
      chemotherapeutic regimen. If the number of manufactured CAR T cells does not meet the
      pre-specified minimum infused dose of 1 x 107/m2 cells, then dose will not be administered,
      and the subject will be replaced in the study. If 1 DLT/3 subjects occurs, the study will
      enroll an additional 3 subjects at this dose level. If 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects
      occurs, the study will advance to Cohort 2.

      If 2 DLT/3 subjects occurs at dose of 1-3 x 107/m2 cells, then enrollment in this Cohort will
      be stopped and the dose will be de-escalated by 10-fold to 1-3 x 106 cells/m2 (Cohort -1). In
      this situation, up to 6 subjects will be enrolled in Cohort

      -1. Cohort 2 subjects (N=3 or 6) will receive a single dose of 1-3 x 108/m2 lentivirally
      transduced CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic
      regimen. If the number of manufactured CAR T cells does not meet the protocol-specified
      minimum of 1 x 108/m2 cells, but does meet the minimum dose requirement of at least 1 x
      107/m2 cells, then the subject may receive the dose and will not be included in the DLT
      assessment for Cohort 2. This subject would be replaced for DLT assessment. If, however, the
      number of manufactured CAR T cells does not meet the pre-specified minimum infused dose as
      outlined for Cohort 1, then no dose will be administered, and the subject will be replaced in
      the study. If 1 DLT/3 subjects occurs, the study will enroll an additional 3 subjects at this
      dose level. If 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects occurs, the study will advance to Cohort
      3. If 2 DLT/3 subjects occur, then the study will stop and declare maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). Cohorts 1 and 2 will serve to identify the MTD of CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose at which 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs occur. Cohort 3
      subjects (N=3 or 6) will receive a single infusion at the MTD of lentivirally transduced
      CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells on day 0, following a single dose of 1.0 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide
      administered up to 4 days prior to the CAR T cells (day -3 ± 1 day). If 0 DLT /3 subjects
      occur, the study will enroll an additional 3 patients to confirm tolerability. If 1 DLT/3
      subjects occurs, the study will enroll an additional 3 subjects at this dose level. If two of
      the initial three subjects experience a DLT, three additional patients will be accrued with a
      dose reduction in the lymphodepleting chemotherapy to 500 mg/m2 administered up to 4 days
      prior to the CAR T cells (day -3 ± 1 day). The DLT observation period will be 28 days. The
      highest dose level where only 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs were observed in a given cohort will be defined
      as the MTD. Adverse event reporting will begin on Day 0 (Cohorts 1 and 2) or Day -3 ±1 day
      (Cohort 3) and continue through 2 years after the infusion or until subjects begin an
      alternative cancer-related treatment, whichever comes first. While on study, subjects will be
      continually reassessed for evidence of acute and cumulative toxicities.
