  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is very common in patients with fatty liver disease as evidenced by our
      observations in the Metabolic Liver Clinic and that reported by others. We also observed that
      patients with more severe fatty liver disease had lower Vitamin D concentrations. Others have
      shown that replacing Vitamin D in patients with cirrhosis is effective and even patients with
      Vitamin D replete status have lowering of Vitamin D over time if not supplemented.

      One of the measures of liver injury in NAFLD is the plasma concentration of ALT and we will
      use this to follow patients as is currently done as standard of care. All patients in the
      Metabolic Liver Clinic are being routinely screened for Vitamin D deficiency as standard of
      care and treatment is being started with oral supplementation, but there are not standardized
      protocols to determine success of therapy. We hypothesize that patients with NAFLD with low
      Vitamin D levels will respond appropriately to Vitamin D supplementation for 6 months.

        The study population for this study is patients who have fatty liver disease. Patients who
        have low vitamin D (&lt;30ng/dL) and patients who have normal vitamin D (&gt; or = to 30ng/dL)
        will be followed for six months and observed.
