      This is a randomized controlled trial of HER-2 positive breast cancer patients treated with
      lapatinib and paclitaxel vs herceptin and paclitaxel with sequential and synchronous
      anthracycline. Safety and efficacy are the primary endpoint. The positive expression of HER2
      was confirmed by postoperative pathology in patients with breast adenocarcinoma (IDC).
      Patients who had not received any chemotherapy and targeted anti HER2 therapy.

      In this study, the non inferiority design method, according to the wishes of patients and
      signed informed consent, randomly into the group, a total of 482 patients were enrolled in
      the trial group: the control group =1:1. The subjects were followed up for a total of 1
      years, until the disease progressed, and the toxicity was not tolerated.

      We want to study 84 months. The follow-up period was 5 years (the first adjuvant treatment
      time to the last follow-up) or the researchers decided to end the study.
