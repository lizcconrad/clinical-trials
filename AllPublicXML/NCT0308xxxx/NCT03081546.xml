      This study plans to assess the effectiveness of performance-based functional assessments
      (PBFAs) and cognitive assessments in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in Hispanic/Latino
      populations. The information from this study will be analyzed with data from the Rocky
      Mountain Alzheimer's Disease Center Bio-AD study (NCT02612376).
