  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in treating advanced
      esophageal cancer. Blood samples will also be collected for research purposes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ⅱ clinical study of ex-vivo knocked-out, expanded, and selected PD-1
      knockout-T cells from autologous origin. 21 advanced esophageal cancer patients are planned
      to receive two cycles of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells treatment. Biomarkers and
      immunological markers are collected and analyzed as well.

    <description>Peripheral blood lymphocytes will be collected and Programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) gene will be knocked out by CRISPR Cas9 in the laboratory (PD-1 Knockout T cells). The lymphocytes will be selected and expanded ex vivo and infused back into patients. To avoid allergic reactions, 50 mg hydrocortisone was intramuscularly injected into patient 30 min before cells infusion every time. Best supportive care was also provided for patients.
A total of 5.0 x 10^8/kg PD-1 Knockout T cells will be infused in one cycle. Patients continued receiving treatment unless they had unacceptable adverse effects, or progressive disease confirmed by CT and PET-CT or they withdrew consent.</description>
