      This randomized phase III trial studies the best dose of apixaban and how well it works in
      preventing secondary cancer related blood clots in cancer patients who have completed
      anticoagulation therapy. Apixaban may stop the clotting of blood by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for blood clotting.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Any episode of major bleeding including fatal bleeding or clinically relevant non-major
      bleeding.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The proportion of patients who experienced at least one such bleeding event within 6
      months of beginning treatment.

      II. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary
      embolism (PE), fatal PE, or arterial thromboembolism.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive lower dose apixaban orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 365 days.

      GROUP II: Patients receive higher dose apixaban PO BID for 365 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.

    <description>Patients will be analyzed according to the drug they received. The analysis of major bleeding plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events will primarily focus on those events which occurred during treatment or within 7 days of treatment discontinuation. Major bleeding events observed later will be described separately. Proportion of patients experiencing at least one bleeding event within 12 months of beginning treatment will be compared across the two study arms using a two-sample comparison of proportions with a one-sided alternative at a significance level of 5% (i.e. a ?Z? test).</description>
