  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy for the treatment
      of dry eye disease. One eye of the participant will be randomized to receive the IPL
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) affects tears and the front surface of the eye. Patients who have DED
      can experience symptoms of discomfort, blurry vision, redness, and pain. DED can also cause
      tears to become unstable which could result in damage to the front surface of the eye.

      There are two types of DED. The one the investigators are studying is called evaporative dry
      eye disease. This type of DED occurs because the pores on the eyelids are not functioning
      properly. In preliminary studies, a new treatment called Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) has shown
      promise to reduce signs and symptoms of evaporative DED. IPL is a non-invasive and non-laser
      light treatment that was approved in 1995 by the FDA for dermatology. It is commonly used for
      treatment of facial rosacea, acne, and hair, wrinkle and lesion removal. It is not currently
      approved for the treatment of dry eye disease. This treatment is thought to provide relief of
      evaporative DED symptoms and improve the expression of the pores on the edge of the eyelid.

    <description>Patients will complete the Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire at each visit. The scores from the 7 month phone call will then be compared to scores obtained at the baseline visit. The questionnaire is assessed on a scale of 0 to 100 with higher scores representing greater dry eye disease severity.</description>

    <description>Participants will have one eye randomized to receive the intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy treatment. Participants will receive approximately 15 light spots to areas around the eye, lower eyelid, cheek, side of the nose and temple. The energy level will be based on skin type. IPL will be administered 4 times throughout the study.</description>

    <description>Participants will have the other eye randomized to receive a sham treatment. The sham treatment will be conducted by placing the intense pulsed light (IPL) device to approximately 15 areas around the eye, lower eyelid, cheek, side of nose and temple without delivery of the light. The sham treatment will mimic the IPL treatment but no light will be delivered. Sham treatment will be administered 4 times throughout the study.</description>
