      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of high dose simvastatin in patients with GI cancers. Three
      dose levels will be evaluated. Simvastatin will be given at escalating dose of 7.5mg/kg bid,
      10mg/kg bid and ( ) mg/kg bid for 7 days and off treatment for 14 days (Final dose will be
      determined based on PK data of cohort 1 and 2). The treatment will be repeated every 3 weeks.
      The cohort size of at least 3 and up to 6 patients ('rolling six design') will be employed to
      improve the rate of accrual of patients to cohorts close to the presumed therapeutic dose by
      reducing the need for late replacement of patients who become non-evaluable during the DLT
      assessment period, whilst not compromising collection of safety data. The total number of
      patients will depend upon the number of dose adjustments necessary. And intra-patient dose
      escalation is not allowed.

          3. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer or
             gastric cancer

          4. For colorectal cancer, patients who progressed after 5FU or capecitabine,
             irinotecan,oxaliplatin, bevacizumab and cetuximab treatment (cetuximab is only for
             KRAS/NRAS wild type)

          5. For gastric cancer, patients who progressed after second line chemotherapy.

          6. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          7. Have evaluable disease based on RECIST v1.1 as determined by investigator.

          8. Be willing to provide blood sample for PK analysis.

          9. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.

         10. Demonstrate adequate organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior history of statins within 12 months from the date of study entry

          2. Patients with massive ascites or disseminated bone metastases

          3. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          4. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          7. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
