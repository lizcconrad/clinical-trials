  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Active learning is designed to pair physical activity with the teaching of
      academic content. This has been shown to be a successful strategy to increase physical
      activity and improve academic performance. The existing designs have confounded academic
      lessons with physical activity. As a result, it is impossible to determine if the subsequent
      improvement in academic performance is due to: (1) physical activity, (2) the academic
      content of the active learning, or (3) the combination of academic material taught through
      physical activity.

      Methods / Design: The Texas I-CAN project is a 3-arm, cluster randomized control trial in
      which 28 elementary schools were assigned to either control, math intervention, or spelling
      intervention. As a result, each intervention condition serves as an unrelated content control
      for the other arm of the trial, allowing the impact of physical activity to be separated from
      the content. That is, schools that perform only active math lessons provide a content control
      for the spelling schools on spelling outcomes. This also calculated direct observations of
      attention and behavior control following periods of active learning.

      Discussion: This design is unique in its ability to separate the impact of physical activity,
      in general, from the combination of physical activity and specific academic content. This, in
      combination with the ability to examine both proximal and distal outcomes along with measures
      of time on task will do much to guide the design of future, school-based interventions.
