  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative intestinal obstruction is one of the most common complication of
      gastrointestinal surgery, some research have confirmed that transcutaneous acupoint
      electrical stimulation (TEAS) can promote recovery of gastrointestinal function, reduce the
      incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, our goal is to investigate the effectiveness
      of TEAS in reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal obstruction after operation in
      perioperative.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive TEAS or Blank treatment
      (acupoints selection are same with the experimental group, connect stimulator for patients,
      but not don't give stimulus). The randomization sequence will be computer-generated, and
      randomization will be performed in blocks and will be stratified according to participating
      center. TEAS will be treated from 30 minutes before anesthesia induction, ending when teh
      operation complete. Time of first fart and food-taking ,time of have normal diet after the
      transplantation will be recorded. The participation of each patient is scheduled for 30 days.
