      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week chronic-dosing study
      to assess the efficacy and safety of BGF MDI compared to BFF MDI in subjects with moderate to
      very severe COPD. The study has a total of 7 visits over a Screening Period of up to 28 days
      and a Treatment Period of 12 weeks followed by a telephone follow-up call 14 days after the
      last dose of study drug.
