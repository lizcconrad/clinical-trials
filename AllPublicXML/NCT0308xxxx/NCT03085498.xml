  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study resembles a four-year follow-up on the influence of physical activity and fitness,
      blood pressure, BMI and stress on vascular health in primary schoolchildren. It examines the
      predictive value of retinal vessel diameters for the development of childhood hypertension.

      The study aims to examine the usefulness of retinal vessel analysis in childhood
      cardiovascular prevention. It investigates the long-term influence of physical activity and
      fitness on retinal vessel diameters, blood pressure, BMI and psychosocial stress in children.
      The study aims to set new standards for an integrative primary prevention concept to initiate
      healthy ageing from childhood to adulthood.

        This study will be designed as a four-year follow-up of the 2014 Sportcheck. All
        first-graders of primary schools in the canton Basel-Stadt took part in measurements of
        height, body weight and physical fitness during physical education lesson. From the 1255
        children, 540 (43%) were allowed by their parents to join additional measurements of blood
        pressure and retinal vessel diameters and filled in questionnaires. In the year 2018, all
        fifth-graders of Basel-Stadt will be invited to take part in the same measurements as in
        2014. All children will again conduct physical fitness tests and measurements of height and
        body weight during physical education. All children with an informed consent will
        participate in the same medical tests that were performed four years previously.
