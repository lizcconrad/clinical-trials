  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will verify the effect of the application of a substance (10% sodium hypoclorite
      -NaOCL) in dentin on noncarious cervical lesions, with the aim of increasing the longevity of
      the restorations performed in this type of lesion.

      The hypothesis of the present study is that the application of deproteinization solution
      after acid etching does not influence the failure rate of the restorations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the failure rates of composite restorations of
      non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) performed with or without the pre-treatment with 10%
      sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) on etched dentin.

      A randomized controlled split-mouth and double blind clinical trial will be carried out.
      Patients with at least two NCCL will be selected. Each patient will be received at least one
      pair of composite restorations (Filtek Z350/3M ESPE), bonded either with 2 techniques:
      control (acid etching + placebo solution for 60 seconds + Adper Single Bond 2/3M ESPE) or
      experimental (acid etching + 10% NaOCl for 60 seconds + Adper Single Bond 2). A calibrated
      examiner will be evaluated the restorations (baseline, 6-, 12-, 24- and 36-month) using the
      FDI criteria. The primary outcome is retention of the restoration.
