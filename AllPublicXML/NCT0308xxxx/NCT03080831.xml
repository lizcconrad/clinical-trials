  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized double blind phase IV trial studying the efficacy and safety of the
      tonicity of two different perioperative maintenance solutions: an isotonic solution
      containing NaCl 0.9 in glucose 5% with an added 40 mmol/L of potassium or a commercially
      available premixed solution (Glucion 5%) containing a.o. 54 mmol/L of sodium and 26 mmol/L of
      potassium. Both solutions are administered at 27 mL/kg of ideal body weight, as recommended
      by current guidelines (NICE 174) and both solutions are widely used in daily clinical
      practice. The primary hypothesis is that isotonic maintenance solutions lead to more fluid
      retention than hypotonic fluids. Metabolism of both solutions is assessed by sequential
      analysis of urine and serum and clinical parameters.
