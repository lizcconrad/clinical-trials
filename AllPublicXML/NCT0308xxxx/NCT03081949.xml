  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a global disease with significant morbidity and
      mortality, and Nigeria probably has the highest burden of the disease in the world.
      Unfortunately, much about the disease including its aetiology, epidemiology and treatment is
      not yet well described. This will be a prospective, national, multicenter cohort study,
      conducted in centres in Nigeria. It is expected that approximately 500 patients with PPCM and
      500 apparently healthy pregnant women will be recruited over a 6-month period with follow‐up
      at 3-monthly intervals for 18 months.

      Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a global disease with significant morbidity and
      mortality, and Nigeria probably has the highest burden of the disease in the world.
      Unfortunately, much about the disease including its aetiology, epidemiology and treatment is
      not yet well described. This will be a prospective, national, multicenter cohort study,
      conducted in centres in Nigeria. It is expected that approximately 500 patients with PPCM and
      500 apparently healthy pregnant women will be recruited over a 6-month period with follow‐up
      at 3-monthly intervals for 18 months. The objectives of the study are:

      i. To describe the burden and demographic, social and clinical characteristics of PPCM in
      Nigeria.

      ii. To describe the ventricular remodelling and outcomes (rehospitalisation rate,
      cardio-embolic events and survival) of PPCM in Nigeria.

      Sub-study:

      iii. To study the relationship between selenium deficiency, oxidative stress and PPCM in
      Nigeria.

      iv. To describe the prevalence of selenium deficiency and its relationship with cardiac
      function in apparently healthy pregnant women in Nigeria.

      v. To study the impact of sodium selenite supplementation on cardiac function among selenium
      deficient PPCM patients who have not recovered left ventricular function at 6 months after
      the diagnosis.

      This will be the largest systematic evaluation of PPCM in Nigeria, and it is hoped that the
      information will assist in developing locally applicable treatment guidelines, policies and
      interventions for this seemingly deadly disease.

Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidise (GPO) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP) will be measured as described in PEACE Registry protocol V3. Abnormal oxidative stress will be defined as the presence of serum NT-BNP &gt;125pg/mL and ANY of the following: plasma MDA &gt;1.25μmol/L, serum SOD &gt;110ng/mL and plasma GPO &gt;470U/L.</description>

    <description>PPCM patients with selenium deficiency, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;35% and/or insignificant left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR) at 6 months postpartum, will be offered sodium selenite 200mcg daily for 3 months, in an open-label randomized trial. LVRR would be defined as the presence of both absolute increase in LVEF ≥10.0% and decrease in LV end-diastolic dimension indexed to body surface area (LVEDDi) ≤33.0 mm/m2, while recovered LV systolic function as LVEF ≥55%, during the follow-up.
Change in LVEF and LVEDDi will be measured at 6, 12, and 18 months follow up visits, to determine prevalence of LVRR among partipants on selenium treatment and those who will not be on selenium treatment.</description>
