      Multicentre, multinational, prospective randomised, open-label, 3 sequence crossover phase
      III b clinical trial with blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE-design)

        -  in 75 patients with sporadic small vessel diseases (SVDs) and

        -  in 30 patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
           and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TREAT-SVDs will be carried out as a multicentre open label trial at five trial sites across 3
      European countries: Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

      Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to one of three sequences of
      antihypertensive treatment which are given as open-label oral medications in standard dose in
      the following order

      Arm A: Amlodipine &gt; Losartan &gt; Atenolol

      Arm B: Atenolol &gt; Amlodipine &gt; Losartan

      Arm C: Losartan &gt; Atenolol &gt; Amlodipine.

      The study starts with a two week run-in phase. During these first two weeks, patients are not
      allowed to take antihypertensive drugs except for the rescue medication. After the run-in
      period,every patient will take subsequently three different antihypertensive drugs (each drug
      from a separate drug class) according to the randomly assigned arm. Each study drug will be
      administered for four weeks.

      Patients will be monitored telemetrically with a dedicated BP device during the whole trial
      period of 14 weeks.

        Patients may be enrolled in the trial if all of the following criteria have been met:

               -  History of clinical lacunar stroke in the last 5 years with a corresponding
                  recent small subcortical infarct visible on MRI scan or CT scan* compatible with
                  the clinical syndrome.

                  *On MRI, recent infarct is defined as a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion
                  on the acute MRI scan. On CT, recent infarct is defined as a novel infarct on CT
                  within 3 weeks after the event that was not visible on the admission CT.

               -  or cognitive impairment defined as visiting a memory clinic with cognitive
                  complaints, and a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of ≥ 0.5, and capacity to
                  consent, and with confluent deep white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI
                  (defined on the Fazekas scale as deep WMH score ≥ 2)

               -  or a diagnosis of CADASIL established by molecular genetic testing of the NOTCH3
