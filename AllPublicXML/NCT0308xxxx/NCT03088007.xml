  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EVAL'ID study aims to demonstrate the value of a multidimensional assessment in
      accompanying schooling of children with Intellectual Disability. The study will be performed
      in the Rhône department (France) in children aged from 5 to 13 years with mild to moderate
      Intellectual Disability , and attending school either at ULIS (Unités Localisées pour
      l'Inclusion Scolaire, which enables disabled children to attend regular schools), or IME
      (Instituts Médico-Educatifs, which are special schools mandated to accommodate children and
      young people with Intellectual Disability at any level of disability). A multidimensional
      assessment encompasses the assessment of academic, cognitive, behavioral and adaptive skills
      of the children, with validated and reliable neuropsychological batteries, called ID Kit
      (Intellectual Deficiency assessment Kit), which includes the following scales : the Wechsler
      Intelligence Scale for Children 4th edition (WISC-IV), the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale
      II, the GECEN rating form (Grille d'Evaluation Comportementale pour Enfants Nisonger, which
      is the French translation of the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form), and an academic skills
      rating form (GEVA-SCO). A comparison of the children neuropsychological profiles according to
      the type of school they attend, will be perform.

      The project consists of three phases:

        -  Stage 1: Collection of information from each child records at MDPH (Departmental
           Administration for Disabled Persons), IME, ULIS schools, including the assessments that
           were performed, and from a survey of both caregivers and parents regarding their
           respective perception and knowledge of the child's disability

        -  Stage 2: All the children who were not previously assessed with the ID kit will be
           further evaluated using these tests. The results of these assessments will be shared
           with parents and caregivers.

        -  Stage 3: A survey regarding the perception and knowledge of the child's disability will
           be carried out again among caregivers and parents.
