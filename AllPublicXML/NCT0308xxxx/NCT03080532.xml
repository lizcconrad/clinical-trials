  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the strong evidence on health benefits of traditional MeD, not many studies have
      broadly and systematically been made for the potential role and relationship of the MeD in
      the composition of the gut microbiota.

      Furthermore, little is known about the composition of the gut microbiota in individuals with
      defined dietary habits on the Mediterranean pattern.

      This work is aiming at comparatively studying the gut microbiota of three different dietary
      oriented european populations. In particular, biological samples and related information will
      be collected from populations with high adherence to Mediterranean diet (MeD) in Crete -
      Greece and Molise region - Italy. These data will be comparatively assessed with those
      provided by a sample population with high adherence to Western diet in Auvergne - France.

      All the participants will give freely their written informed consent before their selection
      in the study.

      Information on demographics, anthropometrics, vital signs, relevant medical history and
      concomitant medication, dietary habits, usual dietary intake and nutritional supplements will
      be collected. Habitual physical activity will be performed using the short form of the IPAQ
      survey. All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked by the investigator or
      co-investigator.

      All selected volunteers will be asked to maintain their usual dietary habits and continue
      their normal physical habits. All volunteers will complete a follow-up questionnaire to
      obtain information about any changes in medication use, disease etc.

      All selected volunteers will collect one stool sample and will complete two 24h dietary
      recalls, and questionnaires related to digestive function and life style.
