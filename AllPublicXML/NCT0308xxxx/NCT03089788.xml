  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Project we will monitor the symptoms of cat allergic participants who live together
      with a cat which is immunized with FEL-CMV using the novel symptom recording method
      &quot;HypoScore&quot;, a General weekly symptom score, and a skin prick test before and after
      immunization of the cat. This project may enable us to determine if the scoring System and
      the tests are able to detect a difference in participant symptoms before and after
      immunization of the cats.
