      This study proposed to construct an ultrasound-based diagnostic model for Differentiating
      Malignant Breast Lesion From Benign Lesion. This study contains both retrospective and
      prospective part, which are designed for model construction and independent validation,
      respectively.This study aims to construct an easy-to-use ultrasound-based model, prove the
      efficacy of the model for identifying malignant breast lesion from benign lesion, and finally
      promote the application of this diagnostic model in more clinics.
