      A prospective, multi-centre, epidemiological observational study designed to evaluate the
      prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BReast CAncer gene) mutations in current and newly diagnosed
      ovarian cancer patients across different countries in the Gulf region. This study will also
      describe the epidemiological features for the disease for the enrolled patients.

        The target study population will be women at least 18 years of age with histologically
        confirmed ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers at participating oncology
        hospitals/departments in the Gulf region. Patients enrolled in this study will be assigned
        to either the treatment-experienced subgroup for those who were previously diagnosis and
        are undergoing treatment at the time of enrollment, or the treatment-native group for those
        who were recently diagnosed and not yet undergoing treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects willing to sign the informed consent form (ICF)

          2. Female subjects 18 years of age or older

          3. Have histologically confirmed diagnosis of Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
             (FIGO) ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cancer made by one or more of the
             following:

               1. Standard staging laparotomy including bilateral
                  salpingo-oophorectomy,omentectomy, and lymph node sampling and debulking and/or

               2. Surgical resection and radiographic evidence consistent with ovarian cancer

               3. Paracentesis or biopsy with radiographic evidence consistent with ovarian
                  cancer(normal appearing pancreas, liver, and gastrointestinal tract).

          4. Have availability of paraffin-embedded archived tumor tissue block (preferred) or, if
             a block is not possible, a minimum of twenty 10-um sections.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria are ineligible to participate in the study
        and hence will not be consented:

          1. The diagnosis is not of a primary ovarian cancer; thus, patients will be excluded if a
             previous cancer has metastasized to the ovary, or if there is a secondary malignancy
             that is associated with the ovarian cancer.

          2. Is not able or willing to provide written informed consent.

          3. Have a diagnosis of other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with
             the interpretation of the study.

          4. Be a patient who, in the judgment of the Investigator, would be inappropriate for
             enrollment in this study.

        A rationale will be documented for all patients who are screened and ultimately excluded
        from the study as a result of meeting any of the aforementioned exclusion criteria
