    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of corneal cross-linking (CXL) in patients with keratoconus or post-refractive
      ectasia (post-LASIK or PRK) utilizing two techniques: the &quot;standard&quot; Epi-Off technique or an
      Epi-On technique that utilizes iontophoresis (I-CXL) to deliver the riboflavin to the cornea
      without need for removal of the corneal epithelium. Patients will be randomized to receive
      CXL treatment with either the Epi-On or Epi-Off technique.

    <description>Using topical anesthesia (proparacaine), the surgeon will create a complete corneal abrasion to facilitate riboflavin diffusion into the cornea. The epithelium will be removed by gently brushing the cornea with a scalpel. A corneal abrasion diameter of ~9mm is recommended, which may be adjusted as needed at the discretion of the investigator to accommodate individual eye geometry. Ultrasound corneal pachymetry should be performed before dis-epithelialization and after dis- epithelialization. Local anesthetics will be administered as needed to maintain patient comfort during the CXL procedure.</description>

             opinion, makes the patient unsuitable as a candidate for cross-linking or study
             participation or may confound the outcome of the study

         10. Inability to cooperate with diagnostic tests or inability to understand the informed

         11. Concurrent use of systemic (including inhaled) medications that may impair healing,

             months of treatment, and amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone®) within 12 months of
             treatment. NOTE: The use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, whether chronic or
             acute, is deemed to adversely affect healing.
