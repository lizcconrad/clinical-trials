  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) and its treatments lead to numerous side effects that affect a person's
      life for years after treatment has ended. Research shows that regular exercise limits many of
      these side effects. However, less than 30% of BC survivors regularly exercise due to many
      barriers that include patients being unaware of the benefits of exercise, health
      professionals facing institutional, personal, and patient-related barriers to promoting
      exercise, and a lack of knowledge translation (KT) strategies within cancer institutions that
      focus on accessible exercise interventions and education by physiotherapists. For this
      project, a pilot study is needed as the first step in order to assess process and resource
      variables before implementation of a large-scale intervention.

      The primary objective of this pilot trial is to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger
      trial to evaluate the effects of a novel KT intervention using exercise and self-management
      versus usual care among BC survivors. The secondary objective is to determine preliminary
      estimates of effects of the KT intervention of exercise plus self-management (SM) program
      versus usual care on (a) levels of exercise knowledge and behaviour, (b) health related
      quality of life and (c) resource utilization, among BC survivors over a four month period.

    <textblock>
      Study Design: Pilot randomized controlled trial. Eligibility: Women older than 18 years who
      are currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment for BC.

      Intervention: The intervention group includes an 8-session multi-component intervention with
      a structured aerobic exercise program plus SM supervised by a physiotherapist.

      Setting: Outpatient-Juravinski Cancer Centre in Hamilton, ON. Control: Usual care.
      Randomization: Participants will be randomly allocated using a 1:1 allocation ratio to
      receive the intervention of structured exercise plus SM program or usual care.

      Sample size: The study will recruit n=12 number of participants/group for a total of 24 in
      both groups.

      Analysis: A blinded assessor will assess outcomes at baseline, post intervention, at 2- and
      4-month follow up. Intervention feasibility and effectiveness will be assessed using
      descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance for continuous outcomes.

      Anticipated Impact: This study aims to assess the feasibility of a larger trial to determine
      effective ways to close the current KT gap and increase exercise awareness for women with BC.
      This project will assess process and resource variables before implementation of a larger
      scale intervention. Together, the overall project goal is to promote sustainable exercise
      behaviour to help manage the burden of BC.

    <description>The intervention group will receive a multi-component KT intervention. This will include exercise and self-management components.
The exercise intervention will involve a moderate intensity aerobic exercise program, using recumbent bikes, delivered within the cancer institution. Participants will take part in the 30-minute sessions 8 times. The intervention will be supervised by a physiotherapist (PT) educated in cancer rehabilitation.
The SM component will include educational modules created by a PT. Participants will view these 30 minute modules prior to each exercise intervention, over the same 8 sessions.</description>
