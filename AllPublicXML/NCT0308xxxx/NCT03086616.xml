    <description>Safety of repeated CED of nal-IRI following standard of care focal radiotherapy will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events, scheduled laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, and physical examinations for subjects who receive the vaccination. The severity of toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (meeting Grade 3, 4, or 5 criteria according to CTCAE) will be summarized by maximum intensity and relationship to study drug(s). Grade 1 and 2 adverse events will be summarized if related to study therapy.</description>

             and diffuse involvement of at least 2/3 of the pons are eligible without histologic
             diagnosis. For lesions with typical imaging features, biopsy is neither encouraged nor
             required for eligibility. Tumors that are biopsied will be eligible if proven to be
             supportive of the diagnosis of a DIPG. Consensus of diagnosis by the study team must
             be met.

          -  Treatment must begin at a minimum of 4 weeks after but no later than 14 weeks of the

             prior to start of CED infusion, with exception of antibody half-lives. For antibody
             therapies, at least 3 half-lives of the antibody after last dose of monoclonal
             antibody should have passed prior to CED infusion.

          -  Prior Radiation: Patients must have received prior treatment with focal radiotherapy
             as part of initial treatment for DIPG and had their last dose at least 4 weeks prior
             to and no later than 14 weeks from the first CED treatment with liposomal-irinotecan.
             Standard focal radiation therapy will include 54 to 60 Gy by external beam
             radiotherapy to the brainstem.

             in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the
             performance score.
