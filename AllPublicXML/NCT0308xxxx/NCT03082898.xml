    <textblock>
      The proposed study is intended to inform the hypotheses that (1) regular dosing of
      exoskeleton walking will provide health benefits to non-ambulatory and poorly-ambulatory
      individuals with SCI, including decreased pain and spasticity, improvements in bowel and
      bladder function, decreased body-mass index (BMI), enhanced well-being; (2) regular dosing of
      exoskeleton walking will facilitate neurological or functional recovery in some individuals
      with SCI, particularly those with incomplete injuries; and (3) the level of mobility enabled
      by a lower limb exoskeleton is commensurate with the walking speeds, distances, and surfaces
      required for community ambulation.

      Study Outline Study 1, as described herein, will assess the three hypotheses, i.e., health
      benefit, neurological recovery, and mobility benefits, in the context of regular dosing of
      exoskeleton walking in a clinical setting. These studies will be conducted at three study
      sites, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville TN, the James A. Haley Veterans
      Hospital in Tampa FL, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN. All study sites will conduct an
      identical study protocol. The study will involve 24 non-ambulatory and poorly-ambulatory
      individuals with incomplete and complete SCI (i.e., 8 subjects at each site). In this study,
      &quot;poorly ambulatory&quot; is defined as persons with functional independence measure (FIM) gait
      score of 2 to 6 who may be able to walk short distances with or without braces and stability
      aid, or may be able to walk with assistance of one person, but whose primary means of
      mobility is a manual or power-operated wheelchair. Of the 24 individuals, half will be
      individuals with motor-complete injuries (i.e., American Spinal Injury Association Injury
      Scale, AIS, A or B), and half with motor-incomplete injuries (i.e., AIS C or D). As described
      subsequently in the Study Procedures section, the study will assess the therapeutic and
      functional effects of exoskeleton walking over an 8-week period of treatment, where the
      treatment consists of 3 walking sessions per week, each approximately 1.5 hours in duration
      for a total of 24 walking sessions. Therapeutic effects will be assessed via a number of
      measurements recorded primarily at study start, at the 4-week study midpoint, at the 8-week
      completion of treatment, and in a follow-up session, 8 weeks following the conclusion of
      treatment. Among the primary measurements to be used to assess secondary health benefits are
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans (DXA) to assess bone mineral density (BMD); Modified
      Ashworth scale (MAS) ratings and Spinal Cord Injury Spasticity Evaluation Tool (SCI-SET) to
      assess effect on spasticity; body mass to assess BMI; and a self-report questionnaire to
      assess effect on pain, spasticity, bowel and bladder function, skin, and well-being.
      Neurological effects for non-ambulatory subjects will be assessed via neurological
      examination and the functional reach (FR) test. Neurological effects for poorly-ambulatory
      subjects will additionally be assessed via the Functional Independence Measure gait score
      (FIM-G), the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI-II), the Ten Meter Walk Test
      (10MWT), and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, all measured while the subject is not wearing
      the exoskeleton. The level of mobility provided by the exoskeleton for both motor-complete
      and motor-incomplete injuries will be assessed by use of the FIM-G, WISCI-II, 10MWT,
      Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), TUG test, and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (BRPE), all
      measured while the subject is wearing the exoskeleton.
