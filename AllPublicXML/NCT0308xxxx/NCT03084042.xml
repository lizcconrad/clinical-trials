      This study aims to 1) examine common and specific emotional and cognitive dysfunctions
      between Major Depression and generalized anxiety disorder; 2) Examine emotional and cognitive
      dysfunctions between the two disorders and healthy controls; 3) Examine the biomarkers
      predicting successful therapy or not.
