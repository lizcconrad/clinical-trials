  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several techniques for initial abdominal entry in laparoscopy have been introduced in
      literature. Various guidelines and recommendations are available on this subject, however,
      compliance to these are controversial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rationale
      and the process of decision making for first entry technique in laparoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several methods, i.e., the Veress needle, open approach using the Hasson trocar and direct
      trocar insertion without insufflation have been described for initial abdominal entry in
      laparoscopy. On the other hand, relatively new approaches, e.g., the optical or radially
      expanding trocars did not become common yet. Despite the advantages of laparoscopic surgery,
      serious complications can be encountered during the initial entry. Development of a
      complication, e.g., major vascular and intestinal injury, would affect the outcome of the
      operation and it may result in conversion to the open approach. Because of low incidence of
      these complications, it is impossible to show any superiority of one approach to another.

      In this study, we aimed to analyze the rationale and the process of decision making of a
      surgeon about initial abdominal entry technique for laparoscopy.

    <description>Close-ended survey will be performed to the participants. The survey consisted of 18 questions (Appendix). The first six questions (#1-6) were related with respondent's demographical and educational data and experiences of surgical and laparoscopic practices. There were five questions to determine preferred technique for first entry (#7-11), three questions for complications (#12-14), and remaining four questions for safety maneuvers (#15-18).</description>
