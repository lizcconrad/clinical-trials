    <textblock>
      The Study for Employment Retention of Veterans (SERVe) is a randomized controlled trial,
      available exclusively to Oregon employers of veterans. It is designed to develop and
      scientifically evaluate Veteran-supportive supervisor training (VSST) that may enhance
      retention of veterans, with the goal of improving workplace culture and general well-being to
      our service members. The intervention, applied to workplace supervisors, will be measured by
      experience of veterans, assessing workplace experiences, health, well-being, as well as
      employees' spouse/partners' family experiences, health and well-being, and workplace
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the Study for Employment Retention of Veterans (SERVe) study is to
      improve health and well-being of current and former service members employed in participating
      Oregon organizations. The SERVe Study seeks to do this by training supervisors to support
      veteran employees by focusing on a reduction in work-life stress while increasing supportive
      supervisor behavior.

      The SERVe Study proposes that supervisor supportiveness can influence workplace experience,
      health, and well-being of service members, as well as of their families.

      The investigators of the SERVe Study expect positive results for study participants,
      including reduced stress and increased social support, reduction in negative workplace
      experiences, and improvement in family well-being outcomes. Longer term, these effects are
      expected to create a more supportive work environment, which has positive effects on safety,
      health, well-being, family, and organizational outcomes.

      Veteran participants are measured at baseline, three months, and nine months. Veteran spouses
      are invited to participate as well. Married and cohabitating veterans and their partners are
      invited to participate in the Daily Family Study (DFS), a 32-day daily diary survey after
      baseline and at six months.

    <description>The family supportive supervisor behavior (FSSB) training intervention developed by Hammer and colleagues (2011) will be used as the basis for the development of the VSST intervention in the present study. In addition, we will draw on critical elements of training provided by the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR), information about potential mental and physical health effects of being in combat, and information to help reduce the stigma associated with returning veterans; in other words, &quot;de-clinicalizing&quot; their symptoms. Furthermore, this intervention study falls under the more general rubric of soldier resilience, but more specifically addresses both veteran and family resilience upon return from combat. The details of the training content will be researched and developed during the funded project period.</description>
