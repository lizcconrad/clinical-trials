  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      When a person is exposed to something that causes an infection, the body sends a type of cell
      called CD8 T cells to attack it. Those cells are also found in breast milk. Nursing mothers
      pass these cells to their child, which helps the child fight infections, too. Researchers
      want to learn more about how CD8 cells work to keep people healthy.

      Objective:

      To learn more about how the human body fights off infections.

      Eligibility:

      People age 18 years and older who either have an infection, are suspected to have an
      infection, or recently got a vaccine.

      The household contacts of these people and people who have not been recently exposed to any
      infection are also needed.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical and health history and physical exam. They may
      have blood tests.

      The first study visit can be the same day as screening. It can be up to 3 months later. For
      those visits, screening tests will be repeated.

      At the first visit, participants will have blood collected from an arm vein.

      Participants who are breastfeeding may provide a small sample of breast milk. They may
      collect it at home or bring a pumping device to NIH to collect it. NIH can also provide a
      breast pump.

      Participants may be contacted for up to 1 year after the first visit to give samples of blood
      and/or breast milk.

      Up to 4 additional visits, which will each take about 1 hour, may be scheduled.

      A personal physician or local lab can collect blood from participants and ship it to NIH.
      Breast milk cannot be shipped.

    <textblock>
      Cellular lysates from purified protein derivative-positive donors have been reported to
      transfer tuberculin reactivity to na(SqrRoot) ve recipients, but not diphtheria reactivity;
      similarly, cell lysates from diphtheria-reactive donors appear to transfer diphtheria
      reactivity without impacting responses to tuberculin. A historically controversial topic, the
      terms transfer factor and dialyzed leukocyte extract were used to characterize the
      reactivity-transferring properties of lysates. We found that the cellular extract derived
      from antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells induces interleukin (IL)-6 from antigen-matched
      antigen-presenting cells. This ultimately elicits IL-17 from bystander memory CD8+ T cells.
      We identified that dialyzable peptide sequences, S100a9, and the TCR &lt;= chain from CD8+ T
      cells contribute to the molecular nature of this activity. We further showed that extracts
      from antigen-targeted T cells enhance immunity to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.
      The observed anti-Candida activity of lysates was enhanced when the cells were taken from
      individuals with higher-than-average exposure to Candida and correlated with increased
      numbers of Candida-reactive T-cells. These effects are sensitive to immunization protocols
      and extraction methodology in ways that may explain past discrepancies in the reproducibility
      of passive cellular immunity. Work by other groups has revealed that memory CD8+ T cells are
      also the only cell population enriched in breast milk as compared to an equal volume of
      peripheral blood. Taken together, it may be that the CD8+ memory T cells in breast milk serve
      as a mechanism of passive cellular immunity transference from mother to offspring. We thus
      aim to expand our analysis into the potential that lysates taken from sources with enriched
      immunity against a given microorganism will induce greater in vivo and mouse model activity
      compared to lysates from non-immune sources, and that this difference in lysate activity will
      be directly related to the CD8+ T cell enrichment.

      In this study, we will collect blood and/or breast milk samples from donors with known or
      suspected exposure to pathogens, and also from healthy non-exposed volunteers. Research
      evaluations of samples will be done for the relevant microbe(s) of interest. The volume of
      blood taken from lacting mothers will be limited to 20mL or less per visit. Cells may be
      proliferated, immortalized, lysed and dialyzed, and/or stored. Cellular lysates will
      subsequently be used in both in vitro and pre-clinical animal models to assess for
      therapeutic potential.

                  -Clinical history is consistent with established epidemiology of the microbe of
                  interest (eg, documentation of past infection; or to a lesser priority travel to
                  endemic areas or living with an individual that suffers from chronic infection
                  with the targeted microbe).

                  AND

                  -Positive results on established clinical immunity tests (eg, viral RNA, antibody
                  titers, etc).

               2. Suspected exposure: Clinical history is consistent with established epidemiology
                  of the microbe of interest (eg, travel to endemic areas, documentation of past
                  infection) but no established clinical assay exists to verify exposure.

               3. Non-exposed: Absence of exposure to targeted microorganisms as measured by lack
                  of exposure to infected individuals, lack of travel to endemic areas, no
                  immunization history, negative screening tests, or other methods of establishing
                  exposure history to mucosal microbial agents.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Active use of immunosuppressive medications.

          2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation
             in this study.
