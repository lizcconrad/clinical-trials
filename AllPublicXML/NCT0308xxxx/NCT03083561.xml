  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY3337641 in
      healthy Japanese and Caucasian participants. The study will also investigate how the body
      processes LY3337641 and the effect of LY3337641 on the body. The study will last up to 4
      weeks for each participant. Screening may occur within 28 days prior to first dose of study
      drug.
