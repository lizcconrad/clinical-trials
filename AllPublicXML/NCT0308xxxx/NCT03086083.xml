      Comparatively studied the effects of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
      bilateral brain stimulation in trauma therapy.

      A randomized, parallel, before-after, blind study was performed. Thirty nine subjects were
      randomly distributed to two groups: one session of EMDR psychotherapy standard and other with
      EMDR standard protocol without its typical brain bilateral stimulation. The results of the
      Beck scales for anxiety, depression and hopelessness and the impact of events test were
      compared between groups.
