  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of crizotinib as induction therapy in participants with
      surgically resectable ALK rearrangement, ROS1 rearrangement, or MET exon 14 mutation positive
      NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with stage IA-IIIA, surgically resectable lung adenocarcinoma with an activating
      alteration in ALK, ROS1 or MET will receive neoadjuvant treatment with crizotinib. This
      neoadjuvant treatment will last 6 weeks and on the last day of dosing of crizotinib,
      participants will undergo surgical resection, followed by 5 years of follow-up via chart
      review.

    <description>Crizotinib is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of ALK, Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFR, c-Met), and ROS1 (c-ros). Crizotinib will be given as a neoadjuvant therapy before surgical resection. The recommended dose of crizotinib is 250mg orally. Participants on this trial will receive this dose, unless dose modification is necessary.</description>
