      The purpose of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, research study is to evaluate
      the accuracy of acutely extracting respiratory rate and tidal volume from implanted cardiac
      device impedance in subjects with heart failure.

      In addition, to assess the feasibility of extracting respiratory rate from device EGM under
      various conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have heart failure and be undergoing implant of a new or
             replacement/upgrade Medtronic dual-chamber ICD or CRT-D device for approved
             indications;

          -  Subject must be implanted with an RV lead that supports bipolar pacing and sensing
             (i.e. a true bipolar defibrillation lead);

          -  Subject must receive a light conscious sedation or no sedation where breathing
             maneuvers can be performed and evaluated during the implant;

          -  Subject must be willing to provide Informed Consent for their participation in the
             study;

          -  Subject must be â‰¥ 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are unable or unwilling to voluntarily participate in any visit required
             by the study and to provide consent;

          -  Subject has congenital heart disease;

          -  Subject has a tachyarrhythmia (atrial and/or ventricular) at the time of enrollment
             and a cardioversion will not be attempted prior to the research procedure;

          -  Subject has unstable coronary artery disease;

          -  Subject requires cardiac pacing at rest for rate support;

          -  Subject presents any concomitant conditions which in the opinion of the investigator
             would not allow a proper execution of the respiratory exercises as per protocol;

          -  Subject presents any concomitant condition which in the opinion of the investigator
             would not allow a safe participation in the study;

          -  Subject is pregnant or breast feeding;

          -  Subject is legally incompetent;

          -  Subject is enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound the results of this study
             without documented pre-approval from Medtronic study manager.
