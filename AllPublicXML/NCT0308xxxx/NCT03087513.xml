  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative monitoring of the motor evoked potentials has been shown to be both a
      sensitive and specific indicator for detecting intraoperative neurologic injuries during
      spine surgery.(Fehlings, Brodke et al. 2010) It is utilised whenever there is risk for injury
      of nerve roots or the spinal cord during the procedure.

      Anaesthetic agents, especially the inhaled volatile anaesthetics and muscle relaxants, are
      confounders for motor evoked potential monitoring as they have deleterious effects on the
      amplitude of motor evoked potentials.(Sekimoto, Nishikawa et al. 2006) Hence, total
      intravenous anaesthesia with no intraoperative muscle relaxants, are the standard anaesthetic
      technique for these surgeries.

      Muscle relaxants are usually required during the induction of anaesthesia and endotracheal
      intubation of larynx. Current practice is to wait for the resolution of residual
      neuromuscular blockade before the motor evoked potential recordings (MEPs) are initiated and
      this makes it difficult to assess if there was any neurological injury associated with
      positioning of the patient. A previous case series has shown that reversal of muscle relaxant
      can improve the amplitude of MEPs.(Batistaki, Papadopoulos et al. 2012) The aim of this study
      is to perform a randomised controlled trial to study the changes in motor evoked potential
      amplitudes comparing sugammadex and placebo.

      Motor evoked potential monitoring is a well-established and safe intervention to assist in
      prevention of intraoperative injury during spine surgery.(Schwartz, Sestokas et al. 2011)
      There is no current consensus for criteria for change in amplitude for trans-cranial motor
      evoked potential monitoring. The peak-peak amplitude of the baseline motor evoked potential
      is utilised as a monitoring tool during surgery. The smaller the change in amplitude that is
      utilised as alarm criterion the more false positives that will be conveyed to the surgeons.
      (Legatt, Emerson 2016) Neurophysiologists use a decrease in the amplitude by more than 50% or
      loss of the signal as a trigger to warn the surgeon of potential development of a
      neurological insult or injury.

      The usual anaesthetic practice at this institution for patients undergoing posterior cervical
      spine surgery is to administer muscle relaxation to aid intubation at the start of the case
      and occasionally small doses of rocuronium (10-20mg) prior to turning the patient prone. The
      neuromuscular blockade is then allowed to wear off and the neurophysiologist will attempt to
      record their baseline motor evoked potentials during or just prior to surgical exposure.

      The issues with this current technique are;

        1. Patients cannot be monitored for neurological changes during their transfer into the
           prone position

        2. There is likely residual neuromuscular blockade decreasing the amplitude of motor evoked
           potentials.

      Investigators plan to perform a randomised controlled cross over trial comparing the change
      in MEP amplitudes with administration of sugammadex or placebo. This will be performed on at
      risk patients (e.g. cervical myelopathy) undergoing posterior cervical spine surgery where
      MEPs can be more difficult to attain but of higher utility.(Kombos, Kopetsch et al. 2003) The
      purpose of this study is to determine the increase in amplitude of the motor evoked
      potentials when residual neuromuscular blockade is reversed with sugammadex or placebo.
