      The aim of the current study is to compare a newly introduced material which is a combination
      of triple mix antibiotics paste and anti-hyperlipidemia drug simvastatin, the new material is
      named 3MIX-TATIN &amp; will be compared to triple antibiotic paste for management of necrotic
      primary molars by using lesion sterilization and tissue repair LSTR technique.

      3Mix-tatin will prepared by mixing three commercially available antibiotics with simvastatin.
      After removing the coating materials, 3 types of antibiotics are pulverized by porcelain
      mortars and pestles to achieve fine powders. A total of 100 mg ciprofloxacin, 100 mg
      metronidazole, and 100 mg cefixime will be mixed in a ratio of 1: 1: 1. Two milligrams of
      simvastatin will be added to the drugs blend to form 3-Mix-tatin. Preparation of 3Mixtatin
      will be trained and supervised by an expert pharmacist. 3Mixtatin will be stored in a tightly
      capped porcelain container, adding a small amount of silica gel in a bag inside the container
      to maintain low humidity. This powder will be mixed with normal saline to form a creamy paste
      of 3Mixtatin at the time of application.

      Local anesthesia using mepivicaine hydrochloride 3% (septodont, saint-maurdesFosses, France)
      will be administered.

      Rubber dam isolation.

      Access cavity will be prepared with a fissure bur in a high-speed handpiece, necrotic pulp
      tissue will be removed using a sterile sharp spoon excavator.

      The canal orifices will be enlarged with a round bur (one mm diameter and two mm depth) to
      create medication receptacles.

      Cotton pellet moistened with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) will be placed in the pulp
      chamber for 1 minute.

      Bleeding, if present, will be controlled by applying sterile cotton pellet moistened with 10%
      sodium hypochlorite against the pulp stumps and will be maintained for 1 min.

      The 3-Mix-Tatin will be mixed with saline to obtain a creamy mix and placed over the canal
      orifices and the pulpal floor.

      The access opening will be sealed with a glass ionomer cement , and the tooth will be
      restored with a stainless steel crown.
