    <textblock>
      Multicentric, placebo‐controlled, double‐blinded, three‐armed, prospective, randomized
      controlled trial.150 patients diagnosed with atopic dermatitis will be randomized to arm 1
      (irradiation for 30min at 415nm wavelength), arm 2 (irradiation for 30min at 450nm
      wavelength), and arm 3 (irradiation for 30min at low‐dose (placebo)). Irradiation will be
      scheduled 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Patients will be followed up for four weeks after the
      last irradiation.

    <masking_description>Patients are blinded by wearing tinted glasses for eye protection which disenable distinction of different wave lengths of light. Medical doctors will examine patients in other rooms than those equipped with the investigational medical devices. These examiners are blinded and are therefore not involved in the preparation and process of the irradiation.</masking_description>
