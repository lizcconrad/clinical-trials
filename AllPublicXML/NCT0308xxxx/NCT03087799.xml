  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) often report more fatigue and sleep disturbances
      compared to their healthy counterparts and compared to patients with other GI disorders. This
      pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of a Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia
      (BBT-I) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. 40 participants will be recruited; 20 will receive 4
      weeks of BBT and 20 will be assigned to a wait list control group (WLC). The primary aim of
      the current project is to assess feasibility of administering BBT-I to a sample of patients
      with IBS. Because behavioral sleep treatment has not yet been studied in IBS or any other GI
      population, this project will provide information about treatment adherence, recruitment, and
      effect sizes. Secondary aims include evaluating the impact of BBT-I on sleep quality and IBS
      symptom severity.

    <description>The BBT arm will consist of 2 in-person treatment visits and 2 telephone check-in visits. Treatment will involve psychoeducation about sleep hygiene and stimulus control as well as sleep schedule modification and sleep restriction. The treatment manual is attached for clarification.
