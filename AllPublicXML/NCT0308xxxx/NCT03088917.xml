      Objective:

      To coordinate active tracing of chronic hepatitis C patients lost to follow-up to inform them
      about there disease severity and treatment options.

      Study design: This is a prospective cohort study, which will start as a pilot study in the
      Radboudumc Population: lost to follow-up chronic hepatitis C patients in the region Nijmegen.
      This so-called lost population consists of all patients, that in the past have been
      identified at the Radboudumc but who are currently lost to or have been withdrawn from
      follow-up. The time-span of interest will be 2000-2015. We estimate that this project will
      retrace 100 lost patients through this search.
