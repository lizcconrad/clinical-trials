  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to examine whether the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) influences
      social reward processing and whether the effects are context- and sex-dependent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subject design healthy volunteers
      will receive either oxytocin or placebo nasal spray (40IU in 10 puffs).

      Subjects will come to the experiment in pairs (two friends of the same sex). 45 min after
      drug administration, the two subjects will simultaneously undergo a social reward task -
      during the task, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data will be acquired from one
      of them. During the social reward task subjects will be asked to rate the valence and arousal
      of emotional pictures in three different conditions: alone, share with a stranger and share
      with their friend.

      Before treatment, subjects will complete a range of validated questionnaires to control for
      potential confounders, such as level of depression (assessed using the BDI) and to explore
      associations between relevant personality factors and treatment effects, such as adult
      attachment style (assessed using the AAS).
