  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized, double-blinded trial will compare the safety and efficacy of
      FMT given enema in subjects 18-60 months of age with uncomplicated, non-edematous SAM not
      responsive to standard therapy. Subjects must meet inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria
      prior to randomization. Subjects will then be randomized by stratified random sampling (by
      age, diarrhea, MUAC and hyponatremia) in a 1:1 ratio at each site to 1 of 2 treatment groups:

        -  FMT by enema: 10mL/kg (maximum 60mL) of donor fecal material will be infused.

        -  Placebo by enema: 10mL/kg (maximum 60mL) of placebo material will be infused.

      Subjects will be evaluated through 56 days (±5) after randomization for primary outcomes
      (safety) as well as secondary outcomes (nutritional, clinical and microbiological response).
      See definition under endpoints/outcome measures above).

      Stool samples will be collected at enrollment and through days 3, 7, 14, 21, 42 and 56.
      Samples will be used for microbiome determination and other exploratory microbiological
      endpoints. An aliquot of donor stool will also be stored for microbiome determination and
      other exploratory microbiological endpoints and assessment of newly acquired infectious
      agents.
