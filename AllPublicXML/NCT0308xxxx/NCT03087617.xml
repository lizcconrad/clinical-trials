      Imbio is developing a Smoking Cessation Report (Report) that includes data analysis from a CT
      lung cancer screening exam. This randomized controlled (RCT) trial will clinically validate
      the Report's impact on: (a) Lung screening participants' motivation to make a quit attempt by
      calling a Quitline, and (b) the effectiveness of a 45-minute telephone smoking cessation
      counseling session for motivating an actual quit attempt and abstinence. The RCT will enroll
      approximately 400 randomly selected participants from lung screening programs at
      HealthPartners and University of Michigan. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      four conditions: 1) Usual Care + quitline phone number (created specifically for the trial
      and maintained for the length of the trial); 2) Usual Care + Report (Report will list
      Quitline number) 3) Usual Care + Counseling, or 4) Usual Care + Report + Counseling. Follow
      up assessment calls will be conducted with participants at three weeks, three months, and six
      months following the mailing of the report.

    <description>Usual Care includes a lung cancer screening CT exam. Following the screen, a radiologist will analyze the CT scan image and send the results to the patient's Primary Care Physician (PCP). If the scan is read as a category 1 or 2 in the Lung Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS), patients are provided a letter in the mail with their results. If the scan is read as a category 3, 4A, 4B, or 4X in Lung-RADS the patient will be contacted by their primary care physician's office and told to schedule a follow up appointment. Either in the letter or at the follow up appointment, patients will be given a Quitline number created specifically for this trial and maintained for the duration.</description>

    <description>In this arm, patients will receive the Usual Care described above and will additionally be provided with the Report. In this arm, the Report will provide the Quitline number.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Usual Care + Counseling</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In addition to the Usual Care described above, patients in this arm will participate in a 45 minute smoking cessation counseling session. Approximately three Tobacco Treatment Specialists will be trained to ensure consistent counseling methodology. Counselors will utilize a patient centered approach grounded in Motivational Interviewing skills to elicit perceived benefits for stopping smoking and to enhance self-efficacy for stopping. A major emphasis of a call is to enroll the caller in formal cessation programs and/or convince them to use FDA approved medication as part of a quit attempt. Study participants who desire further smoking cessation support after their session will be connected with the appropriate organization.</description>

    <description>Research coordinators at the University of Michigan and HealthPartners will be provided access to the research version of LDA via an Imbio website. Following consent and lung screen, research coordinators will manually upload the study participants' images and download a resulting Report. Radiologists have been designated at both sites to review and approve the Report prior to mailing to participants. The Report will include information including the percent of damaged lung volume.</description>
