  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional management of diabetic ulcers is associated with slow healing, high costs and
      repeated trips to clinic. Stem cells contained in fat grafts can differentiate into
      pro-healing cells and release growth factors with evidence suggesting a benefit in wound
      healing. Platelet-rich-plasma (PRP), an autologous blood-product, demonstrates pro-healing
      properties through releasing pro-healing factors and regulating angiogenesis. When used
      combination there is evidence of additional wound healing benefits.

      The aim is to investigate the rate of wound healing in diabetic ulcers when treated with
      conventional dressings, fat grafting alone and fat+PRP combination. The secondary aims will
      be to understand the mechanism of the healing process, the health related quality of life and
      patient satisfaction and the cost implications.

      The study is a single-blinded randomised controlled trial of 30 patients with three parallel
      treatment arms. Each patient will be followed up for 12 weeks and the rate and degree of
      wound healing will be assessed. Wound biopsies will be taken at Day 0, week 1 and week 4 and
      will undergo subsequent histological analysis to evaluate the mechanism of healing. The study
      is expected to last two years from recruitment of the first patient and will be conducted at
      Royal Free Hospital and UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science.

      The combination of fat+PRP may provide diabetic patients the option of a single treatment
      with improved healing, shorter followup and a reduced cost burden. Validation of the
      mechanism of healing through histological analysis will confirm clinical findings and help
      guide future research.
