  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery is a common obstetrical procedure and is associated with increased maternal
      morbidity and mortality. Pain and limited mobilization are major contributing factors that
      result in delayed functional recovery and complications. Elastic abdominal binder, a wide
      elastic belt that is wore around the patient's abdomen to support surgical incision after
      surgery, has been employed by clinicians for pain relief, wound complications prevention,
      improved pulmonary function, and stabilization. Benefits of the abdominal binder use have not
      been properly examined.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of postcesarean elastic abdominal binder use
      on recovery by comparing pain scores and mobility function (through the 6-minute walk test
      [6MWT]) in postcesarean mothers who use versus do not use the elastic abdominal binder to
      support incisional site.

    <description>Each woman will be fitted with an elastic abdominal binder at the time of procedure completion just before leaving the operating room. The binder will be placed snuggly tight on top of the hospital gown at the infraumbilical level with the incision positioned at the middle part of the binder. The patients will be encouraged to wear binders at all time. However, periods of break from wearing the binder will be allowed at their convenience.</description>
