  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to use an innovative and integrated educational curriculum to deliver
      prenatal care and diabetes care for pre-gestational diabetic women from approximately the
      first trimester of pregnancy through delivery and the early postpartum period in a group care
      model. The group care model will be compared to a control group, a traditional, individual
      care model.

    <description>If the participant is randomized to the individual prenatal care model, she will continue to receive individualized care in the prenatal clinic. This includes being seen by both a MFM specialist and possibly an endocrinologist at each prenatal visit. During the prenatal visit, the individual caregivers are responsible for discussing educational topics that they feel are relevant to the patient. Patients are seen every two weeks for Traditional Care.</description>

    <description>If the participant is randomized into the group prenatal care model she will be placed in a group of approximately 6-10 women of approximately the same gestational age. These women will then have sessions scheduled at the same intervals they would have had their traditional prenatal visits, every two weeks until 36 weeks and then weekly until delivery, 12 sessions in total. Each session will last between 90-120 minutes. In the group prenatal care model, the entire visit time will be face to face with a provider and the group. Billing will be done through the standard reimbursement system since the program will follow the schedule of prenatal visits recommended by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologist.</description>
