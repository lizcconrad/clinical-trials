  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different therapy strategies for patients suffering on obstructive lung disease
      like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma bronchial available. One of
      these strategies includes inhalative drugs, e.g. ß2-mimetics, anticholinergic drugs, or
      glucocorticoids, which are indicated often and which can be used with different inhalation
      devices. Dry powder inhalators, and dosieraerosol are used the most in clinical routine.
      Further strategies in treating obstructive lung disease are innovative systems like Respimat
      or systems with liquid inhalation. However, the success of the therapy depends on the correct
      application technique. In the clinical routine a high error rate was observed. Consequently,
      the initiative of the German league of respiratory tracts published internet-based film
      sequences in order to demonstrate how to use an inhalator correctly. These films are
      available in the internet for everyone and can be watched as often as needed in order to
      improve technique and facilitate training.

      Therefore, in this study we aim to evaluate the following aspects:

        -  amount of wrong applications in ambulant and hospitalized patients (wrong in terms of
           lack of knowledge on how to use the inhalator or incorrect utilization)

        -  amount of correct applications in patients who had first used the inhalator incorrectly
           but improved technique by watching the film sequences

        -  evaluation of learning success within 2 weeks to 2 months (follow-up visit in the
           ambulance)

    <description>After written consent patients will be asked whether they know how to use the inhalator and for how long therapy has been already conducted. Patients using the inhalator correctly have completed the study at this point. If patients have demonstrated incorrect use of the inhalator, a film sequence with instructions will be shown via a tablet. The learning success will be assessed subsequently. When patients show correct application, they will be asked to come back for a follow-up visit within 2 to 8 weeks, otherwise they will be retrained by study staff. At the follow-up visit another demonstration evaluation will be performed.
While demonstrating patients will use the inhalator without any drug that could have any medicinal effect on them.</description>
