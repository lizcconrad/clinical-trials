  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is effective and most often used to treat cancer. The common drugs used on
      gynecologic cancer treatment include platinum compounds like cisplatin and carboplatin, which
      combined with taxane, topotecan, or liposomal doxorubicin to date. The most side effects of
      chemotherapy are esophagitis, mucositis, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, abdominal convulsion,
      painful swallowing, fatigue and sometimes diarrhea, dizziness, allergy (rash, itching),
      neutropenia, thrombocytopenia (fever, chills, cough, pain), anemia and bleeding.

      Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), an indicator of quality of life, is a highly prevalent symptom
      (75-80%) during treatment and in patients with advanced cancer, yet is sometimes ignored.
      Fatigue affected their life more than pain. Proposed criteria for CRF have been adopted for
      inclusion in the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health
      Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Therefore, more in-depth
      researches on CRF are needed in Taiwan. Patients with CRF in need of improvement, commonly
      use nutrition supplements, acupuncture, healthy food, massage, drugs, etc. Hence, patients
      with CRF could consult their vital physician for an appropriate treatment. Furthermore,
      several drugs could be chosen to relieve CRF, including anemia drugs, antipsychotics or
      Astragalus polysaccharides extract.

      The objective of this retrospective study is to collect and analyze the medical records of
      gynecologic cancer patients who who had received chemotherapy with or without prescription
      drug treatment for cancer-related fatigue in the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology of
      Tri-Service General Hospital from December 1st, 2015 to Dec 31st, 2018. This study will
      compare the fatigue improvement profile by different chemotherapy regimens, tumor stage, CRF
      treatment, etc. and investigate the association between the profile of fatigue improvement
      and fatigue cluster (weight loss and other symptoms of functional assessment of cancer
      therapy). This study will also collect blood specimens and analyze the correlation of the
      cytokine profile and/or immune profile.These results will supply physicians with more
      understanding about CRF, and help them to enhance the quality on gynecologic cancer care to
      being perfected in the future.

      About 60 gynecologic cancer patients' medical records are expected to collect and analyze in
      this retrospective study. The data collection from medical records of gynecologic cancer
      patients who had received chemotherapy with or without prescription drug treatment for
      cancer-related fatigue include the demographic information (e.g., height, weight, age, sex,
      tumor stage, time from tumor diagnoses, prescription drug of cancer-related fatigue treatment
      and chemotherapy toxicities), the diagnosis and severity of cancer-related fatigue,
      functional assessment of cancer therapy and so on.
