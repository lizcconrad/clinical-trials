  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sufficient oxygenation is critical for completely buried avalanche victims to avoid
      life-threatening consequences during hypoxic exposure. Snow contains a remarkable capacity to
      maintain air availability; it was suspected that the snow physical properties affect the
      development of hypoxia and hypercapnia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence
      of different snow physical properties on the development of hypoxia and hypercapnia in
      subjects breathing into an artificial air pocket in snow. Twelve male healthy subjects
      breathed through an airtight face-mask and 40cm tube into an artificial air pocket of 4L.
      Every subject performed three tests on different days with varying snow characteristics.
      Symptoms, gas and cardiovascular parameters were monitored up to 30min. Tests were
      interrupted at SpO2 &lt;75% (primary endpoint); or due to subjective symptoms like dyspnea,
      dizziness, and headache (i.e. related to hypercapnia). Snow density was assessed via standard
      methods and micro-computed tomography (CT) analysis, and permeability and penetration with
      the snow micro-penetrometer (SMP).
