  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMP-001-002 is a Phase 1b study of CMP-001 administered to subjects with advanced cutaneous
      melanoma who are either receiving Pembrolizumab, or who have previously received an
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy for advanced cutaneous melanoma, and who have not responded (i.e.
      immunotherapy resistant) after at least 4 administrations of anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy.

      This study will be conducted in two parts:

      Part 1 will consist of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase of CMP-001

        -  Dose Escalation Phase will be conducted to assess and identify a recommended phase 2
           dose (RP2D)

        -  The Dose Expansion Phase is intended to further characterize the safety,
           pharmacodynamics, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of the RP2D of CMP-001
           administered SC and IT in combination with Pembrolizumab

      Part 2 will assess the safety and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of CMP-001,
      administered SC for 2 weekly doses (Prime Phase; W1D1 &amp; W2D1), IT for 4 weekly doses (Prime
      Phase; W3D1, W4D1, W5D1, &amp; W6D1) and SC every 3 weeks thereafter (Boost Phase; W9D1, W12D1,
      etc.) when given in combination with Pembrolizumab

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects enrolled into Part 1 must have metastatic lesions where repeated IT
             injections are not feasible and in whom SC injection is the only viable route of
             CMP-001 administration, based on Investigator judgment. Subjects with injectable
             lesions are NOT eligible to participate in Part 1. Subjects enrolled into Part 2 must
             have metastatic lesions that are amenable to repeated IT injections.

          -  All subjects enrolled into either Part 1 or Part 2 must meet all of the following
             inclusion criteria to be eligible:

          -  Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or unresectable malignant
             melanoma arising from skin. Ocular melanoma subjects are not eligible.

          -  Male or female subjects age 18 or older

               1. Subjects who are currently receiving treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody
                  Pembrolizumab either alone or in combination and are progressing. Subjects must
                  have received at least 4 doses of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy OR

               2. Subjects who have previously received any anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, alone or in
                  combination. Subjects must have received at least 4 doses of anti-PD-1/PD-L1
                  therapy

          -  Subjects must have measurable disease by RECIST Version 1.1.

          -  Capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements.

          -  A life expectancy of greater than 24 weeks at Screening.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

          -  Most recent laboratory values (within 2 weeks prior to Week 1 Day 1 (W1D1)) before
             study entry meet the following standards:

               1. Bone marrow function: neutrophil count &gt;/=1,000/mm3, platelet count &gt;/=
                  75,000/mm3 and hemoglobin concentration &gt;/= 8.0 g/dL.

               2. Liver function: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) of
                  each institution, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 3
                  times the ULN range of each institution.

               3. LDH ≤2.0 times the ULN range of each institution

               4. Renal function: serum creatinine ≤1.5 times the ULN range of each institution.

          -  The subject must sign a written informed consent form prior to the initiation of any
             study procedures. Adult subjects unable to provide written informed consent on their
             own behalf will not be eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  Received investigational therapy with another drug or biologic within 30 days prior to
             the start of CMP-001 dosing on W1D1. However, if an investigational drug has a short
             half-life, a shorter wash out period may be acceptable upon permission given by the
             Sponsor.

          -  Received treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody within 30 days prior to the start of
             CMP-001 dosing on W1D1.

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV).

          -  Developed autoimmune disorders of Grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy. Subjects who
             developed autoimmune disorders of Grade ≤ 3 may enroll if the disorder has resolved to
             Grade ≤1 and the subject has been off systemic steroids at doses &gt;10 mg/day for at
             least 2 weeks.

          -  Require systemic pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids at or above the equivalent of

             steroids are permitted. Subjects who have a history of adrenal insufficiency and are
             receiving greater than 10 mg/day systemic steroids may be eligible but only after
             Sponsor consultation.

          -  Active (i.e., symptomatic or growing) central nervous system (CNS) metastases.
             Subjects with CNS metastases are eligible for the trial if: a. the metastases have
             been treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy, b. the subject is off corticosteroids
             (&gt;10 mg/day) and is neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening. c.
             brain MRI completed within 3 months of Screening.

          -  Any concurrent uncontrolled illness, including mental illness or substance abuse,
             which in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unable to cooperate
             or participate in the trial.

          -  Severe uncontrolled cardiac disease within 6 months of study entry, including but not
             limited to uncontrolled hypertension; unstable angina; myocardial infarction (MI) or
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

          -  Requires prohibited treatment (i.e., non-protocol specified anticancer
             pharmacotherapy, surgery or conventional radiotherapy for treatment of malignant
             tumor).
