  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase II study of intravenous (IV) SHR-1210 at 200mg,q2w
      in combination with Apatinib at two dose levels in subjects with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The study is composed of two parts. Part 1 of the study will determine the safety
      ,tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SHR-1210 in combination with Apatinib.

      Part 2 includes a randomized comparison of Apatinib 250mg/d or 500mg/d plus SHR-1210 .

      Subject's tumors will be screened at baseline for EGFR mutations, EML4-ALK translocation, and
      PD-L1 expression.But positive tumor PD-L1 expression will not be required for enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1). Apatinib is a
      new kind of selective Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2(VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI). A disease-control rate of 61.1% and a mPFS of 4.7 months were showed in
      Apatinib phase II study in patients with NSCLC.
