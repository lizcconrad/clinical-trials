    <textblock>
      Patients with post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) that have been treated with
      at least one type of chemotherapy, but whose lymphoma is not responding or coming back after
      the previous treatment will be asked to participate in this study.

      This clinical trial uses a drug called Obinutuzumab. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      has approved Obinutuzumab for sale in the United States for certain diseases. Obinutuzumab is
      still being studied in clinical trials to learn more about what its side effects are and
      whether or not it is effective in the disease or condition being studied. Obinutuzumab is
      considered an investigational drug in this study

      Obinutuzumab (GA101) is an antibody directed against cluster of differentiation antigen 20
      (CD20). Antibodies are protein that are part of the immune system that can target cancer
      cells. Obinutuzumab sticks to a target called CD20. CD20 is an important molecule on some
      cancer cells (including non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and some normal cells of the immune system.

      This study is being done to test if the study drug has an effect on post transplant
      lymphoproliferative disorder and to see how lymphoma will respond to the study drug.

      Primary Objective:

      • To determine the overall response rate of obinutuzumab in relapsed/refractory
      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in both solid organ transplant (SOT) and
      bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Complete remission (CR) rate

        -  Duration of response (DOR)

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Time to treatment failure (TTF)

        -  Safety and tolerability of obinutuzumab

      Patient Population:

      Relapsed or refractory post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) patients who have
      received at least one prior therapy

      Study Design:

      Phase II study of single agent obinutuzumab in relapsed/refractory (RR) post-transplant
      lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in both SOT and BMT patients

    <time_frame>Up to 36 months after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate will be estimated by the total number of patients who achieve a CR and PR divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Response will be assessed using CT scans according to the revised Cheson criteria
CR is defined as complete resolution of all clinically detectable disease and disease related symptoms that were present prior to therapy
PR is defined as at least 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>CR is defined as complete resolution of all clinically detectable disease and disease related symptoms that were present prior to therapy. A post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is proton emission tomography (PET) negative. CR rate will be calculated by dividing the dividing the total number of patients who have achieved CR by the total number of patients who have achieved a CR and PR.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from enrollment into the study to disease progression or death due to any cause. It may be defined as the date of documentation of a new lesion or enlargement of a previous lesion, or the date of the scheduled clinic visit immediately after radiologic assessment has been completed.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The OS is defined as the time from enrollment to the time of death due to any cause. For a patient who is alive at the end of study follow-up, observation of OS is censored on the date of last contact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the time to tumor progression or death due to any cause.</description>

    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Time to treatment failure (TTF) is defined as the time from enrollment to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death.</description>
