  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed by the principal investigator, Dr. Alastair Younger, and the St.
      Paul's Hospital Foot and Ankle Research Group, who will conduct the study. The study is being
      funded by Acumed LLC, the manufacturer of the Health Canada approved Acutrak 2® - 7.5 fully
      threaded screw.

      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the effectiveness of fully threaded screws
      versus partially threaded screws in subtalar fusion, in order to determine the effect of the
      thread configuration on the success of the fusion procedure.

      Efficacy will be assessed primarily by computed tomography (CT) analysis of percent bone
      bridging across the subtalar joint at both 12 and 24 weeks post-op. Outcome scores will also
      be administered to compare general health and foot function between the two groups at
      baseline and at multiple post-op follow-up visits. Additional resource utilization (i.e.
      additional clinic and/or hospital admissions) will also be compared between the two groups
      post-op.
