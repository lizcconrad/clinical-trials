  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to compare the sedative effects of intranasal midazolam
      versus inhaled nitrous oxide (N2O) for minor procedures in the pediatric emergency
      department. The primary outcome will be length of stay (LOS) in the emergency department (ED)
      stay for minor procedures. Secondarily the investigators will compare patient/family and
      provider satisfaction while using either intranasal midazolam or N2O for minimal sedation.
      The investigators hypothesize that the total length of stay for children undergoing minor
      procedures in the ED will be lower for N2O, as compared to intranasal midazolam. The
      investigators also hypothesize that patient/family and provider satisfaction will be higher
      with N2O and adverse effects will not differ between N2O and intranasal midazolam. Patients
      will receive either intranasal midazolam or N2O for minor procedures. Following the
      enrollment period, data will be analyzed and the two will be compared. Total length of stay,
      patient/family and provider satisfaction will be studied.

    <description>Nitrous oxide will be delivered in one of two ways, using the titration method or rapid infusion method. Which ever method is used will be recorded. When using the titration method, starting at 20%, nitrous oxide will be added in 10% increments every 60 seconds until the ideal level of sedation has been met (not to exceed 70% nitrous oxide). Using the rapid infusion method, after the proper flow rate has been achieved with oxygen, the flowmeter will be increased to obtain 50% concentration of nitrous oxide. After 2-3 minutes if the patient does not have adequate sedation, nitrous oxide concentration will be increased to 70%.</description>
