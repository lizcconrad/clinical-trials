      of patients who received empiric antibiotic treatment within first hour after septic shock
      diagnosis were collected. Detailed information about clinical ladder for nursing stuff and
      nursing shift were collected . Clinical ladder for nursing stuff is a new definition based on
      education background and work experience and nurses stuff are classified into four levels. N0
      was defined who got college degree or above, nurse qualification certificate and working time
      less than one year. N1 an N2 were defined as who got nurse qualification certificate and
      working time between 1~3 years and more than three years, respectively. N3 was defined who
