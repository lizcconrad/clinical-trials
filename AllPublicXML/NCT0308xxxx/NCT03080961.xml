  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital herpes has a high prevalence in industrialized as well as developing countries.

      Genital herpes causes genital ulcers, increases risk for acquiring HIV infection, and may be
      transmitted mother to child during birth with possible serious consequences.

      Medical treatments and condoms only partially reduce the risk for transmission from/ to
      sexual partners. Genital herpes transmission despite use of condoms is thought to be due to
      transfer via skin-to-skin contact in unprotected areas, and HSV-2 transmission may be
      enhanced by current shaving habits in the genital area leading to micro lesions (lacerations)
      of the skin.

      VIBLOKâ„¢ is a cream designed to impede the passage of viruses, such as HSV-2, across the skin.
      Bench and animal experiments indicate that it can block virus transmission such as HSV-2 over
      80%.

      The objective of the SAFE trial is to assess the safety and performance of VIBLOK in adults
      with HSV-2 infection by comparing virus detection in the extra-genital area before and after
      application of the barrier cream.

          2. HSV-2 seropositive by the UW Western blot or Alegria assay

          3. History of recurrent genital herpes with at least 3 recurrences in the last year or,
             if currently on suppressive/ prophylactic therapy, prior to starting the therapy
             (antiviral therapy has to be stopped at least 7 days prior to initiation of the trial
             product).

          4. General good health at the discretion of the investigator.

          5. Willing to not use any topical genital therapy aside from the study device for the
             duration of the trial.

          6. Willing to not use any systemic anti HSV therapy during the entire study starting 7
             days prior to baseline.

          7. Willing to obtain 2 swabs from external-genital areas once daily for the duration of
             the trial.

          8. Willing to keep a daily trial diary during the treatment period.

             trial protocol and procedures.

         12. Subject must be willing to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:
