  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GVGH Shigella Sonnei 1970GAHB is a vaccine aimed at preventing the disease caused by Shigella
      sonnei.

      A post-hoc analysis of subjects who participated in the parent study showed significantly
      different responses in subjects with detectable versus undetectable antibody titres at
      baseline, suggesting the possibility that the vaccine might not be sufficiently immunogenic
      in completely naïve adults.

      This study was then designed to further characterize the immunogenicity profile of the
      vaccine and to evaluate whether it was able to induce an immunological memory response.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with abnormal haematological test values</measure>
    <time_frame>At Screening, and from vaccination at Day 1 up to Day 85 post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed haematological parameters are: white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hgb), haematocrit (Hct), platelets (PLT), eosinophils (EOS), basophils (BAS), neutrophils (NEU), monocytes (MCT), lymphocytes (LYM) and prothrombin time (PTT).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with solicited local reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>During 7 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited local reactions include injection site erythema, injection site induration and injection site pain. Solicited local reactions are assessed using a scoring system as follows: grade 0 (absent) measuring 1-24 millimeters (mm) for injection site erythema/induration and presenting no pain at injection site. Grade 1 (mild) = measuring 25-50 mm for injection site erythema/induration and presenting pain that does not interfere with activity. Grade 2 (moderate) = measuring 51-100 mm for injection site erythema/induration and presenting pain that interferes with activities. Grade 3 (Severe) = measuring over &gt; 100 mm for injection site erythema/induration and presenting pain that prevents daily activity.</description>

    <time_frame>During 7 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited systemic reactions include headache, arthralgia, chills, fatigue, malaise, myalgia and oral fever. Solicited systemic reactions are assessed using a scoring system as follows: Grade 0 headache/arthralgia/chills/fatigue = symptoms absent. Grade 1 (mild) headache/arthralgia/chills = symptoms present but do not interfere with activity. Grade 1 (mild) fatigue = does not interfere with activity. Grade 2 (moderate) headache/arthralgia/chills = symptoms interfere with activity. Grade 2 (moderate) Fatigue = symptom has some interference with activity. Grade 3 (severe) headache/arthralgia/chills/fatigue = symptoms prevent daily activity.</description>

Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (defined as symptoms or illnesses requiring hospitalization, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider), or were of concern to the subject.</description>
