      This pilot study evaluates safety of administration of red blood cell transfusions requested
      by patients based on their symptoms instead of levels of hemoglobin for the treatment of
      chronic anemia in patients with blood disorders.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess feasibility and safety of red blood cell transfusions at the time subjects
      requested based on symptomatic anemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define a patient-driven red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) threshold and to compare the
      median hemoglobin (hgb) at the time subjects request RBCT to the standard threshold of hgb &lt;
      8 g/dL.

      II. To compare the number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused and the frequency of
      transfusions at the time subjects request RBCT during the study period to the number of RBC
      units received and frequency using the standard threshold hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL during a
      comparable period prior to enrollment.

      III. To compare the quality of life (QoL) scores when subjects request RBCT to the scores
      obtained at the time hgb is 8 +/- 0.5 g/dL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo RBCT based on their perception and/or the presence of anemia symptoms for up
      to 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
