      This is a single arm open label phase 2 study evaluating the potential effect of ixazomib on
      the prevention of recurrent or late acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD
      at 1-year following reduced intensity (RI) or non-myeloablative (NMA) allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single arm phase 2 study to evaluate a post-transplant proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, as prophylaxis against recurrent or late acute and chronic GVHD. Ixazomib will be initiated within days 100 to 150 post-transplant in patient's ≥ 18 years-old with either myeloid or lymphoid hematologic malignancy treated with a RI or NMA HSCT and will have received calcineurin inhibitor based drug (tacrolimus or cyclosporin) and methotrexate as part of their initial GVHD prophylaxis.</intervention_model_description>

          -  Diagnosis: myeloid or lymphoid hematologic malignancy treated with a RI or NMA
             conditioning HSCT who received calcineurin inhibitor based drug (for example:
             tacrolimus or cyclosporin) and methotrexate as part of their initial GVHD prophylaxis.
             Patients who received sirolimus as part of their GVHD prophylaxis will be eligible.

          -  Recipients of 8-7/8 HLA-matched donor. Post-HSCT period within day +100 to day +150.

          -  Female patients who:

               -  Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR

               -  Are surgically sterile, OR

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of
                  contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent
                  form through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject (periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not
                  acceptable methods of contraception).

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject (periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not
                  acceptable methods of contraception).

             CYP3A (clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole,
             nefazodone, posaconazole) or strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort.

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,

             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are
