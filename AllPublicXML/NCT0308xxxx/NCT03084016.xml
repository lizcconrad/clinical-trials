    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the feasibility of capturing data on exhaled breath compounds
      during an acute asthma exacerbation. In addition to assessing the feasibility of such a study
      the investigators will collect data on exploratory outcomes including the ability of breath
      biomarkers to distinguish between controlled and exacerbated states and their ability to
      differentiate between triggers of exacerbation.

      This will be a longitudinal observational study in which the investigators assess the ability
      to capture information on volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath during an acute asthma
      exacerbation using two different approaches:

      A) Recruitment and assessment of patients in secondary care during an acute exacerbation of
      their asthma; patients to be re-assessed once their asthma is stable and controlled.

      B) Recruitment of clinically stable outpatients who are at increased risk of exacerbation by
      virtue of having had an acute exacerbation within the previous 12 months. Participants to be
      followed for a period of up to 12 months; assessed in the event of an exacerbation; and
      re-assessed once controlled.
