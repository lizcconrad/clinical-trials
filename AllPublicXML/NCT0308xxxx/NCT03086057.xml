  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;PrEPare for Work&quot; is a two-stage randomized controlled pilot trial which utilizes a
      behavioral intervention to optimize the uptake and adherence of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis
      (PrEP) in Male Sex Workers (MSW).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;PrEPare for Work&quot; package includes two behavioral intervention components:

        1. Strengths-based case management for PrEP initiation, and

        2. Counseling and problem-solving PrEP adherence intervention that addresses individualized
           barriers to optimal use.

      Stage 1: MSW will be equally randomized to receive either the strengths-based case management
      or standard of care referral to PrEP clinic.

      Stage 2: Those from stage 1 who initiate PrEP , regardless of stage 1 randomization
      condition, will then be equally randomized to either the &quot;PrEPare for Work&quot; adherence
      intervention or standard of care comparison condition.

    <ipd_description>It is anticipated that this data will be presented annually on data collected after the second year when sufficient baseline data is collected. It is anticipated that most of the papers and data-based projects/presentations will happen in year 3, when all of the baseline data is collected, and the 3 month outcome has occurred for all participants. Sharing of the findings will involve a primary paper describing the study outcome and a paper that describes the intervention, as well as submitting to lead workshops on the intervention approach at relevant national meetings and conferences. Raw data for additional analysis will be available to outside individuals through contacting the MPIs. Information regarding the availability of data for analysis will be listed on the MPIs' web pages. Contact information for the MPIs will be listed in all manuscripts and publications as another means to access data.</ipd_description>
