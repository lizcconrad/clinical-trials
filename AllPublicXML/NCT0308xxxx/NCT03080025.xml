      The purpose of this study is to determine how a CBCT® (Cognitively Based Compassion-Training)
      for couples affect aspects of health and especially social interactions in depressed female
      patients and their romantic partners. compare healthy and depressed couples during an
      instructed positive real-time social interaction in the laboratory.

      Furthermore the investigators aim to examine how social behavior and psychobiological
      indicators of health during real-time social interaction in the laboratory might be improved
      through CBCT® for couples.

      Objects:

      Will a CBCT® (Cognitively Based Compassion-Training) for couples reduce the depressive
      symptomatic and the partners´ burden as well as improve behavioral, endocrine, physiological
      and immune responses during a real time social interaction in the laboratory.

      Do couples with a depressed female partner differ from healthy control couples in behavioral,
      endocrine, physiological and immune responses during a instructed positive real-time social
      interaction in a laboratory setting?

    <description>The CBCT® (Cognitively Based Compassion-Training) for couples (CBCT®-fC) consists of a ten-week training program with a 2h group session weekly and daily home practice based on prerecorded guided mediations (Emory University, Atlanta, USA; Ozawa-de Silva &amp; Negi, 2013). The ten weeks start with an overview and a take-home ideas for continuing practice. Furthermore the first and the 3rd module will be repeated once resulting in a total of ten weeks. Further couple- and dyadic exercises are added.
It focuses on six essential key parts for the development of compassion:
Developing attentional stability and clarity of the mind (Mindfulness)
Cultivating insight into the nature of mental experience
Cultivating self-compassion
Developing impartiality
Developing appreciation and affection for others
Developing empathy and realizing engaged compassion</description>

    <description>The CBCT® (Cognitively Based Compassion-Training) as a secular approach was established as a structured protocol.
The therapeutic tools are based on systemic approaches &amp; techniques, which contains a resource- &amp; solution orientation and the approach of Gottman's model of healthy relationships (e.g. trust and commitment - based on that - elements like &quot;the positive perspective&quot;).
Four dyadic exercises are introduced to enhance positive reciprocity between the romantic partners (based on concepts of couple communication training):
a) Building mindful ability to talk, b) building mindful ability to listen (without reacting initially), c) appreciation in action - indulging the partner, d) &quot;noticing, how the partner is doing something good for me&quot; - gratefulness in action verbally/non-verbally. Finally, the &quot;empathy exercise&quot; has been added inspired by CBASP therapy for chronic major depression.</description>
