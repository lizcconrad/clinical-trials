  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the clinical response, cytokine expression and joint imaging after
      addition of Acthar Gel. The hypothesis is that H.P. Acthar Gel is both safe and effective for
      treatment of patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has different mechanism
      of action than steroids and other DMARDs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease which causes premature
      mortality, disability and compromised quality of life in the industrialized and developing
      world. The prevalence of RA is believed to range from 0.5-1.0% in the general population.
      Over the past half century, many studies have found mortality to be increased in patients
      with established RA in comparison with the general population. Despite available treatment
      options for RA, some patients still have disease that is refractory to treatment and cannot
      achieve remission.

      H.P. Acthar gel (adrenocorticotropic hormone gel) received FDA approval for treatment of a
      variety of diseases, including RA in 1952. The proposed efficacy of H.P. Acthar gel has been
      attributed to its ability to induce production of endogenous steroids and to bind
      melanocortin receptors on lymphocytes and other cells to modulate immunologic responses. The
      present study will examine the clinical response, cytokine production and joint imaging after
      addition of H.P. Acthar gel to confirm the efficacy, confirm different mechanism of action in
      comparison to steroids and other DMARDs by looking for post treatment changes in cytokine
      expression.
