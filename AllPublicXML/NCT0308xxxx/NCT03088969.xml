  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The back pain connected to the work stay a major problem in industrialized countries, in
      particular because of the repercussions of this affection on the work (sick leave,
      absenteeism, handicap and inaptitude). It is difficult to consider among all the patients
      with a Chronic Low Back Pain in the work: how much they are going to stop. However,
      Investigator can consider that approximately 20 % of the patients have a sick leave. Several
      studies showed well that more the sick leave work stoppage goes on more the risk of not
      resumption of work increases. Several risk factors were associated to the evolutionary
      forecast of the pathology and thus to the extension extra time of the sick leave: individual,
      environmental, psychosocial and organizational.

      The evaluation of the self-efficiency perceived of return in the work of the patients by a
      validated auto-questionnaire is thus an additional objective parameter determining the risk
      factors of unfavorable evolution of the patients with Low Back Pain. This parameter also
      allows highlight other levers of actions in the therapeutic education.

      First stage: the translation of the RTWSE in French followed the recommendations of the
      literature, which recommend a double translation, then a double back - translation with
      synthesis of the data in every stage. A final commission deliberate then a final translation,
      culturally adapted.

      The second stage: the RTWSE is given to the patients with a Chronic Back Pain in the program
      of functional restoration of the rachis. Questionnaire FABQ, BARBECUE and Quebec are also
      given to the patient to obtain the status &quot;faith&quot; and the &quot;functional&quot; status. The
      questionnaire JDI as well as the analog visual scale is given to estimate the global
      professional satisfaction. The pain is estimated by a digital scale. The score IPAQ allows to
      estimate the level of physical activity of the patients. The HAD allows to estimate the level
      of anxiety and depression of the patients.

      The additional questionnaires used for several reasons: in routine for the evaluation of the
      patients with a Chronic Back Pain; to characterize the patients and within the framework of
      the study for the validity of convergence and difference of questionnaires RTWSE 10 and 19
      items.

      The third stage: the questionnaire RTWSE is given again to the patient at 72 hours interval
      while the state of the patient is considered as stable.

      The fourth stage: the questionnaires are given at J21 and in 2 months apart for the study of
      the sensibility in the change with the FABQ, BARBECUE, Quebec and the IPAQ.
