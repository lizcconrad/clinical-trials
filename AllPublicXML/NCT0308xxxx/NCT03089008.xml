  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to examine the long-term effect of eccentric exercises
      compared with stretching exercises on patients with achillodynia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with achillodynia for at least 3 months are randomly allocated to one of two
      exercise regimens. Exercise is performed daily for a 3-month period. Symptom severity is
      evaluated by tendon tenderness, ultrasonography, a questionnaire on pain and other symptoms,
      and a global assessment of improvement. Follow-up is performed at time points 3, 6, 9, 12
      weeks and 1 year.

    <description>The tenderness of the symptomatic tendons was determined manually by applying a moderate amount of pressure (about 1 kg) with the first and second finger on each side of the tendon. The tendon was palpated 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion, and at each level the tenderness score was noted according to the subjects' answers of the pain perceived (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe).</description>

    <description>The patients were instructed to stand with straight legs on a small step, lift up on the toes, hereafter put the weight on the injured leg and slowly lower the heel as far as possible until they felt a maximal stretch of the calf muscles and/or the Achilles tendon. The exercises were repeated 15 times. Then the patients were told to repeat the exercises with semi-flexed knee. If possible the series should be repeated twice increasing to three times at each session. If pain decreased they should increase the load on the Achilles tendons by wearing a rug sack and increasing the weight of the rug sack by adding weights (5kg each). The patients were told that some pain was to be expected from the tendon during exercise, but that increasing daily pain or morning stiffness indicated that the exercises had been progressed too fast.</description>

    <description>The patients were instructed in standing stretching exercises of the gastrocnemius (straight leg) and soleus (bended knee). The stretch was slowly increased and maintained for 30s. This stretch was to be repeated five times during each session. The patients were instructed that the stretching should be pain free, although a small degree of unpleasantness was allowed.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pain in the Achilles tendon area with one of the two following findings. a) Distinct
             tenderness of Achilles tendon with no pain in the neighboring structures. b)
             Ultrasonographic changes defined as local thickening of the symptomatic tendon or a
             globally more than 2mm thicker tendon on the sick side.

          2. Diffuse pain in the posterior region of the ankle with local tenderness of the
             Achilles tendon and ultrasonographic changes (as described above).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment of achillodynia with stretching or eccentric training for more than 2 weeks
             within the last 2 years.

          2. Other injuries in the lower extremity or the knee, which by the examining doctor was
             evaluated to influence the evaluation of symptoms or the ability to perform the
             training program.

          3. Acute symptoms with ultrasonographic changes consistent with a partial rupture of the
             tendon.

          4. Age less than 18 years or over 70 years.

          5. Previous operation on the tendon or steroid injections.
