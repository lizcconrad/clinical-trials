  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes in tissue microcirculation during ischemic conditioning (4 cycles of 5-min ischemia
      and 5-min reperfusion) has not been well documented. In previous studies, there was
      difference in changes in microcirculation, such as recovery slope and occlusion slope,
      between healthy subjects and cardiac surgery patients. Moreover, the occlusion slope, which
      reflects local tissue oxygen consumption during ischemic period, is anticipated to decrease
      during repeated ischemia-reperfusion cycle by its protecting effect, however there has not
      been well-conducted study. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the changes in
      microcirculation measured by tissue oxygen saturation during ischemic conditioning between
      healthy volunteers and cardiac surgery patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are male healthy volunteers (aged 20-45) or who are scheduled to receive cardiac
      surgery (aged 20-80) will undergo ischemic conditioning, consisting of 4 cycles of 5-min
      ischemia with pressure of 200 mmHg on upper extremity followed by 5-min reperfusion with no
      pressure. During ischemic conditioning, changes in tissue microcirculation (baseline tissue
      saturation, occlusion slope during ischemia, and recovery slope during reperfusion) will be
      observed using tissue oxygen saturation sensor attached to the thenar muscle of the hand. For
      cardiac surgery patients, the study will be conducted before anesthesia induction on the
      surgery day to exclude any potential effect of anesthetics.
