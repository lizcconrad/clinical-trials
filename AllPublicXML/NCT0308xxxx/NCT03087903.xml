      Patients will take 150 mg of GSE product by mouth twice daily in the form of 75 mg capsule of
      Leucoselect Phytosome preparation; total oral dosage is 300 mg GSE per day for one year.
      Patients will be evaluated every 6 weeks for 3 months, then every 3 months thereafter for up
      to one year. PSA measurements will be obtained at these scheduled visits and patients must
      not have a doubling of their PSA (compared to baseline) by 3 months in order to continue on
      study. Patients who meet criteria to continue on study will be treated until disease
      progression or for one year (whichever comes first).

    <measure>The number of patients with PSA response</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSA response will be defined as an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (PSADT) of 30% (PSADT is the length of time it takes for a PSA to double based on an exponential growth pattern). Patients must have a PSA level of ≥ 0.2 at study entry and should have at least three prior PSA values with dates from which to calculate a PSA doubling time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of change of the PSA over time (PSA velocity) for each patient</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSA velocity will be calculated as a change from the first PSA reading, standardized as PSA change per month.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent has been obtained.

          2. Histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma.

          3. Evidence of rising PSA, on 2 separate occasions, at least one week apart. Baseline PSA
             must be ≥ 0.2 ng/mL at the time of screening. Radiographic evidence of disease is not
             allowed.

          4. Patients must have sufficient PSA time points prior to enrollment (a minimum of 3 PSA
             levels within a six month period) to calculate a baseline PSA doubling time.

          5. Patients must not be on active LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy and must have
             testosterone level &gt; 50 ng/dL.

          6. Patients must not be on active anti-androgen therapy or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors.
             Patients on stable dose of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors for benign prostatic
             hypertrophy for at least 12 months may continue. They must withdraw from the study if
             this is stopped while on study.

          7. Patients who are candidates for local salvage therapy must have had this option
             pursued or discussed; and the patient must have either declined salvage therapy or was
             deemed not to be a candidate for salvage therapy.

          8. Patients who have PSA recurrence after local salvage therapy may participate in this
             study.

          9. Patients with hormone sensitive disease who received prior androgen deprivation
             therapy as part of primary/salvage local treatment or patients receiving intermittent
             androgen deprivation therapy will be allowed to participate.

         10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.

         11. Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC]≥1,500 cells/µL;
             hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL, platelets ≥75,000/µL).

         12. Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 2X the upper limit of normal (ULN)

         13. Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal [ULN], alanine
             aminotransferase [ALT]≤ 3xULN, aspartate aminotransferase [AST]≤3 x ULN).

         14. Patients can continue taking what they are taking at the time they start on the study,
             but agree not to start any new (over the counter) herbal supplement on regular basis
             during study duration.

         15. Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer (upfront, adjuvant, etc.) is allowed as long as
             it was not given for hormone-refractory disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are on active surveillance for untreated localized disease may not
             participate in this study.

          2. Inability to swallow gelatin capsules, or any medical condition that interferes with
             normal gastrointestinal absorption.

          3. Major surgery, radiation, or treatment with any other investigational drug within 2
             weeks of study treatment.

          4. Documented hypersensitivity reaction to any product with GSE (see complete list in
             Appendix 1).

          5. Known chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral hepatitis.

          6. Symptomatic prostate cancer as determined by cancer-related pain requiring narcotic
             pain medication.

          7. History of another cancer is exclusionary unless it is believed to be likely cured or
             is unlikely to be fatal in the next 3 years (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma, superficial
             bladder cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, etc).

          8. Very fast PSA doubling time of less than 4 weeks, if the absolute PSA is &gt; 2 ng/mL.
