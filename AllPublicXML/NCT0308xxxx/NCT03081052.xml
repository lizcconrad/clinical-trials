  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purposes of this study has 2 aims. First, to conduct a clinical investigation to
      determine if iEPO, Veletri® will have similar efficacy in pulmonary vasodilation and have a
      similar impact when compared to iNO, INOMAX® in adult patient who undergo a heart
      transplantation, lung transplantation or implantation of a left ventricular assist device .
      Second, to conduct a cost-capture analysis on the expense each drug incurs per patient.

    <textblock>
      Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) is a selective pulmonary vasodilator (PVD) with FDA-approval in
      the neonatal population alone. In adult patients, iNO is used off-label to treat pulmonary
      hypertension, right ventricular (RV) failure, and ventilation-to-perfusion mismatch. Adult
      patients who undergo durable LVAD implantation (e.g. Heartware®, Heartmate 2®, or Heartmate
      3®) or cardiac transplantation for end-stage heart failure or those that have endured lung
      transplantation as a result of end-stage lung disease, compose the largest subpopulation
      which receives PVD therapy at Duke University Hospital. Inhaled Epoprostenol (iEPO) has been
      introduced in the cardiothoracic operating rooms (OR) and ICU as a cost-conscious alternative
      medication to iNO. iEPO may display an equivalent efficacy profile to iNO for pulmonary
      vasodilation and oxygenation and have a similar impact on clinical outcomes.

      424 informed and consented subjects undergoing thoracic transplantation or left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) implantation under the care of one or more investigators will be
      prospectively enrolled over a three-year period (one-year for follow-up). Patients will be
      randomly assigned 50/50 according to randomization strata to one of two standard of care
      pulmonary vasodilation therapy, iNO vs iEPO. Additional study procedures will involve data
      collection and blood sampling.
