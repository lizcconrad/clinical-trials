      Several reports have shown the utility of PVC ablation with cryo catheters. The aim of this
      study is to compare the outcomes and safety of Cryo vs. RF for PVCs.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation (CA) is an effective therapeutic strategy
      in eliminating refractory idiopathic ventricular outflow tract (OT) ventricular arrhythmias
      (VA). However, early and late recurrences occur commonly. RFCA has also been reported to be
      associated with collateral damage and pain. The use of Cryo ablation as a safer alternative
      energy source been previously described. In several reports Cryo was reported to successfully
      treat VA originating from the OT in the absence of ablation related pain and collateral
      damage to adjacent structures such as the coronaries. When comparing outcomes and
      complications of catheter ablation of VA from the papillary muscles of the left ventricle
      with either Cryo or RF, Cryo was found to be associated with significantly higher success
      rates and lower recurrence rates than RFCA.

      Aim: To compare the outcomes and safety of Cryo vs. RF for PVCs. Methods: Patients with PVC
      VA will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to RFCA or Cryo ablation. All procedures will be done
      using a 3-dimensional mapping system (EnSite™ NavX™ system, St. Jude Medical). Ablation will
      be performed at sites with earliest activation or at least pacemap exhibiting QRS morphology
      match of &gt;11/12. Endpoint of procedure will be elimination and non inducibility of the
      clinical VA. All patients will undergo continuous monitoring for at least 12 hours post
      procedure and 12 lead Holter and exercise testing 1 month post procedure. Successful ablation
      will be defined as absence of clinical VA or &gt; 50% reduction in arrhythmia burden on Holter
      in the absence of anti-arrhythmic medications.

The proportion in Group 1 (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.2500 under the null hypothesis and 0.0500 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in Group 2 (the control group) is 0.2500. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test with pooled variance. The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.0500.
