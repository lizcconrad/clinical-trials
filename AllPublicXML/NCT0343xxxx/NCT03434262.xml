  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90% of children with malignant brain tumors that have recurred or relapsed
      after receiving conventional therapy will die of disease. Despite this terrible and
      frustrating outcome, continued treatment of this population remains fundamental to improving
      cure rates. Studying this relapsed population will help unearth clues to why conventional
      therapy fails and how cancers continue to resist modern advances. Moreover, improvements in
      the treatment of this relapsed population will lead to improvements in upfront therapy and
      reduce the chance of relapse for all. Novel therapy and, more importantly, novel approaches
      are sorely needed. This trial proposes a new approach that evaluates rational combination
      therapies of novel agents based on tumor type and molecular characteristics of these
      diseases. The investigators hypothesize that the use of two predictably active drugs (a
      doublet) will increase the chance of clinical efficacy. The purpose of this trial is to
      perform a limited dose escalation study of multiple doublets to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of these combinations followed by a small expansion cohort to detect preliminary
      efficacy. In addition, a more extensive and robust molecular analysis of all the participant
      samples will be performed as part of the trial such that we can refine the molecular
      classification and better inform on potential response to therapy. In this manner the
      tolerability of combinations can be evaluated on a small but relevant population and the
      chance of detecting antitumor activity is potentially increased. Furthermore, the goal of the
      complementary molecular characterization will be to eventually match the therapy with better
      predictive biomarkers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability and estimate the maximum tolerated
           dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of combination treatment by stratum.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of combination treatment by stratum.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the rate and duration of objective response and progression free survival
           (PFS) by stratum.

      Patients will be stratified by the molecular and histologic characteristics of their tumor to
      one of three treatment strata.

      STRATUM A:

        -  Combination Treatment: ribociclib and gemcitabine.

        -  Patient Population: Participants with a diagnosis of refractory or recurrent
           medulloblastoma (Group 3/4) or refractory or recurrent ependymoma (including:
           ependymoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), WHO Grade III; ependymoma, RELA fusion
           positive; anaplastic ependymoma; ependymoma, NOS, WHO grade II).

      STRATUM B:

        -  Combination Treatment: ribociclib and trametinib.

        -  Patient Population: Participants with a diagnosis of one of the following refractory or
           recurrent CNS diseases: medulloblastoma [sonic hedgehog (SHH)], medulloblastoma (WNT),
           high grade glioma (including: high grade glioma, (NOS), WHO Grade III or IV; anaplastic
           astrocytoma, IDH mutant; glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype; glioblastoma, IDH-mutant; diffuse
           midline glioma, H3K27-mutant; anaplastic oligodendroglioma, IDH mutant and
           1p/19q-codeleted; anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) or select central nervous
           system (CNS) embryonal tumors (including: embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes,
           C19MC-altered; embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes, not otherwise specified
           (NOS); medulloepithelioma; CNS neuroblastoma; CNS ganglioneuroblastoma; CNS embryonal
           tumor, NOS; atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor; CNS embryonal tumor with rhabdoid
           features).

      STRATUM C:

        -  Combination Treatment: ribociclib and sonidegib.

        -  Patient Populations: Participants with refractory or recurrent medulloblastoma (SHH) &gt;6
           months off smoothened inhibitor, presence of 9q loss or PTCH1 mutant, skeletally mature.

      The rolling 6 design will be used separately in each stratum to estimate the MTD or RP2D and
      determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combination of escalating doses. Therapy
      will be administered in cycles of 28 days and may be continued for up to 24 months (26
      cycles) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients will receive doublet therapy in cycles of 28 days. The dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT)-evaluation period will consist of the first cycle (i.e. first 4 weeks of therapy).
      Research participants will be evaluated at least once a week during the DLT-evaluation period
      and at regular intervals thereafter. Standard (e.g., physical exam, blood tests, and disease
      evaluations) tests will be obtained at regular intervals. Research-associated evaluations
      (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies, etc.) will also be obtained during therapy. Treatment may be
      continued for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>The MTD is empirically defined as the highest dose level at which six patients have been treated with at most one patient experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next higher dose level has been determined to be too toxic. The MTD estimate will not be available, if the lowest dose level studied is too toxic or the highest dose level studied is considered safe. In the latter case, the highest studied safe dose will be considered the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The MTD estimation will be limited to evaluable patients and toxicity assessments from course 1 (28 days).</description>
